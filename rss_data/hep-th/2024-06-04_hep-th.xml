      <title>Can you hear the Planck mass?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the Laplacian of an $n$-Riemannian manifold $X$, the Weyl law states that the $k$-th eigenvalue is asymptotically proportional to $(k/V)^{2/n}$, where $V$ is the volume of $X$. We show that this result can be derived via physical considerations by demanding that the gravitational potential for a compactification on $X$ behaves in the expected $(4+n)$-dimensional way at short distances. In simple product compactifications, when particle motion on $X$ is ergodic, for large $k$ the eigenfunctions oscillate around a constant, and the argument is relatively straightforward. The Weyl law thus allows to reconstruct the four-dimensional Planck mass from the asymptotics of the masses of the spin 2 Kaluza--Klein modes. For warped compactifications, a puzzle appears: the Weyl law still depends on the ordinary volume $V$, while the Planck mass famously depends on a weighted volume obtained as an integral of the warping function. We resolve this tension by arguing that in the ergodic case the eigenfunctions oscillate now around a power of the warping function rather than around a constant, a property that we call weighted quantum ergodicity. This has implications for the problem of gravity localization, which we discuss. We show that for spaces with D$p$-brane singularities the spectrum is discrete only for $p =6,7,8$, and for these cases we rigorously prove the Weyl law by applying modern techniques from RCD theory.</description>

      <title>There and Back Again: Mapping and Factorising Cosmological Observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmological correlators encode invaluable information about the wavefunction that characterises the state of the primordial universe. In this letter we present a simple yet novel duality between correlators and wavefunction coefficients that is valid to all orders in the loop expansion. The duality manifests itself as a $\mathbb{Z}_4$ symmetry in the correspondence between correlators and the physical parts of wavefunction coefficients. To demonstrate the power of the duality already at tree-level, we derive a correlator-to-correlator factorisation (CCF) formula for the parity-odd part of cosmological correlators that relates $n$-point observables to lower-point ones via a series of diagrammatic cuts. These relations are in principle testable as they involve observables defined for arbitrary physical kinematics (i.e. without performing any analytic continuation or taking any soft limits). For $n=4$, the CCF formula provides a relation between the parity-odd part of the trispectrum of curvature perturbations, the bispectra involving two curvature perturbations and an additional state with a complementary series mass and integer spin, and the power spectrum of this additional state.</description>

      <title>Fermion Mass Generation without Symmetry Breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the generation of fermion mass in a context where interactions break a discrete chiral symmetry. Then, fermion mass is not protected by a symmetry, no symmetry is broken by the generation of mass, and a vanishing mass no longer enhances a symmetry. We elaborate these scenarios for template fermionic and Yukawa theories in three dimensions where mass can be generated either by fluctuations, strong dynamics, or the vacuum expectation value of a scalar field. We find that fluctuation-induced contributions to fermion mass are parametrically suppressed in the number of fermion flavours $N$. The generation of fermion mass then takes the form of a rapid crossover which turns into a second order quantum phase transition for large $N$, much like in settings with fundamental chiral symmetry. We further discuss theories where fermion mass can be generated spontaneously without breaking any symmetry other than scale symmetry. Implications of our findings are discussed.</description>

      <title>The Quasicrystalline String Landscape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we investigate a largely unexplored non-geometric corner of the string landscape: the quasicrystalline orbifolds. These exist at special points of the Narain moduli leading to frozen moduli and large quantum symmetries. Here we complete the classification and construction of quasicrystalline Narain lattices and use this to explore supersymmetric compactifications in $4\leq D\leq 6$ and with $4\leq Q\leq 16$ supercharges, leading to novel theories including theories with large quantum symmetries at all points in the moduli space. We anticipate these constructions will have many applications and in subsequent papers we apply these techniques to construct non-geometric F-theory models as well as new non-supersymmetric tachyon free models. Similarly these constructions can lead to constructing exotic matter representations in the string landscape.</description>

      <title>Mirror Symmetry and Level-rank Duality for 3d $\mathcal{N} = 4$ Rank 0 SCFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a family of 3d $\mathcal{N} = 4$ superconformal field theories that have zero-dimensional Coulomb and Higgs branches and propose that the rational vertex operator algebras $W^{\text{min}}_{k - \scriptstyle{\frac{1}{2}}}(\mathfrak{sp}_{2N})$ and $L_{k}(\mathfrak{osp}_{1|2N})$ model the modular tensor categories of line operators in their topological $A$ and $B$ twists, respectively. Our analysis indicates that the action of 3d mirror symmetry on this family of theories is related to a novel level-rank duality and leads to several conjectural $q$-series identities of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Holographic description of an anisotropic Dirac semimetal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Holographic quantum matter exploits the AdS/CFT correspondence to study systems in condensed matter physics. An example of these systems are strongly correlated semimetals, which feature a rich phase diagram structure. In this work, we present a holographic model for a Dirac semimetal in $2+1$ dimensions that features a topological phase transition. Our construction relies on deforming a relativistic UV fixed point with some relevant operators that explicitly break rotations and some internal symmetries. The phase diagram for different values of the relevant coupling constants is obtained. The different phases are characterized by distinct dispersion relations for probe fermionic modes in the AdS geometry. We find semi-metallic phases characterized by the presence of Dirac cones and an insulating phase featuring a mass gap with a mild anisotropy. Remarkably, we find as well an anisotropic semi-Dirac phase characterized by a massless a fermionic excitation dispersing linearly in one direction while quadratically in the other.</description>

      <title>Coulomb Branch Operator Algebras and Universal Selection Rules for $\mathcal{N}=2$ SCFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coulomb branches of vacua are the most universal moduli spaces that arise in local unitary interacting 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal field theories (SCFTs). In these theories, $1/2$-BPS primaries parameterize the Coulomb branches and form (anti-)chiral rings. We define the notion of a Coulomb branch operator algebra, $\mathcal{A}_{\mathcal{C}}$, that contains these chiral and anti-chiral rings along with infinitely many more operators and products that are less protected by supersymmetry. Using a universal symmetry, $\mathcal{I}\cong\mathbb{Z}_2$, that arises from studying the superconformal group, we give $\mathcal{I}$ selection rules for $\mathcal{A}_{\mathcal{C}}$ and, more generally, for arbitrary products in the local operator algebra of any 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ SCFT. Defining the notion of a "Coulombic" SCFT, we propose explanations for certain phenomena in a 4d/2d correspondence involving 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ theories and 2d vertex operator algebras (VOAs). Finally, by considering a deformation of $\mathcal{I}$, we explore the case of $\mathcal{N}=4$ SCFTs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In four decades of string theory research, only a handful of non-supersymmetric tachyon-free strings with only one neutral scalar at tree level were found. We construct new such non-supersymmetric tachyon-free string theories using asymmetric orbifolds that serve as the lower-dimensional counterparts to the $O(16) \times O(16)$ string in 4d, 6d, and 8d, each featuring only one neutral scalar at tree level, chiral matter and positive leading order cosmological constant. The 4d construction uses a quasicrystalline orbifold.</description>

      <title>Quantum phase transition of infrared radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe a phase transition of infrared radiation, driven by quantum fluctuations, which takes place at the boundary of (the conformal diagram of) Minkowski spacetime. Specifically, we consider a family of states interpolating between the vacuum and the Kraus-Polley-Reents infravacuum. A state from this family can be imagined as a static source emitting flashes of infrared radiation in distant past. The flashes are in suitable squeezed states and the time intervals between them are controlled by a certain parameter r. For r&lt;0 the states are lightcone normal, thus physically indistinguishable from local excitations of the vacuum. They suffer from the usual infrared problems such as disintegration of the Bloch-Nordsieck S-matrix and rotational symmetry breaking by soft photon clouds. However, for r&gt;0 lightcone normality breaks down, the S-matrix is stabilized by the Kraus-Polley-Reents mechanism and the rotational symmetry is restored. We interpret these two situations as ordered (r&lt;0) and disordered (r&gt;0) phase of infrared radiation, and show that they can be distinguished by asymptotic fluctuations of the fields. We also determine the singular behaviour of some S-matrix elements near the critical point r=0.</description>

      <title>Casimir Energy for Lorentz-Violating Scalar Field with Helical Boundary Condition in d Spatial Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Delving into spring-like helical configurations, such as DNA within our cells, motivates physicists to inquire about the effects of such structures in the realm of quantum field theory, specifically unraveling their manifestation of effectiveness in Casimir energy. To explore this, we initiated our investigation with the Casimir effect and proceeded to calculate the Casimir energy, along with its thermal and radiative corrections, for massive and massless Lorentz-violating scalar fields across $d+1$ dimensional space-time. Adhering to the principle that the renormalization program should be consistent with the boundary conditions applied to the quantum fields was paramount. Accordingly, one-loop correction to the Casimir energy for both massive and massless scalar fields under helical boundary conditions by employing a position-dependent counterterm was performed. Our results, spanning across spatial dimensions, exhibited convergence and coherence with established physical grounds. Additionally, we presented the Casimir energy density using graphical plots for systems featuring time-like and space-like Lorentz violations across all spatial dimensions, followed by a comprehensive discussion of the obtained results.</description>

      <title>A modified dyon solution in a non-Abelian gauge model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A modified $SU(2)$ Georgi-Glashow model is considered here, and it is shown that besides the well-known Julia-Zee dyon solution, the model can also have a modified dyon solution. The properties of the modified dyon solution are studied using analytical and numerical methods. A comparative analysis of the modified dyon and the Julia-Zee dyon shows that their properties are significantly different. In particular, except for the BPS case, the energy and electric charge of the modified dyons exceed considerably those of the Julia-Zee dyons. At the same time, the energy and electric charge of the modified dyon are bounded for all admissible parameter values, whereas those of the Julia-Zee dyon can be arbitrarily large in the BPS case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Coulomb and Higgs indices of the 3d $\mathcal{N}=4$ $U(N)$ ADHM theories can be decorated by line defect operators as the line defect correlators. We obtain exact closed-form expressions and various non-trivial algebraic relations for the correlators of the Wilson lines in the fundamental and (anti)symmetric representations by means of the Hall-Littlewood expansion, the Fermi-gas method and the residue calculation. From the large $N$ limit of the correlators we obtain the single particle gravity indices which are expected to encode the spectra of fluctuation modes on the gravity duals of line operators in M2-brane SCFTs.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study an explicit formula for the thermodynamic potential of the AdS dyonic black brane solution with an axio-dilaton hair, which was discovered in an extension of the $(3+1)$d Gubser-Rocha model enjoying S-duality. From the thermodynamic potential, we can compute the magnetization and the magnetic susceptibilities of the dyonic solution. The result of the magnetization is negative implying that the system is diamagnetic. Subsequently, we consider a specific neutral limit of the dyonic solution. In this setup, we find that the system exhibits spontaneous breaking of a global $U(1)$ symmetry. The order parameter is given by a complex operator which is dual to the axio-dilaton field in the bulk. Interestingly, the system has a finite Hall conductivity even in the absence of the external magnetic field, and it is related to the phase of the complex operator.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Field theoretical tools are developed so that one can analyze quantum phenomena such as transition radiation that must have occurred during the Higgs condensate bubble expansion through plasma in the early universe. Integral representations of Bosonic and Fermionic propagators are presented for the case that particle masses are varied continuously during the passage through the bubble wall interface between symmetry-restored and symmetry-broken regions. The construction of propagators is based on the so-called eigenfunction expansion method associated with self-adjoint differential operators, developed by Weyl, Stone, Titchmarsh, Kodaira and several others. A novel method of field quantization in the presence of the bubble wall is proposed by using the spectral functions introduced in constructing the two-point Green's functions.</description>

      <title>Fokker-Planck Equation and de Sitter Duality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Infra-Red scaling property of inflationary universe is in the same universality class of random walk. The two point correlators of the curvature perturbations are enhanced by the e-folding number N. The distribution function of the curvature perturbation $\rho_t (\zeta)$ satisfies the Fokker Planck equation. The de Sitter universes are dual to the random walk: They belong to the Universality class of dimension two fractal. These boundary and bulk duality are at the heart of holography of quantum gravity. Historically the correspondence of thermodynamics and Einstein's equation are recognized as the first evidence for de Sitter duality .Our de Sitter duality relates the stochastic and geometric point of view. We study two types of the solutions of FP equation in quasi de Sitter space: (1) UV complete spacetime and (2) inflationary spacetime with concave potentials. The maximum entropy principle favors the following scenario: The universe is (a) born with small epsilon and (b) grows by inflation in the concave potential. We predict n_s &lt;0.975(0.97) and r &lt; 0.04(0.03) for N=50(60) at the pivot angle 0.002Mpc^{-1}. We have lowered the upper bound of $r$ by taking account of random walk effect at the boundary. Our predictions are highly consistent with recent observations.</description>

      <title>Covariant quantisation of tensor multiplet models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism is applied to quantise the ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric generalisation of the Freedman-Townsend (FT) model proposed by Lindstr\"om and Ro\v{c}ek in 1983. This super FT theory describes a non-Abelian tensor multiplet and is known to be classically equivalent to a supersymmetric nonlinear sigma model. Using path integral considerations, we demonstrate that this equivalence holds at the quantum level. A modified Faddeev-Popov procedure is employed to quantise models for the ${\cal N}=2$ tensor multiplet in harmonic superspace.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the transition amplitudes of the Unruh-DeWitt detector within the Schwarzschild spacetime background and discover gravity-induced transparency phenomena akin to the earlier acceleration-induced transparency. This is confirmed through calculations performed in both the Hartle-Hawking and Unruh states. The similarity between free-falling detectors in these states and accelerated detectors in electromagnetic fields is noteworthy, as it parallels the scenario in which acceleration-induced transparency phenomena occur.</description>

      <title>Exact quantization conditions and full transseries structures for ${\cal PT}$ symmetric anharmonic oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study exact Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin analysis (EWKB) for a ${\cal PT}$ symmetric quantum mechanics (QM) defined by the potential that $V_{\cal PT}(x) = \omega^2 x^2 + g x^{2 K} (i x)^{\varepsilon}$ with $\omega \in {\mathbb R}_{\ge 0}$, $g \in {\mathbb R}_{&gt;0}$ and $K, \varepsilon \in {\mathbb N}$ to clarify its perturbative/non-perturbative structure. In our analysis, we mainly consider the massless cases, i.e., $\omega = 0$, and derive the exact quantization conditions (QCs) for arbitrary $(K,\varepsilon)$ including all perturbative/non-perturbative corrections. From the exact QCs, we clarify full transseries structure of the energy spectra with respect to the inverse energy level expansion, and then formulate the Gutzwiller trace formula, the spectral summation form, and the Euclidean path-integral. For the massive cases, i.e., $\omega &gt; 0$, we show the fact that, by requiring existence of solution of the exact QCs, the path of analytic continuation in EWKB is uniquely determined for a given $N = 2K + \varepsilon$, and in consequence the exact QCs, the energy spectra, and the three formulas are all perturbative. Similarities to Hermitian QMs and resurgence are also discussed as additional remarks.</description>

Abstract: We examine the properties of 4-d bosonic and fermionic (mesons and mesinos) modes on $D7$-branes wrapped over Kuperstein 4-cycle of the Klebanov-Strassler background. The wave equations are derived in a convenient parameterization of the warped deformed conifold metric. The mass spectra, wave functions and couplings of bosonic modes are evaluated by means of semi-classical tools. We explore the possible existence of fermionic zero modes.</description>

      <title>Black Flowers and Real Forms of Higher Spin Symmetries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using Chern-Simons formulation, we investigate higher spin (HS) black holes in AdS$_{3}$ with soft Heisenberg hair and establish linkage with the real forms of the underlying complexified gauge symmetries taken here as $SL(N,C)_{L}\times SL(N,C)_{R}.$ We study the various conserved currents characterizing the HS black flowers (HS-BF) and show that they can be formed of layers indexed by the elements of the centre of the gauge symmetry. This feature follows from requiring the holonomy of the asymptotic gauge connection around the thermal cycle to sit in the centre $\mathbb{Z}_{N}$ of the symmetry group. With regard to the compact subgroups of the real forms of the complexified gauge symmetry, we calculate the entropies of the HS-BF and verify that, unless we are considering trivial holonomies, there are no continuous paths joining the HS-BF to the core spin 2 black holes. As explicit illustrations, we give quantum field realisations of the soft Heisenberg hair in terms of bosonic and fermionic primary conformal fields and compute the HS-BF entropy as a function of the number of fermions occupying the ground state of the Heisenberg soft hair.</description>

      <title>New Fixed Points from Melonic Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalizations of vector field theories to tensors allow to similarly apply large-$N$ techniques but find a richer though often still tractable structure. However, the potential of such tensor theories has not been fully exploited since only a symmetry-reduced ``isotropic'' part of their phase space has been studied so far. Here we present for the first time the richness of the tensorial phase space applying the functional renormalization group to tensor fields of rank $r$ in the cyclic-melonic potential approximation including the flow of anomalous dimensions. Due to a decoupling of the flow equations of the $r$ couplings at given order, we find non-Gaussian fixed points in any regime of $0&lt;s\le r$ non-vanishing coupling types. Each of these regimes contains isotropic fixed points of Wilson-Fisher type as well as new anisotropic fixed points. This new classification reveals a rich structure of renormalization group dynamics including candidates for asymptotic safe fixed points even at critical dimension. Considering the tensorial interactions as generating discrete geometries, the various fixed points correspond to continuum limits of distinguished ensembles of triangulations raising hope to find new classes of continuum geometry in this way.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we explore a massive (U(1)) gauge holographic model with pure gauge and mixed gauge-gravitational Chern-Simons terms. By considering the full backreaction of the gauge field on the metric tensor, we explore the vortical and energy transport sectors. Our findings for the chiral vortical conductivity, $\sigma_V$, and the chiral magnetic/vortical conductivity of energy current show that $\sigma^\varepsilon_B = \sigma^\varepsilon_V$. Notably, we highlight a contribution to (\sigma_V) induced by the mixed term in the massive theory, which is absent in the massless case.</description>

      <title>Two types of series expansions valid at strong coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that perturbative expansions in powers of the coupling in quantum mechanics (QM) and quantum field theory (QFT) are asymptotic series. This can be useful at weak coupling but fails at strong coupling. In this work, we present two types of series expansions valid at strong coupling. We apply the series to a basic integral as well as a QM path integral containing a quadratic and quartic term with coupling constant $\lambda$. The first series is the usual asymptotic one, where the quartic interaction is expanded in powers of $\lambda$. The second series is an expansion of the quadratic part where the interaction is left alone. This yields an absolutely convergent series in inverse powers of $\lambda$ valid at strong coupling. For the basic integral, we revisit the first series and identify what makes it diverge even though the original integral is finite. We fix the problem and obtain, remarkably, a series in powers of the coupling which is absolutely convergent and valid at strong coupling. We explain how this series avoids Dyson's argument on convergence. We then consider the QM path integral (discretized with time interval divided into $N$ equal segments). As before, the second series is absolutely convergent and we obtain analytical expressions in inverse powers of $\lambda$ for the $n$th order terms by taking functional derivatives of generalized hypergeometric functions. The expressions are functions of $N$ and we work them out explicitly up to third order. The general procedure has been implemented in a Mathematica program that generates the expressions at any order $n$. We present numerical results at strong coupling for different values of $N$ starting at $N=2$. The series matches the exact numerical value for a given $N$ (up to a certain accuracy). The continuum is formally reached when $N\to \infty$ but in practice this can be reached at small $N$.</description>

      <title>A Matrix Model Proposal for Quantum Gravity and the Quantum Mechanics of Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a large $N$ quantum mechanics of non-abelian bosonic and fermionic variables as a model for quantum gravity. The theory admits fuzzy sphere as static solution. Over the fuzzy geometry, the quantum mechanics of the fermions is given by a sum of oscillators with equal frequency. The energy state where exactly half of the Fermi sea is filled contains the maximal amount of degeneracy. This state of the fuzzy sphere obeys the mass-radius relation of a Schwarzschild black hole if the fuzzy sphere is identified with the black hole horizon. Moreover the set of states in the Fermi sea gives precisely the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. We thus propose that quantum black holes are described by fuzzy spheres with a half-filled Fermi sea in the matrix model. We also consider a system of two fuzzy spheres by embedding them as blocks in the matrix quantum mechanics. When the distance $r$ between the two fuzzy spheres is small, the total energy of the system can be computed using perturbation theory. We show that in the leading order of large $N$ limit, the interaction energy depends on the product of the black holes masses and the Newton constant exactly as in Newton gravity. To extract the correct $r$ dependence in the long range, a resummation of all the large $N$ corrections is needed. We outline how Newton gravity may be reproduced in the long distance limit. We also show that the interaction energy is generally finite in the short distance limit, suggesting that the black hole singularity in general relativity is removed in our quantum description of black hole.</description>

      <title>Weyl Fermion Creation by Cosmological Gravitational Wave Background at 1-loop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weyl fermions of spin $\frac12$ minimally coupled to Einstein's gravity in 4 dimensions cannot be produced purely gravitationally in an expanding Universe at tree level. Surprisingly, as we showed in a recent letter [1], this changes at gravitational 1-loop when cosmic perturbations, like a gravitational wave background, are present. Such a background introduces a new scale, thereby breaking the fermions' conformal invariance. This leads to a non-vanishing gravitational self-energy for Weyl fermions at 1-loop and induces their production. In this paper, we present an extended study of this new mechanism, explicitly computing this effect using the in-in formalism. We work in an expanding Universe in the radiation-dominated era as a fixed background. Gravitational wave-induced fermion production has rich phenomenological consequences. Notably, if Weyl fermions eventually acquire mass, and assuming realistic - and potentially detectable - gravitational wave backgrounds, the mechanism can explain the abundance of dark matter in the Universe. More generally, gravitational-wave induced freeze-in is a new purely gravitational mechanism for generating other feebly interacting fermions, e.g. right-handed neutrinos. We show that this loop level effect can dominate over the conventional - tree-level - gravitational production of superheavy fermions in a sizable part of the parameter space.</description>

      <title>Symplectic Quantization and General Constraint Structure of a Prototypical Second-Class System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss a general prototypical constrained Hamiltonian system with a broad application in quantum field theory and similar contexts where dynamics is defined through a functional action obeying a stationarity principle. The prototypical model amounts to a Dirac-Bergmann singular system, whose constraints restrict the actual dynamics to occur within a differential submanifold, as is the case in the major part of field theoretical models with gauge symmetry. We apply the Dirac-Bergmann algorithm in its full generality unraveling a total of $4m$ second-class constraints and obtain the corresponding Dirac brackets algebra in phase space. We follow with the Faddeev-Jackiw-Barcelos-Wotzasek approach in which the geometric character of the mentioned submanifold is emphasized by means of an internal metric function encoding its symplectic properties. We consider two straightforward examples, applying our general results to constrained motion along a toroidal geometry and to a Lorentz violating toy model in field theory. Since toroidal geometry has been recently used in cosmological models, we suggest how our results could lead to different proposals for the shape of the universe in cosmology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an effective field theory (EFT) for conformal impurity by considering a pair of transversely displaced impurities and integrating out modes with mass inversely proportional to the separation distance. This EFT captures the universal signature of the impurity seen by a heavy local operator. We focus on the case of conformal boundaries and derive universal formulas from this EFT for the boundary structure constants at high energy. We point out that the more familiar thermal EFT for conformal field theory is a special case of this EFT with distinguished conformal boundaries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the potential-graviton contribution to the scattering amplitude, the radial action, and the scattering angle of two extremal black holes in N = 8 supergravity at the fifth post-Minkowskian order to next-to-leading order in a large mass expansion (first self-force order). Properties of classical unitarity cuts allow us to focus on the integration-by-parts reduction of planar integrals, while nonplanar integrals at this order are obtained from the planar ones by straightforward manipulations. We present all master integrals and solve their associated differential equations necessary to evaluate the classical scattering amplitudes of massive scalar particles at this order in all gravitational theories, in particular in N = 8 supergravity, and in general relativity. Despite the appearance of higher-weight generalized polylogarithms and elliptic functions in the solution to the differential equation for master integrals, the final supergravity answer is remarkably simple and contains only (harmonic) polylogarithmic functions up to weight 2. The systematic analysis of elliptic integrals discussed here, as well as the particular organization of boundary integrals in N = 8 observables are independent of supersymmetry and may have wider applications, including to aspects of collider physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive new closed form expressions for the partition functions of free conformally-coupled scalars on $S^{2D-1}\times S^1$ which resum the exact high-temperature expansion. The derivation relies on an identification of the partition functions, analytically continued in chemical potentials and temperature, with multiple elliptic Gamma functions. These functions satisfy interesting modular properties, which we use to arrive at our expressions. We describe a geometric interpretation of the modular properties of multiple elliptic Gamma functions in the context of superconformal field theory. Based on this, we suggest a geometric interpretation of the modular property in the context of the free scalar CFT in even dimensions and comment on extensions to odd dimensions and free fermions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17396v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamical dark energy has gained renewed interest due to recent theoretical and observational developments. In the present paper, we focus on a string-motivated dark energy set-up, and perform a detailed cosmological analysis of exponential quintessence with potential $V=V_0 e^{-\lambda\phi}$, allowing for non-zero spatial curvature. We first gain some physical intuition into the full evolution of such a scenario by analysing the corresponding dynamical system. Then, we test the model using a combination of Planck CMB data, DESI BAO data, as well as recent supernovae datasets. For the model parameter $\lambda$, we obtain a preference for nonzero values: $\lambda = 0.48^{+0.28}_{-0.21},\; 0.68^{+0.31}_{-0.20},\; 0.77^{+0.18}_{-0.15}$ at 68% C.L. when combining CMB+DESI with Pantheon+, Union3 and DES-Y5 supernovae datasets respectively. We find no significant hint for spatial curvature. We discuss the implications of current cosmological results for the exponential quintessence model, and more generally for dark energy in string theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In doubly special relativity (DSR) theories the speed of the light usually depends on the frequency. Thus, we expect that light from very distant stars and gamma ray bursts have additional time delays with respect to special relativity. In this paper, we will find the general DSR transformations in the first order of the Planck length which have zero time delay. With respect to these transformations zero time delay isn't only a consequence of special relativity, and we can find some DSR theories which behave like special relativity in the first order of the Planck length in some aspects. We notify that for a correct conclusion in the observations of the quantum gravity effects we should look to all quantum gravity effects together and not one.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that gravitational leptogenesis with dynamical $CPT$ breaking in an expanding universe can be reconciled with exponential $f(R)$ gravity models with axion as cold dark matter. For $L$ violating interactions, we consider both non-supersymmetric model with heavy right handed neutrino decay and supersymmetric model with sneutrino decay. For both the cases, we have shown that the required baryonis asymmetry could be obtained and also have shown the variation of decoupling temperature for lepton number violating interactions with $\beta$ parameter in exponential $f(R)$ gravity. Lepton number violating model parameters are contrained with $\beta$ through decoupling temperature. Upper bound on $\beta$ parameter is also obtained.</description>

      <title>Group-theoretical classification of orientable objects and particle phenomenology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In our previous works, we have proposed a quantum description of relativistic orientable objects by a scalar field on the Poincar\'{e} group. This description is, in a sense, a generalization of ideas used by Wigner, Casimir and Eckart back in the 1930's in constructing a non-relativistic theory of a rigid rotator. The present work is a continuation and development of the above mentioned our works. The position of the relativistic orientable object in Minkowski space is completely determined by the position of a body-fixed reference frame with respect to the space-fixed reference frame, and can be specified by elements $q$ of the motion group of the Minkowski space - the Poincar\'e group $M(3,1)$. Quantum states of relativistic orientable objects are described by scalar wave functions $f(q)$ where the arguments $q=(x,z)$ consist of Minkowski space-time points $x$, and of orientation variables $z$ given by elements of the matrix $Z\in SL(2,C)$. Technically, we introduce and study the so-called double-sided representation $\boldsymbol{T}(\boldsymbol{g})f(q)=f(g_l^{-1}qg_r)$, $\boldsymbol{g}=(g_l,g_r)\in \boldsymbol{M}$, of the group $\boldsymbol{M}$, in the space of the scalar functions $f(q)$. Here the left multiplication by $g_l^{-1}$ corresponds to a change of space-fixed reference frame, whereas the right multiplication by $g_r$ corresponds to a change of body-fixed reference frame. On this basis, we develop a classification of the orientable objects and draw the attention to a possibility of connecting these results with the particle phenomenology. In particular, we demonstrate how one may identify fields described by linear and quadratic functions of $z$ with known elementary particles of spins $0$,$\frac{1}{2}$, and $1$. The developed classification does not contradict the phenomenology of elementary particles and, moreover, in some cases give its group-theoretic explanation.</description>

      <title>Formation and decay of oscillons after inflation in the presence of an external coupling, Part-I: Lattice simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the formation and decay of oscillons during the post-inflationary reheating epoch from inflaton oscillations around asymptotically flat potentials $V(\varphi)$ in the presence of an external coupling of the form $\frac{1}{2}\, g^2 \, \varphi^2 \, \chi^2$. It is well-known that in the absence of such an external coupling, the attractive self-interaction term in the potential leads to the formation of copious amounts of long-lived oscillons both for symmetric and asymmetric plateau potentials. We perform a detailed numerical analysis to study the formation of oscillons in the $\alpha$-attractor E- and T-model potentials using the publicly available lattice simulation code ${\cal C}$osmo${\cal L}$attice. We observe the formation of nonlinear oscillon-like structures with the average equation of state $\langle w_\varphi\rangle \simeq 0$ for a range of values of the inflaton self-coupling $\lambda$ and the external coupling $g^2$. Our results demonstrate that oscillons form even in the presence of an external coupling and we determine the upper bound on $g^2$ which facilitates oscillon formation. We also find that eventually, these oscillons decay into the scalar inflaton radiation as well as into the quanta of the offspring field $\chi$. Thus, we establish the possibility that reheating could have proceeded through the channel of oscillon decay, along with the usual decay of the oscillating inflaton condensate into $\chi$ particles. For a given value of the self-coupling $\lambda$, we notice that the lifetime of a population of oscillons decreases with an increase in the strength of the external coupling, following an (approximately) inverse power-law dependence on $g^2$.</description>

      <title>Monodromies of Second Order $q$-difference Equations from the WKB Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the space of monodromy data of second order $q$-difference equations through the framework of WKB analysis. We compute the connection matrices associated to the Stokes phenomenon of WKB wavefunctions and develop a general framework to parameterize monodromies of $q$-difference equations. Computations of monodromies are illustrated with explicit examples, including a $q$-Mathieu equation and its degenerations. In all examples we show that the monodromy around the origin of $\mathbb{C}^*$ admits an expansion in terms of Voros symbols, or exponentiated quantum periods, with integer coefficients. Physically these monodromies correspond to expectation values of Wilson line operators in five dimensional quantum field theories with minimal supersymmetry. In the case of the $q$-Mathieu equation, we show that the trace of the monodromy can be identified with the Hamiltonian of a corresponding $q$-Painlev\'e equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note we consider a class of $q$-hypergeometric equations describing the quantum difference equation for the cotangent bundle over projective space $X=T^{*}\mathbb{P}^n$ . We show that over $\mathbb{Q}_p$ these equations are equipped with the Frobenius action $z\to z^p$. We obtain an explicit formula for the constant term of the Frobenius intertwiner in therms of $p$-adic $q$-gamma function of Koblitz. In the limit $q\to 1$ our formula degenerates to the Frobenius intertwiners for the hypergeometric differential equations discovered by B.Dwork.</description>

      <title>Observational test for $f(Q)$ gravity with weak gravitational lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article we confront a class of $f(Q)$ gravity models with observational data of galaxy-galaxy lensing. Specifically, we consider the $f(Q)$ gravity models containing a small quadratic correction when compared with General Relativity (GR), and quantify this correction by a model parameter $\alpha$. To derive the observational constraints, we start by extracting the spherically symmetric solutions which correspond to the deviations from the Schwarzschild solution that depends on the model parameter in a two-fold way, i.e., a renormalized mass and a new term proportional to $r^{-2}$. Then, we calculate the effective lensing potential, the deflection angle, the shear component, and the effective Excess Surface Density (ESD) profile. After that, we employ the group catalog and shape catalog from the SDSS DR7 for the lens and source samples respectively. Moreover, we handle the off-center radius as a free parameter and constrain it using the MCMC. Concerning the deviation parameter from GR we derive $\alpha=1.202^{+0.277}_{-0.179}\times 10^{-6} {\rm Mpc}^{-2}$ at 1 $\sigma$ confidence level, and then compare the fitting efficiency with the standard $\Lambda$CDM paradigm by applying the AIC and BIC information criteria. Our results indicate that the $f(Q)$ corrections alongside off-center effects yield a scenario that is slightly favored.</description>

      <title>Form factors of $\Lambda_b^0 \to \Lambda_c(2595)^+$ within light-cone QCD sum rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we calculated the form factors of the weak decay process $\Lambda_b^0 \to \Lambda_c(2595)^+$, where the final charm baryon represents an excited state with spin-parity $\frac{1}{2}^-$. Utilizing the light-cone QCD sum rules approach, we incorporated the contributions of the lowest two charm baryon states: the ground state $\Lambda_c$ with $J^P=\frac{1}{2}^+$ and the excited state $\Lambda_c(2595)^+$ with $J^P=\frac{1}{2}^-$ in the hadronic representation of the $\Lambda_b$ to $\Lambda_c(2595)$ transition correlation function. This approach allowes us to extract the form factors of the $\Lambda_b^0 \to \Lambda_c(2595)^+$ from $\Lambda_b^0 \to \Lambda_c^+$ transition. During the light-cone QCD sum rules procedure, we employed the light-cone distribution amplitudes (LCDAs) of the $\Lambda_b$ baryon. Furthermore, by combining these form factors with the helicity amplitudes of the bottom baryon transition matrix elements, we calculated the differential decay widths for the processes $\Lambda_b^0 \to \Lambda_c(2595)^+\ell^-\bar{\nu}_\ell$. Additionally, within the lifetime of $\Lambda_b^0$, we obtained the absolute branching fractions for the semileptonic decays $\Lambda_b^0 \to \Lambda_c(2595)^+ \ell^- \bar{\nu}_\ell$. With the branching fractions of $\Lambda_b^0 \to \Lambda_c(2595)^+ \ell^- \bar{\nu}_\ell$ calculated in this work, we also determined the parameter $\mathcal{R}(\Lambda_c(2595)^+)$ which tests the lepton flavor universality. This parameter is defined as the ratio of branching fractions $\mathcal{B}r(\Lambda_b^0 \to \Lambda_c(2595)^+\tau^-\bar{\nu}_\tau)$ and $\mathcal{B}r(\Lambda_b^0 \to \Lambda_c(2595)^+\mu^-\bar{\nu}_\mu)$. Our results provide a valuable theoretical test for these decay channels and offer insights into the LCDAs of bottom baryons, paving the way for further in-depth investigations.</description>

      <title>Echoes and quasi-normal modes of perturbations around Schwarzchild traversable wormholes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the waveforms and quasi-normal modes around Schwarzschild traversable wormholes under different field perturbations, including the scalar field perturbation, the electromagnetic (vector) field perturbation and the gravitational (tensor) field perturbation. By comparing Schwarzschild traversable wormholes with Schwarzschild black holes, we find some unique properties for the former. At first, the perturbation waveform includes echoes and damping oscillations around Schwarzschild traversable wormholes, while it has only the damping waveform around Schwarzschild black holes. Secondly, the difference between adjacent peaks of echoes varies with the mass parameter and the defect parameter in the waveform around Schwarzschild traversable wormholes, while it always keeps constant around Schwarzschild black holes. Thirdly, the ordinary isospectrality between the odd and even parities no longer exists in the quasi-normal modes of gravitational perturbations around Schwarzschild traversable wormholes, but an alternative isospectrality appears. According to these properties, we summarize a scenario for estimating the mass parameter and the defect parameter of Schwarzschild traversable wormholes through the waveforms and quasi-normal modes. Our analyses provide a more profound comprehension of the inherent characteristics of Schwarzschild traversable wormholes.</description>

Abstract: This paper studies the Bondi-Metzner-Sachs group in homogeneous projective coordinates, because it is then possible to write all transformations of such a group in a manifestly linear way. The 2-sphere metric, Bondi-Metzner-Sachs metric, asymptotic Killing vectors, generators of supertranslations, as well as boosts and rotations of Minkowski spacetime, are all re-expressed in homogeneous projective coordinates. Last, the integral curves of vector fields which generate supertranslations are evaluated in detail. This work prepares the ground for more advanced applications of the differential geometry of asymptotically flat spacetimes in projective coordinates.</description>

Abstract: We obtain explicit formulas for capped descendent vertex functions of $\text{Hilb}^n(\mathbb{C}^2)$ for descendents given by chern classes of tautological bundles. The expression is the result of twisting a well known generating function for normalized Macdonald polynomials. This gives an explicit description of the rational function the capped vertex is an expansion of. Along the way we prove various limit expressions of the capping operator and the bare vertex function.</description>

      <title>Kerr-MOG-(A)dS black hole and its shadow in scalar-tensor-vector gravity theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The scalar-tensor-vector gravity (STVG) theory has attracted significant interest due to its ability to effectively address the issue of galaxy rotation curves and clusters of galaxies without considering the influence of dark matter. In this paper, we construct rotating black hole solutions with a cosmological constant in the STVG theory (i.e., Kerr-MOG-(A)dS black hole solutions), where the import of a gravitational charge as a source modifies the gravitational constant, determined by $ G=G_{\text{N}}(1+\alpha) $. For Kerr-MOG-dS spacetime, the observer is situated at a specific location within the domain of outer communication, rather than being located infinitely far away. Since black hole shadows are shaped by light propagation in spacetime, the interaction between the MOG parameter and the cosmological constant is expected to produce novel effects on these shadows. As the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ increases, the apparent size of the black hole shadow on the screen decreases. Additionally, the shadow expands with an increase in the MOG parameter $\alpha$, reaching a maximum at a certain value, and its shape becomes more rounded under an arbitrary rotation parameter, which leads to degeneracy between different black hole parameters. However, by employing numerical backward ray-tracing techniques, we have found that gravitational lensing and the frame-dragging effect effectively distinguish this degeneracy. Our work contributes to a deeper understanding of black holes in modified gravity, their observational signatures, and constraints.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent observation of the muon $(g-2)_{\mu}$ anomaly continues to challenge the explanations provided by the Standard Model. However, this anomaly can potentially find reconciliation within the framework of two-Higgs doublet models, provided that the pseudoscalar mass remains low. The introduction of additional fermionic components, such as a generation of vector-like quarks, not only broadens the acceptable parameter range for elucidating the anomaly but also presents an opportunity to circumvent conflicts with constraints from B-decays and heavy Higgs searches. We demonstrate the efficacy of fitting the anomaly in the muon magnetic moment within these models, assuming that vector-like quarks do not undergo mixing with Standard Model quarks. With interactions following a type-X pattern for standard model quarks and a type-II pattern for vector-like quarks, results in models designated as type-XII2HDMVLQ. Additionally, we have explored double Higgs production within this model and observed when both the heavy Higgs and VLQ contribute the double Higgs production cross section significantly enhanced.</description>

      <title>Volichenko-type metasymmetry of braided Majorana qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents different mathematical structures connected with the parastatistics of braided Majorana qubits and clarifies their role; in particular, mixed-bracket Heisenberg-Lie algebras are introduced. These algebras belong to a more general framework than the Volichenko algebras defined in 1990 by Leites-Serganova as metasymmetries which do not respect even/odd gradings and lead to mixed brackets interpolating ordinary commutators and anticommutators. In a previous paper braided $Z_2$-graded Majorana qubits were first-quantized within a graded Hopf algebra framework endowed with a braided tensor product. The resulting system admits truncations at roots of unity and realizes, for a given integer $s=2,3,4,\ldots$, an interpolation between ordinary Majorana fermions (recovered at $s=2$) and bosons (recovered in the $s\rightarrow \infty$ limit); it implements a parastatistics where at most $s-1$ indistinguishable particles are accommodated in a multi-particle sector. The structures discussed in this work are: - the quantum group interpretation of the roots of unity truncations recovered from reps of the quantum superalgebra ${\cal U}_q({{osp}}(1|2))$; - the reconstruction, via suitable intertwining operators, of the braided tensor products as ordinary tensor products; - the introduction of mixed brackets for the braided creation/annihilation operators which define generalized Heisenberg-Lie algebras; - the $s\rightarrow \infty$ untruncated limit of the mixed-bracket Heisenberg-Lie algebras producing parafermionic oscillators; - (meta)symmetries of ordinary differential equations given by matrix Schr\"{o}dinger equations in $0+1$ dimension induced by the braided creation/annihilation operators; - in the special case of a third root of unity truncation, a nonminimal realization of the intertwining operators defines the system as a ternary algebra.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose new vertex operators, both the type I and the type II dual, of the elliptic quantum toroidal algebra U_{t_1,t_2,p}(gl_{1,tor}) by combining representations of U_{t_1,t_2,p}(gl_{1,tor}) and the notions of the elliptic stable envelopes for the instanton moduli space M(n,r). The vertex operators reproduce the shuffle product formula of the elliptic stable envelopes by their composition. We also show that the vacuum expectation value of a composition of the vertex operators gives a correct formula of the K-theoretic vertex function for M(n,r). We then derive exchange relations among the vertex operators and construct a L-operator satisfying the RLL=LLR^* relation with R and R^* being elliptic dynamical instanton R-matrices defined as transition matrices of the elliptic stable envelopes. Assuming a universal form of L, we define a comultiplication \Delta in terms of it. It turns out that the new vertex operators are intertwining operators of the U_{t_1,t_2,p}(gl_{1,tor})-modules w.r.t \Delta.</description>

      <title>Toward regular black holes in sixth-derivative gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study spherically symmetric static solutions of the most general sixth-derivative gravity using series expansions. Specifically, we prove that the only solutions of the complete theory (i.e., with generic coupling constants) that possess a Frobenius expansion around the origin, $r=0$, are necessarily regular. When restricted to specific branches of theories (i.e., imposing particular constraints on the coupling constants), families of potentially singular solutions emerge. By expanding around $r=r_0 \neq 0$, we identify solutions with black-hole horizons. Finally, we argue that, unlike in fourth-derivative gravity, the conditions $R=0$ and $g_{tt}g_{rr}=-1$ are too restrictive for sixth-derivative gravity solutions.</description>

      <title>Mapping the sources of CP violation in neutrino oscillations from the seesaw mechanism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first complete calculation of the Jarlskog invariant, a working measure of the strength of CP violation in the flavor oscillations of three light neutrino species, with the help of a full Euler-like block parametrization of the flavor structure in the canonical seesaw mechanism. We find that this invariant depends on 240 linear combinations of the 6 original phase parameters that are responsible for CP violation in the decays of three heavy Majorana neutrinos in 27 linear combinations as a whole, and thus provides the first model-independent connection between the microscopic and macroscopic matter-antimatter asymmetries.</description>

      <title>Probing flavored regimes of leptogenesis with gravitational waves from cosmic strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmic strings radiate detectable gravitational waves in models featuring high-scale symmetry breaking, e.g., high-scale leptogenesis. In this Letter, for the first time, we show that different flavored regimes of high-scale leptogenesis can be tested distinctly with the spectral features in cosmic string-radiated gravitational waves. This is possible if the scalar field that makes right-handed neutrinos massive is feebly coupled to the Standard Model Higgs. Each flavored regime, sensitive to low-energy neutrino experiments, leaves a marked imprint on the gravitational waves spectrum. A three-flavor and a two-flavor regime could be probed by a characteristic fall-off of the gravitational wave spectrum at the LISA-DECIGO-ET frequency bands with preceding scale-invariant amplitudes bounded from above and below. We present Gravitational Waves windows for Flavored Regimes of Leptogenesis (GWFRL) falsifiable in the upcoming experiments.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous CP violation in Supersymmetric QCD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a composite model of spontaneous CP violation based on a new supersymmetric QCD as a solution to the strong CP problem. The scalar components of the meson chiral superfields obtain complex vacuum expectation values to break CP symmetry spontaneously. Then, wavefunction renormalization for the quark kinetic terms provides the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) phase, while the strong CP phase $\bar{\theta}$ is protected by nonrenormalization of the superpotential and hermiticity of the wavefunction renormalization factor. In our model, the right-handed down-type quark multiplets are given by composite states, enhancing their couplings to CP breaking fields, which is essential to realize the observed CKM phase. The non-perturbative dynamics generates the scale of spontaneous CP violation hierarchically lower than the Planck scale. We discuss potential corrections to $\bar{\theta}$ and find a viable parameter space of the model to solve the strong CP problem without fine-tuning.</description>

      <title>On a reconstruction procedure for special spherically symmetric metrics in the scalar-Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet model: the Schwarzschild metric test</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The 4D gravitational model with a real scalar field $\varphi$, Einstein and Gauss-Bonnet terms is considered. The action contains the potential $U(\varphi)$ and the Gauss-Bonnet coupling function $f(\varphi)$. For a special static spherically symmetric metric $ds^2 = (A(u))^{-1} du^2 - A(u) dt^2 + u^2 d\Omega^2$, with $A(u) &gt; 0$ ($u &gt; 0$ is a radial coordinate), we verify the so-called reconstruction procedure suggested by Nojiri and Nashed. This procedure presents certain implicit relations for $U(\varphi)$ and $f(\varphi)$ which lead to exact solutions to the equations of motion for a given metric governed by $A(u)$. We confirm that all relations in the approach of Nojiri and Nashed for $f(\varphi(u))$ and $\varphi(u)$ are correct, but the relation for $U(\varphi(u))$ contains a typo which is eliminated in this paper. Here we apply the procedure to the (external) Schwarzschild metric with the gravitational radius $2 \mu $ and $u &gt; 2 \mu$. Using the ``no-ghost'' restriction (i.e., reality of $\varphi(u)$), we find two families of $(U(\varphi), f(\varphi))$. The first one gives us the Schwarzschild metric defined for $u &gt; 3 \mu$, while the second one describes the Schwarzschild metric defined for $2 \mu &lt; u &lt; 3 \mu$ ($3 \mu$ is the radius of the photon sphere). In both cases the potential $U(\varphi)$ is negative.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many evidences appear in the past decades and show that the negativity of Casimir energy is responsible for exotic mechanical and gravitational effects. We study in this work the Lorentz boost of a Casimir cavity, on which little attention is paid to its momentum in historical works. We find that the vacuum energy and momentum carried by the cavity transform differently from those of point particles due to the cavity's extension feature. However, the mass-shell condition of the two are identical as long as the cavity is finite along the moving direction only.</description>

      <title>The Hadamard condition on a Cauchy surface and the renormalized stress-energy tensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a Cauchy surface in a curved spacetime and a suitably defined quantum state on the CCR algebra of the Klein Gordon quantum field on that surface, we show, by expanding the squared spacetime geodesic distance and the '$U$' and '$V$' Hadamard coefficients (and suitable derivatives thereof) in sufficiently accurate covariant Taylor expansions on the surface that the renormalized expectation value of the quantum stress-energy tensor on the surface is determined by the geometry of the surface and the first 4 time derivatives of the metric off the surface, in addition to the Cauchy data for the field's two-point function. This result has been anticipated in and is motivated by a previous investigation by the authors on the initial value problem in semiclassical gravity, for which the geometric initial data corresponds {\it a priori} to the metric on the surface and up to 3 time derivatives off the surface, but where it was argued that the fourth derivative can be obtained with aid of the field equations on the initial surface.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Alternative theories of gravity may be put to the test by making use of gravitational wave observations. Scalar-tensor theories provide a relatively simple framework that allows for compact object solutions with characteristics different from those of their GR counterparts. In shift-symmetric theories, black hole hair may arise when a linear coupling with the Gauss-Bonnet (GB) invariant is introduced. The effect of this coupling on the black hole quasinormal modes (QNMs) has been shown to be small, therefore limiting the observational interest in the theory. In general, however, one expects that additional shift-symmetric terms in the Lagrangian may be relevant, and indeed, it has been shown that they can have a nontrivial impact on the mass and scalar charge of the stationary solutions. In this work we explore the effect that various such terms have on the axial and polar QNMs of the hairy black hole solutions.</description>

      <title>The hydrodynamics of inverse phase transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: First order phase transitions are violent phenomena that occur when the state of the universe evolves abruptly from one vacuum to another. A \emph{direct} phase transition connects a local vacuum to a deeper vacuum of the zero--temperature potential, and the energy difference between the two minima manifests itself in the acceleration of the bubble wall. In this sense, the transition is triggered by the release of vacuum energy. On the other hand, an \emph{inverse} phase transition connects a deeper minimum of the zero--temperature potential to a higher one, and the bubble actually expands against the vacuum energy. The transition is then triggered purely by thermal corrections. We study for the first time the hydrodynamics and the energy budget of inverse phase transitions. We find several modes of expansion for inverse bubbles, which are related to the known ones for direct transitions by a mirror symmetry. We finally investigate the friction exerted on the bubble wall and comment on the possibility of runaway walls in inverse phase transitions.</description>

Abstract: We study the gravity solution dual to the D0 brane quantum mechanics, or BFSS matrix model, in the 't Hooft limit.
  The classical physics described by this gravity solution is invariant under a scaling transformation, which changes the action with a specific critical exponent, sometimes called the hyperscaling violating exponent. We present an argument for this critical exponent from the matrix model side, which leads to an explanation for the peculiar temperature dependence of the entropy in this theory, $S \propto T^{9/5}$. We also present a similar argument for all other $Dp$-brane geometries.
  We then compute the black hole quasinormal modes. This involves perturbing the finite temperature geometry. These perturbations can be easily obtained by a mathematical trick where we view the solution as the dimensional reduction of an $AdS_{ 2 + 9/5 } \times S^8$ geometry.</description>

      <title>Towards a unitary formulation of quantum field theory in curved spacetime: the case of de Sitter spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.06046v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Before we ask what the quantum gravity theory is, it is a legitimate quest to formulate a robust quantum field theory in curved spacetime (QFTCS). Several conceptual problems, especially unitarity loss (pure states evolving into mixed states), have raised concerns over several decades. Unitarity in QFTCS is essential for formulating S-matrix and computing scattering amplitudes in curved spacetime. In this paper, acknowledging the fact that {time} is a parameter in quantum theory, which is different from its status in the context of General Relativity (GR), we start with a "quantum first approach" and propose a new formulation for QFTCS based on the discrete spacetime transformations ($\mathcal{C}\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$) which offer a way to achieve unitarity. Our framework for a QFTCS is built on a refined understanding of standard QFT S-matrix that explicitly reflects the \cpt\, invariance of scattering amplitudes. We rewrite the standard QFT equipped with a direct-sum Fock space structure that is explicitly $\mathcal{C}\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$, invariant. Applying this framework to QFTCS, in the context of de Sitter (dS) spacetime, we elucidate how this approach to quantization complies with unitarity and the observer complementarity principle. We then discuss defining an S-matrix in de Sitter spacetime that is analogous to Minkowski. Furthermore, we comment briefly the implications of our QFTCS approach for quantum gravity.</description>

Abstract: Cylindrical gravitational waves are interesting because they enjoy an infinite dimensional symmetry called Geroch symmetry. In this paper, we compute the 2-particle tree-level S-matrix for cylindrical gravitational waves. The model we use is a dimensional reduction of general relativity to two spacetime dimensions. The reduced theory is a nonlinear sigma model. We discuss an SO(2) symmetry of the amplitudes which is a special case of Geroch symmetry.</description>

      <title>Exact Operator Map from Strong Coupling to Free Fields: Beyond Seiberg-Witten Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.05507v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In quantum field theory (QFT) above two spacetime dimensions, one is usually only able to construct exact operator maps from the ultraviolet (UV) to the infrared (IR) of strongly coupled renormalization group (RG) flows for the most symmetry-protected observables. Famous examples include maps of chiral rings in 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetry. In this letter, we construct the first non-perturbative UV/IR map for less protected operators: starting from a particularly "simple" UV strongly coupled non-Lagrangian 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ QFT, we show that a universal non-chiral quarter-BPS ring can be mapped exactly and bijectively to the IR. In particular, strongly coupled UV dynamics governing infinitely many null states manifest in the IR via Fermi statistics of free gauginos. Using the concept of arc space, this bijection allows us to compute the exact UV Macdonald index in the IR.</description>

Abstract: Flavored modular differential equations sometimes arise from null states or their descendants in a chiral algebra with continuous flavor symmetry. In this paper we focus on Kac-Moody algebras $\widehat{\mathfrak{g}}_k$ that contain a level-four null state $|\mathcal{N}_T\rangle$ which implements the nilpotency of the Sugawara stress tensor. We study the properties of the corresponding flavored modular differential equations, and show that the equations exhibit almost covariance under modular $S$-transformation, connecting null states and their descendants at different levels. The modular property of the equations fixes the structure of $\mathfrak{g}$ and the level $k$, as well as the flavored characters of all the highest weight representations. Shift property of the equations can generate non-vacuum characters starting from the vacuum character.</description>

Abstract: We study an evaporating black hole in the boundary conformal field theory (BCFT) model under the fully time-dependent AdS-Vaidya spacetime geometry. We introduce the time-dependent finite bath termed the effective Hawking radiation region. This is described by a nontrivial BCFT solution that acts as a time-dependent brane which we call the moving end-of-the-radiation (METR) brane that leads to a new type of Hubeny-Rangamani-Takayanagi surface. We further examine the island formulation in this particular time-dependent spacetime. The Page curve is calculated by using Holographic Entanglement Entropy (HEE) in the context of double holography.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.17232v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The coset construction is a tool for systematically building low energy effective actions for Nambu-Goldstone modes. This technique is typically used to compute time-ordered correlators appropriate for $S$-matrix computations for systems in their ground state. In this paper, we extend this technique to the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism, which enables one to calculate a wider variety of correlators and applies also to systems in a mixed state. We focus our attention on internal symmetries and demonstrate that, after identifying the appropriate symmetry breaking pattern, Schwinger-Keldysh effective actions for Nambu-Goldstone modes can be constructed using the standard rules of the coset construction. Particular emphasis is placed on the thermal state and ensuring that correlators satisfy the KMS relation. We also discuss explicitly the power counting scheme underlying our effective actions. We comment on the similarities and differences between our approach and others that have previously appeared in the literature. In particular, our prescription does not require the introduction of additional ``diffusive'' symmetries and retains the full non-linear structure generated by the coset construction. We conclude with a series of explicit examples, including a computation of the finite-temperature two-point functions of conserved spin currents in non-relativistic paramagnets, antiferromagnets, and ferromagnets. Along the way, we also clarify the discrete symmetries that set antiferromagnets apart from ferromagnets, and point out that the dynamical KMS symmetry must be implemented in different ways in these two systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.10345v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We argue that the origin of unitarity violation and information loss paradox in our understanding of black holes (BH) lies in the standard way of doing quantum field theory in curved space-time (QFTCS), which is heavily biased on intuition borrowed from classical General Relativity. In this paper, with the quantum first approach, we formulate a so-called direct-sum QFT (DQFT) in BH space-time based on a novel formulation of discrete space-time transformations in gravity that potentially restores unitarity. By invoking the quantum effects associated with the gravitational backreaction, we show that the Hawking quanta emerging outside of the Schwarzschild radius ($r_S=2GM$) cannot be independent of the quanta that continue to be inside $r_S$. This enables the information to be carried by Hawking quanta, but in the BH DQFT formalism, we do not get any firewalls. Furthermore, DQFT leads to the BH evaporation involving only pure states. This means the quantum mechanical effects at the BH horizon produce two components of a maximally entangled pure state in superselection sector Hilbert spaces. This construction enables pure states to evolve into pure states, restoring unitarity and observer complementarity. Finally, we discuss how our framework leaves important clues for formulating a scattering matrix and probing the nature of quantum gravity.</description>

The gauge symmetry is broken by a bulk Higgs vacuum expectation value triggered on the brane. We propose two separate Goldstone boson equivalence theorems for the boundary and bulk degrees of freedom. We compute the holographic self-energy of the gauge field and show that its spectrum is either a continuum, gapped continuum, or a discretuum as a function of the Higgs bulk mass. When the Higgs has no bulk mass, the AdS isometries are unbroken. We find in that case that the dual CFT has a non-conserved U(1) current whose anomalous dimension is proportional to the square of the Higgs vacuum expectation value. When the Higgs background weakly breaks the AdS isometries, we present an adapted WKB method to solve the gauge field equations. We show that the U(1) current dimension runs logarithmically with the energy scale in accordance with a nearly-marginal U(1)-breaking deformation of the CFT.</description>

      <title>Engineering Perturbative String Duals for Symmetric Product Orbifold CFTs</title>

Abstract: Constructing a holographic string theory dual for a CFT in the perturbative, weakly coupled regime is a holy grail for gauge/string dualities that would not only open the door for proofs of the AdS/CFT correspondence but could also provide novel examples of string duals with and without supersymmetry. In this work we consider some marginal perturbation of a family of symmetric product orbifolds in two dimensions. From their correlation functions we engineer a bosonic string theory whose amplitudes are shown to reproduce the CFT correlation function order-by-order both in the coupling and in $1/N$. Our derivation does not require to compute and compare correlation functions explicitly but rather relies on a sequence of identities that can be derived using path integral methods. The bosonic string theory we engineer is based on the field content of the Kac-Wakimoto representation of strings in $AdS_3$ with $k$ units of pure NSNS flux, but the interaction terms we obtain are different. They include current algebra preserving interaction terms with one unit of spectral flow.</description>

      <title>Anti-de Sitter $\to$ de Sitter transition driven by Casimir forces and mitigating tensions in cosmological parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12352v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over the last few years, low- and high-redshift observations set off tensions in the measurement of the present-day expansion rate $H_0$ and in the determination of the amplitude of the matter clustering in the late Universe (parameterized by $S_8$). It was recently noted that both these tensions can be resolved if the cosmological constant parametrizing the dark energy content switches its sign at a critical redshift $z_c \sim 2$. However, the anti-de Sitter (AdS) swampland conjecture suggests that the postulated switch in sign of the cosmological constant at zero temperature seems unlikely because the AdS vacua are an infinite distance appart from de Sitter (dS) vacua in moduli space. We provide an explanation for the required AdS $\to$ dS crossover transition in the vacuum energy using the Casimir forces of fields inhabiting the bulk. We then use entropy arguments to claim that any AdS $\to$ dS transition between metastable vacua must be accompanied by a reduction of the species scale where gravity becomes strong. We provide a few examples supporting this AdS $\to$ dS uplift conjecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13269v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study, from the perspective of supersymmetry and space-time Killing spinors, the local brane densities involved in 1/4-BPS intersecting brane systems. In particular, we classify the possible local brane structures that have maximal (16) supersymmetries in 1/4-BPS intersecting brane backgrounds. Applied to BPS black holes, this classification reveals the allowed local microstructure for pure microstates. We further use these structures with local 16 supersymmetries as building blocks to generalise to 1/8-BPS systems. Moreover, we give examples of 1/8-BPS black holes for which the local supersymmetries are compatible with the combination of different entropy-generating effects from brane interaction. Finally, applying our classification to BPS domain walls, we illustrate how our formalism may possibly describe the local picture of the Hanany-Witten effect.</description>

      <title>Fermionic signal of vacuum polarization in strong laser fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11168v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vacuum polarization (VP) is investigated for the interaction of a polarized $\gamma$-ray beam of GeV photons with a counterpropagating ultraintense laser pulse. In a conventional setup of a vacuum birefringence measurement, a VP signal is the emerging small circular (linear) polarization of the initially linearly (circularly) polarized probe photons. The pair production via the nonlinear Breit-Wheeler process in such a high-energy environment eliminates part of the $\gamma$-photons in the outgoing $\gamma$-beam, increasing the statistical error and decreasing the accuracy of this VP signal. In contrast, we investigate the conversion of the emerging circular polarization of $\gamma$-photons into longitudinal polarization of the created positrons, considering the latter as the main VP signal. To study the VP effects in the highly nonlinear regime, where the Euler-Heisenberg effective Lagrangian method breaks down, we have developed a Monte-Carlo simulation method, incorporating vacuum birefringence and dichroism via the one-loop QED probabilities in the locally constant field approximation. Our Monte Carlo method will enable the study of VP effects in strong fields of arbitrary configuration. With 10~PW laser systems, we demonstrate the feasibility of detecting the fermionic signal of the VP effect at the 5$\sigma$ confidence level with a few hours of measurement time.</description>

      <title>An \'Etude on the Regularization and Renormalization of Divergences in Primordial Observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10008v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many cosmological observables of interest derive from primordial vacuum fluctuations evolved to late times. These observables represent statistical draws from some underlying quantum or statistical field theoretic framework where infinities arise and require regularization. After subtracting divergences, renormalization conditions must be imposed by measurements or observations at some scale, mindful of scheme and background dependence. We review this process on backgrounds that transition from finite duration inflation to radiation domination, and show how in spite of the ubiquity of scaleless integrals, UV divergences can still be meaningfully extracted from quantities that nominally vanish when dimensionally regularized. In this way, one can contextualize calculations with hard cutoffs, distinguishing between UV and IR scales corresponding to the beginning and end of inflation from UV and IR scales corresponding the unknown completion of the theory and its observables. This distinction has significance as observable quantities cannot depend on the latter although they will certainly depend on the former. One can also explicitly show the scheme independence of the coefficients of UV divergent logarithms. Furthermore, certain IR divergences can be shown to be an artifact of the de Sitter limit and are cured for finite duration inflation. For gravitational wave observables, we stress the need to regularize stress tensors that do not presume a prior scale separation in their construction (as with the standard Isaacson form), deriving an improved stress tensor fit to purpose. We conclude by highlighting the inextricable connection between inferring $N_{\rm eff}$ bounds from vacuum tensor perturbations and the process of background renormalization.</description>

      <title>Rotating metrics and new multipole moments from scattering amplitudes in arbitrary dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16574v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the vacuum metric generated by a generic rotating object in arbitrary dimensions up to third post-Minkowskian order by computing the classical contribution of scattering amplitudes describing the graviton emission by massive spin-1 particles up to two loops. The solution depends on the mass, angular momenta, and on up to two parameters related to generic quadrupole moments. In $D=4$ spacetime dimensions, we recover the vacuum Hartle-Thorne solution describing a generic spinning object to second order in the angular momentum, of which the Kerr metric is a particular case obtained for a specific mass quadrupole moment dictated by the uniqueness theorem. At the level of the effective action, the case of minimal couplings corresponds to the Kerr black hole, while any other mass quadrupole moment requires non-minimal couplings. In $D&gt;4$, the absence of black-hole uniqueness theorems implies that there are multiple spinning black hole solutions with different topology. Using scattering amplitudes, we find a generic solution depending on the mass, angular momenta, the mass quadrupole moment, and a new stress quadrupole moment which does not exist in $D=4$. As special cases, we recover the Myers-Perry and the single-angular-momentum black ring solutions, to third and first post-Minkowksian order, respectively. Interestingly, at variance with the four dimensional case, none of these solutions corresponds to the minimal coupling in the effective action. This shows that, from the point of view of scattering amplitudes, black holes are the "simplest" General Relativity vacuum solutions only in $D=4$.</description>

Abstract: We consider 1+1 field generalization of the elliptic Calogero-Moser model. It is shown that the Lax connection satisfies the classical non-ultralocal $r$-matrix structure of Maillet type. Next, we consider 1+1 field analogue of the spin Calogero-Moser model and its multipole (or multispin) extension. Finally, we discuss the field analogue of the classical IRF-Vertex correspondence, which relates utralocal and non-ultralocal $r$-matrix structures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02206v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Starting from the computation of Symmetry Resolved Entanglement Entropy (SREE) for boosted intervals in a two dimensional Conformal Field Theory, we compute the same in various non-Lorentzian limits, viz, Galilean and Carrollian Conformal Field Theory in same number of dimensions. We approach the problem both from a limiting perspective and by using intrinsic symmetries of respective non-Lorentzian conformal algebras. In particular, we calculate the leading order terms, logarithmic terms, and the $\mathcal{O}(1)$ terms and explicitly show exact compliance with $\textit{equipartition of entanglement}$, even in the non-Lorentzian system. Keeping in mind the holographic origin of SREE for the Carrollian limit, we further compute SREE for BMS$_{3}$-Kac-Moody, which couples a $U(1)\times U(1)$ theory with bulk gravity.</description>

      <title>Celestial strings: field theory, conformally soft limits, and mapping the worldsheet onto the celestial sphere</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01643v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the celestial correlators corresponding to tree-level 5-gluon amplitudes in the type I superstring theory. Since celestial correlation functions are obtained by integrating over the full range of energies, there is no obvious analog of the $\alpha' \to 0$ limit in this basis. This is manifestly shown by a factorization of the $\alpha '$ dependence in the celestial string amplitudes. Consequently, the question arises as to how the field theory limit is recovered from string theory in the celestial basis. This problem has been addressed in the literature for the case of 4-gluon amplitudes at tree level, where the forward scattering limit of the stringy factor was identified as a limit in which celestial Yang-Mills 4-point function is recovered. Here, we extend the analysis to the case with five gluons, for which the string moduli space allows for more types of limits, thus allowing to investigate this aspect in more detail. Based on celestial data only, we study the regime in which one arrives at the correct celestial field theory limit. We also study other properties of the celestial string amplitudes, namely, the conformally soft theorem, effective field theory expansion in the conformal basis, and a map that arises in the regime of high-energy/large-scaling dimension that connects the punctured string worldsheet to the insertion of primary operators in the celestial CFT for the massless $n$-point string amplitude.</description>

Abstract: We propose bulk 3D N=4 rank-0 superconformal field theories, which are related to 2D N=1 supersymmetric minimal models, SM(2, ...) and SM(3, ...), via recently discovered non-unitary bulk-boundary correspondence. The correspondence relates a 3D N=4 rank-0 superconformal field theory to 2D chiral rational conformal field theories. A topologically twisted theory of the rank-0 SCFT supports the rational chiral algebra at the boundary upon a proper choice of boundary condition. We test the proposal by checking several non-trivial dictionaries of the correspondence.</description>

Abstract: We derive the new identity in homotopy algebras which directly corresponds to the Schwinger-Dyson equations in quantum field theory. As an application, we derive the Ward-Takahashi identities. We demonstrate that the Ward-Takahashi identities are reproduced in several examples. In general, our formula contains divergence. We mediate this problem by introducing stubs known in the context of string field theory. With the regularization, we can calculate the anomaly such as axial U(1) anomaly in vector-like U(1) gauge theory.</description>

Abstract: Gibbons-Hawking-York (GHY) terms are typically neglected when performing dimensional reductions of gravitational theories. We consider the reduction of such terms for both two-derivative and four-derivative theories in general dimensions. We demonstrate a robust consistency wherein the GHY term in the original, higher-dimensional theory translates directly to the appropriate GHY term in the dimensionally reduced theory. In particular, this gives a novel way of generating such terms for higher-derivative corrections. We carry out this procedure for Gauss-Bonnet, Chern-Simons modified, and $f(R)$ gravities to derive novel boundary terms.</description>

Abstract: The creation of particles by the excitation of the quantum vacuum in a cavity with a moving mirror was predicted in 1969. Here, we investigate that, in addition to real particles, the excitation of the quantum vacuum in a dynamical cavity can also result in the creation of a certain amount of positive vacuum energy around these particles. We show that while in the case of a single mirror moving in a free space, with the field in the vacuum state, all the energy transferred from the mirror to the field is converted into real particles, on the other hand, when considering a second and static mirror forming a cavity with the first, the same movement of the first mirror can lead to less energy being converted into real particles, with the difference being converted into positive vacuum energy around these particles.</description>

      <title>Spread and Spectral Complexity in Quantum Spin Chains: from Integrability to Chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11254v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore spread and spectral complexity in quantum systems that exhibit a transition from integrability to chaos, namely the mixed-field Ising model and the next-to-nearest-neighbor deformation of the Heisenberg XXZ spin chain. We corroborate the observation that the presence of a peak in spread complexity before its saturation, is a characteristic feature in chaotic systems. We find that, in general, the saturation value of spread complexity post-peak depends not only on the spectral statistics of the Hamiltonian, but also on the specific state. However, there appears to be a maximal universal bound determined by the symmetries and dimension of the Hamiltonian, which is realized by the thermofield double state (TFD) at infinite temperature. We also find that the time scales at which the spread complexity and spectral form factor change their behaviour agree with each other and are independent of the chaotic properties of the systems. In the case of spectral complexity, we identify that the key factor determining its saturation value and timescale in chaotic systems is given by minimum energy difference in the theory's spectrum. This explains observations made in the literature regarding its earlier saturation in chaotic systems compared to their integrable counterparts. We conclude by discussing the properties of the TFD which, we conjecture, make it suitable for probing signatures of chaos in quantum many-body systems.</description>

Abstract: We consider a model of a holographic 2+1d CFT interacting with an oscillating background gauge field. It is solved by an AdS-Vaidya metric describing Ohmic heating of the boundary field theory. However, we also show that if timelike singularities of Kasner type are permitted then a time independent solution that may be interpreted as a Floquet state of the system can be constructed. In this state the system exhibits either Hall conductivity or kinetic induction, and we numerically evaluate the Kasner exponents for a range of boundary conditions. This model may contribute to the ongoing discussion on the validity and meaning of the Kasner metric in the AdS/CFT correspondence and its application in cosmology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15186v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the context of the holographic correspondence, we introduce a purely extrinsic renormalization prescription, exemplified with the case of a minimally-coupled scalar field in AdS space. The counterterms depend only on the field and its radial derivatives. Consistency with the Dirichlet variational principle is achieved considering that the asymptotic structure of asymptotically locally AdS spacetimes relates the tangential and radial derivatives of the field. Crucially, as seen from a path integral definition of the bulk partition function involved in the standard GKPW formula, this relation is valid beyond the saddle. We find that the extrinsic renormalization prescription is maximally efficient when the scalar field is massless, which is suggestive of a connection with the Kounterterm method for renormalization of pure gravity.</description>

      <title>On 5D Black Brane Stabilities from M-theory on Three Parameter Calabi-Yau Threefolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15937v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we reconsider the study of 5D black branes in M-theory compactifications by means of $\mathcal{N}=2$ supergravity formalism. Precisely, we provide a model relaying on a three parameter Calabi-Yau manifold in the $\mathbb{P}^{1}\times\mathbb{P}^{1}\times\mathbb{P}^{2}$ projective space factorization, referred to as economical model. First, we investigate the stability of 5D BPS and non-BPS black holes obtained from wrapped M2-branes on non-holomorphic two-cycles in such a Calabi-Yau manifold. Then, we approach the stability of 5D black strings derived from wrapped M5-branes on non-holomorphic four-cycles. Among others, we find various stable and unstable black brane solutions depending on the charge regions of the involved moduli space.</description>

      <title>Non-hyperbolic 3-manifolds and 3D field theories for 2D Virasoro minimal models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16377v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using 3D-3D correspondence, we construct 3D dual bulk field theories for general Virasoro minimal models $M(P,Q)$. These theories correspond to Seifert fiber spaces $S^2 ((P,P-R),(Q,S),(3,1))$ with two integers $(R,S)$ satisfying $PS-QR =1$. In the unitary case, where $|P-Q|=1$, the bulk theory has a mass gap and flows to a unitary topological field theory (TQFT) in the IR, which is expected to support the chiral Virasoro minimal model at the boundary under an appropriate boundary condition. For the non-unitary case, where $|P-Q|&gt;1$, the bulk theory flows to a 3D $\mathcal{N}=4$ rank-0 superconformal field theory, whose topologically twisted theory supports the chiral minimal model at the boundary. We also provide a concrete field theory description of the 3D bulk theory using $T[SU(2)]$ theories. Our proposals are supported by various consistency checks using 3D-3D relations and direct computations of various partition functions.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Calabi-Yau four folds with hybrid and recurrent neural network architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17406v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we report the results of applying deep learning based on hybrid convolutional-recurrent and purely recurrent neural network architectures to the dataset of almost one million complete intersection Calabi-Yau four-folds (CICY4) to machine-learn their four Hodge numbers $h^{1,1}, h^{2,1}, h^{3,1}, h^{2,2}$. In particular, we explored and experimented with twelve different neural network models, nine of which are convolutional-recurrent (CNN-RNN) hybrids with the RNN unit being either GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) or Long Short Term Memory (LSTM). The remaining four models are purely recurrent neural networks based on LSTM. In terms of the $h^{1,1}, h^{2,1}, h^{3,1}, h^{2,2}$ prediction accuracies, at 72% training ratio, our best performing individual model is CNN-LSTM-400, a hybrid CNN-LSTM with the LSTM hidden size of 400, which obtained 99.74%, 98.07%, 95.19%, 81.01%, our second best performing individual model is LSTM-448, an LSTM-based model with the hidden size of 448, which obtained 99.74%, 97.51%, 94.24%, and 78.63%. These results were improved by forming ensembles of the top two, three or even four models. Our best ensemble, consisting of the top four models, achieved the accuracies of 99.84%, 98.71%, 96.26%, 85.03%. At 80% training ratio, the top two performing models LSTM-448 and LSTM-424 are both LSTM-based with the hidden sizes of 448 and 424. Compared with the 72% training ratio, there is a significant improvement of accuracies, which reached 99.85%, 98.66%, 96.26%, 84.77% for the best individual model and 99.90%, 99.03%, 97.97%, 87.34% for the best ensemble.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves and tadpole resummation: Efficient and easy convergence of finite temperature QFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.08218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.08218v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate analytically and numerically that "optimized partial dressing" (OPD) thermal mass resummation, which uses gap equation solutions inserted into the tadpole, efficiently tames finite-temperature perturbation theory calculations of the effective thermal potential, without necessitating use of the high-temperature approximation. An analytical estimate of the scale dependence for OPD resummation, standard Parwani resummation (Daisy resummation), and dimensional reduction shows that OPD has similar scale dependence to dimensional reduction, greatly improving Parwani resummation. We also elucidate how to construct and solve the gap equation for realistic numerical calculations, and demonstrate OPD's improved accuracy for a toy scalar model. OPD's improved accuracy is most physically significant when the high-temperature approximation breaks down, rendering dimensional reduction unusable and Parwani resummation highly inaccurate, with the latter underestimating the maximal gravitational wave amplitude for the model by 2 orders of magnitude compared to OPD. Our work highlights the need to bring theoretical uncertainties under control even when analyzing broad features of a model. Given the simplicity of the OPD compared to two-loop dimensional reduction, as well as the ease with which this scheme handles departures from the high-temperature expansion, we argue this scheme has great potential in analyzing the parameter space of realistic beyond the Standard Model models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.07458v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Regular black holes are generically unstable because of the classical phenomenon that goes by the name of "mass inflation" which destabilizes the inner horizon. In a recent article, [Phys.Rev.D~107~(2023)~2,~024005], it is argued that semiclassical effects due to Hawking radiation can cure this instability, and some concerns are raised against the validity of previous analyses showing its existence in the first place. In this short comment, we explain our reservations regarding these recent claims, and reiterate the relevance of the mass inflation instability for regular black holes of astrophysical interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.03478v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A general organizing principle is proposed that can be used to derive the equations of motion describing the near-equilibrium dynamics of causal and thermodynamically stable relativistic systems. The latter are found to display some new type of universal behavior near equilibrium that allows them to be grouped into universality classes defined by their degrees of freedom, information content, and conservation laws. The universality classes expose a number of surprising equivalences between different theories, shedding new light on the near-equilibrium behavior of relativistic systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.05332v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using a formalism that was recently developed in a companion paper, we rigorously prove the equivalence, in the linear regime, of a number of apparently different relativistic hydrodynamic theories proposed in the literature. In particular, we show that Hydro+ is indistinguishable from the Israel-Stewart theory for bulk viscosity, which in turn is indistinguishable from a reacting mixture. The two-fluid model for superfluidity coincides with the Israel-Stewart theory for heat conduction in the limit of infinite conductivity, and this explains why the latter has a second sound. Also, MIS$^*$ is equivalent to the Burgers model for viscoelasticity, and this implies that the former must exhibit an elastic behavior at high frequencies. Additionally, we show that if the degrees of freedom and the conservation laws of a hydrodynamic theory have the same geometric character as those of the Israel-Stewart theory, then such theory must be indistinguishable from the Israel-Stewart theory in the linear regime. This explains why all second-order theories turn out to be identical near equilibrium. Finally, we construct the first linearized model for a relativistic supersolid that is proven to be causal, stable, and strongly hyperbolic.</description>

      <title>Schr\"odinger as a Quantum Programmer: Estimating Entanglement via Steering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.07911v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantifying entanglement is an important task by which the resourcefulness of a quantum state can be measured. Here, we develop a quantum algorithm that tests for and quantifies the separability of a general bipartite state by using the quantum steering effect, the latter initially discovered by Schr\"odinger. Our separability test consists of a distributed quantum computation involving two parties: a computationally limited client, who prepares a purification of the state of interest, and a computationally unbounded server, who tries to steer the reduced systems to a probabilistic ensemble of pure product states. To design a practical algorithm, we replace the role of the server with a combination of parameterized unitary circuits and classical optimization techniques to perform the necessary computation. The result is a variational quantum steering algorithm (VQSA), a modified separability test that is implementable on quantum computers that are available today. We then simulate our VQSA on noisy quantum simulators and find favorable convergence properties on the examples tested. We also develop semidefinite programs, executable on classical computers, that benchmark the results obtained from our VQSA. Thus, our findings provide a meaningful connection between steering, entanglement, quantum algorithms, and quantum computational complexity theory. They also demonstrate the value of a parameterized mid-circuit measurement in a VQSA.</description>

      <title>Solving Conformal Defects in 3D Conformal Field Theory using Fuzzy Sphere Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.01903v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Defects in conformal field theory (CFT) are of significant theoretical and experimental importance. The presence of defects theoretically enriches the structure of the CFT, but at the same time, it makes it more challenging to study, especially in dimensions higher than two. Here, we demonstrate that the recently-developed theoretical scheme, \textit{fuzzy (non-commutative) sphere regularization}, provides a powerful lens through which one can dissect the defect of 3D CFTs in a transparent way. As a notable example, we study the magnetic line defect of 3D Ising CFT and clearly demonstrate that it flows to a conformal defect fixed point. We have identified 6 low-lying defect primary operators, including the displacement operator, and accurately extract their scaling dimensions through the state-operator correspondence. Moreover, we also compute one-point bulk correlators and two-point bulk-defect correlators, which show great agreement with predictions of defect conformal symmetry, and from which we extract various bulk-defect operator product expansion coefficients. Our work demonstrates that the fuzzy sphere offers a powerful tool for exploring the rich physics in 3D defect CFTs.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes without fine-tuning from a light stochastic spectator field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04174v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a mechanism of primordial black hole (PBH) formation that avoids any dependence on specific inflationary features or exotic physics. In this scenario, the required large curvature fluctuations leading to PBH formation are generated after inflation by the quantum fluctuations of a light stochastic spectator field during inflation, when this field transiently dominates the energy density. We calculate the dynamics of such a spectator field during and after inflation, the distribution of induced curvature perturbations and their non-Gaussian tails leading to the copious production of PBHs. For a plateau-like potential, this scenario produces an extended PBH mass distribution with a peak at the solar-mass scale when one takes into account the effects of the thermal history. What is remarkable in this scenario is the absence of parameter fine-tuning. Instead, it invokes an anthropic selection over all the realizations of PBH abundances predicted by the field stochasticity. This scenario offers a novel perspective for the formation of PBHs with minimal ingredients and without the need of fine-tuning. It is amenable to observational tests, notably with the gravitational-wave observations of black hole mergers and of a background at nanoHertz frequency, as recently observed by pulsar timing arrays.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-scalar meson spectral properties in the chiral crossover region of QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.13476v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Determining the type of excitations that can exist in a thermal medium is key to understanding how hadronic matter behaves at extreme temperatures. In this work we study this question for pseudo-scalar mesons comprised of light-strange and strange-strange quarks, analysing how their low-energy spectral properties are modified as one passes through the high-temperature chiral crossover region between $T=145.6 \, \text{MeV}$ and $172.3 \, \text{MeV}$. We utilise the non-perturbative constraints satisfied by correlation functions at finite temperature in order to extract the low-energy meson spectral function contributions from spatial correlator lattice data in $N_{f}=2+1$ flavour QCD. The robustness of these contributions are tested by comparing their predictions with data for the corresponding temporal correlator at different momentum values. We find that around the pseudo-critical temperature $T_{\text{pc}}$ the data in both the light-strange and strange-strange channels is consistent with the presence of a distinct stable particle-like ground state component, a so-called thermoparticle excitation. As the temperature increases this excitation undergoes collisional broadening, and this is qualitatively the same in both channels. These findings suggest that pseudo-scalar mesons in QCD have a bound-state-like structure at low energies within the chiral crossover region which is still strongly influenced by the vacuum states of the theory.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping entanglement in quantum spin systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16503v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we employ the bootstrap method, a technique that relies on consistency relations instead of direct diagonalization, to determine the expectation values in quantum many-body systems. We then use these values to assess the entanglement content of the system. Our work extends the bootstrap approach to quantum many-body systems, rather than single-body or few-body systems, concentrating on the well-known Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick (LMG) model with both transverse and longitudinal external magnetic fields. In the bootstrap method we solve the LMG model with up to 16 sites. Unlike previous studies that have focused mainly on ground-state properties, our methodology allows for the calculation of a broad range of properties, including energy spectrum, angular momentum, concurrence, tangle, residual tangle, and quantum Fisher information (QFI), for all eigenstates or a particular sector of the eigenstates, without referring to the explicit wavefunctions of these states. We show that this approach offers not only a new computational methodology but also a comprehensive view of both bipartite and multipartite entanglement properties across the entire spectrum of eigenstates. Specifically, we demonstrate that states typically found in the central region of the spectrum exhibit greater multipartite entanglement, as indicated by larger QFI values, compared to states at the edges of the spectrum. In contrast, concurrence displays the opposite trend. This observed behavior is in line with the monogamy principle governing quantum entanglement.</description>

Abstract: The hadronic vacuum polarization contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of a lepton is considered as a function of the lepton mass. We show how the analyticity properties of this function allow for its full reconstruction when it is only known in a restricted mass region. Assuming that LQCD could evaluate it in an optimal mass region we show, within the framework of a phenomenological model, how to reconstruct the function elsewhere, in particular at the muon mass value.</description>

      <title>Are $f(R, {\rm Matter})$ theories really relevant to cosmology?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12925v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine $f(R, \text{Matter})$ theories that directly couple the curvature $R$ or $R_{\mu\nu}$ with the matter sector in the action, in addition to the universal coupling. We argue that if the matter sector includes the Standard Model (SM), such theories are either inconsistent or already excluded by experiments unless they are a rewriting of $f(R)$ gravity or general relativity. If these theories genuinely couple the SM to curvature, they suffer from the presence of ghost states at energies within their domain of application for cosmological purposes. Therefore, we raise questions about their relevance to cosmology. Moreover, if such theories do not include the SM, they should just be seen as scalar-tensor, vector-tensor, ..., theories, depending on the additional degrees of freedom. They should thus be studied accordingly.}</description>

Abstract: We investigate the viability of primordial black hole (PBH) formation in the Standard Model (SM) in a scenario that does not rely on specific inflationary features or any exotic physics such as phase transitions or non-minimal coupling to gravity. If the Brout-Englert-Higgs (BEH) field lies exactly at the transition between metastability and stability, its potential exhibits an inflexion point due to radiative corrections. The BEH can act like a stochastic curvaton field, leading to a non-Gaussian tail of large curvature fluctuations that later collapse into PBHs when they re-enter inside the horizon. This scenario would require a precise value of the top-quark mas to ensure the Higgs stability, which is disfavored but still consistent with the most recent measurements. However, we also find that large curvature fluctuations are also generated on cosmological scales that are inconsistent with cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations. We therefore conclude that the SM cannot have led to the formation of PBHs based on this mechanism. Nevertheless, a variation of the scenario based on the Palatini formulation of gravity may have provided the conditions to produce stellar-mass PBHs with an abundance comparable to dark matter, without producing too large curvature fluctuations on cosmological scales.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15552v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present for the first time a Friedmann-like construction in the framework of an osculating Finsler-Randers-Sasaki geometry. In particular, we consider a vector field in the metric on a Lorentz tangent bundle, and thus the curvatures of horizontal and vertical spaces, as well as the extra contributions of torsion and non-linear connection, provide an intrinsic richer geometrical structure, with additional degrees of freedom, that lead to extra terms in the field equations. Applying these modified field equations at a cosmological setup we extract the generalized Friedmann equations for the horizontal and vertical space, showing that we obtain an effective dark energy sector arising from the richer underlying structure of the tangent bundle. Additionally, as it is common in Finsler-like constructions, we obtain an effective interaction between matter and geometry. Finally, we consider a specific model and we show that it can describe the sequence of matter and dark-energy epochs, and that the dark-energy equation of state can lie in the quintessence or phantom regimes, or cross the phantom divide.</description>

      <title>Holomorphic gravity and its regularization of Locally Signed Coordinate Invariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00140v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We expect the final theory of gravity to have more symmetries than we suspect and our research points in this direction. To start with, standard general coordinate invariance can be extended to complex holomorphic general coordinate transformations. This is possible by introducing a non Riemannian Measure of integration (NRMI) and where we avoid the non holomorphic standard
  $\sqrt{-g}$ measure of integration. Second, locally signed coordinate transformations where the Jacobian changes sign locally but the Jacobian approaches one asymptotically should be symmetries of Nature. This is unlike globally signed transformations that produce a change of boundary conditions, like in the cases of global parity and global time reversal, which are not symmetries of Nature. The holomorphic extension can regularize the regions of space time where the Jacobian changes sign. Consequences for Quantum Gravity are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07969v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A canonical formalism for quantum electrodynamics in curved spacetime is developed. This formalism enables a systematic investigation of photons in the Schwarzschild gravitational field, yielding novel results as well as refining previous results that were predicted by heuristic methods. The claim that "the gravitational redshift is a shift in the sharp frequencies of the photons for all frequencies of the spectrum" is proved. It is shown the gravitational decoherence is due to photon-gravity coupling and observer-dependent quantum electrodynamics in curved spacetime phenomena. The proper value of the photon gravitational interferometric relative phase shift is calculated and its full quantum-general relativistic nature is demonstrated. It is shown its observation will falsify the validity of Newtonian gravity and the extension of the Einstein equivalence principle beyond a single point (even in the weak uniform gravitational field.)</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07980v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scalar-tensor theories have a long history as possible phenomenological alternatives to General Relativity, but are known to potentially produce deviations from the (strong) equivalence principle in systems involving self-gravitating objects, as a result of the presence of an additional gravitational scalar field besides the tensor modes of General Relativity. We describe here a novel mechanism whereby the equivalence principle is violated for an isolated rotating neutron star, if the gravitational scalar field is changing in time far from the system. We show that the neutron star rotational period changes due to an effective coupling ("angular momentum sensitivity") to the gravitational scalar, and compute that coupling for viable equations of state for nuclear matter. We comment on the relevance of our findings for testing scalar-tensor theories and models of ultralight dark matter with pulsar timing observations, a topic that we tackle in a companion paper.</description>

      <title>Condensate-Induced Inflation from Primordial Gravitational Waves in String-Inspired Chern-Simons Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09005v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we elaborate further on a cosmological model of inflation that characterises Chern-Simons (CS) gravity models inspired from string theory. Such models are known to belong to the class of the so-called String-Inspired Running Vacuum Cosmologies. In particular, by applying methods of dynamical systems, commonly used in scalar-field cosmology, we examine in detail, for the first time, the passage from a pre-inflationary era dominated by a stiff-axion-matter equation of state, characteristic of the model, to inflation of Running Vacuum Model (RVM) type. By a careful discussion of the formation of the condensate of the CS gravitational anomaly term, induced by populations of primordial gravitational waves at the end of the stiff-axion-matter era, we show that an effectively linear axion-monodromy potential arises. This eventually causes the transition from the matter to the RVM inflation. By taking into account terms that have previously been ignored in the relevant literature of weak-graviton quantisation, we show that the effect of such terms is to diminish the value of the condensate by half, remaining however in the same order of magnitude. This, in turn, implies that the qualitative conclusions of previous works on the subject remain valid. Moreover, on assuming the approximate cosmic-time independence of the gravitational-CS condensate, we also provide an estimate of the number of sources of the primordial gravitational waves, upon the requirement of respecting the transplanckian conjecture.</description>

      <title>Measurement-only dynamical phase transition of topological and boundary order in toric code and gauge-Higgs models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13435v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extensively study long-time dynamics and fate of topologically-ordered state in toric code model evolving through projective measurement-only circuit. The circuit is composed of several measurement operators corresponding to each term of toric code Hamiltonian with magnetic-field perturbations, which is a gauge-fixed version of a (2+1)-dimensional gauge-Higgs model. We employ a cylinder geometry with distinct upper and lower boundaries to classify stationary states after long-time measurement dynamics. The appearing stationary states depend on measurement probabilities for each measurement operator. The Higgs, confined and deconfined phases emerge in the time evolution by the circuit. We find that both Higgs and confined phases are separated from the deconfined phase by topological entanglement entropy. We numerically clarify that both Higgs and confined phases are characterized by a long-range order on the boundaries accompanying edge modes, and they shift with each other by a crossover reflecting properties in the bulk phase diagram.</description>

      <title>Bipartite Sachdev-Ye Models with Read-Saleur Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15270v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce an SU(M)-symmetric disordered bipartite spin model with unusual characteristics. Although superficially similar to the Sachdev-Ye model, it has several markedly different properties for M&gt;2. In particular, it has a large non-trivial nullspace whose dimension grows exponentially with system size. The states in this nullspace are frustration-free, and are ground states when the interactions are ferromagnetic. The exponential growth of the nullspace leads to Hilbert-space fragmentation and a violation of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. We demonstrate that the commutant algebra responsible for this fragmentation is a non-trivial subalgebra of the Read-Saleur commutant algebra of certain nearest-neighbour models such as the spin-1 biquadratic spin chain. We also discuss the low-energy behaviour of correlations for the disordered version of this model in the limit of a large number of spins and large M, using techniques similar to those applied to the SY model. We conclude by generalizing the Shiraishi-Mori embedding formalism to non-local models, and apply it to turn some of our nullspace states into quantum many-body scars.</description>

      <title>Mechanisms for producing Primordial Black Holes from Inflationary Models Beyond Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14321v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we present an analysis of the fine-tuning required in various inflationary models in order to explain the production of Primordial Black Holes (PBHs). We specifically examine the degree of fine-tuning necessary in two prominent single field inflationary models: those with an inflection point and those with step-like features in the potential. Our findings indicate that models with step-like features generally require less fine-tuning compared to those with an inflection point, making them more viable for consistent PBH production. An interesting outcome of these models is that, in addition to improved fine-tuning, they may also predict low-frequency signals that can be detected by pulsar timing array (PTA) collaborations. Additionally, we extend our analysis to multifield inflationary models to assess whether the integration of additional fields can further alleviate the fine-tuning demands. The study also explores the role of a spectator field and its impact on the fine-tuning process. Through a comparative analysis across these models, we evaluate their parametric sensitivities and alignment with the constraints from Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) observations. Our results indicate that although mechanisms involving a spectator field can circumvent the issue of fine-tuning parameters for PBH production, both multifield models and models with step-like features present promising alternatives. While fine-tuning involves multiple considerations, our primary objective is to evaluate various inflationary models to identify the one that most naturally explains the formation of PBHs. Hence, this study aims to the development of less constrained inflationary scenarios that align with observational data and support the theoretical possibility of PBH production.</description>

      <title>Holography for Sp(2$N_c$) Gauge Dynamics: from Composite Higgs to Technicolour</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14480v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study Sp(2$N_c$) gauge dynamics with two Dirac fermion flavours in the fundamental representation. These strongly coupled systems underlie some composite Higgs models with a global symmetry breaking pattern SU(4)$\rightarrow$Sp(4), leading to a light quartet of pseudo-Goldstone bosons that can play the role of the Higgs. Including four-fermion interactions can rotate the vacuum to a technicolour breaking pattern. Using gauge/gravity duality, we study the underlying gauge dynamics. Our model incorporates the $N_c$-specific running of the fermion anomalous dimension and can thus distinguish between specific gauge groups. We determine the bound-state spectrum of the UV SU(4)$\rightarrow$Sp(4) symmetry breaking model, also including fermion masses and mass splitting, and display the $N_c$ dependence. The inclusion of a four-fermion interaction shows the emergence of three Goldstone bosons on the path to technicolour dynamics.</description>

      <title>Double Inflation in Classically Conformal $B-L$ Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10537v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has recently been shown in Ref. [1] that the double-inflation scenario based on the Coleman-Weinberg potential can successfully generate primordial black holes (PBHs) with the inflationary predictions consistent with the Planck measurements. These PBHs can play the role of dark matter in our universe. In this paper, we propose the classically conformal minimal $B-L$ model as an ultra-violet (UV) completion of the scenario. In our model, the $B-L$ Higgs field is identified with the inflaton and the electroweak symmetry breaking is triggered by the radiative $B-L$ symmetry breaking with the Coleman-Weinberg potential. We show that this UV completion leads to a viable cosmological history after the double inflaton: the universe is reheated via inflaton decay into right-handed neutrinos whose mass is determined consistently by a relation between the number of e-folds and reheating temperature. Using the general parameterization for neutrino Dirac Yukawa couplings through the seesaw mechanism and the neutrino oscillation data, we also show that the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe is successfully reproduced by either resonant leptogenesis or non-thermal leptogenesis. Based on the scalar power spectrum shown in Ref. [1], we evaluate the scalar induced gravitational wave spectrum, which can be tested by various proposed gravitational wave observatories like BBO, DECIGO etc.</description>

      <title>Comparing sharp and smooth transitions of the second slow-roll parameter in single-field inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12145v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In single-field inflation, violation of the slow-roll approximation can lead to growth of curvature perturbation outside the horizon. This violation is characterized by a period with a large negative value of the second slow-roll parameter. At an early time, inflation must satisfy the slow-roll approximation, so the large-scale curvature perturbation can explain the cosmic microwave background fluctuations. At intermediate time, it is viable to have a theory that violates the slow-roll approximation, which implies amplification of the curvature perturbation on small scales. Specifically, we consider ultraslow-roll inflation as the intermediate period. At late time, inflation should go back to the slow roll period so that it can end. This means that there are two transitions of the second slow-roll parameter. In this paper, we compare two different possibilities for the second transition: sharp and smooth transitions. Focusing on effects generated by the relevant cubic self-interaction of the curvature perturbation, we find that the bispectrum and one-loop correction to the power spectrum due to the change of the second slow-roll parameter vanish if and only if the Mukhanov-Sasaki equation for perturbation satisfies a specific condition called Wands duality. We also find in the case of sharp transition that, even though this duality is satisfied in the ultraslow-roll and slow-roll phases, it is severely violated at the transition so that the resultant one-loop correction is extremely large inversely proportional to the duration of the transition.</description>

      <title>Generating large primordial fluctuations in single-field inflation for PBH formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12149v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In order to produce appreciable amount of primordial black holes (PBHs), the square amplitude of curvature perturbation must take a large value of $\mathcal{O}(0.01)$, namely, seven digits larger than the value observed by cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB) on large scales. Such a large fluctuation can be achieved by violating the slow-roll (SR) condition within a short duration. The best known of such possibilities is the ultraslow-roll (USR) inflation. We calculate the power spectrum of curvature perturbation in a simple single-field inflation model which evolves through the SR-USR-SR regimes so that both large-amplitude small-scale fluctuation for PBH formation and small-amplitude large-scale fluctuation as observed by CMB are realized. We further calculate the bispectrum and one-loop correction to the power spectrum induced by the third-order action of curvature perturbation as the beginning of precision cosmology on small scales. As a result, we show that single-field inflation model realizing PBH formation can be constrained by the quantum correction.</description>
