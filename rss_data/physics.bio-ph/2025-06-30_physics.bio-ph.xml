      <title>PlanTUS: A heuristic tool for prospective planning of transcranial ultrasound transducer placements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-intensity focused transcranial ultrasonic stimulation (TUS) offers unique depth and precision in non-invasive brain stimulation. Effective administration of TUS, however, requires precise placement of transducers to ensure selective neural target exposure and engagement. This process is constrained by individual skull anatomy, hardware limitations, as well as computational and time costs of running exhaustive acoustic simulations to optimize transducer placement. To address these challenges, we introduce PlanTUS, a fast, open-source tool designed to heuristically identify feasible transducer positions, accounting for individual anatomical and hardware constraints. It visualizes relevant metrics on the scalp, such as target accessibility, required transducer tilt, and skull thickness, allowing users to identify and export potential transducer positions compatible with both acoustic simulation and neuronavigation software. In addition to individualized planning, PlanTUS facilitates feasibility evaluations during study planning, offering practical utility to researchers seeking to optimize TUS delivery with greater efficiency and precision.</description>

      <title>Optimizing information transmission in the canonical Wnt pathway</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Populations of cells regulate gene expression in response to external signals, but their ability to make reliable collective decisions is limited by both intrinsic noise in molecular signaling and variability between individual cells. In this work, we use optogenetic control of the canonical Wnt pathway as an example to study how reliably information about an external signal is transmitted to a population of cells, and determine an optimal encoding strategy to maximize information transmission from Wnt signals to gene expression. We find that it is possible to reach an information capacity beyond 1 bit only through an appropriate, discrete encoding of signals. By averaging over an increasing number of outputs, we systematically vary the effective noise in the pathway. As the effective noise decreases, the optimal encoding comprises more discrete input signals. These signals do not need to be fine-tuned. The optimal code transitions into a continuous code in the small-noise limit, which can be shown to be consistent with the Jeffreys prior. We visualize the performance of signal encodings using decoding maps. Our results suggest optogenetic Wnt signaling allows for regulatory control beyond a simple binary switch, and provides a framework to apply ideas from information processing to single-cell in vitro experiments.</description>

      <title>Thermal-phototactic bioconvection in a forward scattering algal suspension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bioconvection induced by phototaxis and thermal gradients in an anisotropic (forward) scattering algal suspension is investigated in this article. The suspension is illuminated by collimated irradiation from above and heated either from top or bottom. The linear theory is deployed on the steady state of the proposed bioconvective system and resulting eigen value problem is solved using fourth-order accurate finite-difference scheme based on Newton-Raphson-Kantorovich iteration. The results indicate that the forward scattering and heating from above (or cooling from below) in an algal suspension enhance bioconvective stability. On the other hand, heating from below enhance bioconvective instability for a fixed forward scattering coefficient.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phototaxis, the process by which living organisms navigate toward optimal light conditions, is essential for motile photosynthetic microorganisms. Positive(negative) phototaxis denotes the motion directed towards(away from) the source of illumination. The main objective of this study is the numerical investigation of onset of bioconvection in a suspension of phototactic microorganisms illuminated by oblique collimated irradiation at the top. In this suspension, the algal cells absorb and anisotropically scatter incident light which influences the flow dynamics of the cells.</description>

      <title>What if each voxel were measured with a different diffusion protocol?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Expansion of diffusion MRI (dMRI) both into the realm of strong gradients, and into accessible imaging with portable low-field devices, brings about the challenge of gradient nonlinearities. Spatial variations of the diffusion gradients make diffusion weightings and directions non-uniform across the field of view, and deform perfect shells in the q-space designed for isotropic directional coverage. Such imperfections hinder parameter estimation: Anisotropic shells hamper the deconvolution of fiber orientation distribution function (fODF), while brute-force retraining of a nonlinear regressor for each unique set of directions and diffusion weightings is computationally inefficient. Here we propose a protocol-independent parameter estimation (PIPE) method that enables fast parameter estimation for the most general case where the scan in each voxel is acquired with a different protocol in q-space. PIPE applies for any spherical convolution-based dMRI model, irrespective of its complexity, which makes it suitable both for white and gray matter in the brain or spinal cord, and for other tissues where fiber bundles have the same properties within a voxel (fiber response), but are distributed with an arbitrary fODF. In vivo human MRI experiments on a high-performance system show that PIPE can map fiber response and fODF parameters for the whole brain in the presence of significant gradient nonlinearities in under 3 minutes. PIPE enables fast parameter estimation in the presence of arbitrary gradient nonlinearities, eliminating the need to arrange dMRI in shells or to retrain the estimator for different protocols in each voxel. PIPE applies for any model based on a convolution of a voxel-wise fiber response and fODF, and data from varying b-tensor shapes, diffusion/echo times, and other scan parameters.</description>

      <title>Protein Drift-Diffusion in Membranes with Non-equilibrium Fluctuations arising from Gradients in Concentration or Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate proteins within heterogeneous cell membranes where non-equilibrium phenomena arises from spatial variations in concentration and temperature. We develop simulation methods building on non-equilibrium statistical mechanics to obtain stochastic hybrid continuum-discrete descriptions which track individual protein dynamics, spatially varying concentration fluctuations, and thermal exchanges. We investigate biological mechanisms for protein positioning and patterning within membranes and factors in thermal gradient sensing. We also study the kinetics of Brownian motion of particles with temperature variations within energy landscapes arising from heterogeneous microstructures within membranes. The introduced approaches provide self-consistent models for studying biophysical mechanisms involving the drift-diffusion dynamics of individual proteins and energy exchanges and fluctuations between the thermal and mechanical parts of the system. The methods also can be used for studying related non-equilibrium effects in other biological systems and soft materials.</description>

      <title>Actively induced supercoiling can slow down plasmid solutions by trapping the threading entanglements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Harnessing the topology of ring polymers as a design motif in functional nanomaterials is becoming a promising direction in the field of soft matter. For example, the ring topology of DNA plasmids prevents the relaxation of excess twist introduced to the polymer, instead resulting in helical supercoiled structures. In equilibrium semi-dilute solutions, tightly supercoiled rings relax faster than their torsionally relaxed counterparts, since the looser conformations of the latter allow for rings to thread through each other and entrain via entanglements. Here we use molecular simulations to explore a non-equilibrium scenario, in which a supercoiling agent, akin to gyrase enzymes, rapidly induces supercoiling in the suspensions of relaxed plasmids. The activity of the agent not only alters the conformational topology from open to branched, but also locks-in threaded rings into supramolecular clusters, which relax very slowly. Ultimately, our work shows how the polymer topology under non-equilibrium conditions can be leveraged to tune dynamic behavior of macromolecular systems, suggesting a pathway to novel class of driven materials glassified by activity.</description>

      <title>Bacteria optimize tumble bias to strategically navigate surface constraints</title>

Abstract: In natural environments, solid surfaces present both opportunities and challenges for bacteria. On one hand, they serve as platforms for biofilm formation, crucial for bacterial colonization and resilience in harsh conditions. On the other hand, surfaces can entrap bacteria for extended periods and force them to swim along circular trajectories, constraining their environmental exploration compared to the freedom they experience in the bulk liquid. Here, through systematic single-cell behavioral measurements, phenomenological modeling, and theoretical analysis, we reveal how bacteria strategically navigate these factors. We observe that bacterial surface residence time decreases sharply with increasing tumble bias from zero, transitioning to a plateau at the mean tumble bias of wild-type Escherichia coli (~ 0.25). Furthermore, we find that bacterial surface diffusivity peaks near this mean tumble bias. Considering the phenotypic variation in bacterial tumble bias, which is primarily induced by noise in gene expression, this reflects a strategy for bacterial offspring persistence: In the absence of stimulus cues, some bacteria swiftly escape from the nearby surface in case it lacks nutrients, while others, with longer surface residence times, explore this two-dimensional environment most efficiently to find potential livable sites.</description>

      <title>Landscapes and nonequilibrium fluctuations of eukaryotic gene regulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10067v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the interplay among processes that occur over different timescales is a challenging issue in the physics of systems regulation. In gene regulation, the timescales for changes in chromatin states can differ from those for changes in the concentration of product protein, raising questions about how to understand their coupled dynamics. In this study, we examine the effects of these different timescales on eukaryotic gene regulation using a stochastic model that describes the landscapes and probability currents of nonequilibrium fluctuations.This model shows that slow, nonadiabatic transitions of chromatin states significantly impact gene-regulation dynamics. The simulated circular flow of the probability currents indicates a maximum entropy production when the rates of chromatin-state transitions are low in the intensely nonadiabatic regime. In the mildly nonadiabatic regime, this circular flow fosters hysteresis, suggesting that changes in chromatin states precede changes in transcription activity. Furthermore, calculations using a model of a circuit involving three core genes in mouse embryonic stem cells illustrate how the timescale difference can tune fluctuations in individual genes. These findings highlight the rich effects of nonadiabatic chromatin-state transitions on gene regulation in eukaryotic cells.</description>

      <title>Multiparticle Collision Dynamics Simulations of the Flagellar Apparatus in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20553v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using multiparticle collision dynamics simulations, we investigate the swimming dynamics, orientational behavior, and hydrodynamic interactions of a model swimmer designed to mimic the isolated flagellar apparatus ($FA$) of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. We represent the $FA$ as a chain of monomers connected by elastic springs, with two traveling waves originating at its center and propagating in opposite directions along the chain. Our simulations show that an $FA$ whose beat pattern has non-zero mean curvature sustains ballistic motion for several hundred beats before transitioning to a diffusion-dominated regime via rotational diffusion. In contrast, a flagellar apparatus with zero mean curvature ($FA_0$) -- generates mirror-symmetric deformations and fails to achieve net propulsion. Both the active $FA$ and $FA_0$ exhibit orientational autocorrelation functions that decay exponentially -- matching those of their inactive counterparts -- indicating that active beating does not influence the FA's rotational diffusion. Driving the two flagellar arms at different frequencies reproduces the epitrochoid-like trajectory observed experimentally. Finally, hydrodynamic interactions between two $FA$s give rise to co-moving bound pairs in either parallel or antiparallel configurations, with their stability governed by the phase difference of the curvature waves. Together, our results establish a versatile model microswimmer with tunable dynamics -- offering a blueprint for the rational design of artificial, flagella-driven microswimmers. </description>

      <title>Incremental dynamics of prestressed viscoelastic solids and its applications in shear wave elastography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04745v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Shear wave elastography (SWE) is a promising imaging modality for mechanical characterization of tissues, offering biomarkers with potential for early and precise diagnosis. While various methods have been developed to extract mechanical parameters from shear wave characteristics, their relationships in viscoelastic materials under prestress remain poorly understood. Here, we present a generalized incremental dynamics theory for finite-strain viscoelastic solids. The theory derives small-amplitude viscoelastic wave motions in a material under static pre-stress. The formalism is compatible with a range of existing constitutive models, including both hyperelasticity and viscoelasticity--such as the combination of Gasser-Ogden-Holzapfel (GOH) and Kelvin-Voigt fractional derivative (KVFD) models used in this study. We validate the theory through experiments and numerical simulations on prestressed soft materials and biological tissues, using both optical coherence elastography and ultrasound elastography. The theoretical predictions closely match experimental dispersion curves over a broad frequency range and accurately capture the effect of prestress. Furthermore, the framework reveals the relationships among shear wave phase velocity, attenuation, and principal stresses, enabling prestress quantification in viscoelastic solids without prior knowledge of constitutive parameters. This generalized acousto-viscoelastic formalism is particularly well-suited for high-frequency, high-resolution SWE in tissues under prestress.</description>

Abstract: Microphase separation is common in active biological systems as exemplified by the separation of RNA and DNA-rich phases in the cell nucleus driven by the transcriptional activity of polymerase enzymes acting similarly to amphiphiles in a microemulsion. Here we propose an analytically tractable model of an active microemulsion to investigate how the activity affects its structure and relaxation dynamics. Continuum theory derived from a lattice model exhibits two distinct regimes of the relaxation dynamics and is linked to the broken detailed balance due to intermittent activity of the amphiphiles.</description>

      <title>A universal hydrodynamic transition in confined marine invertebrate larvae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11744v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ocean is teeming with a myriad of mm-sized invertebrate planktonic larvae, which thrive in a viscous fluid environment. Many of them rely on ciliary beating to generate fluid flows for locomotion and feeding. Their larval forms, local morphologies, and ciliation patterns exhibit remarkable diversity, producing intricate and dynamic 3D flows that are notoriously difficult to characterize in laboratory settings. Traditional microscopic imaging techniques typically involve gently squeeze-confining the soft larvae between a glass slide and cover slip to study their flows in quasi-2D. However, a comprehensive hydrodynamic framework for the low-to-intermediate Reynolds number (&lt;1) flows in quasi-2D confinement, particularly in light of their complex forms, has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate that vortices around larvae proliferate with increasing confinement and illuminate the underlying physical mechanism. We experimentally quantify confinement-induced flows in larvae of sea stars and sea urchins. The flows exhibited strikingly universal patterns: under weak confinement, all larvae generated two vortices, whereas under strong confinement, the number of generated vortices significantly increased. The experimental observations were well captured by a low Reynolds number theoretical model based on the superposition of confined Stokeslets. Building on experiments and theory, we developed a comprehensive framework for confinement-induced flows, which suggests that vorticity dynamics are primarily determined by local morphological features, rather than solely the body plan. Our work provides fundamental insights into form-functional relationships between larval morphology and flow generation. Our findings are broadly applicable to understanding flows generated by a wide range of ciliated organisms with complex forms and morphologies, from micro- to milli-length-scales.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional chiral active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model for helical motion of microorganisms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18927v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Active movement is essential for the survival of microorganisms like bacteria, algae and unicellular parasites. In three dimensions, both swimming and gliding microorganisms often exhibit helical trajectories. One such case are malaria parasites gliding through 3D hydrogels, for which we find that their internal correlation time is similar to the time taken for one helical turn. Motivated by this experimental finding, here we theoretically analyze the case of finite internal correlation time for microorganisms with helical trajectories as chiral active particles with an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process for torque. We present an analytical solution which is in very good agreement with computer simulations. We then show that for this type of internal noise, chirality and rotation increase the persistence of motion and results in helical trajectories that have a larger long-time mean squared displacement than straight trajectories at the same propulsion speed. Finally we provide experimental evidence for this prediction for the case of the malaria parasites.</description>

Abstract: The umbilical cord plays a critical role in delivering nutrients and oxygen from the placenta to the fetus through the umbilical vein, while the two umbilical arteries carry deoxygenated blood with waste products back to the placenta. Although solute exchange in the placenta has been extensively studied, exchange within the cord tissue has not been investigated. Here, we explore the hypothesis that the coiled structure of the umbilical cord could strengthen diffusive coupling between the arteries and the vein, resulting in a functional shunt. We calculate the diffusion of solutes, such as oxygen, and heat in the umbilical cord to quantify how this shunt is affected by vascular configuration within the cord. We demonstrate that the shunt is enhanced by coiling and vessel proximity. Furthermore, our model predicts that typical vascular configurations of the human cord tend to minimise shunting, which could otherwise disrupt thermal regulation of the fetus. We also show that the exchange, amplified by coiling, can provide additional oxygen supply to the cord tissue surrounding the umbilical vessels.</description>

      <title>Boundary Effects and Oxygen Deficiency-Driven Pattern Transitions in Algal Bioconvection</title>

Abstract: Suspensions of motile microorganisms can spontaneously form large-scale fluid motion, known as bioconvection, characterized by dense downwelling plumes separated by broad upwelling regions. In this study, we investigate bioconvection in shallow suspensions of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii confined within spiral-shaped boundaries, combining detailed experiments with three-dimensional simulations. Under open liquid-air interfaces, cells accumulate near the surface via negative gravitaxis, generating spiral-shaped density patterns that subsequently fragment into lattice-like clusters, leading to plume formation. Space-time analyses demonstrate coherent rotational dynamics, with predominantly inward-directed motion near the spiral core and bidirectional motion further out. Introducing confinement by sealing the upper boundary with an air-impermeable wall triggers dramatic pattern transitions due to oxygen depletion: initially stable arrangements reorganize into new structures with significantly reduced wavelengths. Complementary numerical simulations, based on incompressible Navier-Stokes equations incorporating negative buoyancy and active swimmer stress, successfully replicate initial pattern formation, subsequent instability, fragmentation into plumes, and emergence of strong vortical flows-nearly an order of magnitude faster than individual cell swimming. However, these models do not capture oxygen depletion-driven transitions observed experimentally. Our results highlight that geometric confinement, oxygen availability, and metabolic transitions critically regulate bioconvection dynamics, offering novel strategies for controlling microbial self-organization and fluid transport.</description>
