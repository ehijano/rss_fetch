      <title>On a Klein-Gordon Reduction for Oscillons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work we examine the dynamics of a model for oscillons in 1-dimensional spacetime field theories with a cubic nonlinearity. We utilize a reduction of the model to first and third harmonics, which leads to a reduced partial differential equation (PDE) system whose steady states are candidates for the original PDE oscillons. We analyze the steady states of this model and their stability, including via tools such as index theory. We develop suitable functionals needed for the study of such stationary states, as well as an analogue of the famous Vakhitov-Kolokolov criterion for a quantity whose change of monotonicity reflects a change of stability. Then, we test the relevant predictions, over the full range of oscillon frequencies, through systematic numerical computations of both the reduced model, its steady states and stability, and also of the original PDE model, identifying its time-periodic oscillon solution. Our results yield some significant connections with previous studies, but also some fundamental new insights both on the reduced system and the dynamics of the original system.</description>

      <title>Image Inpainting based on Visual-Neural-Inspired Specific Object-of-Interest Imaging Technology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study addresses the bottlenecks of conventional holistic image inpainting methods -- susceptibility to informational redundancy and low computational efficiency under occlusions and complex backgrounds -- by proposing a novel three-stage framework: "Specific Object-of-Interest Imaging -- Coarse Structural imaging -- Fine Textural Refinement". First, the Network with Object-Imaging Module (NOIM) precisely delineates target structures from degraded inputs while actively suppressing background interference. Subsequently, the Structural Recovery Module (SRM) employs multi-scale dilated convolutions and feature pyramid fusion to complete shape reconstruction from preliminary imaging. Finally, the Global Detail Refinement Module (GDRM) utilizes sub-pixel convolution with skip connections to map structural priors into high-fidelity RGB outputs. We design a triple-branch hybrid loss (weighted reconstruction, perceptual, and stylistic components) alongside a phased training strategy to enforce structural coherence, semantic consistency, and visual stylization. Experimental validation demonstrates competitive performance against state-of-the-art inpainting models across metrics including SSIM (0.978), PSNR (33.86 dB), MAE (1.605), and LPIPS (0.018), while maintaining robustness in extreme scenarios (low illumination, high noise, multi-object occlusion, motion blur). Theoretical analysis integrated with cognitive neuroscience perspectives reveals profound correlations between the "object precedence perception" mechanism and dynamic feature modulation in visual cortices (V1--V4). This approach not only achieves efficient and precise target-centric imaging but also pioneers interdisciplinary pathways bridging brain-inspired computational frameworks with advanced image inpainting techniques.</description>

      <title>Quantized nonlinear kink movement through topological boundary state instabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thouless pumping is a paradigmatic example of topologically protected, directed transport in linear systems. Recent extensions to nonlinear pumps often overlook the need to reassess the conventional framework of linear topology. In this work, we study a nonlinear dimer-chain model that exhibits quantized transport of kinks under a periodic modulation of a pumping parameter. Crucially, linear excitations in the system map to a Rice-Mele model and display topological boundary modes localized at these kinks. Using methods from nonlinear dynamics, we show that instabilities in these boundary modes are the driving mechanism behind the observed kink motion. While the transport resembles that of a linear Thouless pump, it cannot be fully captured by conventional topological indices. Instead, the behavior is more akin to a topological ratchet: robust, directional, and reproducible, yet fundamentally nonlinear. Furthermore, by introducing multiple pumping parameters, we demonstrate fine control over multiple kink trajectories, as well as soliton motion, suggesting applications in information transport. Our results unify concepts from linear topology and nonlinear dynamics to establish a framework for quantized transport in nonlinear media.</description>

      <title>Hyperparameter Optimization in the Estimation of PDE and Delay-PDE models from data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an improved method for estimating partial differential equations and delay partial differential equations from data, using Bayesian optimization and the Bayesian information criterion to automatically find suitable hyperparameters for the method itself or for the equations (such as a time-delay). We show that combining time integration into an established model estimation method increases robustness and yields predictive models. Allowing hyperparameters to be optimized as part of the model estimation results in a wider modelling scope. We demonstrate the method's performance on a number of synthetic benchmark problems of different complexity, representing different classes of physical behaviour. This includes the Allen-Cahn and Cahn-Hilliard models, as well as different reaction-diffusion systems without and with time-delay.</description>

      <title>Kink dynamics in a high-order field model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.12957v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study various properties of topological solitons (kinks) of a field-theoretic model with a polynomial potential of the twelfth degree. This model is remarkable in that it has several topological sectors, in which kinks have different masses. We obtain asymptotic estimates for the kink-antikink and antikink-kink interaction forces. We also study numerically kink-antikink and antikink-kink collisions and observe a number of interesting phenomena: annihilation of a kink-antikink pair in one topological sector and the production in its place of a pair in another sector; resonance phenomena -- escape windows, despite the absence of vibrational modes in the kink excitation spectra.</description>

      <title>Velocity correlations of vortices and rarefaction pulses in compressible planar quantum fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08930v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a quantitative analytical framework for calculating two-point velocity correlations in compressible quantum fluids, focusing on two key classes of superfluid excitations: vortices and rarefaction pulses. We employ two complementary approaches. First, we introduce a new ansatz for vortex cores in planar quantum fluids that enhances analytic integrability. This ansatz yields closed-form expressions for power spectra and velocity correlations for general vortex distributions. Using it, we identify distinct signatures of short- and long-range velocity correlations corresponding to vortex dipoles and vortex pairs, respectively. Second, we analyze the fast rarefaction pulse regime of the Jones-Roberts soliton. By applying the asymptotic high-velocity wavefunction, we derive analytic expressions for the velocity power spectrum and correlation function, capturing the soliton characteristic length scale. We validate our analytical results for the homogeneous system against numerical treatment of a large trapped system, finding close quantitative agreement. Our findings provide the first analytic treatment of velocity correlations for Jones-Roberts solitons in quantum fluids of light [M. Baker-Rasooli et al., Physical Review Letters, 134, 233401 (2025)], and establish a foundation for characterizing vortices and solitons in compressible quantum fluids.</description>
