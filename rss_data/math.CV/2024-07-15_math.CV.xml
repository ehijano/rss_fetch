      <title>The Julia-Wolff-Carath\'eodory theorem in convex finite type domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rudin's version of the classical Julia-Wolff-Carath\'eodory theorem is a cornerstone of holomorphic function theory in the unit ball of $\mathbb{C}^d$. In this paper we obtain a complete generalization of Rudin's theorem for a holomorphic map $f\colon D\to D'$ between convex domains of finite type. In particular, given a point $\xi\in \partial D$ with finite dilation we show that the $K$-limit of $f$ at $\xi$ exists and is a point $\eta\in \partial D'$, and we obtain asymptotic estimates for all entries of the Jacobian matrix of the differential $df_z$ in terms of the multitypes at the points $\xi$ and at $\eta$. We introduce a generalization of Bracci-Patrizio-Trapani's pluricomplex Poisson kernel which, together with the dilation at $\xi$, gives a formula for the restricted $K$-limit of the normal component of the normal derivative $\langle df_z(n_\xi),n_\eta\rangle$. Our principal tools are methods from Gromov hyperbolicity theory, a scaling in the normal direction, and the strong asymptoticity of complex geodesics. To obtain our main result we prove a conjecture by Abate on the Kobayashi type of a vector $v$, proving that it is equal to the reciprocal of the line type of $v$, and we give new extrinsic characterizations of both $K$-convergence and restricted convergence to a point $\xi\in \partial D$ in terms of the multitype at $\xi$.</description>

      <title>Some results on Mattei's Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we present some results on the Mattei's conjecture, which asserts that the algebraic multiplicity of one-dimensional holomorphic foliations is a topological invariant. For instance, we establish a version of the A'Campo-L\^e Theorem adapted for foliations, which was originally formulated for hypersurfaces. More precisely, we show that, under certain conditions, the algebraic multiplicity equals to 1 of holomorphic one-dimensional foliations is a topological invariant. As a consequence, we prove that saddle-nodes are also topological invariant. Additionally, we address a fundamental result in the literature concerning Mattei's conjecture proved by Rosas-Bazan, which says that under the existence of a homeomorphism extending throughout a neighborhood of the exceptional divisor of the first blowing up, Mattei's conjecture has a positive answer. As a consequence of a characterization of the invariance of multiplicity proved here, we obtain that Mattei's conjecture has a positive answer if the homeomorphism extends locally in a small neighborhood where there is a separatrix not contained in the exceptional divisor of the first blowing up, but not necessarily extends throughout a neighborhood of whole exceptional divisor.</description>

      <title>The CFT of SLE loop measures and the Kontsevich--Suhov conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper initiates the study of the conformal field theory of the SLE$_\kappa$ loop measure $\nu$ for $\kappa\in(0,4]$, the range where the loop is almost surely simple. First, we construct two commuting representations $(\mathbf{L}_n,\bar{\mathbf{L}}_n)_{n\in\mathbb{Z}}$ of the Virasoro algebra with central charge $c_\mathrm{M}=1-6(\frac{2}{\sqrt{\kappa}}-\frac{\sqrt{\kappa}}{2})^2\leq1$ as (unbounded) first order differential operators on $L^2(\nu)$. Second, we introduce highest-weight representations and characterise their structure: in particular, we prove the existence of vanishing singular vectors at arbitrary levels on the Kac table. Third, we prove an integration by parts formula for the SLE loop measure, and use it to define the Shapovalov form of the representation, a non degenerate (but \emph{not} positive definite) Hermitian form $\mathcal{Q}$ on $L^2(\nu)$ with a remarkably simple geometric expression. The fact that $\mathcal{Q}$ differs from the $L^2(\nu)$-inner product is a manifestation of non-unitarity. Finally, we write down a spectral resolution of $\mathcal{Q}$ using the joint diagonalisation of $\mathbf{L}_0$ and $\bar{\mathbf{L}}_0$. As an application of these results, we provide the first proof of the uniqueness of restriction measures, as conjectured by Kontsevich and Suhov.
  Our results lay the groundwork for an in-depth study of the CFT of SLE: in forthcoming works, we will define correlation functions on Riemann surfaces, and prove conformal Ward identities, BPZ equations, and conformal bootstrap formulas.</description>

      <title>Shafarevich-Tate groups of holomorphic Lagrangian fibrations II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a compact hyperk\"ahler manifold with a Lagrangian fibration $\pi\colon X\to B$. A Shafarevich-Tate twist of $X$ is a holomorphic symplectic manifold with a Lagrangian fibration $\pi^\varphi\colon X^\varphi\to B$ which is isomorphic to $\pi$ locally over the base. In particular, $\pi^\varphi$ has the same fibers as $\pi$. A twist $X^\varphi$ corresponds to an element $\varphi$ in the Shafarevich-Tate group of $X$. We show that $X^\varphi$ is K\"ahler when a multiple of $\varphi$ lies in the connected component of unity of the Shafarevich-Tate group and give a necessary condition for $X^\varphi$ to be bimeromorphic to a K\"ahler manifold.</description>

      <title>On complete generators of certain Lie algebras on Danielewski surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14702v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Lie algebra of polynomial vector fields on a smooth Danielewski surface of the form $x y = p(z)$ with $x,y,z \in \mathbb{C}$. We provide explicitly given generators to show that: 1. The Lie algebra of polynomial vector fields is generated by $6$ complete vector fields. 2. The Lie algebra of volume-preserving polynomial vector fields is generated by finitely many vector fields, whose number depends on the degree of the defining polynomial. 3. There exists a Lie sub-algebra generated by $4$ LNDs whose flows generate a group that acts infinitely transitively on the Danielewski surface. The latter result is also generalized to higher dimensions where $z \in \mathbb{C}^N$.</description>

      <title>Operator models for meromorphic functions of bounded type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05214v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we construct operator models for meromorphic functions of bounded type on Krein spaces. This construction is based on certain reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces which are closely related to model spaces. Specifically, we show that each function of bounded type corresponds naturally to a pair of such spaces, extending Helson's representation theorem. This correspondence enables an explicit construction of our model, where the Krein space is a suitable sum of these identified spaces. Additionally, we establish that the representing self-adjoint relations possess a relatively simple structure, proving to be partially fundamentally reducible. Conversely, we show that realizations involving such relations correspond to functions of bounded type.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional B\l{}ocki, $L^p$-Mahler, and Bourgain conjectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10992v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We confirm, in dimension two, Blocki's conjectures on sharp lower bounds for Bergman kernels of tube domains. To that end, we verify a broader class of $L^p$-Mahler conjectures due to Berndtsson and the authors, where $p=1$ are Blocki's conjecture, and $p=\infty$ are Mahler's conjectures. The proofs are technically challenging as the $L^p$-Mahler volume is considerably harder to deal with analytically compared to Mahler's volume, and furthermore duality is lost. In addition, unlike in the classical Mahler setting, the non-symmetric setting is considerably more involved than the symmetric one. The proofs involve studying the effect of Mahler's classical sliding of vertices on two-dimensional polytopes on the $L^p$-polar body (no longer a polytope). Some arguments are inspired by works of Campi--Gronchi and Meyer--Reisner on volumes of classical polar bodies of shadow systems. In passing, we also explore how Mahler's sliding affects the isotropic constant. This leads to an elementary proof of Bourgain's strong hyperplane conjectures in dimension two, originally due to Bisztriczky--B\"or\"oczky, Campi--Colesanti--Gronchi and Meckes. Specifically, we show that, as a function of the sliding parameter, the isotropic constant raised to an appropriate power is a convex quadratic polynomial.</description>
