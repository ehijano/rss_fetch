      <title>On the weighted hermite-hadamard inequality in multiple variables, application for weighted multivariate means</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the so-called Hermite-Hadamard inequality for (operator) convex functions with one variable has known extensive several developments by virtue of its nice properties and various applications. The fundamental target of this paper is to investigate a weighted variant of Hermite-Hadamard inequality in multiple variables that extends the univariate case. As an application, we introduce some weighted multivariate means extending certain bivariate means known in the literature.</description>

      <title>Representability of G-functions as rational functions in hypergeometric series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fres\'an and Jossen have given a negative answer to a question of Siegel about the representability of every $E$-function as a polynomial with algebraic coefficients in $E$-functions of type ${}_pF_q[\underline{a};\underline{b};\gamma x^{q-p+1}]$ with $q\geq p\geq 0$, $\gamma \in \overline{\mathbb Q}$ and rational parameters $\underline{a}, \underline{b}$. In this paper, we study, in a more general context, a similar question for $G$-functions asked by Fischler and the second author: can every $G$-function be represented as a polynomial with algebraic coefficients in $G$-functions of type $\mu(x)\cdot {}_pF_{p-1}[\underline{a};\underline{b};\lambda(x)]$ with $p\ge 1$, rational parameters $\underline{a},\underline{b}$ and $\mu,\lambda$ algebraic over $\mathbb Q(x)$ with  $\lambda(0)=0$? They have shown the answer to be negative under a generalization of Grothendieck's Period Conjecture and a technical assumption on the~$\lambda$'s. Using differential Galois theory, we prove that, for every $N\in \mathbb N$, there exists a $G$-function which can not be represented as a  rational function with coefficients in $\overline{\mathbb C(x)}$ of solutions of linear differential equations with coefficients in $\mathbb C(x)$ and at most $N$ singularities in $\mathbb{P}^1 (\mathbb C)$. As a corollary, we deduce that not all $G$-functions can be represented as a rational function in hypergeometric series of the above mentioned type, when the $\lambda$'s are rational functions with degrees of their numerators and denominators bounded by an arbitrarily large fixed constant. This provides an unconditional negative answer to the question asked by Fischler and the second author for such~$\lambda$'s.</description>

      <title>Hyperuniformity of random measures on Euclidean and hyperbolic spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate lower asymptotic bounds of number variances for invariant locally square-integrable random measures on Euclidean and real hyperbolic spaces. In the Euclidean case we show that there are subsequences of radii for which the number variance grows at least as fast as the volume of the boundary of Euclidean balls, generalizing a classical result of Beck. With regards to real hyperbolic spaces we prove that random measures are never geometrically hyperuniform and if the random measure admits non-trivial complementary series diffraction, then it is hyperfluctuating. Moreover, we define spectral hyperuniformity and stealth of random measures on real hyperbolic spaces in terms of vanishing of the complementary series diffraction and sub-Poissonian decay of the principal series diffraction around the Harish-Chandra $\Xi$-function.</description>

      <title>Discrete orthogonality relations for multi-indexed Laguerre and Jacobi polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.08950</link>
      <description>arXiv:1907.08950v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The discrete orthogonality relations hold for all the orthogonal polynomials obeying three term recurrence relations. We show that they also hold for multi-indexed Laguerre and Jacobi polynomials, which are new orthogonal polynomials obtained by deforming these classical orthogonal polynomials. The discrete orthogonality relations could be considered as more encompassing characterisation of orthogonal polynomials than the three term recurrence relations. As the multi-indexed orthogonal polynomials start at a positive degree $\ell_{\mathcal D}\ge1$, the three term recurrence relations are broken. The extra $\ell_{\mathcal D}$ `lower degree polynomials', which are necessary for the discrete orthogonality relations, are identified. The corresponding Christoffel numbers are determined. The main results are obtained by the blow-up analysis of the second order differential operators governing the multi-indexed orthogonal polynomials around the zeros of these polynomials at a degree $\ell_{\mathcal D}+\mathcal{N}$. %changed The discrete orthogonality relations are shown to hold for another group of `new' orthogonal polynomials called Krein-Adler polynomials based on the Hermite, Laguerre and Jacobi polynomials.</description>

      <title>The Beurling and Malliavin Theorem in Several Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.12397v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The present paper is devoted to a new multidimensional generalization of the Beurling and Malliavin Theorem, which is a classical result in the Uncertainty Principle in Fourier Analysis. In more detail, we establish by an elegant but simple new method a sufficient condition for a radial function to be a Beurling and Malliavin majorant in several dimensions (this means that the function in question can be minorized by the modulus of a square integrable function which is not zero identically and which has the support of the Fourier transform included in an arbitrary small ball). As a corollary of the radial case, we also get a new sharp sufficient condition in the nonradial case. The latter result provides an answer to a question posed by L. H\"ormander. Our proof is different in the cases of odd and even dimensions. In the even dimensional case we make use of one classical formula from the theory of Bessel functions due to N. Ya. Sonin.</description>

      <title>A Quantitative Bound For Szemer\'edi's Theorem for a Complexity One Polynomial Progression over $\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.05540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.05540v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $N$ be a large prime and $P, Q \in \mathbb{Z}[x]$ two linearly independent polynomials with $P(0) = Q(0) = 0$. We show that if a subset $A$ of $\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z}$ lacks a progression of the form $(x, x + P(y), x + Q(y), x + P(y) + Q(y))$, then $$|A| \le O\left(\frac{N}{\log_{(O(1))}(N)}\right)$$ where $\log_{C}(N)$ is an iterated logarithm of order $C$ (e.g., $\log_{2}(N) = \log\log(N)$). To establish this bound, we adapt Peluse's (2018) degree lowering argument to the quadratic Fourier analysis setting to obtain quantitative bounds on the true complexity of the above progression. Our method also shows that for a large class of polynomial progressions, if one can establish polynomial-type bounds on the true complexity of those progressions, then one can establish polynomial-type bounds on Szemer\'edi's theorem for that type of polynomial progression.</description>
