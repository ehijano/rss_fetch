      <title>PaMMA-Net: Plasmas magnetic measurement evolution based on data-driven incremental accumulative prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An accurate evolution model is crucial for effective control and in-depth study of fusion plasmas. Evolution methods based on physical models often encounter challenges such as insufficient robustness or excessive computational costs. Given the proven strong fitting capabilities of deep learning methods across various fields, including plasma research, this paper introduces a deep learning-based magnetic measurement evolution method named PaMMA-Net (Plasma Magnetic Measurements Incremental Accumulative Prediction Network). This network is capable of evolving magnetic measurements in tokamak discharge experiments over extended periods or, in conjunction with equilibrium reconstruction algorithms, evolving macroscopic parameters such as plasma shape. Leveraging a incremental prediction approach and data augmentation techniques tailored for magnetic measurements, PaMMA-Net achieves superior evolution results compared to existing studies. The tests conducted on real experimental data from EAST validate the high generalization capability of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Sawtooth crash in tokamak as a sequence of Multi-region Relaxed MHD equilibria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the sawtooth crash phenomenon in tokamak plasmas by modelling it as a sequence of Multi-region Relaxed Magnetohydrodynamic (MRxMHD) equilibria. Using the Stepped-Pressure Equilibrium Code (SPEC), we constructed a series of equilibria representing intermediate states during the sawtooth crash, with progressively increasing reconnection regions. Numerical results demonstrated that the system prefers the lower energy non-axisymmetric equilibria with islands and is eventually back to an axisymmetric state, capturing key features of the reconnection process. Comparisons with the nonlinear MHD code M3D-C1 showed remarkable agreement on the field-line topology, the safety factor, and the current profile. However, the simplified MRxMHD model does not resolve the detailed structure of the current sheet. Despite this limitation, MRxMHD offers an insightful approach and a complementary perspective to initial-value MHD simulations.</description>

      <title>Consideration on relation between penetrated power and topological charge of millimeter-wave vortex in magnetized plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It was demonstrated that the vortex field of a hybrid mode can propagate in the mag-netized plasma region where plane waves are unable to propagate due to the cut-off condition. In this study, the dependence of the penetrated power of injected as millime-ter-wave vortices of the hybrid mode in magnetized plasma is analyzed using the Fi-nite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) method. The effect of the radius size of the cor-rugated waveguide on the penetrated power is described, revealing its significant con-tribution to reducing the deviation of topological charge in the hybrid mode. Further-more, it was found that the penetrated power of the vortex field in magnetized plasma strongly depends on the topological charge l and the deviation of topological charge</description>

      <title>Fast matter-antimatter separation in plasma with external force acting on lepton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the separation of matter and antimatter driven by the growth of the Weibel instability in a matter-antimatter plasma. The plasma under consideration comprises protons and antiprotons initially at rest, along with a relativistic stream of leptons (electrons and positrons). This stream is maintained by an external force, potentially originating from phenomena such as a photon wind. Our findings reveal the rapid onset of a Weibel-type instability, leading to a distinct separation of matter and antimatter. Results from our particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations are compared with an analytical model based on the linearized magnetohydrodynamics equations.</description>

      <title>Blob velocities and sizes in the Alcator C-Mod scrape-off layer for ohmic and high confinement mode plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An improved time delay estimation method is used to calculate the velocity of cross-field blob motion in the scrape-off layer of Alcator C-Mod for an ohmic and two high confinement (H-mode) plasmas; an edge localized mode free and an enhanced D-alpha H-mode. The gas puff imaging data analysis results are interpreted in the framework of a stochastic model that describes the fluctuations as a super-position of uncorrelated blob-like structures. In all confinement modes investigated, the scrape-off layer is dominated by large amplitude, blob-like filaments moving radially outwards with velocities in the range from 400 to 1000 m/s. Blobs in high confinement mode plasmas have similar velocities and sizes as in ohmic plasma, which is consistent with the close similarity of conditionally averaged burst shapes and frequency spectra for the confinement modes investigated.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic System Conceptual Design for a Negative Triangularity Tokamak</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Negative triangularity (NT) tokamak configurations have several key benefits including sufficient core confinement, improved power handling, and reduced edge pressure gradients that allow for edge-localized mode (ELM) free operation. We present the design of a compact NT device for testing sophisticated simulation and control software, with the aim of demonstrating NT controllability and informing power plant operation. The TokaMaker code is used to develop the basic electromagnetic system of the $R_0$ = 1 m, $a$ = 0.27 m, $B_t$ = 3 T, $I_p$ = 0.75 MA tokamak. The proposed design utilizes eight poloidal field coils with maximum currents of 1 MA to achieve a wide range of plasma geometries with $-0.7 &lt; \delta &lt; -0.3$ and $1.5 &lt; \kappa &lt; 1.9$. Scenarios with strong negative triangularity and high elongation are particularly susceptible to vertical instability, necessitating the inclusion of high-field side and/or low-field side passive stabilizing plates which together reduce vertical instability growth rates by $\approx$75%. Upper limits for the forces on poloidal and toroidal field coils are predicted and mechanical loads on passive structures during current quench events are assessed. The 3 T on-axis toroidal field is achieved with 16 demountable copper toroidal field coils, allowing for easy maintenance of the vacuum vessel and poloidal field coils. This pre-conceptual design study demonstrates that the key capabilities required of a dedicated NT tokamak experiment can be realized with existing copper magnet technologies.</description>

      <title>Numerical study of vortices within a background vortex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study aims to exploit the analogy of vortex dynamics in a 2D ideal fluid and 2D non-neutral plasma. Numerical simulations using contour dynamics with adaptive refinement are conducted to study the dynamics of one or more vortices within a background vortex, and results are compared with experiments using magnetized non-neutral electron plasmas confined in a Penning-Malmberg trap. This comparison is based on the isomorphism between the 2D Euler equations for ideal fluid and the 2D drift-Poisson equations for non-neutral plasma, where the the fluid vorticity and stream function correspond to the plasma charge density and electric potential. Agreement and discrepancy between simulation and experiment are observed and discussed.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Kinetic Effects on Current Gradient-Driven Instabilities of Electron Current Layers via Particle-in-Cell Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06799v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electron current layers, which form in various natural and laboratory plasmas, are susceptible to multiple instabilities, with tearing being a prominent instability driven by current gradients. Tearing is considered a potential mechanism for magnetic reconnection in collisionless regimes, where electron inertia acts as a non-ideal factor that causes magnetic field lines to break and reconnect. In contrast, another mode, known as the surface-preserving mode, also driven by current gradients, maintains the magnetic field topology. In this study, we investigate the kinetic effects on these modes in the presence of finite electron temperatures using two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations. Our findings reveal that temperature significantly stabilizes the tearing mode, particularly at higher temperatures, due to an increased electron Larmor radius and the associated magnetic field diffusion. We also examine the interplay between the guide field and temperature. Additionally, we observe that growth rates for the surface-preserving mode, in contrast to the tearing mode, increase with temperature, likely due to enhanced electron flow velocities. Furthermore, we identify cases with mixed modes, where both tearing and surface-preserving modes coexist, exhibiting asymmetric structures characteristic of asymmetric magnetic reconnection. Finally, we outline potential future research directions that build upon our findings.</description>

      <title>Turbulent transport regimes in the presence of an X-point magnetic configuration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18634v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the transport properties of the two-dimensional electrostatic turbulence characterizing the edge of a Tokamak device from the study of test particles motion (passive fluid tracers) following the EXB drift. We perform statistical tests on the tracer population in order to assess both the magnitude and the main features of transport. The role of other physical properties, such as viscosity and inverse energy cascade in the spectrum, is also considered. We outline that large scale eddies are responsible for greater transport coefficients, while the presence of an X-point magnetic field reduces the mean free path of the particles, however generating a larger outliers population with respect to a Gaussian profile.</description>

      <title>Does the oscillatory behavior of the Momentum Spectrum depend on the basis in the Post-Transient Stage?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16321v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pair creation by a spatially homogeneous, time-dependent electric field is studied within the framework of scalar quantum electrodynamics. We employ the standard Bogoliubov transformation approach to compute the single-particle distribution function in an adiabatic basis. We analyzed the distribution function of created particles in two different adiabatic bases (related by a unitary transformation). A novel dynamical scaling is observed while analyzing the oscillatory momentum spectrum of the pairs created by the Sauter pulsed field at intermediate times, calculated using the two adiabatic bases. In these bases, the same oscillatory momentum spectra are observed but at different times. However, when we scale the time by the point marking the end of the transient stage of dynamical evolution for each case of central momentum, the respective momentum spectra overlap. Furthermore, we study the time evolution of the momentum spectrum in the multi-photon regime and find that the spectra show a multi-modal profile structure at finite times for both choices of basis.</description>
