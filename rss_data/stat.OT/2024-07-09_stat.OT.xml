      <title>The Need for a Recurring Large-Scale Benchmarking Survey to Continually Evaluate Sampling Methods and Administration Modes: Lessons from the 2022 Collaborative Midterm Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As survey methods adapt to technological and societal changes, a growing body of research seeks to understand the tradeoffs associated with various sampling methods and administration modes. We show how the NSF-funded 2022 Collaborative Midterm Survey (CMS) can be used as a dynamic and transparent framework for evaluating which sampling approaches - or combination of approaches - are best suited for various research goals. The CMS is ideally suited for this purpose because it includes almost 20,000 respondents interviewed using two administration modes (phone and online) and data drawn from random digit dialing, random address-based sampling, a probability-based panel, two nonprobability panels, and two nonprobability marketplaces. The analysis considers three types of population benchmarks (election data, administrative records, and large government surveys) and focuses on the national-level estimates as well as oversamples in three states (California, Florida, and Wisconsin). In addition to documenting how each of the survey strategies performed, we develop a strategy to assess how different combinations of approaches compare to different population benchmarks in order to guide researchers combining sampling methods and sources. We conclude by providing specific recommendations to public opinion and election survey researchers and demonstrating how our approach could be applied to a large government survey conducted at regular intervals to provide ongoing guidance to researchers, government, businesses, and nonprofits regarding the most appropriate survey sampling and administration methods.</description>

      <title>Reducing Total Trip Time and Vehicle Emission through Park-and-Ride -- methods and case-study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Serious traffic congestion and emission by excessive usage of private cars are crucial issues in our modern society. As one solution for these, a concept of Park-and-Ride (PnR) where people stop their private cars (i.e. single-occupancy vehicles) at stations and ride on public vehicles (i.e. mass transportation) are receiving wide attention recently. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive mathematical model which can evaluate waiting times and traveling times of customers, and the total emission of vehicles for various usage ratio of PnR and operation policies of public transportation. Using a system of queues integrated with an emissions model we perform a case-study of Tsukuba city, in Japan. We indicate an intriguing trade-off between the waiting time of customers for the PnR and the long traveling time due to the traffic congestion (leading to high emissions) caused by private cars depending on the usage ratio through some numerical experiments. Moreover, we study the total cost to society caused by total trip times and pollution, in which the decision variables are the capacities and frequencies of the public transportation for the PnR system. Our numerical results showed a significant reduction in the total social cost under the optimal transit policy for the current high usage rate of single-occupancy vehicles. Furthermore, we show that further reduction in the total social cost can be revealed by considering the reduction on the use of private cars compared to the current state implying the social importance of promoting car-free movement.</description>

      <title>Guidelines and Best Practices to Share Deidentified Data and Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18232v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 2022, the Journal of Statistics and Data Science Education (JSDSE) instituted augmented requirements for authors to post deidentified data and code underlying their papers. These changes were prompted by an increased focus on reproducibility and open science (NASEM 2019). A recent review of data availability practices noted that "such policies help increase the reproducibility of the published literature, as well as make a larger body of data available for reuse and re-analysis" (PLOS ONE, 2024). JSDSE values accessibility as it endeavors to share knowledge that can improve educational approaches to teaching statistics and data science. Because institution, environment, and students differ across readers of the journal, it is especially important to facilitate the transfer of a journal article's findings to new contexts. This process may require digging into more of the details, including the deidentified data and code. Our goal is to provide our readers and authors with a review of why the requirements for code and data sharing were instituted, summarize ongoing trends and developments in open science, discuss options for data and code sharing, and share advice for authors.</description>
