      <title>Design of Ligand-Binding Proteins with Atomic Flow Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing novel proteins that bind to small molecules is a long-standing challenge in computational biology, with applications in developing catalysts, biosensors, and more. Current computational methods rely on the assumption that the binding pose of the target molecule is known, which is not always feasible, as conformations of novel targets are often unknown and tend to change upon binding. In this work, we formulate proteins and molecules as unified biotokens, and present AtomFlow, a novel deep generative model under the flow-matching framework for the design of ligand-binding proteins from the 2D target molecular graph alone. Operating on representative atoms of biotokens, AtomFlow captures the flexibility of ligands and generates ligand conformations and protein backbone structures iteratively. We consider the multi-scale nature of biotokens and demonstrate that AtomFlow can be effectively trained on a subset of structures from the Protein Data Bank, by matching flow vector field using an SE(3) equivariant structure prediction network. Experimental results show that our method can generate high fidelity ligand-binding proteins and achieve performance comparable to the state-of-the-art model RFDiffusionAA, while not requiring bound ligand structures. As a general framework, AtomFlow holds the potential to be applied to various biomolecule generation tasks in the future.</description>

      <title>Dynamic PDB: A New Dataset and a SE(3) Model Extension by Integrating Dynamic Behaviors and Physical Properties in Protein Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12413v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite significant progress in static protein structure collection and prediction, the dynamic behavior of proteins, one of their most vital characteristics, has been largely overlooked in prior research. This oversight can be attributed to the limited availability, diversity, and heterogeneity of dynamic protein datasets. To address this gap, we propose to enhance existing prestigious static 3D protein structural databases, such as the Protein Data Bank (PDB), by integrating dynamic data and additional physical properties. Specifically, we introduce a large-scale dataset, Dynamic PDB, encompassing approximately 12.6K proteins, each subjected to all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations lasting 1 microsecond to capture conformational changes. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive suite of physical properties, including atomic velocities and forces, potential and kinetic energies of proteins, and the temperature of the simulation environment, recorded at 1 picosecond intervals throughout the simulations. For benchmarking purposes, we evaluate state-of-the-art methods on the proposed dataset for the task of trajectory prediction. To demonstrate the value of integrating richer physical properties in the study of protein dynamics and related model design, we base our approach on the SE(3) diffusion model and incorporate these physical properties into the trajectory prediction process. Preliminary results indicate that this straightforward extension of the SE(3) model yields improved accuracy, as measured by MAE and RMSD, when the proposed physical properties are taken into consideration. https://fudan-generative-vision.github.io/dynamicPDB/ .</description>

      <title>Active learning for energy-based antibody optimization and enhanced screening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10964v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate prediction and optimization of protein-protein binding affinity is crucial for therapeutic antibody development. Although machine learning-based prediction methods $\Delta\Delta G$ are suitable for large-scale mutant screening, they struggle to predict the effects of multiple mutations for targets without existing binders. Energy function-based methods, though more accurate, are time consuming and not ideal for large-scale screening. To address this, we propose an active learning workflow that efficiently trains a deep learning model to learn energy functions for specific targets, combining the advantages of both approaches. Our method integrates the RDE-Network deep learning model with Rosetta's energy function-based Flex ddG to efficiently explore mutants. In a case study targeting HER2-binding Trastuzumab mutants, our approach significantly improved the screening performance over random selection and demonstrated the ability to identify mutants with better binding properties without experimental $\Delta\Delta G$ data. This workflow advances computational antibody design by combining machine learning, physics-based computations, and active learning to achieve more efficient antibody development.</description>

      <title>t-SMILES 2: Hierarchical Structure Enhances the Generalizability of Linear Molecular Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02164v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Encoding is the carrier of information. Artificial intelligence models possess basic capabilities in syntax, semantics, and reasoning, but these capabilities are sensitive to specific inputs. This study introduces TSIS (Simplified TSID) to the t-SMILES family, with the intention of conducting a more comprehensive and in-depth evaluation of t-SMILES. TSID has been demonstrated significantly outperforms classical SMILES, DeepSMILES, and SELFIES in previous research. Further analysis of this study reveals that the tree structure utilized by the t-SMILES framework is more effectively comprehensible than initially anticipated. Additionally, TSIS, along with their variants, demonstrate comparable performance to TSID and markedly surpass that of SMILES, SAFE, and SELFIES. Moreover, its format is more straightforward to read. Overall, the contrast analysis indicates that the hierarchical structure of t-SMILES enhances its generalizability. Concurrently, the evaluation of the generative models reveals that the GPT model exhibits the highest novelty-similarity scores. The VAE and diffusion models demonstrate robust capabilities in terms of interpolation, whereas the LSTM model encounters some challenges in parsing complex structures.</description>
