      <title>The neutron star mass, distance, and inclination from precision timing of the brilliant millisecond pulsar J0437$-$4715</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The observation of neutron stars enables the otherwise impossible study of fundamental physical processes. Timing of binary radio pulsars is particularly powerful, as it enables precise characterization of their (three-dimensional) positions and orbits. PSR J0437$-$4715 is an important millisecond pulsar for timing array experiments and is also a primary target for the Neutron Star Interior Composition ExploreR (NICER). The main aim of the NICER mission is to constrain the neutron star equation of state by inferring the compactness ($M_p/R$) of the star. Direct measurements of the mass $M_p$ from pulsar timing therefore substantially improve constraints on the radius $R$, and the equation of state. Here we use observations spanning 26 years from Murriyang, the 64-m Parkes radio telescope, to improve the timing model for this pulsar. Among the new precise measurements are the pulsar mass $M_p=1.418\pm 0.044$ M$_{\odot}$, distance $D=156.96 \pm 0.11$ pc, and orbital inclination angle $i=137.506 \pm 0.016^\circ$, which can be used to inform the X-ray pulse profile models inferred from NICER observations. We demonstrate that these results are consistent between multiple data sets from the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array (PPTA), each modelled with different noise assumptions. Using the longest available PPTA data set, we measure an apparent second derivative of the pulsar spin frequency and discuss how this can be explained either by kinematic effects due to the proper motion and radial velocity of the pulsar, or excess low-frequency noise such as a gravitational-wave background.</description>

      <title>Constraints on FRB emission in the aftermath of GRBs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are highly energetic radio transients with millisecond duration, whose physical origin is still unknown. Many models consider magnetars as possible FRB sources, supported by the observational association of FRBs with the galactic magnetar SGR 1935+2154. Magnetars are also thought to be the source of the power of a fraction of Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs), opening the possibility that the two extreme phenomena have a common progenitor. In this work we put constrains to this hypothesis searching for possible associations between GRBs and FRBs with currently available catalogs, and estimating if the lack of coincident detection can rule out their association. We cross-matched all the Swift GRBs detected so far with all the well-localised FRBs reported in the FRBSTATS catalog, and we looked for FRB-GRB associations considering both spatial and temporal constraints. We also simulated a synthetic population of FRBs associated with Swift GRBs to estimate how likely it is to have a joint detection with current and future radio facilities. We recover two, low significant, possible associations already reported in literature from the catalogs' matches: GRB 110715A/FRB 20171209A and GRB 060502B/FRB 20190309A. However, our study shows that the absence of any unambiguous association so far between Swift GRBs and FRBs cannot exclude that the two populations are connected, given the characteristics of current GRB and FRB detectors. Currently available observational data are not sufficient to clearly exclude/confirm whether GRBs and FRBs are physically associated. In the next decade, with new generations of GRB and FRB detectors there will be a higher probability to detect joint GRB-FRB events, if any: future observations will therefore be key to put more stringent constraints on the hypothesis that FRBs and GRBs have common progenitors.</description>

      <title>Association of the IceCube neutrinos with blazars in the CGRaBS sample</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of high-energy (HE) astrophysical neutrinos has remained an elusive hot topic in the field of HE astrophysics for the past decade. Apart from a handful of individual associations, the vast majority of HE neutrinos arise from unknown sources. While there are theoretically-motivated candidate populations, such as blazars -- a subclass of AGN with jets pointed towards our line-of-sight -- they have not yet been convincingly linked to HE neutrino production. Here, we perform a spatio-temporal association analysis between a sample of blazars (from CGRaBS catalog) in the radio and optical bands and the most up-to-date IceCube HE neutrino catalog. We find that if the IceCube error regions are enlarged by 1$^\circ$ in quadrature, to account for unknown systematic errors at maximal level, a spatio-temporal correlation between the multiwavelength light curves of the CGRaBS blazars and the IceCube HE neutrinos is hinted at least at a 2.17$\sigma$ significance level. On the other hand, when the IceCube error regions are taken as their published values, we do not find any significant correlations. A discrepancy in the blazar-neutrino correlation strengths, when using such minimal and enlarged error region scenarios, was also obtained in a recent study by the IceCube collaboration. In our study, this difference arises because several flaring blazars -- coinciding with a neutrino arrival time -- happen to narrowly miss the published 90\%-likelihood error region of the nearest neutrino event. For all of the associations driving our most significant correlations, the flaring blazar is much less than 1$^\circ$ away from the published error regions. Therefore, our results indicate that the question of the blazar-neutrino connection is highly sensitive to the reconstruction of the neutrino error regions, whose reliability is expected to improve with the next generation of neutrino observatories.</description>

      <title>Across the soft gamma-ray regime: utilizing simultaneous detections in the Compton Spectrometer and Imager (COSI) and the Background and Transient Observer (BTO) to understand astrophysical transients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Compton Spectrometer and Imager (COSI) is a NASA funded Small Explorer (SMEX) mission slated to launch in 2027. COSI will house a wide-field gamma-ray telescope designed to survey the entire sky in the 0.2--5 MeV range. Using germanium detectors, the instrument will provide imaging, spectroscopy, and polarimetry of astrophysical sources with excellent energy resolution and degree-scale localization capabilities. In addition to the main instrument, COSI will fly with a student collaboration project known as the Background and Transient Observer (BTO). BTO will extend the COSI bandpass to energies lower than 200 keV, thus enabling spectral analysis across the shared band of 30 keV--2 MeV range. The BTO instrument will consist of two NaI scintillators and student-designed readout electronics. Using spectral information from both the COSI and BTO instruments, physics such as the energy peak turnover in gamma-ray bursts, the characteristics of magnetar flares, and the event frequency of a range of transient phenomena will be constrained. In this paper, we present the expected science returnables from BTO and comment on the shared returnables from the COSI and BTO missions. We include simulations of gamma-ray bursts, magnetar giant flares, and terrestrial gamma-ray flashes using BTO's spectral response. Additionally, we estimate BTO's gamma-ray burst detection rate and find that BTO will detect ~150 gamma-ray bursts per year, with most of these events being long bursts.</description>

      <title>Redshifts of candidate host galaxies of four fast X-ray transients using VLT/MUSE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast X-ray transients (FXTs) are X-ray flares lasting minutes to hours. Multi-wavelength counterparts to these FXTs have been proven hard to find. As a result distance measurements are through indirect methods such as host galaxy identification. The three main models proposed for FXTs; supernova shock breakout emission (SN SBO), binary neutron star (BNS) mergers and tidal dirsuption events (TDEs) of an intermediate mass black hole (IMBH) disrupting a white dwarf (WD), have a different associated L$_{X, peak}$. Therefore obtaining the distance to FXTs will be a powerful probe to investigate the nature of these FXTs. We use VLT/MUSE observations of a sample of FXTs to report the redshift of between 13 and 22 galaxies per FXT and use these redshifts to calculate the distance, L$_{X, peak}$ and the projected offsets. We find L$_{X, peak}&gt;10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$ if we assume any of the sources with a redshift measurement is the true host galaxy of the corresponding FXT. For XRT 100831 we find a very faint galaxy within the 1$\sigma$ uncertainty region with a chance alignment probability of 0.04. For XRT 060207 we find a candidate host galaxy at z = 0.939 with a low chance alignment probability. However, we also report the detection of a late-type star within the 3$\sigma$ uncertainty region with a similar chance alignment probability. For the remaining FXTs we find no sources within their 3$\sigma$ uncertainty regions. We rule out a SN SBO nature for all FXTs based on L$_{X, peak}$ and the projected offsets. For XRT 100831 we conclude the detected galaxy within the 1$\sigma$ uncertainty position is likely to be the host galaxy of this FXT. From the available information, we are not able to determine if XRT 060207 originated from the galaxy found within 1$\sigma$ of the FXT position or was due to a flare from the late-type star detected within the 3$\sigma$ uncertainty region.</description>

      <title>Characterisation of Supernovae Interacting with Dense Circumstellar Matter with a Flat Density Profile</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interaction between supernova (SN) ejecta and dense circumstellar medium (CSM) with a flat density structure ($\rho \propto r^{-s}, s &lt; 1.5$) was recently proposed as a possible mechanism behind interacting SNe that exhibit exceptionally long rise times exceeding 100 days. In such a configuration, the interaction luminosity keeps rising until the reverse shock propagates into the inner layers of the SN ejecta. We investigate the light curves of SNe interacting with a flatly distributed CSM in detail, incorporating the effects of photon diffusion inside the CSM into the model. We show that three physical processes - the shock breakout, the propagation of the reverse shock into the inner ejecta, and the departure of the shock from the dense CSM - predominantly determine the qualitative behaviour of the light curves. Based on the presence and precedence of these processes, the light curves of SNe interacting with flatly distributed CSM can be classified into five distinct morphological classes. We also show that our model can qualitatively reproduce doubly peaked SNe whose peaks are a few tens of days apart, such as SN 2005bf and SN 2022xxf. Our results show that the density distribution of the CSM is an important property of CSM that contributes to the diversity in light curves of interacting SNe.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Relativistic Jets from the Fast X-ray Transient 210423 using Prompt Radio Follow-Up Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast X-ray Transients (FXTs) are a new observational class of phenomena with no clear physical origin. This is at least partially a consequence of limited multi-wavelength follow up of this class of transients in real time. Here we present deep optical ($g-$ and $i-$ band) photometry with Keck, and prompt radio observations with the VLA of FXT 210423 obtained at ${\delta t \approx 14-36}$ days since the X-ray trigger. We use these multi-band observations, combined with publicly available data sets, to constrain the presence and physical properties of on-axis and off-axis relativistic jets such as those that can be launched by neutron-star mergers and tidal disruption events, which are among the proposed theoretical scenarios of FXTs. Considering a wide range of possible redshifts $z\le3.5$, circumstellar medium (CSM) density $n={10^{-6}-10^{-1}\,\rm{cm^{-3}}}$, isotropic-equivalent jet kinetic energy $E_{k,iso}={10^{48}-10^{55}\,\rm{erg}}$, we find that we can rule out wide jets with opening angle ${\theta_{j}=15^{\circ}}$ viewed within ${10^{\circ}}$ off-axis. For more collimated jets (${\theta_{j}=3^{\circ}}$) we can only rule out on-axis (${\theta_{j}=0^{\circ}}$) orientations. This study highlights the constraining power of prompt multi-wavelength observations of FXTs discovered in real time by current (e.g., Einstein Probe) and future facilities.</description>

      <title>Black hole spin estimation of XTE J2012+381 using simultaneous observations of Swift/XRT and NuSTAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A sufficiently precise measurement of black hole spin is required to carry out quantitative tests of the Kerr metric and to understand several phenomena related to astrophysical black holes. After 24 years, XTE J2012+381 again underwent an outburst in December 2022. In this work, we focused on the measurement of spin and mass of black hole candidate XTE J2012+381 using broadband spectral analysis of X-ray data from \emph{Swift/XRT} and \emph{NuSTAR}. By using the relxillCp model, the spin and inclination of the source were found to be $0.883_{-0.061}^{+0.033}$ and $46.2_{-2.0}^{+3.7}$ degrees, respectively for high disk density ($i.e.\;10^{20}\;\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$). We further test our results for lamp post geometry using the relxilllpCp model. The spin and inclination of the source were found to be $0.892_{-0.044}^{+0.020}$ and $43.1_{-1.2}^{+1.4}$ degrees, respectively. Then "continuum-fitting" method was used for the soft state to estimate the mass of BH and found to be $7.95_{-3.25}^{+7.65}\;\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ and $7.48_{-2.75}^{+5.80}\;\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ for the spin and inclination estimated from the relxillCp and relxilllpCp model respectively. We used a distance of 5.4 kpc as measured by Gaia using the parallax method. This study also addresses the issue of supersolar iron abundance in XTE J2012+381 by using \texttt{reflionx} based reflection model and found high disk density for the source.</description>

      <title>High $\gamma$-ray escape time in 2003fg-like supernovae: A challenge to proposed models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A rare subclass of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), named after the prototype SN 2003fg, includes some of the brightest SNe Ia, often called "super Chandrasekhar-mass" SNe Ia. We calculate the $\gamma$-ray deposition histories and the $^{56}$Ni mass synthesized in the explosion, $M_\mathrm{Ni56}$, for eight 2003fg-like SNe. Our findings reveal that the $\gamma$-ray escape time, $t_0$, for these objects is $ t_0\approx45\text{-}60 \,$ days, significantly higher than that of normal SNe Ia. 2003fg-like SNe are distinct from normal SNe Ia in the $ t_0 $-$ M_\mathrm{Ni56} $ plane, with a noticeable gap between the two populations. The observed position of 2003fg-like SNe in this plane poses a significant challenge for theoretical explosion models. We demonstrate that the merger of two white dwarfs (WDs) and a single star exceeding the Chandrasekhar limit fail to reproduce the observed $ t_0 $-$ M_\mathrm{Ni56} $ distribution. However, preliminary calculations of head-on collisions of massive WDs show agreement with the observed $ t_0 $-$ M_\mathrm{Ni56} $ distribution.</description>

      <title>The discovery of a nearby 421~s transient with CHIME/FRB/Pulsar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutron stars and white dwarfs are both dense remnants of post-main-sequence stars. Pulsars, magnetars and strongly magnetised white dwarfs have all been seen to been observed to exhibit coherent, pulsed radio emission in relation to their rotational period. Recently, a new type of radio long period transient (LPT) has been discovered. The bright radio emission of LPTs resembles that of radio pulsars and magnetars. However, they pulse on timescales (minutes) much longer than previously seen. While minute timescales are common rotation periods for white dwarfs, LPTs are much brighter than the known pulsating white dwarfs, and dipolar radiation from isolated (as opposed to binary) magnetic white dwarfs has yet to be observed. Here, we report the discovery of a new $\sim$421~s LPT, CHIME J0630+25, using the CHIME/FRB and CHIME/Pulsar instruments. We used standard pulsar timing techniques and obtained a phase-coherent timing solution which yielded limits on the inferred magnetic field and characteristic age. CHIME J0630+25 is remarkably nearby ($170 \pm 80$~pc), making it the closest LPT discovered to date.</description>

      <title>The contribution of winds of star clusters to the Galactic cosmic-ray population</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmic rays are energetic nuclei that permeate the entire Galactic disk. Their existence requires the presence of powerful particle accelerators. While Galactic supernova explosions may supply the required energy, there is growing evidence that they cannot explain all of the observed properties of cosmic rays, such as their maximum particle energy and isotopic composition. Among Galactic objects, winds from stellar clusters meet the energetic requirement and provide a suitable environment for particle acceleration. The recent detection of some of these objects in gamma rays confirms that they indeed harbor high-energy particles.However, as most supernovae explode inside stellar clusters, it is difficult to distinguish the contribution of winds to particle acceleration. Here we report the detection of young star clusters in the nearby Vela molecular ridge star forming region. The young age of the systems guarantees an unbiased estimate of the stellar CR luminosity free from any supernova or pulsar contamination and allows us to draw conclusions on the acceleration efficiency and the total power supplied by these objects. We demonstrate that much more than 1% of the wind mechanical power is converted into CRs and consequently conclude that a small but non-negligible fraction ~ 1-10% of the CR population is contributed by stellar clusters.</description>

      <title>Extended gamma-ray emission from particle escape in pulsar wind nebulae -- Application to HESS J1809-193 and HESS J1825-137</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is growing evidence from gamma-ray observations at high and very high energies that particle escape is a key aspect shaping the morphological properties of pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe) at various evolutionary stages. We aim to provide a simple model for the gamma-ray emission from these objects including the transport of particles across the different components of the system. We applied it to sources HESS J1809-193 and HESS J1825-137. We developed a multi-zone framework applicable to dynamically young PWNe, taking into account the diffusive escape of relativistic electron-positron pairs out of the nebula into the parent supernova remnant (SNR) and their confinement downstream of the magnetic barrier of the forward shock until an eventual release into the surrounding interstellar medium (ISM). For a wide range of turbulence properties in the nebula, the GeV-TeV inverse-Compton radiation from pairs that escaped into the remnant can be a significant if not dominant contribution to the emission from the system. It may dominate the pion-decay radiation from cosmic rays accelerated at the forward shock and advected downstream of it. In the TeV-PeV range, the contribution from particles escaped into the ISM can exceed by far that of the SNR+PWN components. Applied to HESS J1809-193 and HESS J1825-137, we found that spatially extended GeV-TeV emission components can be accounted for mostly from particles escaped into the ISM, while morphologically more compact components above 50-100TeV are ascribed to the PWNe. In these two cases, the model suggests high turbulence in the nebula and a forward shock accelerating cosmic rays up to ~100TeV at most. The model provides the temporal and spectral properties of the flux of particles originally energized by the pulsar wind and ultimately released in the ISM. (Abridged).</description>

      <title>Black hole X-ray binary A0620$\unicode{x2013}$00 in quiescence: hints of Faraday rotation of near-infrared and optical polarization?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present simultaneous high-precision optical polarimetric and near-infrared (NIR) to ultraviolet (UV) photometric observations of low-mass black hole X-ray binary A0620$\unicode{x2013}$00 in the quiescent state. Subtracting interstellar polarization, estimated from a sample of field stars, we derive the intrinsic polarization of A0620$\unicode{x2013}$00. We show that the intrinsic polarization degree (PD) is variable with the orbital period with the amplitude of $\sim0.3\%$ at least in the $R$ band, where the signal-to-noise ratio of our observations is the best. It implies that some fraction of the optical polarization is produced by scattering of stellar radiation off the matter that follows the black hole in its orbital motion. In addition, we see a rotation of the orbit-average intrinsic polarization angle (PA) with the wavelength from $164\deg$ in the $R$ to $180\deg$ in the $B$ band. All of the above, combined with the historical NIR to optical polarimetric observations, shows the complex behavior of average intrinsic polarization of A0620$\unicode{x2013}$00 with the PA making continuous rotation from infrared to blue band by $\sim56\deg$ in total, while the PD $\sim1\%$ remains nearly constant over the entire spectral range. The spectral dependence of the PA can be described by Faraday rotation with the rotation measure of RM=$-0.2$ rad $\mu$m$^{-2}$, implying a few Gauss magnetic field in the plasma surrounding the black hole accretion disk. However, our preferred interpretation for the peculiar wavelength dependence is the interplay between two polarized components with different PAs. Polarimetric measurements in the UV range can help distinguishing between these scenarios.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the dead time effects of Insight-HXMT/ME on timing analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dead time is a common instrumental effect of X-ray detectors which would alter the behavior of timing properties of astronomical signals, such as distorting the shape of power density spectra (PDS), affecting the root-mean-square of potential quasi-periodic oscillation signals, etc. We revisit the effects of the dead time of Medium Energy X-ray telescope (ME) onboard Insight-HXMT, based on the simulation of electronic read-out mechanism that causes the dead time, and the real data. We investigate dead time effects on the pulse profile as well as the Quasi-Periodic Oscillation (QPO) signals. The dead time coefficient suggests a linear correlation with the observed count rate in each phase bin of the pulse profile according to the simulation of periodic signal as well as the real data observed on Swift J0243.6+6124. The Fourier-amplitude-difference (FAD) method could well recover the intrinsic shape of the observed PDS in the case that the PDS is from two identical detectors. We apply this technique on ME, by splitting the 9 FPGA modules into 2 groups. The results indicate that the FAD technique suits the case when two groups of detectors are not largely different; and the recovered PDS of Sco X-1 observed by ME slightly enhances the significance of the previously known QPO signal, meanwhile the root-mean-square of QPO is significantly improved. We provide the FAD correction tool implemented in HXMTDAS for users in the future to better analyze QPO signals.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Inference of Fine-Features of Nuclear Equation of State from Future Neutron Star Radius Measurements to 0.1km Accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To more precisely constrain the Equation of State (EOS) of supradense neutron-rich nuclear matter, future high-precision X-ray and gravitational wave observatories are proposed to measure the radii of neutron stars (NSs) with an accuracy better than about 0.1 km. However, it remains unclear what particular aspects (other than the stiffness generally spoken of in the literature) of the EOS and to what precision they will be better constrained. In this work, within a Bayesian framework using a meta-model EOS for NSs, we infer the posterior probability distribution functions (PDFs) of incompressibility $K_{0}$ and skewness $J_{0}$ of symmetric nuclear matter (SNM) as well as the slope $L$, curvature $K_{\rm{sym}}$, and skewness $J_{\rm{sym}}$ characterizing the density dependence of nuclear symmetry energy $E_{\rm{sym}}(\rho)$, respectively, from mean values of NS radii consistent with existing observations and an expected accuracy $\Delta R$ ranging from about 1.0 km to 0.1 km. We found that (1) the $\Delta R$ has little effect on inferring the stiffness of SNM at suprasaturation densities, (2) smaller $\Delta R$ reveals more accurately not only the PDFs but also pairwise correlations among parameters characterizing high-density $E_{\rm{sym}}(\rho)$, (3) a double-peak feature of the PDF($K_{\rm{sym}}$) corresponding to the strong $K_{\rm{sym}}-J_{\rm{sym}}$ and $K_{\rm{sym}}-L$ anti-correlations is revealed when $\Delta R$ is less than about 0.2 km, (4) the high-precision radius measurement for canonical NSs is more useful than that for massive ones for constraining the EOS of nucleonic matter around (2-3) times the saturation density of SNM.</description>

      <title>Probe and Prejudice: Classification of compact objects and model comparison using EOS knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nuclear theory and experiments, alongside astrophysical observations, constrain the equation of state (EOS) of supranuclear-dense matter. Conversely, knowledge of the EOS allows an improved interpretation of nuclear or astrophysical data. In this article, we use several established constraints on the EOS and the new NICER measurement of PSR J0437-4715 to comment on the nature of the primary companion in GW230529 and the companion of PSR J0514-4002E. We find that, with a probability of $\gtrsim 84\%$ and $\gtrsim 68\%$, respectively, both objects are black holes. These likelihoods increase to above $95\%$ when one uses GW170817's remnant as an upper limit on the TOV mass. We also demonstrate that the current knowledge of the EOS substantially disfavors high masses and radii for PSR J0030+0451, inferred recently when combining NICER with XMM-Newton background data and using particular hot-spot models. Finally, we also use our obtained EOS knowledge to comment on measurements of the nuclear symmetry energy, finding that the large value predicted by the PREX-II measurement displays some mild tension with other constraints on the EOS.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Three-Body Problem at High Eccentricities = Simple Pendulum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The gradual evolution of the restricted hierarchical three body problem is analyzed analytically, focusing on conditions of Kozai-Lidov Cycles that may lead to orbital flips from prograde to retrograde motion due to the octupole (third order) term which are associated with extremely high eccentricities. We revisit the approach described by Katz, Dong and Malhotra (\href{https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.107.181101}{Phys. Rev. Lett. 107, 181101 (2011)}) and show that for most initial conditions, to an excellent approximation, the analytic derivation can be greatly simplified and reduces to a simple pendulum model allowing an explicit flip criterion. The resulting flip criterion is much simpler than the previous one but the latter is still needed in a small fraction of phase space. We identify a logical error in the earlier derivation but clarify why it does not affect the final results.</description>

      <title>The Maximum Black Hole Mass at Solar Metallicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyse current knowledge and uncertainties in detailed stellar evolution and wind modelling to evaluate the mass of the most massive stellar black hole (BH) at solar metallicity. Contrary to common expectations that it is the most massive stars that would produce the most massive BHs, we find that the maximum $M_{\rm BH}^{\rm Max} \simeq 30 \pm 10\,M_{\odot}$ is found in the canonical intermediate range between $M_{\rm ZAMS} \simeq 30$ and $50\,M_{\odot}$ instead. The prime reason for this seemingly counter-intuitive finding is that very massive stars (VMS) have increasingly high mass-loss rates, leading to substantial mass evaporation before they expire as stars, ending as lighter BHs than their canonical O-star counterparts.</description>

      <title>A blazar in the epoch of reionization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Relativistic jets are thought to play a crucial role in the formation of massive galaxies and supermassive black holes. Here we report multi-wavelength and multi-epoch observations of the quasar VLASSJ0410-0139 at redshift z=7, powered by a 7e8 solar-mass black hole. Its radio variability, X-ray properties, and compact radio emission on parsec scales reveal that J0410-0139 is a blazar with a relativistic jet aligned with our line of sight. This blazar's existence implies that many more similar (unaligned) jetted sources must exist at z=7. One scenario is that we observe an intrinsically low-power radio jet, but we see it at high luminosity due to relativistic beaming effects. In this case, a large fraction (&gt;80%) of the UV bright quasars must have a similar jet to match the number density expected from the UV quasar luminosity function. These jets can enhance the growth of supermassive black holes and substantially affect their host galaxies. However, the implications would be even more severe if the quasar belongs to the top 10% radio luminous quasars, as measured if the beaming enhancement is less than a factor of 10-15. In this scenario, there should be hundreds to thousands of radio-quiet quasars at z=7 with intrinsic properties similar to J0410-0139 -- in strong tension with the number density of bright quasars derived from their UV luminosity function. To reconcile these results, most black hole growth at z=7 must happen in an obscured phase, as some models predict. The existence of supermassive black holes in the epoch of reionization is facilitated by significant jet-enhanced or obscured super-Eddington accretion.</description>

      <title>The spatial correlations between pulsars for interfering sources in Pulsar Timing Array and evidence for gravitational-wave background in NANOGrav 15-year data set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pulsar timing arrays (PTAs), aimed at detecting gravitational waves (GWs) in the $1\sim 100$ nHz range, have recently made significant strides. Compelling evidence has emerged for a common spectrum signal spatially correlated among pulsars, following a Hellings-Downs (HD) pattern, which is crucial for detecting a gravitational-wave background (GWB). However, the HD curve is expected for discrete and non-interfering sources, which is unlikely to hold in realistic scenarios with potential interference among numerous GW sources, such as the supermassive black-hole binaries. Incorporating interference was previously expected to introduce an irreducible uncertainty (known as "cosmic variance") in discerning the HD correlation; however, our work reveals how this interference generates measurable frequency-dependent spatial correlations distinct from the HD curve. The spatial correlations for interfering sources (referred to as "ISC") still exhibit contributions in the quadrupole and higher orders, resembling the HD correlation and encoding the nature of GW radiations. We apply these novel correlations to search for a GWB in the NANOGrav 15-year data set. In an optimistic estimation, our findings show a Bayes factor of $33.7\pm 3.2$ comparing ISC to the HD correlation, and an improvement in optimal statistic signal-to-noise ratio from $4.9\pm 1.1$ for the HD correlation to $6.6\pm 1.7$ for the ISC, highlighting the significant enhancement in evidence for detecting a GWB through incorporating interference.</description>

      <title>ler : LVK (LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration) event (compact-binary mergers) rate calculator and simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: '$ler$' is a statistics-based Python package specifically designed for computing detectable rates of both lensed and unlensed GW events, catering to the requirements of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Scientific Collaboration and astrophysics research scholars. The core functionality of '$ler$' intricately hinges upon the interplay of various components which include sampling the properties of compact-binary sources, lens galaxies characteristics, solving lens equations to derive properties of resultant images, and computing detectable GW rates. This comprehensive functionality builds on the leveraging of array operations and linear algebra from the $numpy$ library, enhanced by interpolation methods from $scipy$ and Python's $multiprocessing$ capabilities. Efficiency is further boosted by the $numba$ library's Just-In-Time ($njit$) compilation, optimizing extensive numerical computations and employing the inverse transform sampling method to replace more cumbersome rejection sampling. The modular design of '$ler$' not only optimizes speed and functionality but also ensures adaptability and upgradability, supporting the integration of additional statistics as research evolves. Currently, '$ler$' is an important tool in generating simulated GW events, both lensed and unlensed, and provides astrophysically accurate distributions of event-related parameters for both detectable and non-detectable events. This functionality aids in event validation and enhances the forecasting of detection capabilities across various GW detectors to study such events. The architecture of the '$ler$' API facilitates seamless compatibility with other software packages, allowing researchers to integrate and utilize its functionalities based on specific scientific requirements.</description>

      <title>New Gravitational Wave Discoveries Enabled by Machine Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The detection of gravitational waves has revolutionized our understanding of the universe, offering unprecedented insights into its dynamics. A major goal of gravitational wave data analysis is to speed up the detection and parameter estimation process using machine learning techniques, in light of an anticipated surge in detected events that would render traditional methods impractical. Here, we present the first detections of new gravitational-wave candidate events in data from a network of interferometric detectors enabled by machine learning. We discuss several new enhancements of our ResNet-based deep learning code, AresGW, that increased its sensitivity, including a new hierarchical classification of triggers, based on different noise and frequency filters. The enhancements resulted in a significant reduction in the false alarm rate, allowing AresGW to surpass traditional pipelines in the number of detected events in its effective training range (single source masses between 7 and 50 solar masses and source chirp masses between 10 and 40 solar masses), when the new detections are included. We calculate the astrophysical significance of events detected with AresGW using a logarithmic ranking statistic and injections into O3 data. Furthermore, we present spectrograms, parameter estimation, and reconstruction in the time domain for our new candidate events and discuss the distribution of their properties. In addition, the AresGW code exhibited very good performance when tested across various two-detector setups and on observational data from the O1 and O2 observing periods. Our findings underscore the remarkable potential of AresGW as a fast and sensitive detection algorithm for gravitational-wave astronomy, paving the way for a larger number of future discoveries.</description>

      <title>Photons from neutrinos: the gamma ray echo of a supernova neutrino burst</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13197v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When a star undergoes core collapse, a vast amount of energy is released in a ~10 s long burst of neutrinos of all species. Inverse beta decay in the star's hydrogen envelope causes an electromagnetic cascade which ultimately results in a flare of gamma rays - an "echo" of the neutrino burst - at the characteristic energy of 0.511 MeV. We study the phenomenology and detectability of this flare. Its luminosity curve is characterized by a fast, seconds-long, rise and an equally fast decline, with a minute- or hour-long plateau in between. For a near-Earth star (distance D&lt;1 kpc) the echo will be observable at near future gamma ray telescopes with an effective area of 10^3 cm^2 or larger. Its observation will inform us on the envelope size and composition. In conjunction with the direct detection of the neutrino burst, it will also give information on the neutrino emission away from the line of sight and will enable tests of neutrino propagation effects between the stellar surface and Earth.</description>

      <title>Constraining the mass of fermionic dark matter from its feeble interaction with hadronic matter via dark mediators in neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14419v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Considering ten well-known relativistic mean field models, we invoke feeble interaction between hadronic matter and fermionic dark matter (DM) $\chi$ via new physics scalar ($\phi$) and vector ($\xi$) mediators in neutron star core, thereby forming DM admixed neutron stars (DMANSs). The chosen masses of the DM fermion ($m_{\chi}$) and the mediators ($m_{\phi}$ and $m_{\xi}$) are consistent with the self-interaction constraint from Bullet cluster while their respective couplings ($y_{\phi}$ and $y_{\xi}$) are also constrained by the present day relic abundance. Assuming that both $\phi$ and $\xi$ contribute equally to the relic abundance, we compute the equation of state of the DMANSs and consequently their structural properties. We found that for a particular (constant) DM density, the presence of lighter DM results in more massive DMANSs with larger radius. In the light of the various recent constraints like those from the massive pulsar PSR J0740+6620, the gravitational wave (GW170817) data and the results of NICER experiments for PSR J0030+0451 and PSR J0740+6620, we provide a bound on $m_{\chi}$ within the framework of the present work as $m_{\chi}\approx$ (0.1 $-$ 30) GeV for a wide range of fixed DM Fermi momenta $k_F^{\chi}$=(0.01 $-$ 0.07) GeV. In the case of the hadronic models that yield larger radii corresponding to the low mass neutron stars in the no-DM scenario, interaction with comparatively heavier DM fermion is necessary in order to ensure that the DMANSs obtained with such models satisfy the radius constraints from both GW170817 and NICER data for PSR J0030+0451.</description>

Abstract: Shock breakout is the first electromagnetic signal from supernovae (SNe), which contains important information on the explosion energy and the size and chemical composition of the progenitor star. This paper presents the first two-dimensional (2D) multi-wavelength radiation hydrodynamics simulations of SN 1987A shock breakout by using the $\texttt{CASTRO}$ code with the opacity table, $\texttt{OPAL}$, considering eight photon groups from infrared to X-ray. To investigate the impact of the pre-supernova environment of SN 1987A, we consider three possible circumstellar medium (CSM) environments: a steady wind, an eruptive mass loss, and the existence of a companion star. In sum, the resulting breakout light curve has an hour duration and its peak luminosity of $\sim 6\times 10^{46}\,\rm{erg\,s^{-1}}$ then following a decay rate of $\sim 3.5\,\rm{mag\,hour^{-1}}$ in X-ray. The dominant band transits to UV around 3 hours after the initial breakout, and its luminosity has a decay rate of $\sim 1.5\,\rm{mag\,hour^{-1}}$ that agrees well with the observed shock breakout tail. The detailed features of breakout emission are sensitive to the pre-explosion environment. Furthermore, our 2D simulations demonstrate the importance of multidimensional mixing and its impacts on shock dynamics and radiation emission. The mixing emerging from the shock breakout may lead to a global asymmetry of SN ejecta and affect its later supernova remnant formation.</description>

      <title>Eddington envelopes: The fate of stars on parabolic orbits tidally disrupted by supermassive black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09381v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stars falling too close to massive black holes in the centres of galaxies can be torn apart by the strong tidal forces. Simulating the subsequent feeding of the black hole with disrupted material has proved challenging because of the range of timescales involved. Here we report a set of simulations that capture the relativistic disruption of the star, followed by one year of evolution of the returning debris stream. These reveal the formation of an expanding asymmetric bubble of material extending to hundreds of astronomical units -- an outflowing Eddington envelope with an optically thick inner region. Such envelopes have been hypothesised as the reprocessing layer needed to explain optical/UV emission in tidal disruption events, but never produced self-consistently in a simulation. Our model broadly matches the observed light curves with low temperatures, faint luminosities, and line widths of 10,000--20,000 km/s.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive study of compact stars with dark matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12875v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of compact stars admixed with non-self annihilating self-interacting fermionic dark matter, delineating the dependence on the nuclear equation of state by considering the two limiting parametrized equations of state for neutron star matter obtained by smoothly matching the low-density chiral effective theory and the high-density perturbative QCD. These two parametrizations are the limiting cases of a wide variety of smooth equations of state, i.e. the softest and stiffest possible one without a phase transition, that generate masses and radii compatible with 2M$_\odot$ observations and the tidal constraint from GW170817. With an exhaustive analysis of the possible stable mass-radius configurations, we determine the quantity of dark matter contained in stars with masses and radii compatible with the aforementioned astrophysical constraints. We find that for dark particle masses of a few tenths of GeV, the dark core collapses and no stable solutions are found for the two limiting ordinary matter equations of state. For lower masses, the dark matter fraction is limited to 10%, being at most 1% for masses ranging from 0.1 to 10 GeV for the limiting soft nuclear equation of state. For the limiting stiff nuclear equation of state, the dark matter fraction can reach values of more than 10%, but the dark particle mass is being constrained to 0.3 GeV and 10 GeV for the weak self-interacting case and has to be at least 5 GeV for the strong self-interacting one. For dark particle masses of less than 0.1 GeV, stable neutron star configurations should have less than 1% of self-interacting dark matter to be compatible with the constraint of the tidal deformability from GW170817 for the two limiting ordinary matter equations of state studied.</description>

      <title>On the energy budget of starquake-induced repeating fast radio bursts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07152v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With a growing sample of fast radio bursts (FRBs), we investigate the energy budget of different power sources within the framework of magnetar starquake triggering mechanism. During a starquake, the energy can be released in any form through strain, magnetic, rotational, and gravitational energies. The strain energy can be converted from other three kinds of energy during starquakes. The following findings are revealed: 1. The crust can store free magnetic energy of $\sim10^{46}$ erg by existing toroidal fields, sustaining $10^6$ bursts with frequent starquakes occurring due to crustal instability. 2. The strain energy develops as a rigid object spins down, which can be released during a global starquake accompanied by a glitch. However, it takes a long time to accumulate enough strain energy via spindown. 3. The rotational energy of a magnetar with $P\lesssim0.1\rm\,s$ can match the energy and luminosity budget of FRBs. 4. The budget of the total gravitational energy is high, but the mechanism and efficiency of converting this energy to radiation deserve further exploration.</description>

      <title>PixelPop: High Resolution Nonparameteric Inference of Gravitational-Wave Populations in Multiple Dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16813v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The origins of merging compact binaries observed by gravitational-wave detectors remains highly uncertain. Several astrophysical channels may contribute to the overall merger rate, with distinct formation processes imprinted on the structure and correlations in the underlying distributions of binary source parameters. In the absence of confident theoretical models, the current understanding of this population mostly relies on simple parametric models that make strong assumptions and are prone to misspecification. Recent work has made progress using more flexible nonparametric models, but detailed measurement of the multidimensional population remains challenging. In pursuit of this, we present PixelPop-a high resolution Bayesian nonparametric model to infer joint distributions and parameter correlations with minimal assumptions. PixelPop densely bins the joint parameter space and directly infers the merger rate in each bin, assuming only that bins are coupled to their nearest neighbors. We demonstrate this method on mock populations with and without bivariate source correlations, employing several statistical metrics for information gain and correlation significance to quantify our nonparametric results. We show that PixelPop correctly recovers the true populations within posterior uncertainties and offers a conservative assessment of population-level features and parameter correlations. Its flexibility and tractability make it a useful data-driven tool to probe gravitational-wave populations in multiple dimensions.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric analysis of correlations in the binary black hole population with LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16844v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Formation channels of merging compact binaries imprint themselves on the distributions and correlations of their source parameters, but current understanding of this population is hindered by simplified parametric models. We overcome such limitations using PixelPop [Heinzel et al. (2024)]-our Bayesian nonparametric multidimensional population model. We analyze data from the first three LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observing runs and make high resolution, minimally modeled measurements of the pairwise distributions of binary black hole masses, redshifts, and spins. We find no evidence that the mass spectrum evolves over redshift and show that such measurements are fundamentally limited by the detector horizon. We find support for correlations of the spin distribution with binary mass ratio and redshift, but at reduced significance compared to overly constraining parametric models. Confident data-driven conclusions about population-level correlations with flexible models like PixelPop will require more informative gravitational-wave catalogs.</description>

      <title>Spin-Flavor Precession Phase Effects in Supernova</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.06926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.06926v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the phase effects driven by neutrino magnetic moment for Majorana neutrinos in a core collapse supernova. A neutrino with a large magnetic moment is emitted in a superposition of energy eigenstates from the neutrinosphere. These energy eigenstates can interfere to create a phase effect at a partially adiabatic spin flavor precession (SFP) resonance. We examine the dependence of the SFP phase effect on the size of the neutrino magnetic moment as well as its variation with the post bounce time. In particular, at late post-bounce times the SFP resonance becomes wider and eventually overlaps with the Mikheev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein (MSW) resonance. At this point, Landau-Zener criteria for adiabaticity can no longer be applied to individual resonances, but we show that SFP phase effect is still present after the overlap. We also discuss the observability of the SFP phase effect at late post bounce times where it is more likely to make an impact. Our analysis for the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) reveals that at low energies event rates do not fluctuate despite the presence of a sizable SFP phase effect. We find larger event rate fluctuations at high energies, but these fluctuations are also erased in the energy spectra of the observed charged leptons. A more refined treatment of electron fraction and the inclusion of neutrino-neutrino interactions may change our conclusions for observability in future studies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.07358v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that extremal Kerr black holes are sensitive probes of new physics. Stringy or quantum corrections to general relativity are expected to generate higher-curvature terms in the gravitational action. We show that in the presence of these terms, asymptotically flat extremal rotating black holes have curvature singularities on their horizon. Furthermore, near-extremal black holes can have large yet finite tidal forces for infalling observers. In addition, we consider five-dimensional extremal charged black holes and show that higher-curvature terms can have a large effect on the horizon geometry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01838v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs), if captured by neutron stars (NSs), would emit a characteristic gravitational wave (GW) signal as they orbit inside the host star. We identify a specific and qualitatively new feature of these signals, namely quasi-periodic beats caused by the precession of noncircular PBH orbits. We demonstrate numerically and analytically that the beat frequency depends rather sensitively on the NS structure, so that hypothetical future observations with next-generation GW detectors would provide valuable constraints on the nuclear equation of state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01032v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study in detail the influence of different chemical potentials (baryon, charged, strange, and neutrino) on how and how fast a free gas of quarks in the zero-temperature limit reaches the conformal limit. We discuss the influence of non-zero masses, the inclusion of leptons, and different constraints, such as charge neutrality, zero-net strangeness, and fixed lepton fraction. We also investigate for the first time how the symmetry energy of the system under some of these conditions approaches the conformal limit. Finally, we briefly discuss what kind of corrections are expected from perturbative QCD as one goes away from the conformal limit.</description>

      <title>In-field phasing at the upgraded GMRT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06741v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In time-domain radio astronomy with arrays, voltages from individual antennas are added together with proper delay and fringe correction to form the beam in real-time. In order to achieve the correct phased addition of antenna voltages one has to also correct for the ionospheric and instrumental gains. Conventionally this is done using observations of a calibrator source located near to the target field. This scheme is sub-optimal since it does not correct for the variation of the gains with time and position in the sky. Further, since the ionospheric phase variation is typically most rapid at the longest baselines, the most distant antennas are often excluded while forming the beam. We present here a different methodology ("in-field phasing"), in which the gains are obtained in real-time using a model of the intensity distribution in the target field, which overcomes all of these drawbacks. We present observations with the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) which demonstrates that in-field phasing does lead to a significant improvement in sensitivity. We also show, using observations of the millisecond pulsar J1120$-$3618 that this in turn leads to a significant improvement of measurements of the Dispersion Measure and Time of Arrival. Finally, we present test observations of the GMRT discovered eclipsing black widow pulsar J1544+4937 showing that in-field phasing leads to improvement in the measurement of the cut-off frequency of the eclipse.</description>
