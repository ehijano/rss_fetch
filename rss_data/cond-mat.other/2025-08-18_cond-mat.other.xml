      <title>Generalized Neumann boundary condition for the scalar field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the Klein-Gordon field theory in $(D+1)$ dimensions in the presence of a $(D-1)$-dimensional hyperplanar $\delta$-like potential that couples quadratically to the field derivatives. This model effectively generalizes the Neumann boundary condition for the scalar field on the plane, as it reduces to this condition in an appropriate limit of the coupling parameter. Specifically, we calculate the modifications to the Feynman propagator induced by the planar potential and analyze the interaction energy between a stationary point-like source and the potential, obtaining a general and exact expression. We demonstrate that, under certain conditions relating the field mass and the coupling constant to the external potential, the vacuum state becomes unstable, giving rise to a pair-creation phenomenon that resembles the Schwinger effect in quantum electrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast X-ray interaction with photovoltaic materials: Thermal and nonthermal responses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cadmium telluride (CdTe), lead sulfide (PbS), and indium tin oxide (ITO) are important in various electronic technologies, for which laser irradiation is used to selectively modify and design their unique semiconductor properties. We employ the hybrid multiscale code XTANT-3 to simulate the kinetics of material response to ultrafast X-ray irradiation. The code accounts for nonequilibrium electronic and atomic dynamics, nonadiabatic coupling, nonthermal melting, and bond breaking due to electronic excitation. Among the materials studied, CdTe exhibits the highest radiation resistance, similar to CdS. At the respective threshold doses, the melting is primarily thermal, driven by electron-phonon coupling, which is accompanied by the band gap closure. Additionally, all materials show nonthermal melting at higher doses. Threshold doses increase further if energy sinks and recrystallization are included. In CdTe and PbS, below 1.5 eV/atom, the band gap returns to its original value upon recrystallization. As the dose increases, the cooled state becomes more amorphous, reducing the band gap until it stabilizes. Curiously, in a narrow window of deposited doses, ITO exhibit transient superionic behavior, with the liquid oxygen but solid In and Sn sublattices. At 0.6 eV/atom in CdTe and 0.4 eV/atom in PbS and ITO, material ablation from the surface occurs. The results suggest that femtosecond lasers may be used for tuning the band gap of photovoltaic semiconductors.</description>

      <title>Topological phase transition through tunable nearest-neighbor interactions in a one-dimensional lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14603v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the phase diagram of a one-dimensional model of hardcore bosons or spinless fermions with tunable nearest-neighbor interactions. By introducing alternating repulsive and attractive interactions on consecutive bonds, we show that the system undergoes a transition from a bond-ordered (BO) phase to a charge-density wave-II (CDW-II) phase as the attractive interaction strength increases at a fixed repulsive interaction. For a specific interaction pattern, the BO phase exhibits topological properties, which vanish when the pattern is altered, leading to a transition from a topological BO phase to a trivial BO phase through a gap-closing point where both interactions vanish. We identify these phases using a combination of order parameters, topological invariants, edge-state analysis and Thouless charge pumping. By extending our analysis beyond half-filling, we explore the phase diagram across all densities and identify the superfluid (SF) and the pair-superfluid (PSF) phases, characterized by single-particle and bound-pair excitations at incommensurate densities. The proposed model is experimentally realizable in platforms such as Rydberg excited or ultracold atoms in optical lattices, offering a versatile framework to study such interplay between topology and interactions in low-dimensional systems.</description>

      <title>Diffusion and instabilities in large-N holographic Fermi liquids: the vector fluctuations of the electron star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00211v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the hydrodynamic response of the AdS electron star in the vector sector, and compute the correlation functions and the transverse conductivity of the dual field theory. The system exhibits hydrodynamic behavior at low temperatures and near the critical temperature where the electron star undergoes the phase transition to the RN black hole. However, at intermediate temperatures the hydrodynamics does not exist. Remarkably, the system has an instability, i.e. a pole on the positive imaginary frequency axis at finite temperature. This instability is found both from analytical arguments and from numerics. Its physical meaning is so far unclear but it might mean that the ideal fluid limit for the star is a false vacuum.</description>
