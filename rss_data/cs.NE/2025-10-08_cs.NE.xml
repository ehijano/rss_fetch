      <title>From Neural Activity to Computation: Biological Reservoirs for Pattern Recognition in Digit Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a biologically grounded approach to reservoir computing (RC), in which a network of cultured biological neurons serves as the reservoir substrate. This system, referred to as biological reservoir computing (BRC), replaces artificial recurrent units with the spontaneous and evoked activity of living neurons. A multi-electrode array (MEA) enables simultaneous stimulation and readout across multiple sites: inputs are delivered through a subset of electrodes, while the remaining ones capture the resulting neural responses, mapping input patterns into a high-dimensional biological feature space. We evaluate the system through a case study on digit classification using a custom dataset. Input images are encoded and delivered to the biological reservoir via electrical stimulation, and the corresponding neural activity is used to train a simple linear classifier. To contextualize the performance of the biological system, we also include a comparison with a standard artificial reservoir trained on the same task. The results indicate that the biological reservoir can effectively support classification, highlighting its potential as a viable and interpretable computational substrate. We believe this work contributes to the broader effort of integrating biological principles into machine learning and aligns with the goals of human-inspired vision by exploring how living neural systems can inform the design of efficient and biologically plausible models.</description>

      <title>AgentZero++: Modeling Fear-Based Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present AgentZero++, an agent-based model that integrates cognitive, emotional, and social mechanisms to simulate decentralized collective violence in spatially distributed systems. Building on Epstein's Agent\_Zero framework, we extend the original model with eight behavioral enhancements: age-based impulse control; memory-based risk estimation; affect-cognition coupling; endogenous destructive radius; fight-or-flight dynamics; affective homophily; retaliatory damage; and multi-agent coordination. These additions allow agents to adapt based on internal states, previous experiences, and social feedback, producing emergent dynamics such as protest asymmetries, escalation cycles, and localized retaliation. Implemented in Python using the Mesa ABM framework, AgentZero++ enables modular experimentation and visualization of how micro-level cognitive heterogeneity shapes macro-level conflict patterns. Our results highlight how small variations in memory, reactivity, and affective alignment can amplify or dampen unrest through feedback loops. By explicitly modeling emotional thresholds, identity-driven behavior, and adaptive networks, this work contributes a flexible and extensible platform for analyzing affective contagion and psychologically grounded collective action.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Coevolutionary Illumination with Generational Adversarial MAP-Elites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06617v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quality-Diversity (QD) algorithms seek to discover diverse, high-performing solutions across a behavior space, contrasting with conventional optimization methods that target a single optimum. Adversarial problems present unique challenges for QD approaches, as the competing nature of opposing sides creates interdependencies that complicate the evolution process. Existing QD methods applied to such scenarios typically fix one side, constraining behavioral diversity. We present Generational Adversarial MAP-Elites (GAME), a coevolutionary QD algorithm that evolves both sides by alternating which side is evolved at each generation. By integrating a vision embedding model, our approach eliminates the need for domain-specific behavior descriptors and instead operates on video. We validate GAME across three distinct adversarial domains: a multi-agent battle game, a soft-robot wrestling environment, and a deck building game. Our experiments reveal several evolutionary phenomena, including arms-race-like dynamics, enhanced novelty through generational extinction, and the preservation of neutral mutations as crucial stepping stones toward the highest performance. While GAME successfully illuminates all adversarial problems, its capacity for truly open-ended discovery remains constrained by the finite nature of the underlying search spaces. These findings establish GAME's broad applicability while highlighting opportunities for future research into open-ended adversarial coevolution.</description>

      <title>Accuracy-Robustness Trade Off via Spiking Neural Network Gradient Sparsity Trail</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23762v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have attracted growing interest in both computational neuroscience and artificial intelligence, primarily due to their inherent energy efficiency and compact memory footprint. However, achieving adversarial robustness in SNNs, particularly for vision-related tasks, remains a nascent and underexplored challenge. Recent studies have proposed leveraging sparse gradients as a form of regularization to enhance robustness against adversarial perturbations. In this work, we present a surprising finding: under specific architectural configurations, SNNs exhibit natural gradient sparsity and can achieve state-of-the-art adversarial defense performance without the need for any explicit regularization. Further analysis reveals a trade-off between robustness and generalization: while sparse gradients contribute to improved adversarial resilience, they can impair the model's ability to generalize; conversely, denser gradients support better generalization but increase vulnerability to attacks.</description>

      <title>Solar Irradiation Forecasting using Genetic Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.13956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.13956v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Renewable energy forecasting is attaining greater importance due to its constant increase in contribution to the electrical power grids. Solar energy is one of the most significant contributors to renewable energy and is dependent on solar irradiation. For the effective management of electrical power grids, forecasting models that predict solar irradiation, with high accuracy, are needed. In the current study, Machine Learning techniques such as Linear Regression, Extreme Gradient Boosting and Genetic Algorithm Optimization are used to forecast solar irradiation. The data used for training and validation is recorded from across three different geographical stations in the United States that are part of the SURFRAD network. A Global Horizontal Index (GHI) is predicted for the models built and compared. Genetic Algorithm Optimization is applied to XGB to further improve the accuracy of solar irradiation prediction.</description>
