      <title>HeartUnloadNet: A Weakly-Supervised Cycle-Consistent Graph Network for Predicting Unloaded Cardiac Geometry from Diastolic States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The unloaded cardiac geometry (i.e., the state of the heart devoid of luminal pressure) serves as a valuable zero-stress and zero-strain reference and is critical for personalized biomechanical modeling of cardiac function, to understand both healthy and diseased physiology and to predict the effects of cardiac interventions. However, estimating the unloaded geometry from clinical images remains a challenging task. Traditional approaches rely on inverse finite element (FE) solvers that require iterative optimization and are computationally expensive. In this work, we introduce HeartUnloadNet, a deep learning framework that predicts the unloaded left ventricular (LV) shape directly from the end diastolic (ED) mesh while explicitly incorporating biophysical priors. The network accepts a mesh of arbitrary size along with physiological parameters such as ED pressure, myocardial stiffness scale, and fiber helix orientation, and outputs the corresponding unloaded mesh. It adopts a graph attention architecture and employs a cycle-consistency strategy to enable bidirectional (loading and unloading) prediction, allowing for partial self-supervision that improves accuracy and reduces the need for large training datasets. Trained and tested on 20,700 FE simulations across diverse LV geometries and physiological conditions, HeartUnloadNet achieves sub-millimeter accuracy, with an average DSC of 0.986 and HD of 0.083 cm, while reducing inference time to just 0.02 seconds per case, over 10^5 times faster and significantly more accurate than traditional inverse FE solvers. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of the architecture. Notably, the cycle-consistent design enables the model to maintain a DSC of 97% even with as few as 200 training samples. This work thus presents a scalable and accurate surrogate for inverse FE solvers, supporting real-time clinical applications in the future.</description>

      <title>Estimating Sensitivity Maps for X-Nuclei Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopic Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this research is to estimate sensitivity maps when imaging X-nuclei that may not have a significant presence throughout the field of view. We propose to estimate the coil's sensitivities by solving a least-squares problem where each row corresponds to an individual estimate of the sensitivity for a given voxel. Multiple estimates come from the multiple bins of the spectrum with spectroscopy, multiple times with dynamic imaging, or multiple frequencies when utilizing spectral excitation. The method presented in this manuscript, called the L2 optimal method, is compared to the commonly used RefPeak method which uses the spectral bin with the highest energy to estimate the sensitivity maps. The L2 optimal method yields more accurate sensitivity maps when imaging a numerical phantom and is shown to yield a higher signal-to-noise ratio when imaging the brain, pancreas, and heart with hyperpolarized pyruvate as the contrast agent with hyperpolarized MRI. The L2 optimal method is able to better estimate the sensitivity by extracting more information from the measurements.</description>

      <title>SAM2-Aug: Prior knowledge-based Augmentation for Target Volume Auto-Segmentation in Adaptive Radiation Therapy Using Segment Anything Model 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Purpose: Accurate tumor segmentation is vital for adaptive radiation therapy (ART) but remains time-consuming and user-dependent. Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) shows promise for prompt-based segmentation but struggles with tumor accuracy. We propose prior knowledge-based augmentation strategies to enhance SAM2 for ART.
  Methods: Two strategies were introduced to improve SAM2: (1) using prior MR images and annotations as contextual inputs, and (2) improving prompt robustness via random bounding box expansion and mask erosion/dilation. The resulting model, SAM2-Aug, was fine-tuned and tested on the One-Seq-Liver dataset (115 MRIs from 31 liver cancer patients), and evaluated without retraining on Mix-Seq-Abdomen (88 MRIs, 28 patients) and Mix-Seq-Brain (86 MRIs, 37 patients).
  Results: SAM2-Aug outperformed convolutional, transformer-based, and prompt-driven models across all datasets, achieving Dice scores of 0.86(liver), 0.89(abdomen), and 0.90(brain). It demonstrated strong generalization across tumor types and imaging sequences, with improved performance in boundary-sensitive metrics.
  Conclusions: Incorporating prior images and enhancing prompt diversity significantly boosts segmentation accuracy and generalizability. SAM2-Aug offers a robust, efficient solution for tumor segmentation in ART. Code and models will be released at https://github.com/apple1986/SAM2-Aug.</description>

      <title>Time-resolved dynamic CBCT reconstruction using prior-model-free spatiotemporal Gaussian representation (PMF-STGR)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22139v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time-resolved CBCT imaging, which reconstructs a dynamic sequence of CBCTs reflecting intra-scan motion (one CBCT per x-ray projection without phase sorting or binning), is highly desired for regular and irregular motion characterization, patient setup, and motion-adapted radiotherapy. Representing patient anatomy and associated motion fields as 3D Gaussians, we developed a Gaussian representation-based framework (PMF-STGR) for fast and accurate dynamic CBCT reconstruction. PMF-STGR comprises three major components: a dense set of 3D Gaussians to reconstruct a reference-frame CBCT for the dynamic sequence; another 3D Gaussian set to capture three-level, coarse-to-fine motion-basis-components (MBCs) to model the intra-scan motion; and a CNN-based motion encoder to solve projection-specific temporal coefficients for the MBCs. Scaled by the temporal coefficients, the learned MBCs will combine into deformation vector fields to deform the reference CBCT into projection-specific, time-resolved CBCTs to capture the dynamic motion. Due to the strong representation power of 3D Gaussians, PMF-STGR can reconstruct dynamic CBCTs in a 'one-shot' training fashion from a standard 3D CBCT scan, without using any prior anatomical or motion model. We evaluated PMF-STGR using XCAT phantom simulations and real patient scans. Metrics including the image relative error, structural-similarity-index-measure, tumor center-of-mass-error, and landmark localization error were used to evaluate the accuracy of solved dynamic CBCTs and motion. PMF-STGR shows clear advantages over a state-of-the-art, INR-based approach, PMF-STINR. Compared with PMF-STINR, PMF-STGR reduces reconstruction time by 50% while reconstructing less blurred images with better motion accuracy. With improved efficiency and accuracy, PMF-STGR enhances the applicability of dynamic CBCT imaging for potential clinical translation.</description>

      <title>AFIRE: Accurate and Fast Image Reconstruction Algorithm for Geometric-inconsistent Multispectral CT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24793v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For nonlinear multispectral computed tomography (CT), accurate and fast image reconstruction is challenging when the scanning geometries under different X-ray energy spectra are inconsistent or mismatched. Motivated by this, we propose an Accurate and Fast Image REconstruction (AFIRE) algorithm to address such problems in the case of mildly full scan. From the continuous (resp. discrete) setting, we discover that the derivative operator (gradient) of the involved nonlinear mapping at some special points, for example, at zero, can be represented as a composition (block multiplication) of a diagonal operator (matrix) composed of X-ray transforms (projection matrices) and a very small-scale matrix. Based on these insights, the AFIRE algorithm is proposed by leveraging the simplified Newton method. Under proper conditions, we establish the convergence theory of the proposed algorithm. Furthermore, numerical experiments are also carried out to verify that the proposed algorithm can accurately and effectively reconstruct the basis images in completely geometric-inconsistent dual-energy CT with noiseless and noisy projection data. Particularly, the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms some state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency. Finally, the flexibility and extensibility of the proposed algorithm are also demonstrated.</description>
