      <title>Heading towards an Algebraic Heisenberg Cut</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In previous papers we have explained how a sequence of theorems by John von Neumann on infinite tensor products (ITP) can be understood as providing elements to support both sectorisation of the Hilbert space of large quantum systems, and a mechanism of self decoherence thereof. These two effects may help understanding the articulation of the classical and quantum realms. However, as they involve considering an infinite number of quantum degrees of freedom, legitimate concerns can be raised on their applicability. In this paper, we address explicitly the interface between both realms through the example of a simplified model of a photon polarisation measurement device. Guided by the fact that there is von Neumann sectorisation at infinity, and by the necessity of classical contexts to perform measurements, we show that this limit can be under control, and that although the full force of the sectorisation theorems requires taking the infinite limit, early signs of the macroscopic behaviour appear before infinity. In our example, this shows up in photodiodes through diverging electron avalanches that simultaneously make the system classical, localise it randomly in a macroscopic sector and provide a macroscopic signal. This lays the grounds for justifying the inclusion in quantum physics of the ITP formalism, which involves non-separable Hilbert spaces and potentially type-III von Neumann algebras. Such an approach could make sense of the quantum-classical transition as a primarily algebraic one.</description>

      <title>From Hadrons to Gravitons via Strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The first quantum string theories were developed around 1970, prior to the discovery of QCD, with the goal of producing a theory of hadrons. Basic physical requirements and mathematical consistency of the string theories known at that time turned out to require the inclusion of gravity and the existence of extra spatial dimensions. This came as a complete surprise to everyone who was involved. It led to a completely new and very ambitious goal for string theory research, namely a unified quantum theory of gravity and all other forces. In particular, this goal requires that the string tension is 20 orders of magnitude larger than was previously envisioned. Fifty years later, this goal is widely shared.</description>

      <title>Enaction for QBists</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04230v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper began as a set of notes introducing quantum physicists of the QBist persuasion to enactive theory. Unlike mainstream cognitive science, which views cognition as computations on internal representations of the external world (and thus the mind as in the head), the enactive approach sees cognition as adaptive, embodied action. Enaction can ground concepts of experience, agency, knowledge, and normativity - which play key roles in QBist quantum mechanics - in terms consistent with QBism's participatory approach. That's because QBism and enaction both reject an absolute, pregiven subject-object split: for QBism, quantum measurement is the enactment of the subject-object divide; for enaction, cognition is the enactment of that divide. Indeed, each appears to be half of the same story. QBism is a theory of how the world is created and recreated through interactions with an agent, while enaction is a theory of how agents are created and recreated through interactions with the world. Through conversations with QBists and enactivists, these notes evolved into a larger project aimed at unifying QBist physics with enactive cognitive science. Taken together, they offer the possibility of a unified metaphysics - one that brings subject and object, mind and world, back together again.</description>
