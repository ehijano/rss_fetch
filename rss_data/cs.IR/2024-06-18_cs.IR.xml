      <title>Personalized Federated Knowledge Graph Embedding with Client-Wise Relation Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated Knowledge Graph Embedding (FKGE) has recently garnered considerable interest due to its capacity to extract expressive representations from distributed knowledge graphs, while concurrently safeguarding the privacy of individual clients. Existing FKGE methods typically harness the arithmetic mean of entity embeddings from all clients as the global supplementary knowledge, and learn a replica of global consensus entities embeddings for each client. However, these methods usually neglect the inherent semantic disparities among distinct clients. This oversight not only results in the globally shared complementary knowledge being inundated with too much noise when tailored to a specific client, but also instigates a discrepancy between local and global optimization objectives. Consequently, the quality of the learned embeddings is compromised. To address this, we propose Personalized Federated knowledge graph Embedding with client-wise relation Graph (PFedEG), a novel approach that employs a client-wise relation graph to learn personalized embeddings by discerning the semantic relevance of embeddings from other clients. Specifically, PFedEG learns personalized supplementary knowledge for each client by amalgamating entity embedding from its neighboring clients based on their "affinity" on the client-wise relation graph. Each client then conducts personalized embedding learning based on its local triples and personalized supplementary knowledge. We conduct extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets to evaluate our method against state-of-the-art models and results demonstrate the superiority of our method.</description>

      <title>When Box Meets Graph Neural Network in Tag-aware Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Last year has witnessed the re-flourishment of tag-aware recommender systems supported by the LLM-enriched tags. Unfortunately, though large efforts have been made, current solutions may fail to describe the diversity and uncertainty inherent in user preferences with only tag-driven profiles. Recently, with the development of geometry-based techniques, e.g., box embedding, diversity of user preferences now could be fully modeled as the range within a box in high dimension space. However, defect still exists as these approaches are incapable of capturing high-order neighbor signals, i.e., semantic-rich multi-hop relations within the user-tag-item tripartite graph, which severely limits the effectiveness of user modeling. To deal with this challenge, in this paper, we propose a novel algorithm, called BoxGNN, to perform the message aggregation via combination of logical operations, thereby incorporating high-order signals. Specifically, we first embed users, items, and tags as hyper-boxes rather than simple points in the representation space, and define two logical operations to facilitate the subsequent process. Next, we perform the message aggregation mechanism via the combination of logical operations, to obtain the corresponding high-order box representations. Finally, we adopt a volume-based learning objective with Gumbel smoothing techniques to refine the representation of boxes. Extensive experiments on two publicly available datasets and one LLM-enhanced e-commerce dataset have validated the superiority of BoxGNN compared with various state-of-the-art baselines. The code is released online</description>

      <title>Balancing Embedding Spectrum for Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern recommender systems heavily rely on high-quality representations learned from high-dimensional sparse data. While significant efforts have been invested in designing powerful algorithms for extracting user preferences, the factors contributing to good representations have remained relatively unexplored. In this work, we shed light on an issue in the existing pair-wise learning paradigm (i.e., the embedding collapse problem), that the representations tend to span a subspace of the whole embedding space, leading to a suboptimal solution and reducing the model capacity. Specifically, optimization on observed interactions is equivalent to a low pass filter causing users/items to have the same representations and resulting in a complete collapse. While negative sampling acts as a high pass filter to alleviate the collapse by balancing the embedding spectrum, its effectiveness is only limited to certain losses, which still leads to an incomplete collapse. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel method called DirectSpec, acting as a reliable all pass filter to balance the spectrum distribution of the embeddings during training, ensuring that users/items effectively span the entire embedding space. Additionally, we provide a thorough analysis of DirectSpec from a decorrelation perspective and propose an enhanced variant, DirectSpec+, which employs self-paced gradients to optimize irrelevant samples more effectively. Moreover, we establish a close connection between DirectSpec+ and uniformity, demonstrating that contrastive learning (CL) can alleviate the collapse issue by indirectly balancing the spectrum. Finally, we implement DirectSpec and DirectSpec+ on two popular recommender models: MF and LightGCN. Our experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness and efficiency over competitive baselines.</description>

      <title>Mutual Learning for Finetuning Click-Through Rate Prediction Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction has become an essential task in digital industries, such as digital advertising or online shopping. Many deep learning-based methods have been implemented and have become state-of-the-art models in the domain. To further improve the performance of CTR models, Knowledge Distillation based approaches have been widely used. However, most of the current CTR prediction models do not have much complex architectures, so it's hard to call one of them 'cumbersome' and the other one 'tiny'. On the other hand, the performance gap is also not very large between complex and simple models. So, distilling knowledge from one model to the other could not be worth the effort. Under these considerations, Mutual Learning could be a better approach, since all the models could be improved mutually. In this paper, we showed how useful the mutual learning algorithm could be when it is between equals. In our experiments on the Criteo and Avazu datasets, the mutual learning algorithm improved the performance of the model by up to 0.66% relative improvement.</description>

      <title>Intermediate Distillation: Data-Efficient Distillation from Black-Box LLMs for Information Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent research has explored distilling knowledge from large language models (LLMs) to optimize retriever models, especially within the retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework. However, most existing training methods rely on extracting supervision signals from LLMs' weights or their output probabilities, which is not only resource-intensive but also incompatible with black-box LLMs. In this paper, we introduce \textit{Intermediate Distillation}, a data-efficient knowledge distillation training scheme that treats LLMs as black boxes and distills their knowledge via an innovative LLM-ranker-retriever pipeline, solely using LLMs' ranking generation as the supervision signal. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method can significantly improve the performance of retriever models with only 1,000 training instances. Moreover, our distilled retriever model significantly boosts performance in question-answering tasks within the RAG framework, demonstrating the potential of LLMs to economically and effectively train smaller models.</description>

      <title>CherryRec: Enhancing News Recommendation Quality via LLM-driven Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in language understanding and generation. Custom LLMs leveraging textual features have been applied to recommendation systems, demonstrating improvements across various recommendation scenarios. However, most existing methods perform untrained recommendation based on pre-trained knowledge (e.g., movie recommendation), and the auto-regressive generation of LLMs leads to slow inference speeds, making them less effective in real-time recommendations.To address this, we propose a framework for news recommendation using LLMs, named \textit{CherryRec}, which ensures the quality of recommendations while accelerating the recommendation process. Specifically, we employ a Knowledge-aware News Rapid Selector to retrieve candidate options based on the user's interaction history. The history and retrieved items are then input as text into a fine-tuned LLM, the Content-aware News Llm Evaluator, designed to enhance news recommendation capabilities. Finally, the Value-aware News Scorer integrates the scores to compute the CherryRec Score, which serves as the basis for the final recommendation.We validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework by comparing it with state-of-the-art baseline methods on benchmark datasets. Our experimental results consistently show that CherryRec outperforms the baselines in both recommendation performance and efficiency.The project resource can be accessed at: \url{https://github.com/xxxxxx}</description>

      <title>A Gradient Accumulation Method for Dense Retriever under Memory Constraint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: InfoNCE loss is commonly used to train dense retriever in information retrieval tasks. It is well known that a large batch is essential to stable and effective training with InfoNCE loss, which requires significant hardware resources. Due to the dependency of large batch, dense retriever has bottleneck of application and research. Recently, memory reduction methods have been broadly adopted to resolve the hardware bottleneck by decomposing forward and backward or using a memory bank. However, current methods still suffer from slow and unstable training. To address these issues, we propose \longmodelname\ (\modelname), a stable and efficient memory reduction method for dense retriever trains that uses a dual memory bank structure to leverage previously generated query and passage representations. Experiments on widely used five information retrieval datasets indicate that \modelname\ can surpass not only existing memory reduction methods but also high-resource scenario. Moreover, theoretical analysis and experimental results confirm that \modelname\ provides more stable dual-encoder training than current memory bank utilization methods.</description>

      <title>LLM-enhanced Reranking in Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reranking is a critical component in recommender systems, playing an essential role in refining the output of recommendation algorithms. Traditional reranking models have focused predominantly on accuracy, but modern applications demand consideration of additional criteria such as diversity and fairness. Existing reranking approaches often fail to harmonize these diverse criteria effectively at the model level. Moreover, these models frequently encounter challenges with scalability and personalization due to their complexity and the varying significance of different reranking criteria in diverse scenarios. In response, we introduce a comprehensive reranking framework enhanced by LLM, designed to seamlessly integrate various reranking criteria while maintaining scalability and facilitating personalized recommendations. This framework employs a fully connected graph structure, allowing the LLM to simultaneously consider multiple aspects such as accuracy, diversity, and fairness through a coherent Chain-of-Thought (CoT) process. A customizable input mechanism is also integrated, enabling the tuning of the language model's focus to meet specific reranking needs. We validate our approach using three popular public datasets, where our framework demonstrates superior performance over existing state-of-the-art reranking models in balancing multiple criteria. The code for this implementation is publicly available.</description>

      <title>Improving Multi-modal Recommender Systems by Denoising and Aligning Multi-modal Content and User Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-modal recommender systems (MRSs) are pivotal in diverse online web platforms and have garnered considerable attention in recent years. However, previous studies overlook the challenges of (1) noisy multi-modal content, (2) noisy user feedback, and (3) aligning multi-modal content with user feedback. In order to tackle these challenges, we propose Denoising and Aligning Multi-modal Recommender System (DA-MRS). To mitigate multi-modal noise, DA-MRS first constructs item-item graphs determined by consistent content similarity across modalities. To denoise user feedback, DA-MRS associates the probability of observed feedback with multi-modal content and devises a denoised BPR loss. Furthermore, DA-MRS implements Alignment guided by User preference to enhance task-specific item representation and Alignment guided by graded Item relations to provide finer-grained alignment. Extensive experiments verify that DA-MRS is a plug-and-play framework and achieves significant and consistent improvements across various datasets, backbone models, and noisy scenarios.</description>

      <title>LLM4MSR: An LLM-Enhanced Paradigm for Multi-Scenario Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the demand for more personalized recommendation grows and a dramatic boom in commercial scenarios arises, the study on multi-scenario recommendation (MSR) has attracted much attention, which uses the data from all scenarios to simultaneously improve their recommendation performance. However, existing methods tend to integrate insufficient scenario knowledge and neglect learning personalized cross-scenario preferences, thus leading to suboptimal performance and inadequate interpretability. Meanwhile, though large language model (LLM) has shown great capability of reasoning and capturing semantic information, the high inference latency and high computation cost of tuning hinder its implementation in industrial recommender systems. To fill these gaps, we propose an effective efficient interpretable LLM-enhanced paradigm LLM4MSR in this work. Specifically, we first leverage LLM to uncover multi-level knowledge including scenario correlations and users' cross-scenario interests from the designed scenario- and user-level prompt without fine-tuning the LLM, then adopt hierarchical meta networks to generate multi-level meta layers to explicitly improves the scenario-aware and personalized recommendation capability. Our experiments on KuaiSAR-small, KuaiSAR, and Amazon datasets validate two significant advantages of LLM4MSR: (i) the effectiveness and compatibility with different multi-scenario backbone models (achieving 1.5%, 1%, and 40% AUC improvement on three datasets), (ii) high efficiency and deployability on industrial recommender systems, and (iii) improved interpretability. The implemented code and data is available to ease reproduction.</description>

      <title>Predicting Award Winning Research Papers at Publication Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, many studies have been focusing on predicting the scientific impact of research papers. Most of these predictions are based on citations count or rely on features obtainable only from already published papers. In this study, we predict the likelihood for a research paper of winning an award only relying on information available at publication time. For each paper, we build the citation subgraph induced from its bibliography. We initially consider some features of this subgraph, such as the density and the global clustering coefficient, to make our prediction. Then, we mix this information with textual features, extracted from the abstract and the title, to obtain a more accurate final prediction. We made our experiments considering the ArnetMiner citation graph, while the ground truth on award-winning papers has been obtained from a collection of best paper awards from 32 computer science conferences. In our experiment, we obtained an encouraging F1 score of 0.694. Remarkably, The high recall and the low false negatives rate, show how the model performs very well at identifying papers that will not win an award. This behavior can help researchers in getting a first evaluation of their work at publication time. Lastly, we made some first experiments on interpretability. Our results highlight some interesting patterns both in topological and textual features.</description>

      <title>Behavior-Dependent Linear Recurrent Units for Efficient Sequential Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sequential recommender systems aims to predict the users' next interaction through user behavior modeling with various operators like RNNs and attentions. However, existing models generally fail to achieve the three golden principles for sequential recommendation simultaneously, i.e., training efficiency, low-cost inference, and strong performance. To this end, we propose RecBLR, an Efficient Sequential Recommendation Model based on Behavior-Dependent Linear Recurrent Units to accomplish the impossible triangle of the three principles. By incorporating gating mechanisms and behavior-dependent designs into linear recurrent units, our model significantly enhances user behavior modeling and recommendation performance. Furthermore, we unlock the parallelizable training as well as inference efficiency for our model by designing a hardware-aware scanning acceleration algorithm with a customized CUDA kernel. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets with varying lengths of user behavior sequences demonstrate RecBLR's remarkable effectiveness in simultaneously achieving all three golden principles - strong recommendation performance, training efficiency, and low-cost inference, while exhibiting excellent scalability to datasets with long user interaction histories.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Differentiable Search Index (DSI) utilizes Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) for efficient document retrieval without relying on external indexes. However, DSIs need full re-training to handle updates in dynamic corpora, causing significant computational inefficiencies. We introduce PromptDSI, a rehearsal-free, prompt-based approach for instance-wise incremental learning in document retrieval. PromptDSI attaches prompts to the frozen PLM's encoder of DSI, leveraging its powerful representation to efficiently index new corpora while maintaining a balance between stability and plasticity. We eliminate the initial forward pass of prompt-based continual learning methods that doubles training and inference time. Moreover, we propose a topic-aware prompt pool that employs neural topic embeddings as fixed keys. This strategy ensures diverse and effective prompt usage, addressing the challenge of parameter underutilization caused by the collapse of the query-key matching mechanism. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that PromptDSI matches IncDSI in managing forgetting while significantly enhancing recall by over 4% on new corpora.</description>

      <title>News Without Borders: Domain Adaptation of Multilingual Sentence Embeddings for Cross-lingual News Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rapidly growing numbers of multilingual news consumers pose an increasing challenge to news recommender systems in terms of providing customized recommendations. First, existing neural news recommenders, even when powered by multilingual language models (LMs), suffer substantial performance losses in zero-shot cross-lingual transfer (ZS-XLT). Second, the current paradigm of fine-tuning the backbone LM of a neural recommender on task-specific data is computationally expensive and infeasible in few-shot recommendation and cold-start setups, where data is scarce or completely unavailable. In this work, we propose a news-adapted sentence encoder (NaSE), domain-specialized from a pretrained massively multilingual sentence encoder (SE). To this end, we construct and leverage PolyNews and PolyNewsParallel, two multilingual news-specific corpora. With the news-adapted multilingual SE in place, we test the effectiveness of (i.e., question the need for) supervised fine-tuning for news recommendation, and propose a simple and strong baseline based on (i) frozen NaSE embeddings and (ii) late click-behavior fusion. We show that NaSE achieves state-of-the-art performance in ZS-XLT in true cold-start and few-shot news recommendation.</description>

      <title>GAugLLM: Improving Graph Contrastive Learning for Text-Attributed Graphs with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work studies self-supervised graph learning for text-attributed graphs (TAGs) where nodes are represented by textual attributes. Unlike traditional graph contrastive methods that perturb the numerical feature space and alter the graph's topological structure, we aim to improve view generation through language supervision. This is driven by the prevalence of textual attributes in real applications, which complement graph structures with rich semantic information. However, this presents challenges because of two major reasons. First, text attributes often vary in length and quality, making it difficulty to perturb raw text descriptions without altering their original semantic meanings. Second, although text attributes complement graph structures, they are not inherently well-aligned. To bridge the gap, we introduce GAugLLM, a novel framework for augmenting TAGs. It leverages advanced large language models like Mistral to enhance self-supervised graph learning. Specifically, we introduce a mixture-of-prompt-expert technique to generate augmented node features. This approach adaptively maps multiple prompt experts, each of which modifies raw text attributes using prompt engineering, into numerical feature space. Additionally, we devise a collaborative edge modifier to leverage structural and textual commonalities, enhancing edge augmentation by examining or building connections between nodes. Empirical results across five benchmark datasets spanning various domains underscore our framework's ability to enhance the performance of leading contrastive methods as a plug-in tool. Notably, we observe that the augmented features and graph structure can also enhance the performance of standard generative methods, as well as popular graph neural networks. The open-sourced implementation of our GAugLLM is available at Github.</description>

      <title>UniGLM: Training One Unified Language Model for Text-Attributed Graphs</title>

Abstract: Representation learning on text-attributed graphs (TAGs), where nodes are represented by textual descriptions, is crucial for textual and relational knowledge systems and recommendation systems. Currently, state-of-the-art embedding methods for TAGs primarily focus on fine-tuning language models (e.g., BERT) using structure-aware training signals. While effective, these methods are tailored for individual TAG and cannot generalize across various graph scenarios. Given the shared textual space, leveraging multiple TAGs for joint fine-tuning, aligning text and graph structure from different aspects, would be more beneficial. Motivated by this, we introduce a novel Unified Graph Language Model (UniGLM) framework, the first graph embedding model that generalizes well to both in-domain and cross-domain TAGs. Specifically, UniGLM is trained over multiple TAGs with different domains and scales using self-supervised contrastive learning. UniGLM includes an adaptive positive sample selection technique for identifying structurally similar nodes and a lazy contrastive module that is devised to accelerate training by minimizing repetitive encoding calculations. Extensive empirical results across 9 benchmark TAGs demonstrate UniGLM's efficacy against leading embedding baselines in terms of generalization (various downstream tasks and backbones) and transfer learning (in and out of domain scenarios). The code is available at https://github.com/NYUSHCS/UniGLM.</description>

      <title>RIGL: A Unified Reciprocal Approach for Tracing the Independent and Group Learning Processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the realm of education, both independent learning and group learning are esteemed as the most classic paradigms. The former allows learners to self-direct their studies, while the latter is typically characterized by teacher-directed scenarios. Recent studies in the field of intelligent education have leveraged deep temporal models to trace the learning process, capturing the dynamics of students' knowledge states, and have achieved remarkable performance. However, existing approaches have primarily focused on modeling the independent learning process, with the group learning paradigm receiving less attention. Moreover, the reciprocal effect between the two learning processes, especially their combined potential to foster holistic student development, remains inadequately explored. To this end, in this paper, we propose RIGL, a unified Reciprocal model to trace knowledge states at both the individual and group levels, drawing from the Independent and Group Learning processes. Specifically, we first introduce a time frame-aware reciprocal embedding module to concurrently model both student and group response interactions across various time frames. Subsequently, we employ reciprocal enhanced learning modeling to fully exploit the comprehensive and complementary information between the two behaviors. Furthermore, we design a relation-guided temporal attentive network, comprised of dynamic graph modeling coupled with a temporal self-attention mechanism. It is used to delve into the dynamic influence of individual and group interactions throughout the learning processes. Conclusively, we introduce a bias-aware contrastive learning module to bolster the stability of the model's training. Extensive experiments on four real-world educational datasets clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed RIGL model.</description>

      <title>Influence Maximization via Graph Neural Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a ubiquitous scenario in the study of Influence Maximization (IM), in which there is limited knowledge about the topology of the diffusion network. We set the IM problem in a multi-round diffusion campaign, aiming to maximize the number of distinct users that are influenced. Leveraging the capability of bandit algorithms to effectively balance the objectives of exploration and exploitation, as well as the expressivity of neural networks, our study explores the application of neural bandit algorithms to the IM problem. We propose the framework IM-GNB (Influence Maximization with Graph Neural Bandits), where we provide an estimate of the users' probabilities of being influenced by influencers (also known as diffusion seeds). This initial estimate forms the basis for constructing both an exploitation graph and an exploration one. Subsequently, IM-GNB handles the exploration-exploitation tradeoff, by selecting seed nodes in real-time using Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN), in which the pre-estimated graphs are employed to refine the influencers' estimated rewards in each contextual setting. Through extensive experiments on two large real-world datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of IM-GNB compared with other baseline methods, significantly improving the spread outcome of such diffusion campaigns, when the underlying network is unknown.</description>

      <title>Incentive-Aware Recommender Systems in Two-Sided Markets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.15381v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Online platforms in the Internet Economy commonly incorporate recommender systems that recommend products (or "arms") to users (or "agents"). A key challenge in this domain arises from myopic agents who are naturally incentivized to exploit by choosing the optimal arm based on current information, rather than exploring various alternatives to gather information that benefits the collective. We propose a novel recommender system that aligns with agents' incentives while achieving asymptotically optimal performance, as measured by regret in repeated interactions. Our framework models this incentive-aware system as a multi-agent bandit problem in two-sided markets, where the interactions of agents and arms are facilitated by recommender systems on online platforms. This model incorporates incentive constraints induced by agents' opportunity costs. In scenarios where opportunity costs are known to the platform, we show the existence of an incentive-compatible recommendation algorithm. This algorithm pools recommendations between a genuinely good arm and an unknown arm using a randomized and adaptive strategy. Moreover, when these opportunity costs are unknown, we introduce an algorithm that randomly pools recommendations across all arms, utilizing the cumulative loss from each arm as feedback for strategic exploration. We demonstrate that both algorithms satisfy an ex-post fairness criterion, which protects agents from over-exploitation. All code for using the proposed algorithms and reproducing results is made available on GitHub.</description>

Abstract: The federated recommendation system is an emerging AI service architecture that provides recommendation services in a privacy-preserving manner. Using user-relation graphs to enhance federated recommendations is a promising topic. However, it is still an open challenge to construct the user-relation graph while preserving data locality-based privacy protection in federated settings. Inspired by a simple motivation, similar users share a similar vision (embeddings) to the same item set, this paper proposes a novel Graph-guided Personalization for Federated Recommendation (GPFedRec). The proposed method constructs a user-relation graph from user-specific personalized item embeddings at the server without accessing the users' interaction records. The personalized item embedding is locally fine-tuned on each device, and then a user-relation graph will be constructed by measuring the similarity among client-specific item embeddings. Without accessing users' historical interactions, we embody the data locality-based privacy protection of vanilla federated learning. Furthermore, a graph-guided aggregation mechanism is designed to leverage the user-relation graph and federated optimization framework simultaneously. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate GPFedRec's superior performance. The in-depth study validates that GPFedRec can generally improve existing federated recommendation methods as a plugin while keeping user privacy safe. Code is available to ease reproducibility</description>

      <title>A Survey on Large Language Models for Recommendation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.19860v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and have recently gained significant attention in the domain of Recommendation Systems (RS). These models, trained on massive amounts of data using self-supervised learning, have demonstrated remarkable success in learning universal representations and have the potential to enhance various aspects of recommendation systems by some effective transfer techniques such as fine-tuning and prompt tuning, and so on. The crucial aspect of harnessing the power of language models in enhancing recommendation quality is the utilization of their high-quality representations of textual features and their extensive coverage of external knowledge to establish correlations between items and users. To provide a comprehensive understanding of the existing LLM-based recommendation systems, this survey presents a taxonomy that categorizes these models into two major paradigms, respectively Discriminative LLM for Recommendation (DLLM4Rec) and Generative LLM for Recommendation (GLLM4Rec), with the latter being systematically sorted out for the first time. Furthermore, we systematically review and analyze existing LLM-based recommendation systems within each paradigm, providing insights into their methodologies, techniques, and performance. Additionally, we identify key challenges and several valuable findings to provide researchers and practitioners with inspiration. We have also created a GitHub repository to index relevant papers on LLMs for recommendation, https://github.com/WLiK/LLM4Rec.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Recommendation Diversity by Re-ranking with Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11506v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has long been recognized that it is not enough for a Recommender System (RS) to provide recommendations based only on their relevance to users. Among many other criteria, the set of recommendations may need to be diverse. Diversity is one way of handling recommendation uncertainty and ensuring that recommendations offer users a meaningful choice. The literature reports many ways of measuring diversity and improving the diversity of a set of recommendations, most notably by re-ranking and selecting from a larger set of candidate recommendations. Driven by promising insights from the literature on how to incorporate versatile Large Language Models (LLMs) into the RS pipeline, in this paper we show how LLMs can be used for diversity re-ranking.
  We begin with an informal study that verifies that LLMs can be used for re-ranking tasks and do have some understanding of the concept of item diversity. Then, we design a more rigorous methodology where LLMs are prompted to generate a diverse ranking from a candidate ranking using various prompt templates with different re-ranking instructions in a zero-shot fashion. We conduct comprehensive experiments testing state-of-the-art LLMs from the GPT and Llama families. We compare their re-ranking capabilities with random re-ranking and various traditional re-ranking methods from the literature. We open-source the code of our experiments for reproducibility. Our findings suggest that the trade-offs (in terms of performance and costs, among others) of LLM-based re-rankers are superior to those of random re-rankers but, as yet, inferior to the ones of traditional re-rankers. However, the LLM approach is promising. LLMs exhibit improved performance on many natural language processing and recommendation tasks and lower inference costs. Given these trends, we can expect LLM-based re-ranking to become more competitive soon.</description>

      <title>Future Impact Decomposition in Request-level Recommendations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.16108v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recommender systems, reinforcement learning solutions have shown promising results in optimizing the interaction sequence between users and the system over the long-term performance. For practical reasons, the policy's actions are typically designed as recommending a list of items to handle users' frequent and continuous browsing requests more efficiently. In this list-wise recommendation scenario, the user state is updated upon every request in the corresponding MDP formulation. However, this request-level formulation is essentially inconsistent with the user's item-level behavior. In this study, we demonstrate that an item-level optimization approach can better utilize item characteristics and optimize the policy's performance even under the request-level MDP. We support this claim by comparing the performance of standard request-level methods with the proposed item-level actor-critic framework in both simulation and online experiments. Furthermore, we show that a reward-based future decomposition strategy can better express the item-wise future impact and improve the recommendation accuracy in the long term. To achieve a more thorough understanding of the decomposition strategy, we propose a model-based re-weighting framework with adversarial learning that further boost the performance and investigate its correlation with the reward-based strategy.</description>

      <title>Non-autoregressive Generative Models for Reranking Recommendation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06871v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Contemporary recommendation systems are designed to meet users' needs by delivering tailored lists of items that align with their specific demands or interests. In a multi-stage recommendation system, reranking plays a crucial role by modeling the intra-list correlations among items. The key challenge of reranking lies in the exploration of optimal sequences within the combinatorial space of permutations. Recent research proposes a generator-evaluator learning paradigm, where the generator generates multiple feasible sequences and the evaluator picks out the best sequence based on the estimated listwise score. The generator is of vital importance, and generative models are well-suited for the generator function. Current generative models employ an autoregressive strategy for sequence generation. However, deploying autoregressive models in real-time industrial systems is challenging. To address these issues, we propose a Non-AutoRegressive generative model for reranking Recommendation (NAR4Rec) designed to enhance efficiency and effectiveness. To tackle challenges such as sparse training samples and dynamic candidates, we introduce a matching model. Considering the diverse nature of user feedback, we employ a sequence-level unlikelihood training objective to differentiate feasible sequences from unfeasible ones. Additionally, to overcome the lack of dependency modeling in non-autoregressive models regarding target items, we introduce contrastive decoding to capture correlations among these items. Extensive offline experiments validate the superior performance of NAR4Rec over state-of-the-art reranking methods. Online A/B tests reveal that NAR4Rec significantly enhances the user experience. Furthermore, NAR4Rec has been fully deployed in a popular video app Kuaishou with over 300 million daily active users.</description>

      <title>CELA: Cost-Efficient Language Model Alignment for CTR Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10596v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction holds a paramount position in recommender systems. The prevailing ID-based paradigm underperforms in cold-start scenarios due to the skewed distribution of feature frequency. Additionally, the utilization of a single modality fails to exploit the knowledge contained within textual features. Recent efforts have sought to mitigate these challenges by integrating Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs). They design hard prompts to structure raw features into text for each interaction and then apply PLMs for text processing. With external knowledge and reasoning capabilities, PLMs extract valuable information even in cases of sparse interactions. Nevertheless, compared to ID-based models, pure text modeling degrades the efficacy of collaborative filtering, as well as feature scalability and efficiency during both training and inference. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{C}ost-\textbf{E}fficient \textbf{L}anguage Model \textbf{A}lignment (\textbf{CELA}) for CTR prediction. CELA incorporates textual features and language models while preserving the collaborative filtering capabilities of ID-based models. This model-agnostic framework can be equipped with plug-and-play textual features, with item-level alignment enhancing the utilization of external information while maintaining training and inference efficiency. Through extensive offline experiments, CELA demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, an online A/B test conducted on an industrial App recommender system showcases its practical effectiveness, solidifying the potential for real-world applications of CELA.</description>

      <title>Prediction of the Realisation of an Information Need: An EEG Study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08105v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the foundational goals of Information Retrieval (IR) is to satisfy searchers' Information Needs (IN). Understanding how INs physically manifest has long been a complex and elusive process. However, recent studies utilising Electroencephalography (EEG) data have provided real-time insights into the neural processes associated with INs. Unfortunately, they have yet to demonstrate how this insight can practically benefit the search experience. As such, within this study, we explore the ability to predict the realisation of IN within EEG data across 14 subjects whilst partaking in a Question-Answering (Q/A) task. Furthermore, we investigate the combinations of EEG features that yield optimal predictive performance, as well as identify regions within the Q/A queries where a subject's realisation of IN is more pronounced. The findings from this work demonstrate that EEG data is sufficient for the real-time prediction of the realisation of an IN across all subjects with an accuracy of 73.5% (SD 2.6%) and on a per-subject basis with an accuracy of 90.1% (SD 22.1%). This work helps to close the gap by bridging theoretical neuroscientific advancements with tangible improvements in information retrieval practices, paving the way for real-time prediction of the realisation of IN.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08863v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: CAD (Computer-Aided Design) plays a crucial role in mechanical industry, where large numbers of similar-shaped CAD parts are often created. Efficiently reusing these parts is key to reducing design and production costs for enterprises. Retrieval systems are vital for achieving CAD reuse, but the complex shapes of CAD models are difficult to accurately describe using text or keywords, making traditional retrieval methods ineffective. While existing representation learning approaches have been developed for CAD, manually labeling similar samples in these methods is expensive. Additionally, CAD models' unique parameterized data structure presents challenges for applying existing 3D shape representation learning techniques directly. In this work, we propose GC-CAD, a self-supervised contrastive graph neural network-based method for mechanical CAD retrieval that directly models parameterized CAD raw files. GC-CAD consists of two key modules: structure-aware representation learning and contrastive graph learning framework. The method leverages graph neural networks to extract both geometric and topological information from CAD models, generating feature representations. We then introduce a simple yet effective contrastive graph learning framework approach, enabling the model to train without manual labels and generate retrieval-ready representations. Experimental results on four datasets including human evaluation demonstrate that the proposed method achieves significant accuracy improvements and up to 100 times efficiency improvement over the baseline methods.</description>

Abstract: This paper introduces AutoSurvey, a speedy and well-organized methodology for automating the creation of comprehensive literature surveys in rapidly evolving fields like artificial intelligence. Traditional survey paper creation faces challenges due to the vast volume and complexity of information, prompting the need for efficient survey methods. While large language models (LLMs) offer promise in automating this process, challenges such as context window limitations, parametric knowledge constraints, and the lack of evaluation benchmarks remain. AutoSurvey addresses these challenges through a systematic approach that involves initial retrieval and outline generation, subsection drafting by specialized LLMs, integration and refinement, and rigorous evaluation and iteration. Our contributions include a comprehensive solution to the survey problem, a reliable evaluation method, and experimental validation demonstrating AutoSurvey's effectiveness.We open our resources at \url{https://github.com/AutoSurveys/AutoSurvey}.</description>

      <title>DELRec: Distilling Sequential Pattern to Enhance LLM-based Recommendation</title>

Abstract: Sequential recommendation (SR) tasks enhance recommendation accuracy by capturing the connection between users' past interactions and their changing preferences. Conventional models often focus solely on capturing sequential patterns within the training data, neglecting the broader context and semantic information embedded in item titles from external sources. This limits their predictive power and adaptability. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in SR tasks due to their advanced understanding capabilities and strong generalization abilities. Researchers have attempted to enhance LLMs' recommendation performance by incorporating information from SR models. However, previous approaches have encountered problems such as 1) only influencing LLMs at the result level; 2) increased complexity of LLMs recommendation methods leading to reduced interpretability; 3) incomplete understanding and utilization of SR models information by LLMs.
  To address these problems, we proposes a novel framework, DELRec, which aims to extract knowledge from SR models and enable LLMs to easily comprehend and utilize this supplementary information for more effective sequential recommendations. DELRec consists of two main stages: 1) SR Models Pattern Distilling, focusing on extracting behavioral patterns exhibited by SR models using soft prompts through two well-designed strategies; 2) LLMs-based Sequential Recommendation, aiming to fine-tune LLMs to effectively use the distilled auxiliary information to perform SR tasks. Extensive experimental results conducted on three real datasets validate the effectiveness of the DELRec framework.</description>

      <title>Improving Medical Reasoning through Retrieval and Self-Reflection with Retrieval-Augmented Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15269</link>

Abstract: Recent proprietary large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4, have achieved a milestone in tackling diverse challenges in the biomedical domain, ranging from multiple-choice questions to long-form generations. To address challenges that still cannot be handled with the encoded knowledge of LLMs, various retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods have been developed by searching documents from the knowledge corpus and appending them unconditionally or selectively to the input of LLMs for generation. However, when applying existing methods to different domain-specific problems, poor generalization becomes apparent, leading to fetching incorrect documents or making inaccurate judgments. In this paper, we introduce Self-BioRAG, a framework reliable for biomedical text that specializes in generating explanations, retrieving domain-specific documents, and self-reflecting generated responses. We utilize 84k filtered biomedical instruction sets to train Self-BioRAG that can assess its generated explanations with customized reflective tokens. Our work proves that domain-specific components, such as a retriever, domain-related document corpus, and instruction sets are necessary for adhering to domain-related instructions. Using three major medical question-answering benchmark datasets, experimental results of Self-BioRAG demonstrate significant performance gains by achieving a 7.2% absolute improvement on average over the state-of-the-art open-foundation model with a parameter size of 7B or less. Overall, we analyze that Self-BioRAG finds the clues in the question, retrieves relevant documents if needed, and understands how to answer with information from retrieved documents and encoded knowledge as a medical expert does. We release our data and code for training our framework components and model weights (7B and 13B) to enhance capabilities in biomedical and clinical domains.</description>

      <title>Knowledge-Driven Cross-Document Relation Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13546v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Relation extraction (RE) is a well-known NLP application often treated as a sentence- or document-level task. However, a handful of recent efforts explore it across documents or in the cross-document setting (CrossDocRE). This is distinct from the single document case because different documents often focus on disparate themes, while text within a document tends to have a single goal. Linking findings from disparate documents to identify new relationships is at the core of the popular literature-based knowledge discovery paradigm in biomedicine and other domains. Current CrossDocRE efforts do not consider domain knowledge, which are often assumed to be known to the reader when documents are authored. Here, we propose a novel approach, KXDocRE, that embed domain knowledge of entities with input text for cross-document RE. Our proposed framework has three main benefits over baselines: 1) it incorporates domain knowledge of entities along with documents' text; 2) it offers interpretability by producing explanatory text for predicted relations between entities 3) it improves performance over the prior methods.</description>

      <title>General Distribution Learning: A theoretical framework for Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05666</link>

Abstract: There remain numerous unanswered research questions on deep learning (DL) within the classical learning theory framework. These include the remarkable generalization capabilities of overparametrized neural networks (NNs), the efficient optimization performance despite non-convexity of objectives, the mechanism of flat minima for generalization, and the exceptional performance of deep architectures in solving physical problems. This paper introduces General Distribution Learning (GD Learning), a novel theoretical learning framework designed to address a comprehensive range of machine learning and statistical tasks, including classification, regression and parameter estimation. Departing from traditional statistical machine learning, GD Learning focuses on the true underlying distribution. In GD Learning, learning error, corresponding to the expected error in classical statistical learning framework, is divided into fitting errors due to models and algorithms, as well as sampling errors introduced by limited sampling data. The framework significantly incorporates prior knowledge, especially in scenarios characterized by data scarcity, thereby enhancing performance. Within the GD Learning framework, we demonstrate that the global optimal solutions in non-convex optimization can be approached by minimizing the gradient norm and the non-uniformity of the eigenvalues of the model's Jacobian matrix. This insight leads to the development of the gradient structure control algorithm. GD Learning also offers fresh insights into the questions on deep learning, including overparameterization and non-convex optimization, bias-variance trade-off, and the mechanism of flat minima.</description>
