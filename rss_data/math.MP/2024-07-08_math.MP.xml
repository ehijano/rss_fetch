      <title>Optimal synchronisation to a limit cycle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the absence of external forcing, all trajectories on the phase plane of the van der Pol oscillator tend to a closed, periodic, trajectory -- the limit cycle -- after infinite time. Here, we drive the van der Pol oscillator with an external time-dependent force to reach the limit cycle in a given finite time. Specifically, we are interested in minimising the non-conservative contribution to the work when driving the system from a given initial point on the phase plane to any final point belonging to the limit cycle. There appears a speed limit inequality, which expresses a trade-off between the connection time and cost -- in terms of the non-conservative work. We show how the above results can be { generalized to the broader family of non-linear oscillators given by} the Li\'enard equation. Finally, we also look into the problem of minimising the total work done by the external force.</description>

      <title>Helicity is a topological invariant of massless particles: C=-2h</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is an elementary but indispensable relationship between the topology and geometry of massive particles. The geometric spin $s$ is related to the topological dimension of the internal space $V$ by $\dim V = 2s + 1$. This breaks down for massless particles, which are characterized by their helicity $h$, but all have 1D internal spaces. We show that a subtler relation exists between the topological and geometry of massless particles. Wave functions of massless particles are sections of nontrivial line bundles over the lightcone whose topology are completely characterized by their first Chern number $C$. We prove that in general $C = -2h$. In doing so, we also exhibit a method of generating all massless bundle representations via an abelian group structure of massless particles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show how Cauchy's Integral Formula and the ideas of Dunford's Holomorphic Functional Calculus (for unbounded operators) can be used to compute the Vacuum Characteristic Function (Quantum Fourier Transform) of quantum random variables defined as self-adjoint operators on $L^2(\mathbb{R},\mathbb{C})$. We consider in detail several quantum observables defined in terms of the position and momentum operators $X$, $P$, respectively, on $L^2(\mathbb{R},\mathbb{C})$.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian formalism for general variational problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present article introduces a generalization of the Hamiltonian field theory for a Lagrangian density, allowing the formulation of this kind of field theories for variational problem of more general nature than those associated to a classical variational problem. It is achieved by realizing that the usual construction of the Hamiltonian equations can be performed without the use of the so called Hamiltonian section, whose existence is problematic when general variational problems are considered. The developed formalism is applied to obtain an unified problem and a Hamiltonian field theory for the vakonomic Herglotz variational problem.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Processes: From Classical to Quantum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main goal of these notes is to give an introduction to the mathematics of quantum noise and some of its applications in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics. We start with some reminders from the theory of classical stochastic processes. We then provide a brief overview of quantum mechanics and quantum field theory, from the viewpoint of quantum probability and adopting the language of Hudson and Parthasarathy. We introduce quantum stochastic processes on a boson Fock space and their calculus. Whenever possible, we make connections with the relevant concepts in classical probability theory. As an application of the theory, we introduce the theory of open quantum systems, with emphasis on the physics and modeling aspects of these systems.</description>

      <title>Cohomological field theories and generalized Seiberg-Witten equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a formalism for constructing cohomological field theories (CohFT) out of nonlinear PDEs based on the first author's previous work (arXiv:2202.12425). We apply the formalism to the generalized Seiberg-Witten equations and show that the obtained CohFT functionals agree with the existing ones proposed by physicists. This leads to a unified perspective from which to view the full supersymmetric functionals of the Donaldson-Witten, Seiberg-Witten, and Kapustin-Witten theories and understand the relations between them. We also outline a quantization program for our framework and discuss its potential to produce manifold invariants and quantum cohomologies.</description>

      <title>Convergence rates for the Trotter-Kato splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study convergence rates of the Trotter-Kato splitting $e^{A+L} = \lim_{n \to \infty} (e^{L/n} e^{A/n})^n$ in the strong operator topology. In the first part, we use complex interpolation theory to treat generators $L$ and $A$ of contraction semigroups on Banach spaces, with $L$ relatively $A$-bounded. In the second part, we study unitary dynamics on Hilbert spaces and develop a new technique based on the concept of energy constraints. Our results provide a complete picture of the convergence rates for the Trotter splitting for all common types of Schr\"odinger and Dirac operators, including singular, confining and magnetic vector potentials, as well as molecular many-body Hamiltonians in dimension $d=3$. Using the Brezis-Mironescu inequality, we derive convergence rates for the Schr\"odinger operator with $V(x)=\pm |x|^{-a}$ potential. In each case, our conditions are fully explicit.</description>

      <title>Conformally covariant probabilities, operator product expansions, and logarithmic correlations in two-dimensional critical percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The large-scale behavior of two-dimensional critical percolation is expected to be described by a conformal field theory (CFT). Moreover, this putative percolation CFT is believed to be of the logarithmic type, exhibiting logarithmic corrections to the most commonly encountered and studied behavior of CFT correlations.
  It was recently shown by the first author [Cam24] that critical connection probabilities, when appropriately rescaled, have a well-defined and conformally covariant scaling limit and therefore behave like CFT correlation functions. While constructing a full-fledged percolation CFT is still an open problem, in this paper we prove various CFT features of the scaling limit of two-dimensional critical percolation.
  We identify several connectivity events, including arm-events and the events that a vertex is pivotal or belongs to the percolation backbone, whose probabilities have conformally covariant scaling limits and can be interpreted as CFT correlation functions.
  For some of the probabilities mentioned above, we prove asymptotic expansions that can be interpreted as CFT operator product expansions (OPEs) and provide rigorous versions of CFT fusion rules.
  In some of the probabilities mentioned above, we identify logarithmic singularities, providing the first rigorous confirmation of similar predictions made in the physics literature and establishing the logarithmic nature of the putative percolation CFT.
  The latter result is particularly interesting because, while logarithmic CFTs are more complex and less studied than ordinary CFTs, they have attracted considerable attention in recent years due to their role in the analysis of important physical models and phenomena, such as, besides percolation, the Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) model, the quantum Hall effect, disordered critical systems, self-avoiding polymers, and the Fortuin-Kasteleyn (FK) model.</description>

      <title>Chernoff's product formula: Semigroup approximations with non-uniform time intervals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Often, when we consider the time evolution of a system, we resort to approximation: Instead of calculating the exact orbit, we divide the time interval in question into uniform segments. Chernoff's results in this direction provide us with a general approximation scheme. There are situations when we need to break the interval into uneven pieces. In this paper, we explore alternative conditions to the one found by Smolyanov et. al such that Chernoff's original result can be extended to unevenly distributed time intervals. Two applications concerning the foundations of quantum mechanics and the central limit theorem are presented.</description>

      <title>A spring pair method of finding saddle points using the minimum energy path as a compass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finding index-1 saddle points is crucial for understanding phase transitions. In this work, we propose a simple yet efficient approach, the spring pair method (SPM), to accurately locate saddle points. Without requiring Hessian information, SPM evolves a single pair of spring-coupled particles on the potential energy surface. By cleverly designing complementary drifting and climbing dynamics based on gradient decomposition, the spring pair converges onto the minimum energy path (MEP) and spontaneously aligns its orientation with the MEP tangent, providing a reliable ascent direction for efficient convergence to saddle points. SPM fundamentally differs from traditional surface walking methods, which rely on the eigenvectors of Hessian that may deviate from the MEP tangent, potentially leading to convergence failure or undesired saddle points. The efficiency of SPM for finding saddle points is verified by ample examples, including high-dimensional Lennard-Jones cluster rearrangement and the Landau energy functional involving quasicrystal phase transitions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a neutral bosonic molecule in the Born-Oppenheimer approximation without spin and assume the physically obvious assertion that a neutral molecule prefers to break into smaller neutral clusters. We prove the existence of a global in space/uniform spectral gap between the ground state and first excited state energies. To do so, we improve upon previous results using a different tool, the time-independent Feshbach-Schur map.</description>

      <title>Factorial Series Representation of Stieltjes Series Converging Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The practical usefulness of Levin-type nonlinear sequence transformations as numerical tools for the summation of divergent series or for the convergence acceleration of slowly converging series, is nowadays beyond dispute. Weniger's transformation, in particular, is able to accomplish spectacular results when used to overcome resummation problems, often outperforming better known resummation techniques, the most known being Pad\'e approximants. However, our understanding of its theoretical features is still far from being satisfactory and particularly bad as far as the decoding of factorially divergent series is concerned.
  Stieltjes series represent a class of power series of fundamental interest in mathematical physics. In the present paper, it is shown how the Stieltjes series converging factor of any order is expressible as an inverse factorial series, whose terms can be analytically retrieved through a simple recursive algorithm. A few examples of applications of our algorithm are presented, in order to show its effectiveness and implementation ease. We believe the results presented here could constitute an important, preliminary step for the development of a general convergence theory of Weniger's transformation on Stieltjes series. A rather ambitious project, but worthy of being pursued in the future.</description>

      <title>Chebyshev Spectral Neural Networks for Solving Partial Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this study is to utilize the Chebyshev spectral method neural network(CSNN) model to solve differential equations. This approach employs a single-layer neural network wherein Chebyshev spectral methods are used to construct neurons satisfying boundary conditions. The study uses a feedforward neural network model and error backpropagation principles, utilizing automatic differentiation (AD) to compute the loss function. This method avoids the need to solve non-sparse linear systems, making it convenient for algorithm implementation and solving high-dimensional problems. The unique sampling method and neuron architecture significantly enhance the training efficiency and accuracy of the neural network. Furthermore, multiple networks enables the Chebyshev spectral method to handle equations on more complex domains. The numerical efficiency and accuracy of the CSNN model are investigated through testing on elliptic partial differential equations, and it is compared with the well-known Physics-Informed Neural Network(PINN) method.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic and stability analysis of kinetic models for opinion formation on networks: an Allen-Cahn approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the analysis of the stationary equilibria and their stability in case of an opinion formation process in presence of binary opposite opinions evolving according to majority-like rules on social networks. The starting point is a kinetic Boltzmann-type model derived from microscopic interactions rules for the opinion exchange among individuals holding a certain degree of connectivity. The key idea is to derive from the kinetic model an Allen-Cahn type equation for the fraction of individuals holding one of the two opinions. The latter can be studied by means of a linear stability analysis and by exploiting integral operator analysis. While this is true for ternary interactions, for binary interactions the derived equation of interest is a linear scattering equation, that can be studied by means of General Relative Entropy tools and integral operators.</description>

      <title>Theory of Complex Particle without Extra Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complex particle is a kind of bilocal particle having unexpected symmetry, which was proposed by the authour. In the present paper, we show that critical dimension of the complex particle in Minkowski spacetime is $D = 4$, while $D = 2, 4$ or $6$ are permitted in Euclid spacetime. The origin of the restriction to the dimension is the existence of tertiary constraint in the canonical theory, quantization of which leads to an eigenvalue equation having single-valued and bounded solutions only in particular dimension of spacetime. The derivation is based on a detailed analysis of Laplace-Beltrami operator on $S^{1,D-2}$ or $S^{D-1}$.</description>

      <title>Fluctuations and Correlations in Causal Set Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the statistical fluctuations (such as the variance) of causal set quantities, with particular focus on the causal set action. To facilitate calculating such fluctuations, we develop tools to account for correlations between causal intervals with different cardinalities. We present a convenient decomposition of the fluctuations of the causal set action into contributions that depend on different kinds of correlations. This decomposition can be used in causal sets approximated by any spacetime manifold $\mathcal M$. Our work paves the way for investigating a number of interesting discreteness effects, such as certain aspects of the Everpresent $\Lambda$ cosmological model.</description>

Abstract: We prove a nonlinear characteristic $C^k$-gluing theorem for vacuum gravitational fields in Bondi gauge for a class of characteristic hypersurfaces near static vacuum $n$-dimensional backgrounds, $n\ge 3$, with any finite $k$, with cosmological constant $ \Lambda \in \mathbb{R}$, near Birmingham-Kottler backgrounds. This generalises the $C^2$-gluing of Aretakis, Czimek and Rodnianski, carried-out near light cones in four-dimensional Minkowski spacetime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We point out that the q-entropy composition for independent events has exactly the same form as the Pythagorean theorem in hyperbolic geometry. We justify the formal relation of hyperbolic geometry with the q-entropy through the use of the $\kappa$-entropy, which is directly related to the hyperboloid model of hyperbolic space. We comment on the relation between orthogonality in this form of the Pythagorean theorem and the independence of the probability distributions appearing in the q-entropy composition through the use of the Dvoretzky-Rogers lemma.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The celestial $Lw_{1+\infty}$ symmetries in asymptotically flat spacetimes have a natural geometric interpretation on twistor space in terms of Poisson diffeomorphisms. Using this framework, we provide a first-principle derivation of the canonical generators associated with these symmetries starting from the Poisson BF twistor action for self-dual gravity. We express these charges as surface integrals over the celestial sphere in terms of spacetime data at null infinity. The connection between twistor space and spacetime expressions at $\mathscr{I}$ is achieved via an integral formula for the asymptotic Bianchi identities due to Bramson and Tod. Finally, we clarify how $Lw_{1+\infty}$ transformations are symmetries of gravity from a phase space perspective by showing the invariance of the asymptotic Bianchi identities.</description>

      <title>Geometric relational framework for general-relativistic gauge field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We remind how relationality arises as the core insight of general-relativistic gauge field theories from the articulation of the generalised hole and point-coincidence arguments. Hence, a compelling case for a manifestly relational framework ensues naturally. We propose our formulation for such a framework, based on a significant development of the dressing field method of symmetry reduction.
  We first develop a version for the group $\text{Aut}(P)$ of automorphisms of a principal bundle $P$ over a manifold $M$, as it is the most natural and elegant, and as $P$ hosts all the mathematical structures relevant to general-relativistic gauge field theory. Yet, as the standard formulation is local, on $M$, we then develop the relational framework for local field theory. It manifestly implements the generalised point-coincidence argument, whereby the physical field-theoretical degrees of freedoms co-define each other and define, coordinatise, the physical spacetime itself. Applying the framework to General Relativity, we obtain relational Einstein equations, encompassing various notions of "scalar coordinatisation" \`a la Kretschmann-Komar and Brown-Kucha\v{r}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive a large deviation principle for families of random variables in the basin of attraction of spectrally positive stable distributions by proving a uniform version of the Tauberian theorem for Laplace-Stieltjes transforms. The main advantage of this method is that it can be easily applied to cases that are beyond the reach of the techniques currently used in the literature, such as random walks with long-ranged memory kernels or randomly stopped sums where the random time is not concentrated around its expectation. The method reveals the role of the characteristic function when Cram\'er's condition is violated and provides a unified approach within regular variation.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal modes on Kerr spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a rigorous framework for defining quasinormal modes on stationary, asymptotically flat spacetimes as isolated eigenvalues of the infinitesimal generator of time translations. We consider time functions corresponding to a foliation of asymptotically hyperboloidal hypersurfaces and restrict to suitable Hilbert spaces of functions. These functions have finite Sobolev regularity in bounded regions, but need to be Gevrey-regular at null infinity. This framework is developed in the context of sub-extremal Kerr spacetimes, but also gives uniform-in-$\Lambda$ resolvent estimates on Kerr--de Sitter spacetimes with a small cosmological constant $\Lambda$. As a corollary, we also construct the meromorphic continuation (in a sector of the complex plane) of the cut-off resolvent in Kerr that is associated to the standard Boyer--Lindquist time function. The framework introduced in this paper bridges different notions of quasinormal modes found in the literature. As further applications of our methods, we prove stability of quasinormal frequencies in a sector of the complex plane, with respect to suitably small perturbations and establish convergence properties for Kerr--de Sitter quasinormal frequencies when the cosmological constant approaches zero.</description>

      <title>Dynamic problem of a power-law graded half-plane and an associated Carleman problem for two functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A steady state plane problem of an inhomogeneous half-plane subjected to a load running along the boundary at subsonic speed is analyzed. The Lame coefficients and the density of the half-plane are assumed to be power functions of depth. The model is different from the standard static model have been used in contact mechanics since the Sixties and originated from the 1964 Rostovtsev exact solution of the Flamant problem of a power-law graded half-plane. To solve the governing dynamic equations with variable coefficients written in terms of the displacements, we propose a method that, by means of the Fourier and Mellin transforms, maps the model problem to a Carleman boundary value problem for two meromorphic functions in a strip with two shifts or, equivalently, to a system of two difference equations of the second order with variable coefficients. By partial factorization the Carleman problem is recast as a system of four singular integral equations on a segment with a fixed singularity and highly oscillating coefficients. A numerical method for its solution is proposed and tested. Numerical results for the displacement and stress fields are presented and discussed.</description>

Abstract: In this contribution, we study spacetimes of cosmological interest, without making any symmetry assumptions. We prove a rigid Hawking singularity theorem for positive cosmological constant, which sharpens known results. In particular, it implies that any spacetime with $\operatorname{Ric} \geq -ng$ in timelike directions and containing a compact Cauchy hypersurface with mean curvature $H \geq n$ is timelike incomplete. We also study the properties of cosmological time and volume functions, addressing questions such as: When do they satisfy the regularity condition? When are the level sets Cauchy hypersurfaces? What can one say about the mean curvature of the level sets? This naturally leads to consideration of Hawking type singularity theorems for Cauchy surfaces satisfying mean curvature inequalities in a certain weak sense.</description>

      <title>Minimal eigenvalue estimates for self-adjoint trace-class operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spectral properties of bounded linear operators play a crucial role in several areas of mathematics and physics, and arguably the most important one is being positive semidefinite. For each self-adjoint, trace-class operator $O$ we construct a monotone increasing sequence $q_n$ which tends to the minimal eigenvalue $\lambda_{\min}$ if $O$ is not positive semidefinite, and to $0$ otherwise. This sequence only depends on the moments of $O$ and a concrete upper estimate of its $1$-norm; we also demonstrate that it can be effectively calculated for a large class of physically relevant operators. As a by-product, we obtain computable estimates for the $1$-norm of $O$, too.
  First assume that $O$ is positive semidefinite. Unfortunately, positivity tests fail to prove this in finitely many steps. However, $q_n$ gives a rigorous, monotone increasing lower estimate for all eigenvalues, providing a quantitative way of measuring positivity. In this case the speed of convergence is $q_n\approx -\frac cn$.
  Now suppose that $O$ is not positive semidefinite. Then $q_n$ monotonically converges to $\lambda_{\min}$ with super-exponential speed. Hence if $q_n$ stabilizes at a negative value, we obtain a strong indication that $O$ is in fact not positive semidefinite. We also construct an easier computable sequence $q_{n,0}$ which fails to be monotone, but converges to $\lambda_{\min}&lt;0$ faster, providing an even better indicator of non-positivity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a nonabelianization map for conformal blocks, which relates $c=1$ Virasoro blocks on a Riemann surface $C$ to Heisenberg blocks on a branched double cover $\widetilde{C}$ of $C$. The nonabelianization map uses the datum of a spectral network on $C$. It gives new formulas for Virasoro blocks as regularized Fredholm determinants of integral operators, with kernel given by an appropriate free-fermion two-point function on $\widetilde{C}$. The nonabelianization map also intertwines with the action of Verlinde loop operators, and can be used to construct eigenblocks. This leads to new Kyiv-type formulas and Fredholm determinant formulas for $\tau$-functions.</description>

      <title>Convex roofs witnessing Kirkwood-Dirac nonpositivity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given two observables $A$ and $B$, one can associate to every quantum state a Kirkwood-Dirac (KD) quasiprobability distribution. KD distributions are like joint classical probabilities except that they can have negative or nonreal values, which are associated to nonclassical features of the state. In the last decade, KD distributions have come to the forefront as a versatile tool to investigate and construct quantum advantages and nonclassical phenomena. KD distributions are also used to determine quantum-classical boundaries. To do so, one must have witnesses for when a state is KD nonpositive. Previous works have established a relation between the uncertainty of a pure state with respect to the eigenbases of $A$ and $B$ and KD positivity. If this $\textit{support uncertainty}$ is large, the state cannot be KD positive. Here, we construct two witnesses for KD nonpositivity for general mixed states. Our first witness is the convex roof of the support uncertainty; it is not faithful, but it extends to the convex hull of pure KD-positive states the relation between KD positivity and small support uncertainty. Our other witness is the convex roof of the total KD nonpositivity, which provides a faithful witness for the convex hull of the pure KD-positive states. This implies that the convex roof of the total nonpositivity captures the nonpositive nature of the KD distribution at the underlying pure state level.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Formalism for a family of cellular automata and duality with the shift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We will consider a family of cellular automata $\Phi: \{1,2,...,r\}^\mathbb{N}\circlearrowright$ that are not of algebraic type. Our first goal is to determine conditions that result in the identification of probabilities that are at the same time $\sigma$-invariant and $\Phi$-invariant, where $\sigma$ is the full shift. Via the use of versions of the Ruelle operator $\mathcal{L}_{A,\sigma}$ and $\mathcal{L}_{B,\Phi}$ we will show that there is an abundant set of measures with this property; they will be equilibrium probabilities for different Lispchitz potentials $A,B$ and for the corresponding dynamics $\sigma$ and $\Phi$. Via the use of a version of the involution kernel $W$ for a $(\sigma,\Phi)$-mixed skew product $\hat{\Phi}: \{1,2,...,r\}^\mathbb{Z}\circlearrowright$, given $A$ one can determine $B$, in such way that the integral kernel $e^W$ produce a duality between eigenprobabilities $\rho_A$ for $(\mathcal{L}_{A,\sigma})^*$ and eigenfunctions $\psi_B$ for $\mathcal{L}_{B,\Phi}$. In another direction, considering the non-mixed extension $\hat{\Phi}_n : \{1,2,...,r\}^\mathbb{Z}\circlearrowright$ of $\Phi$, given a Lispchitz potential $\hat{A} : \{1,2,...,r\}^\mathbb{Z}\to \mathbb{R}$, we can identify a Lipschitz potential $A:\{1,2,...,r\}^\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R} $, in such away that relates the variational problem of $\hat{\Phi}_n$-Topological Pressure for $\hat{A}$ with the $\Phi$-Topological Pressure for $A$. We also present a version of Livsic's Theorem. Whether or not $\Phi$ (or $\hat{\Phi})$ can eventually be conjugated with another shift of finite type is irrelevant in our context.</description>

      <title>Two methods to analyse radial diffusion ensembles: the peril of space- and time- dependent diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Particle dynamics in Earth's outer radiation belt can be modelled using a diffusion framework, where large-scale electron movements are captured by a diffusion equation across a single adiabatic invariant, $L^{*}$ $``(L)"$. While ensemble models are promoted to represent physical uncertainty, as yet there is no validated method to analyse radiation belt ensembles. Comparisons are complicated by the domain dependent diffusion, since diffusion coefficient $D_{LL}$ is dependent on $L$. We derive two tools to analyse ensemble members: time to monotonicity $t_m$ and mass/energy moment quantities $\mathcal{N}, \mathcal{E}$. We find that the Jacobian ($1/L^2$) is necessary for radiation belt error metrics. Components of $\partial\mathcal{E}/\partial t$ are explicitly calculated to compare the effects of outer and inner boundary conditions, and loss, on the ongoing diffusion. Using $t_m$, $\mathcal{N}$ and $\mathcal{E}$, we find that: (a) different physically motivated choices of outer boundary condition and location result in different final states and different rates of evolution; (b) the gradients of the particle distribution affect evolution more significantly than $D_{LL}$; (c) the enhancement location, and the amount of initial background particles, are both significant factors determining system evolution; (d) loss from pitch-angle scattering is generally dominant; it mitigates but does not remove the influence of both initial conditions and outer boundary settings, which are due to the $L$-dependence of $D_{LL}$. We anticipate this study will promote renewed focus on the distribution gradients, on the location and nature of the outer boundary in radiation belt modelling, and provide a foundation for systematic ensemble modelling.</description>

That is, we bound the difference between solutions of the Schr\"odinger equation by the difference of their Hamiltonians. The stability theorem obtained in this article provides a sharper bound than those previously obtained in the literature. This makes it a potentially useful tool for time-dependent problems in Quantum Physics, in particular for Quantum Control. We apply this result to prove two theorems about global approximate controllability of infinite-dimensional quantum systems. These results improve and generalise existing results on infinite-dimensional quantum control.</description>

Abstract: We exhaustively classify the Lie reductions of the real dispersionless Nizhnik equation to partial differential equations in two independent variables and to ordinary differential equations. Lie and point symmetries of reduced equations are comprehensively studied, including the analysis of which of them correspond to hidden symmetries of the original equation. If necessary, associated Lie reductions of a nonlinear Lax representation of the dispersionless Nizhnik equation are carried out as well. As a result, we construct wide families of new invariant solutions of this equation in explicit form in terms of elementary, Lambert and hypergeometric functions as well as in parametric or implicit form. We show that Lie reductions to algebraic equations lead to no new solutions of this equation in addition to the constructed ones. Multiplicative separation of variables is used for illustrative construction of non-invariant solutions.</description>

      <title>Folding QQ-relations and transfer matrix eigenvalues: towards a unified approach to Bethe ansatz for super spin chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.16660v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extending the method proposed in [arXiv:1109.5524], we derive QQ-relations (functional relations among Baxter Q-functions) and T-functions (eigenvalues of transfer matrices) for fusion vertex models associated with the twisted quantum affine superalgebras $U_{q}(gl(2r+1|2s)^{(2)})$, $U_{q}(gl(2r|2s+1)^{(2)})$, $U_{q}(gl(2r|2s)^{(2)})$, $U_{q}(osp(2r|2s)^{(2)})$ and the untwisted quantum affine orthosymplectic superalgebras $U_{q}(osp(2r+1|2s)^{(1)})$ and $U_{q}(osp(2r|2s)^{(1)})$ (and their Yangian counterparts, $Y(osp(2r+1|2s))$ and $Y(osp(2r|2s))$) as reductions (a kind of folding) of those associated with $U_{q}(gl(M|N)^{(1)})$. In particular, we reproduce previously proposed generating functions (difference operators) of the T-functions for the symmetric or anti-symmetric representations, and tableau sum expressions for more general representations for orthosymplectic superalgebras [arXiv:0911.5393,arXiv:0911.5390], and obtain Wronskian-type expressions (analogues of Weyl-type character formulas) for them. T-functions for spinorial representations are related to reductions of those for asymptotic limits of typical representations of $U_{q}(gl(M|N)^{(1)})$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13231v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider an Ising model with quenched surface disorder, the disorder average of the free energy is the main object of interest. Explicit expressions for the free energy distribution are difficult to obtain if the quenched surface spins take values of $\pm 1$. Thus, we choose a different approach and model the surface disorder by Gaussian random matrices. The distribution of the free energy is calculated. We chose skew-circulant random matrices and analytically compute the characteristic function of the free energy distribution. From the characteristic function we numerically calculate the distribution and show that it becomes log-normal for sufficiently large dimensions of the disorder matrices, and in the limit of infinitely large matrices tends to a Gaussian. Furthermore, we establish a connection to the central limit theorem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11696v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over the past three decades, it has been shown that discrete and continuous media can support topologically nontrivial waves. Recently, it was shown that the same is true of the vacuum, namely, right (R) and left (L) circularly polarized photons are topologically nontrivial. Here, we study the topology of another class of massless particles, namely gravitons. We show that the collection of all gravitons forms a topologically trivial vector bundle over the lightcone, allowing us to construct a globally smooth basis for gravitons. The graviton bundle also has a natural geometric splitting into two topologically nontrivial subbundles, consisting of the R and L gravitons. The R and L gravitons are unitary irreducible bundle representations of the Poincar\'{e} group, and are thus elementary particles; their topology is characterized by the Chern numbers $\mp 4$. This nontrivial topology obstructs the splitting of graviton angular momentum into spin and orbital angular momentum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12781v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We work out a generalization of the Szeg\"o limit theorems on the determinant of large matrices. We focus on matrices with nonzero leading principal minors and elements that decay to zero exponentially fast with the distance from the main diagonal, but we relax the constraint of the Toeplitz structure. We obtain an expression for the asymptotic behaviour of the determinant written in terms of the factors of a left and right Wiener-Hopf type factorization of an appropriately defined symbol. For matrices with elements varying slowly along the diagonals (e.g., in locally Toeplitz sequences), we propose to apply the analogue of the semiclassical expansion of the Moyal star product in phase-space quantum mechanics. This is a systematic method that provides approximations up to any order in the typical scale of the inhomogeneity and allows us to obtain explicit asymptotic formulas.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, the Cauchy problem for a Friedrichs system on a globally hyperbolic manifold with a timelike boundary is investigated. By imposing admissible boundary conditions, the existence and the uniqueness of strong solutions are shown. Furthermore, if the Friedrichs system is hyperbolic, the Cauchy problem is proved to be well-posed in the sense of Hadamard. Finally, examples of Friedrichs systems with admissible boundary conditions are provided.</description>

Abstract: We provide a deformation quantization, in the sense of Rieffel, for \textit{all} globally hyperbolic spacetimes with a Poisson structure. The Poisson structures have to satisfy Fedosov type requirements in order for the deformed product to be associative. We apply the novel deformation to quantum field theories and their respective states and we prove that the deformed state (i.e.\ a state in non-commutative spacetime) has a singularity structure resembling Minkowski, i.e.\ is \textit{Hadamard}, if the undeformed state is Hadamard. This proves that the Hadamard condition, and hence the quantum field theoretical implementation of the equivalence principle is a general concept that holds in spacetimes with quantum features (i.e. a non-commutative spacetime).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.07289v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The goal of this research paper is to investigate curvature inheritance symmetry in conformally flat spacetime. Curvature inheritance symmetry in conformally flat spacetime is shown to be a conformal motion. We have proven that a conformally flat spacetime reduces to Einstein spacetime if admits curvature inheritance symmetry. A few results on conformally flat spacetimes that obey Einstein's field equation with or without a cosmological constant, if admits the curvature inheritance symmetry. The energy-momentum tensor is to be covariantly constant in a 4-dimensional relativistic perfect fluid spacetime which is also conformally flat spacetime, admits curvature inheritance, and obeys Einstein's field equations in the presence of a cosmological constant. Moreover, it is also obtained that such spacetimes with perfect fluid satisfy the the vacuum-like equation of state consecutively it is dark matter. Finally, in the third part of the article, the case compatible with all Theorems from Theorem \ref{Th2.1} to Theorem \ref{Th2.5n} is shown. On the other hand, it has also been emphasized that it is an example of de Sitter spacetime. It has been demonstrated that this spacetime also has a conformal killing vector.</description>

      <title>Conformal duality of the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation: Theory and applications to parameter estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.17720v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (NLSE) is a rich and versatile model, which in one spatial dimension has stationary solutions similar to those of the linear Schr\"odinger equation as well as more exotic solutions such as solitary waves and quantum droplets. Here we present the unified theory of the NLSE, showing that all stationary solutions of the local one-dimensional cubic-quintic NLSE can be classified according to a single number called the cross-ratio. Any two solutions with the same cross-ratio can be converted into one another using a conformal transformation, and the same also holds true for traveling wave solutions. Further, we introduce an optimization afterburner that relies on this conformal symmetry to substantially improve NLSE parameter estimation from noisy empirical data. The new method therefore should have far reaching practical applications for nonlinear physical systems.</description>

      <title>Homotopy, Symmetry, and Non-Hermitian Band Topology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.14416v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian matrices are ubiquitous in the description of nature ranging from classical dissipative systems, including optical, electrical, and mechanical metamaterials, to scattering of waves and open quantum many-body systems. Seminal line-gap and point-gap classifications of non-Hermitian systems using K-theory have deepened the understanding of many physical phenomena. However, ample systems remain beyond this description; reference points and lines do not in general distinguish whether multiple non-Hermitian bands exhibit intriguing exceptional points, spectral braids and crossings. To address this we consider two different notions: non-Hermitian band gaps and separation gaps that crucially encompass a broad class of multi-band scenarios, enabling the description of generic band structures with symmetries. With these concepts, we provide a unified and comprehensive classification of both gapped and nodal systems in the presence of physically relevant parity-time ($\mathcal{PT}$) and pseudo-Hermitian symmetries using homotopy theory. This uncovers new stable topology stemming from both eigenvalues and wave functions, and remarkably also implies distinct fragile topological phases. In particular, we reveal different Abelian and non-Abelian phases in $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric systems, described by frame and braid topology. The corresponding invariants are robust to symmetry-preserving perturbations that do not induce (exceptional) degeneracy, and they also predict the deformation rules of nodal phases. We further demonstrate that spontaneous $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry breaking is captured by Chern-Euler and Chern-Stiefel-Whitney descriptions, a fingerprint of unprecedented non-Hermitian topology previously overlooked. These results open the door for theoretical and experimental exploration of a rich variety of novel topological phenomena in a wide range of physical platforms.</description>

      <title>Operadic structure of boundary conditions for two-dimensional Markov Gaussian random fields on the lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.07230v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The theory of Markov processes on the square lattice has been given recently by the second author a new algebraic description in terms of operads. In particular, this new approach allows for a nice description of invariant boundary conditions and infinite-volume Gibbs measures. This theory comes with new algebraic objects which have not been constructed on any non trivial model yet. In this article, the main objective is to exhibit and understand these structures in the particular case of Gaussian Markov fields on the two-dimensional square lattice. This article, in the Gaussian framework, is the first time where all the operadic constructions -- products and eigen-elements up to morphisms -- introduced by the second author are defined rigorously. We also relate these constructions to more classical approach such as the transfer matrix of statistical mechanics and the Fourier transform. The description of half-strips and corners is new and requires the introduction of new operations such as folding. From the probabilistic point of view, we also show that the operadic products on the boundaries are not easily defined and most operations are lifted to the level of parameter spaces, here quadratic forms through Schur complements.</description>

Abstract: We propose a microscopic definition of finite cut-off JT quantum gravity on the disk, both in the discretized and in the continuum points of view. The discretized formulation involves a new model of so-called self-overlapping random polygons. The measure is not uniform, implying that the degrees of freedom are not in one-to-one correspondence with the shape of the boundary. The continuum formulation is based on a boundary $\text{CFT}_{1}$ from which we predict some critical exponents of the self-overlapping polygon model. The coupling to an arbitrary bulk matter CFT is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Null Infinity as a Weakly Isolated Horizon</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17977v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Null infinity arises as a boundary of the Penrose conformal completion of an asymptotically flat physical space-time. We first note that null infinity is a weakly isolated horizon (WIH), and then show that its familiar properties can be derived from the general WIH framework. This seems quite surprising because physics associated with black hole (and cosmological) WIHs is very different from that extracted at null infinity. We show that these differences can be directly traced back to the fact that null infinity is a WIH in the conformal completion rather than the physical space-time. In particular, the BMS group at null infinity stems from the symmetry group of WIHs. In a companion paper, we obtain fluxes and charges associated with symmetries associated with both null infinity and black hole (and cosmological) horizons using a new Hamiltonian framework. The fact that is there is a single mathematical framework underlying these different situations paves the way to explore the relation between horizon dynamics in the strong field region and waveforms at infinity. It should also be useful in the analysis of black hole evaporation in quantum gravity.</description>

Abstract: We solve "half" the problem of finding three-dimensional quasisymmetric magnetic fields that do not necessarily satisfy force balance. This involves determining which hidden symmetries are admissible as quasisymmetries, and then showing explicitly how to construct quasisymmetric magnetic fields given an admissible symmetry. The admissibility conditions take the form of a system of overdetermined nonlinear partial differential equations involving second derivatives of the symmetry's infinitesimal generator.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16456v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Flux quantization of the C-field in 11d supergravity is arguably necessary for the (UV-)completion of the theory, in that it determines the torsion charges carried by small numbers of M-branes. However, hypotheses about C-field flux-quantization ("models of the C-field") have previously been discussed only in the bosonic sector of 11d supergravity and ignoring the supergravity equations of motion. Here we highlight a duality-symmetric formulation of on-shell 11d supergravity on superspace, observe that this naturally lends itself to completion of the theory by flux quantization, and indeed that 11d super-spacetimes are put on-shell by carrying quantizable duality-symmetric super-C-field flux; the proof of which we present in detail.</description>

Abstract: The notion of pre-Poisson algebras was introduced by Aguiar in his study of zinbiel algebras and pre-Lie algebras. In this paper, we first introduce NS-Poisson algebras as a generalization of both Poisson algebras and pre-Poisson algebras. An NS-Poisson algebra has an associated sub-adjacent Poisson algebra. We show that a Nijenhuis operator and a twisted Rota-Baxter operator on a Poisson algebra deforms the structure into an NS-Poisson algebra. The semi-classical limit of an NS-algebra deformation and a suitable filtration of an NS-algebra produce NS-Poisson algebras. On the other hand, F-manifold algebras were introduced by Dotsenko as the underlying algebraic structure of F-manifolds. We also introduce NS-F-manifold algebras as a simultaneous generalization of NS-Poisson algebras, F-manifold algebras and pre-F-manifold algebras. In the end, we show that Nijenhuis deformations of F-manifold algebras and the semi-classical limits of NS-pre-Lie algebra deformations have NS-F-manifold algebra structures.</description>

Abstract: An exactly solvable strongly correlated electron model with two independent parameters is constructed in the frame of the quantum inverse scattering method, which can be seen as a generalization of the Bariev model. Through the Bethe ansatz method, a set of Bethe ansatz equations is derived. In the thermodynamic limit, to study the ground state of the model, we obtain the integral equations for the density of Bethe roots. Numerical validation are done to confirm the accuracy of our analytic results.</description>

      <title>Positive formula for the product of conjugacy classes on the unitary group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06723v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The convolution product of two conjugacy classes of the unitary group $U_n$ is described by a probability distribution on the space of central measures. Relating this convolution to the quantum cohomology of Grassmannians and using recent results describing the structure constants of the latter, we give a manifestly positive formula for the density of the probability distribution for the product of generic conjugacy classes. In the same flavor as the hive model of Knutson and Tao, this formula is given in terms of a subtraction-free sum of volumes of explicit polytopes. As a consequence, this expression also provides a positive and explicit formula for the volume of $SU_n$-valued flat connections on the three-holed two dimensional sphere, which was first given by Witten in terms of an infinite sum of characters.</description>

      <title>Generalized cluster states from Hopf algebras: non-invertible symmetry and Hopf tensor network representation</title>

Abstract: Cluster states are crucial resources for measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC). It exhibits symmetry-protected topological (SPT) order, thus also playing a crucial role in studying topological phases. We present the construction of cluster states based on Hopf algebras. By generalizing the finite group valued qudit to a Hopf algebra valued qudit and introducing the generalized Pauli-X operator based on the regular action of the Hopf algebra, as well as the generalized Pauli-Z operator based on the irreducible representation action on the Hopf algebra, we develop a comprehensive theory of Hopf qudits. We demonstrate that non-invertible symmetry naturally emerges for Hopf qudits. Subsequently, for a bipartite graph termed the cluster graph, we assign the identity state and trivial representation state to even and odd vertices, respectively. Introducing the edge entangler as controlled regular action, we provide a general construction of Hopf cluster states. To ensure the commutativity of the edge entangler, we propose a method to construct a cluster lattice for any triangulable manifold. We use the 1d cluster state as an example to illustrate our construction. As this serves as a promising candidate for SPT phases, we construct the gapped Hamiltonian for this scenario and delve into a detailed discussion of its non-invertible symmetries. We also show that the 1d cluster state model is equivalent to the quasi-1d Hopf quantum double model. We also introduce the Hopf tensor network representation of Hopf cluster states by integrating the tensor representation of structure constants with the string diagrams of the Hopf algebra.</description>

      <title>Progresses on some open problems related to infinitely many symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00208</link>

Abstract: The quest to reveal the physical essence of the infinitely many symmetries and conservation laws that are intrinsic to integrable systems has historically posed a significant challenge at the confluence of physics and mathematics. This scholarly investigation delves into five open problems related to these boundless symmetries within integrable systems by scrutinizing their multi-wave solutions, employing a fresh analytical methodology. For a specified integrable system, there exist various categories of $n$-wave solutions. Each sub-wave comprising the $n$-wave solution may possess free parameters, including center, width, and periodic parameters. It is evident that these solutions are translation invariant with respect to all these free parameters. We postulate that the entirety of the recognized infinite symmetries merely constitute linear combinations of these finite wave parameter translation symmetries. The conjecture intimates that the currently known infinitely many symmetries are not exhaustive, and an indeterminate number of symmetries remain to be discovered. This conjecture further indicates that by imposing an infinite array of symmetry constraints, it becomes feasible to derive exact multi-wave solutions. By considering the renowned KdV equation and the Burgers equation as simple examples, the conjecture is substantiated for the $n$-soliton solutions. It is unequivocal that any linear combination of the wave parameter translation symmetries retains its status as a symmetry associated with the particular solution. This observation suggests that by introducing a ren-variable and a ren-symmetric derivative which serve as generalizations of the Grassmann variable and the super derivative, it may be feasible to unify classical integrable systems, supersymmetric integrable systems, and ren-symmetric integrable systems within a cohesive hierarchical framework.</description>

      <title>Elliptic Deformation of the Gaiotto-Rap\v{c}\'{a}k Corner VOA and the Associated Partially Symmetric Polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15860v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct the elliptic Miura transformation and use it to obtain the expression of the currents of elliptic corner VOA. We subsequently prove a novel combinatorial formula that is essential for deriving the quadratic relations of the currents. In addition, we give a conjecture that relates the correlation function of the currents of elliptic corner VOA to a certain family of partially symmetric polynomials. The elliptic Macdonald polynomials, constructed recently by Awata-Kanno-Mironov-Morozov-Zenkevich, and Fukuda-Ohkubo-Shiraishi, can be obtained as a particular case of this family.</description>
