      <title>Goppa Codes: Key to High Efficiency and Reliability in Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study some codes of algebraic geometry related to certain maximal curves. Quantum stabilizer codes obtained through the self orthogonality of Hermitian codes of this error correcting do not always have good parameters. However, appropriate parameters found that the Hermitian self-orthogonal code quantum stabilizer code has good parameters. Therefore, we investigated the quantum stabilizer code at a certain maximum curve and modified its parameters. Algebraic geometry codes show promise for enabling high data rate transmission over noisy power line communication channels.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Limits of Communication-Assisted Sensing in ISAC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system stands out as a pivotal usage scenario of 6G. To explore the coordination gains offered by the ISAC technique, this paper introduces a novel communication-assisted sensing (CAS) system. The CAS system can endow users with beyond-line-of-sight sensing capability, wherein the base station with favorable visibility senses device-free targets, simultaneously transmitting the acquired sensory information to users. Within the CAS framework, we characterize the fundamental limits to reveal the achievable distortion between the state of the targets of interest and their reconstruction at the users' end. Finally, within the confines of this theoretical framework, we employ a typical application as an illustrative example to demonstrate the minimization of distortion through dual-functional waveform design, showcasing the potential of CAS in enhancing sensing capabilities.</description>

      <title>OTFS Channel Estimation and Detection for Channels with Very Large Delay Spread</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In low latency applications and in general, for overspread channels, channel delay spread is a large percentage of the transmission frame duration. In this paper, we consider OTFS in an overspread channel exhibiting a delay spread that exceeds the block duration in a frame, where traditional channel estimation (CE) fails. We propose a two-stage CE method based on a delay-Doppler (DD) training frame, consisting of a dual chirp converted from time domain and a higher power pilot. The first stage employs a DD domain embedded pilot CE to estimate the aliased delays (due to modulo operation) and Doppler shifts, followed by identifying all the underspread paths not coinciding with any overspread path. The second stage utilizes time domain dual chirp correlation to estimate the actual delays and Doppler shifts of the remaining paths. This stage also resolves ambiguity in estimating delays and Doppler shifts for paths sharing same aliased delay. Furthermore, we present a modified low-complexity maximum ratio combining (MRC) detection algorithm for OTFS in overspread channels. Finally, we evaluate performance of OTFS using the proposed CE and the modified MRC detection in terms of normalized mean square error (NMSE) and bit error rate (BER).</description>

      <title>On the Impact of Reactive Region on the Near-Field Channel Gain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The near-field channel gain is analyzed by considering both radiating and reactive components of the electromagnetic field. Novel expressions are derived for the channel gains of spatially-discrete (SPD) and continuous-aperture (CAP) arrays, which are more accurate than conventional results that neglect the reactive region. To gain further insights, asymptotic analyses are carried out in the large aperture size, based on which the impact of the reactive region is discussed. It is proved that for both SPD and CAP arrays, the impact of the reactive region on near-field channel gain is negligible, even as the array aperture size approaches infinity.</description>

      <title>Joint Computation Offloading and Target Tracking in Integrated Sensing and Communication Enabled UAV Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a joint computation offloading and target tracking in Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC)-enabled unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) network. Therein, the UAV has a computing task that is partially offloaded to the ground UE for execution. Meanwhile, the UAV uses the offloading bit sequence to estimate the velocity of a ground target based on an autocorrelation function. The performance of the velocity estimation that is represented by Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRB) depends on the length of the offloading bit sequence and the UAV's location. Thus, we jointly optimize the task size for offloading and the UAV's location to minimize the overall computation latency and the CRB of the mean square error for velocity estimation subject to the UAV's budget. The problem is non-convex, and we propose a genetic algorithm to solve it. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Galois Self-dual 2-quasi Constacyclic Codes over Finite Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $F$ be a field with cardinality $p^\ell$ and $0\neq \lambda\in F$, and $0\le h&lt;\ell$. Extending Euclidean and Hermitian inner products, Fan and Zhang introduced Galois $p^h$-inner product (DCC, vol.84, pp.473-492). In this paper, we characterize the structure of $2$-quasi $\lambda$-constacyclic codes over $F$; and exhibit necessary and sufficient conditions for $2$-quasi $\lambda$-constacyclic codes being Galois self-dual. With the help of a technique developed in this paper, we prove that, when $\ell$ is even, the Hermitian self-dual $2$-quasi $\lambda$-constacyclic codes are asymptotically good if and only if $\lambda^{1+p^{\ell/2}}=1$. And, when $p^\ell\,{\not\equiv}\,3~({\rm mod}~4)$, the Euclidean self-dual $2$-quasi $\lambda$-constacyclic codes are asymptotically good if and only if $\lambda^{2}=1$.</description>

      <title>Learning-Based Joint Antenna Selection and Precoding Design for Cell-Free MIMO Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers a downlink cell-free multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) network in which multiple multi-antenna base stations (BSs) serve multiple users via coherent joint transmission. In order to reduce the energy consumption by radio frequency components, each BS selects a subset of antennas for downlink data transmission after estimating the channel state information (CSI). We aim to maximize the sum spectral efficiency by jointly optimizing the antenna selection and precoding design. To alleviate the fronthaul overhead and enable real-time network operation, we propose a distributed scalable machine learning algorithm. In particular, at each BS, we deploy a convolutional neural network (CNN) for antenna selection and a graph neural network (GNN) for precoding design. Different from conventional centralized solutions that require a large amount of CSI and signaling exchange among the BSs, the proposed distributed machine learning algorithm takes only locally estimated CSI as input. With well-trained learning models, it is shown that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms the distributed baseline schemes and achieves a sum spectral efficiency comparable to its centralized counterpart.</description>

      <title>Age of Information Optimization and State Error Analysis for Correlated Multi-Process Multi-Sensor Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine a multi-sensor system where each sensor may monitor more than one time-varying information process and send status updates to a remote monitor over a single channel. We consider that each sensor's status update may contain information about more than one information process in the system subject to the system's constraints. To investigate the impact of this correlation on the overall system's performance, we conduct an analysis of both the average Age of Information and source state estimation error at the monitor. Building upon this analysis, we subsequently explore the impact of the packet arrivals, correlation probabilities, and rate of processes' state change on the system's performance. Next, we consider the case where sensors have limited sensing abilities and distribute a portion of their sensing abilities for different processes. We optimize this distribution to minimize the total AoI of the system. Interestingly, we show that monitoring multiple processes from a single source may not always be beneficial. Additionally, our results highlight that the optimal sensing distribution for diverse arrival rates may exhibit a fast regime change instead of undergoing smooth changes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a post-training quantization algorithm with error estimates relying on ideas originating from frame theory. Specifically, we use first-order Sigma-Delta ($\Sigma\Delta$) quantization for finite unit-norm tight frames to quantize weight matrices and biases in a neural network. In our scenario, we derive an error bound between the original neural network and the quantized neural network in terms of step size and the number of frame elements. We also demonstrate how to leverage the redundancy of frames to achieve a quantized neural network with higher accuracy.</description>

      <title>HCL-MTSAD: Hierarchical Contrastive Consistency Learning for Accurate Detection of Industrial Multivariate Time Series Anomalies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multivariate Time Series (MTS) anomaly detection focuses on pinpointing samples that diverge from standard operational patterns, which is crucial for ensuring the safety and security of industrial applications. The primary challenge in this domain is to develop representations capable of discerning anomalies effectively. The prevalent methods for anomaly detection in the literature are predominantly reconstruction-based and predictive in nature. However, they typically concentrate on a single-dimensional instance level, thereby not fully harnessing the complex associations inherent in industrial MTS. To address this issue, we propose a novel self-supervised hierarchical contrastive consistency learning method for detecting anomalies in MTS, named HCL-MTSAD. It innovatively leverages data consistency at multiple levels inherent in industrial MTS, systematically capturing consistent associations across four latent levels-measurement, sample, channel, and process. By developing a multi-layer contrastive loss, HCL-MTSAD can extensively mine data consistency and spatio-temporal association, resulting in more informative representations. Subsequently, an anomaly discrimination module, grounded in self-supervised hierarchical contrastive learning, is designed to detect timestamp-level anomalies by calculating multi-scale data consistency. Extensive experiments conducted on six diverse MTS datasets retrieved from real cyber-physical systems and server machines, in comparison with 20 baselines, indicate that HCL-MTSAD's anomaly detection capability outperforms the state-of-the-art benchmark models by an average of 1.8\% in terms of F1 score.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we formalize an optimization framework for analog beamforming in the context of monostatic integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), where we also address the problem of self-interference in the analog domain. As a result, we derive semidefinite programs to approach detection-optimal transmit and receive beamformers, and we devise a superiorized iterative projection algorithm to approximate them. Our simulations show that this approach outperforms the detection performance of well-known design techniques for ISAC beamforming, while it achieves satisfactory self-interference suppression.</description>

      <title>Semantic Communication for Cooperative Multi-Task Processing over Wireless Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we have expanded the current status of semantic communication limited to processing one task to a more general system that can handle multiple tasks concurrently. In pursuit of this, we first introduced our definition of the "semantic source", enabling the interpretation of multiple semantics based on a single observation. A semantic encoder design is then introduced, featuring the division of the encoder into a common unit and multiple specific units enabling cooperative multi-task processing. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed semantic source and the system design. Our approach employs information maximization (infomax) and end-to-end design principles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.12735v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The electromagnetic (EM) features of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) fundamentally determine their operating principles and performance. Motivated by these considerations, we study a single-input single-output (SISO) system in the presence of an RIS, which is characterized by a circuit-based EM-consistent model. Specifically, we model the RIS as a collection of thin wire dipoles controlled by tunable load impedances, and we propose a gradient-based algorithm for calculating the optimal impedances of the scattering elements of the RIS in the presence of mutual coupling. Furthermore, we prove the convergence of the proposed algorithm and derive its computational complexity in terms of number of complex multiplications. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithm provides better performance and converges faster than a benchmark algorithm.</description>

      <title>Beamfocusing Optimization for Near-Field Wideband Multi-User Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.16861v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A near-field wideband communication system is investigated in which a base station (BS) employs an extra-large scale antenna array (ELAA) to serve multiple users in its near-field region. To facilitate near-field multi-user beamforming and mitigate the spatial wideband effect, the BS employs a hybrid beamforming architecture based on true-time delayers (TTDs). In addition to the conventional fully-connected TTD-based hybrid beamforming architecture, a new sub-connected architecture is proposed to improve energy efficiency and reduce hardware requirements. Two wideband beamforming optimization approaches are proposed to maximize spectral efficiency for both architectures. 1) Fully-digital approximation (FDA) approach based on full channel state information (CSI): In this method, the TTD-based hybrid beamformer is optimized by the block-coordinate descent and penalty method to approximate the optimal digital beamformer. This approach ensures convergence to the stationary point of the spectral efficiency maximization problem. 2) Heuristic two-stage (HTS) approach based on partial CSI: In this approach, a piecewise-near-field approximation of near-field channels is first proposed to facilitate the design of TTD-based analog beamformers based on the outcomes of near-field beam training. Subsequently, the low-dimensional digital beamformer is optimized using knowledge of the low-dimensional equivalent channels, resulting in reduced computational complexity and channel estimation complexity. Our numerical results show that 1) the proposed approach effectively eliminates the spatial wideband effect, and 2) the proposed sub-connected architecture is more energy efficient and has fewer hardware constraints on the TTD and system bandwidth compared to the fully-connected architecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.09888v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The novel concept of near-field velocity sensing is proposed. In contrast to far-field velocity sensing, near-field velocity sensing enables the simultaneous estimation of both radial and transverse velocities of a moving target. A maximum-likelihood-based method is proposed for jointly estimating the radial and transverse velocities from the echo signals. Assisted by near-field velocity sensing, a predictive beamforming framework is proposed for a moving communication user, which requires no channel estimation but achieves seamless data transmission. Finally, numerical examples validate the proposed approaches.</description>

      <title>Nearest-Neighbours Estimators for Conditional Mutual Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00556v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The conditional mutual information quantifies the conditional dependence of two random variables. It has numerous applications; it forms, for example, part of the definition of transfer entropy, a common measure of the causal relationship between time series. It does, however, require a lot of data to estimate accurately and suffers the curse of dimensionality, limiting its application in machine learning and data science. However, the Kozachenko-Leonenko approach can address this problem: it is possible, in this approach to define a nearest-neighbour estimator which depends only on the distance between data points and not on the dimension of the data. Furthermore, the bias can be calculated analytically for this estimator. Here this estimator is described and is tested on simulated data.</description>

Abstract: Consider a binary statistical hypothesis testing problem, where $n$ independent and identically distributed random variables $Z^n$ are either distributed according to the null hypothesis $P$ or the alternative hypothesis $Q$, and only $P$ is known. A well-known test that is suitable for this case is the so-called Hoeffding test, which accepts $P$ if the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the empirical distribution of $Z^n$ and $P$ is below some threshold. This work characterizes the first and second-order terms of the type-II error probability for a fixed type-I error probability for the Hoeffding test as well as for divergence tests, where the KL divergence is replaced by a general divergence. It is demonstrated that, irrespective of the divergence, divergence tests achieve the first-order term of the Neyman-Pearson test, which is the optimal test when both $P$ and $Q$ are known. In contrast, the second-order term of divergence tests is strictly worse than that of the Neyman-Pearson test. It is further demonstrated that divergence tests with an invariant divergence achieve the same second-order term as the Hoeffding test, but divergence tests with a non-invariant divergence may outperform the Hoeffding test for some alternative hypotheses $Q$. Potentially, this behavior could be exploited by a composite hypothesis test with partial knowledge of the alternative hypothesis $Q$ by tailoring the divergence of the divergence test to the set of possible alternative hypotheses.</description>

      <title>RIS-Assisted OTFS Communications: Phase Configuration via Received Energy Maximization</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the integration of two revolutionary technologies, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) and orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation, to enhance high-speed wireless communications. We introduce a novel phase shift design algorithm for RIS-assisted OTFS, optimizing energy reception and channel gain in dynamic environments. The study evaluates the proposed approach in a downlink scenario, demonstrating significant performance improvements compared to benchmark schemes in the literature, particularly in terms of bit error rate (BER). Our results showcase the potential of RIS to enhance the system's performance. Specifically, our proposed phase shift design technique outperforms the benchmark solutions by over 4 dB. Furthermore, even greater gains can be obtained as the number of RIS elements increases.</description>

      <title>The Curious Price of Distributional Robustness in Reinforcement Learning with a Generative Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16589</link>

Abstract: This paper investigates model robustness in reinforcement learning (RL) to reduce the sim-to-real gap in practice. We adopt the framework of distributionally robust Markov decision processes (RMDPs), aimed at learning a policy that optimizes the worst-case performance when the deployed environment falls within a prescribed uncertainty set around the nominal MDP. Despite recent efforts, the sample complexity of RMDPs remained mostly unsettled regardless of the uncertainty set in use. It was unclear if distributional robustness bears any statistical consequences when benchmarked against standard RL. Assuming access to a generative model that draws samples based on the nominal MDP, we characterize the sample complexity of RMDPs when the uncertainty set is specified via either the total variation (TV) distance or $\chi^2$ divergence. The algorithm studied here is a model-based method called {\em distributionally robust value iteration}, which is shown to be near-optimal for the full range of uncertainty levels. Somewhat surprisingly, our results uncover that RMDPs are not necessarily easier or harder to learn than standard MDPs. The statistical consequence incurred by the robustness requirement depends heavily on the size and shape of the uncertainty set: in the case w.r.t.~the TV distance, the minimax sample complexity of RMDPs is always smaller than that of standard MDPs; in the case w.r.t.~the $\chi^2$ divergence, the sample complexity of RMDPs can often far exceed the standard MDP counterpart.</description>

      <title>Single-shot decoding of good quantum LDPC codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12470</link>

Abstract: Quantum Tanner codes constitute a family of quantum low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes with good parameters, i.e., constant encoding rate and relative distance. In this article, we prove that quantum Tanner codes also facilitate single-shot quantum error correction (QEC) of adversarial noise, where one measurement round (consisting of constant-weight parity checks) suffices to perform reliable QEC even in the presence of measurement errors. We establish this result for both the sequential and parallel decoding algorithms introduced by Leverrier and Z\'emor. Furthermore, we show that in order to suppress errors over multiple repeated rounds of QEC, it suffices to run the parallel decoding algorithm for constant time in each round. Combined with good code parameters, the resulting constant-time overhead of QEC and robustness to (possibly time-correlated) adversarial noise make quantum Tanner codes alluring from the perspective of quantum fault-tolerant protocols.</description>
