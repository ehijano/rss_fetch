      <title>Entanglement entropy as a probe of topological phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement entropy (EE) provides a powerful probe of quantum phases, yet its role in identifying topological transitions in disordered systems remains underexplored. We introduce an exact EE-based framework that captures topological phase transitions even in the presence of disorder. Specifically, for a class of Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model variants, we show that the difference in EE between half-filled and near-half-filled ground states, $\Delta S^{\mathcal{A}}$, vanishes in the topological phase but remains finite in the trivial phase -- a direct consequence of edge-state localization. This behavior persists even in the presence of quasiperiodic or binary disorder. Exact phase boundaries, derived from Lyapunov exponents via transfer matrices, agree closely with numerical results from $\Delta S^{\mathcal{A}}$ and the topological invariant $\mathcal{Q}$, with instances where $\Delta S^{\mathcal{A}}$ outperforms $\mathcal{Q}$. Our results highlight EE as a robust diagnostic tool and a potential bridge between quantum information and condensed matter approaches to topological matter.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity and Ferroelectric Orbital Magnetism in Semimetallic Rhombohedral Hexalayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rhombohedral multilayer graphene has emerged as a promising platform for exploring correlated and topological quantum phases, enabled by its Berry-curvature-bearing flat bands. While prior work has focused on separated conduction and valence bands, we probe the extensive semimetallic regime of rhombohedral hexalayer graphene. We survey a rich phase diagram dominated by flavor-symmetry breaking and reveal an electric-field-driven band inversion through fermiology. Near this inversion, we find a superconducting-like state confined to a region with emergent electron and hole Fermi surfaces. In addition, two multiferroic orbital-magnetic phases are observed: a ferrovalley state near zero field and a ferroelectric state at large fields around charge neutrality. The latter shows electric-field-reversible magnetic hysteresis, consistent with a $\Delta P \cdot M$ multiferroic order parameter. Our fermiology analysis elucidates the correlated semimetal regime in rhombohedral graphene and underscores its potential to host diverse quantum phases.</description>

      <title>Evolution of magnetic bubble domains in the uniaxial ferromagnet CeRu$_2$Ga$_2$B inferred from the Hall effect and ac magnetic susceptibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Hall effect, AC magnetic susceptibility ($\chi_{\rm ac}$), and magnetic force microscopy of the uniaxial ferromagnet CeRu$_2$Ga$_2$B with a centrosymmetric crystal structure. We observe a finite topological Hall effect (THE) within the ordered phase before the magnetization is polarized by applied field. By comparing the field dependences of the area fraction of the magnetic bubbles, the derivative of $\chi_{\rm ac}$, and the THE signal, we deduce that the magnetic bubbles of CeRu$_2$Ga$_2$B evolve from the trivial to topological spin texture with field. Our findings will be utilized to expand the search for magnetic materials hosting the topological spin textures to ones with uniaxial anisotropy, and open a new possibility to tailor the topological spin texture.</description>

      <title>Terahertz third-harmonic generation of lightwave driven Weyl fermions far from equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on time-resolved ultrafast terahertz third-harmonic generation spectroscopy of nonequilibrium dynamics of Weyl fermions in a nanometer thin film of the Weyl semimetal TaP. Under a strong multicycle narrowband terahertz drive, very efficient terahertz third-harmonic generation is observed at room temperature which exhibits a perturbative cubic power-law dependence on the terahertz drive. By varying the polarization of the drive pulse from linear to elliptical, we realize a sensitive tuning of the third harmonic yield. We ascribe the observed strong nonlinearity to THz field driven nonlinear kinetics of the Weyl fermions.</description>

      <title>Investigating structure and physical properties of quaternary layered transition metal oxide Na2Cu2TeO6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated the crystal structure, magnetic behavior, and optical properties of the layered honeycomb compound Na2Cu2TeO6. X-ray and neutron diffraction confirmed a monoclinic structure, with Cu ions arranged in dimerized chains. Magnetic susceptibility measurements yielded a Curie-Weiss temperature significantly lower than the expected spin-only value, indicating the presence of strong antiferromagnetic interactions and enhanced quantum fluctuations. A broad maximum near 160 K in the susceptibility data is consistent with short-range one-dimensional antiferromagnetic correlations. Magnetization measurements showed negligible coercivity, and specific heat data revealed no anomalies down to 3 K. Temperature-dependent neutron diffraction showed no evidence of long-range magnetic order. Optical absorption studies using UV-Visible spectroscopy displayed a sharp absorption edge in the UV region. Tauc analysis estimated a direct optical band gap of approximately 2.10 eV, with no clear indication of an indirect transition. These observations provide insight into the interplay between structural distortions, low-dimensional magnetism, and optical behavior in Na2Cu2TeO6</description>

      <title>Scalable Hybrid quantum Monte Carlo simulation of U(1) gauge field coupled to fermions on GPU</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a GPU-accelerated hybrid quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) algorithm to solve the fundamental yet difficult problem of $U(1)$ gauge field coupled to fermions, which gives rise to a $U(1)$ Dirac spin liquid state under the description of (2+1)d quantum electrodynamics QED$_3$. The algorithm renders a good acceptance rate and, more importantly, nearly linear space-time volume scaling in computational complexity $O(N_{\tau} V_s)$, where $N_\tau$ is the imaginary time dimension and $V_s$ is spatial volume, which is much more efficient than determinant QMC with scaling behavior of $O(N_\tau V_s^3)$. Such acceleration is achieved via a collection of technical improvements, including (i) the design of the efficient problem-specific preconditioner, (ii) customized CUDA kernel for matrix-vector multiplication, and (iii) CUDA Graph implementation on the GPU. These advances allow us to simulate the $U(1)$ Dirac spin liquid state with unprecedentedly large system sizes, which is up to $N_\tau\times L\times L = 660\times66\times66$, and reveal its novel properties. With these technical improvements, we see the asymptotic convergence in the scaling dimensions of various fermion bilinear operators and the conserved current operator when approaching the thermodynamic limit. The scaling dimensions find good agreement with field-theoretical expectation, which provides supporting evidence for the conformal nature of the $U(1)$ Dirac spin liquid state in the \qed. Our technical advancements open an avenue to study the Dirac spin liquid state and its transition towards symmetry-breaking phases at larger system sizes and with less computational burden.</description>

      <title>Universal Entanglement Pattern Formation via a Quantum Quench</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We identify a universal short-time structure in symmetry-resolved entanglement dynamics -- the entanglement channel wave (ECW) -- arising from the decomposition of entanglement into conserved-quantum-number sectors that host robust, channel-specific patterns. Focusing on domain-wall melting, we conduct a systematic investigation across three paradigmatic classes of many-body systems: U(1) fermions, U(1) bosons, and SU(2) spinful fermions. For each class, we explore four distinct regimes defined by the presence or absence of interactions and disorder, employing both the Krylov-subspace iterative method and the correlation matrix approach. The ECW emerges universally across all cases, establishing its independence from particle statistics, interaction strength and disorder. In free fermions, the ECW formalism further enables analytical determination of the correlation matrix spectrum. The subsequent melting of the ECW exhibits symmetry- and statistics-dependent signatures, revealing finer structures in the growth of symmetry-resolved entanglement.</description>

      <title>Tracking flat bands via phonon-mediated interband scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flat-band (FB) materials have emerged as promising platforms for exploring exotic quantum phases. While numerous candidates have recently been identified through spectroscopic techniques such as angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, central challenges remain on how to tune FBs towards the Fermi level $E_F$ and to understand their impact on low-energy excitations probed in electronic transport experiments. Here, we show that, by attributing the temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity at elevated temperatures to electron-phonon interband scattering, one can infer the position of FBs near $E_F$ across diverse material classes. As charge carriers scatter off phonons, interband transitions into FB states lead to distinctive sub- or superlinear resistivity at elevated temperatures, governed by the proximity of the FB to $E_F$. Our phenomenological model captures these universal transport behaviors observed across several recently studied FB compounds and offers a simple, broadly applicable method for detecting flat bands.</description>

      <title>Chiral charge density wave in 4Hb- and 1T-TaS$_2$: The Role of interlayer coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use micro-angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (micro-ARPES) to investigate chiral charge density waves (CDWs) in 4Hb-TaS$_2$ with micron-scale spatial resolution. In the 1T layers of 4Hb-TaS$_2$, we uncover coexisting left- and right-handed CDW domains and resolve four distinct spectral patterns arising from the interplay of chirality and rotational stacking. In contrast, bulk 1T-TaS$_2$ exhibits a uniform chirality. In addition, 4Hb-TaS$_2$ shows negligible out-of-plane dispersion of the 1T-derived bands, in contrast to the pronounced interlayer coupling observed in bulk 1T-TaS$_2$. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations corroborate this picture, revealing that the interlayer interaction of the chiral order in 4Hb-TaS$_2$ is nearly two orders of magnitude weaker than in the 1T polytype. Our findings establish 4Hb-TaS$_2$ as a quasi-two-dimensional platform for exploring tunable chiral CDW phenomena.</description>

      <title>Teleportation based detection of quantum critical points using small spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show for the models here investigated that the teleportation based quantum critical point (QCP) detectors can properly estimate the locations of the QCPs when we are not even close to the thermodynamic limit (infinite spin chains) and when we only have access to finite temperature data. Specifically, by working with spin chains with about ten qubits and in equilibrium with a thermal reservoir at temperature T, we show that it is possible to locate with an error of only a few percents the correct spots of the QCPs for almost all the models studied here. The spin chains we investigate are given by the XXZ model with or without an external longitudinal magnetic field as well as the XX model, the XY model, and the Ising model, all of them subjected to an external transverse magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Enhanced thermopower in a magnetic semiconductor EuTe4 with multiple charge-density-wave instabilities/</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the layered magnetic semiconductor EuTe4, focusing on its intricate charge-density wave (CDW) states near and above room temperature through single-crystal X-ray diffraction (XRD), magnetic, and thermoelectric measurements.The XRD measurement revealed that the CDW state inducing the polar lattice distortion persists even at 650 K, demonstrating its remarkable thermal stability. Notably, the Seebeck coefficient near room temperature reaches values exceeding 500 uVK-1. This large Seebeck coefficient, not fully captured by a simple band calculation, is comparable to those observed in heavy-electron semiconducting oxides, suggesting the importance of electron correlation and spin/lattice instabilities. Furthermore, potentially reflecting the competition of two types of CDW states, the thermal conductivity near room temperature is as low as 0.02 Wcm-1K-1. As a result, the thermoelectric figure of merit zT reaches 0.22 at 460 K. These findings establish EuTe4 as a compelling platform to explore novel types of thermoelectric materials with multiple electronic instability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconducting chiral domains associated with a time-reversal symmetry-breaking order parameter have garnered significant attention in Kagome systems. In this work, we demonstrate both the intrinsic direct-current and alternating-current Josephson effects in the nanoplates of the vanadium-based Kagome material CsV3Sb5, as evidenced by Fraunhofer-like patterns and Shapiro steps. Moreover, both the Fraunhofer-like patterns and Shapiro steps are modulated by thermal cycling, suggesting that the Josephson effects arise from dynamic superconducting domains. These findings may provide new insights into chiral superconductivity in CsV3Sb5 and highlight the potential of these intrinsic Josephson junctions for applications in chiral superconductor based quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Double excitations in molecules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Double excitations in organic molecules have garnered significant interest as a result of their importance in singlet fission and photophysics. These excitations play a crucial role in understanding the photoexcitation processes in polyenes. To describe photoexcited states with both single and double excitation character, we use a first-principles many-body theory that combines the GW / Bethe-Salpeter equation and the configuration interaction (CI) methods. Specifically, we develop and employ two CI-based methods: screened configuration interaction singles and doubles (scrCISD) and screened configuration interaction singles with perturbative doubles (scrCIS(D)), applied to an effective many-body Hamiltonian that incorporates screening. We apply these methods to Thiel's set of molecules, which exhibit excited states predominantly characterized by single excitations with a partial double excitation character. Our results indicate that the scrCISD method systematically underestimates the excitation energies compared to the best theoretical estimates, while the scrCIS(D) method shows good agreement with these estimates. Furthermore, we used the scrCISD method to calculate the binding energies of the dominantly doubly excited correlated triplet pair states, $\mathrm{TT^1}$, in pentacene dimers, finding that the $\mathrm{TT^1}$ binding energies agree well with empirical calculations.</description>

      <title>Extreme magnetic field-boosted superconductivity in a high-temperature superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic fields typically suppress superconductivity through Pauli and orbital limiting effects. However, there are rare instances of magnetic-field-induced superconductivity, as seen in Chevrel phase compounds [1], organic conductors [2], uranium-based heavy-fermion systems [3, 4], and moire graphene [5], though these materials possess inherently low superconducting transition temperatures (Tc). Here, we demonstrate high field-stabilized superconductivity in a class of materials with a significantly higher Tc (up to 40 K): the infinite-layer nickelates [6]. Both low-field and high-field superconducting states can be plausibly explained by a compensation mechanism akin to the Jaccarino-Peter effect. These findings demonstrate the possibility of achieving substantially enhanced upper critical fields in high-temperature superconductors.</description>

      <title>Infinite matrix product states for $(1+1)$-dimensional gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a matrix product operator construction that allows us to represent the lattice Hamiltonians of (abelian or non-abelian) gauge theories in a local and manifestly translation-invariant form. In particular, we use symmetric matrix product states and introduce link-enhanced matrix product operators (LEMPOs) that can act on both the physical and virtual spaces of the matrix product states. This construction allows us to study Hamiltonian lattice gauge theories on infinite lattices. As examples, we show how to implement this method to study the massless and massive one-flavor Schwinger model and adjoint QCD$_2$.</description>

      <title>Charge transfer empties the flat band in 4H$_b$-TaS$_2$ -- except at the surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The 4H\textsubscript{b} polytype of TaS$_2$ is a natural heterostructure of H and T-type layers. Intriguing recent evidence points towards a possibly chiral superconducting ground state, unlike the superconductivity found in other polytypes where the T layers are absent, requiring understanding of the possible contributions of electrons from the T layers. Here we use micro-focused angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy to reveal that the T termination of the 4H\textsubscript{b} structure is metallic, but a subsurface T layer -- seen below an H termination and thus more representative of the bulk case -- is gapped. The results imply a complete charge transfer of 1 electron per 13 Ta from the T to adjacent H layers in the bulk, but an incomplete charge transfer at the T termination, yielding a metallic Fermi surface with a planar-chiral character. A similar metallic state is found in an anomalous region with likely T-H-H' stacking at the surface. Our results exclude cluster Mott localisation in either the bulk or surface of 4H$_b$-TaS$_2$ and point to a scenario of superconductivity arising from Josephson-like tunneling between the H layers.</description>

      <title>Signatures of spin-glass superconductivity in nickelate (La, Pr, Sm)3Ni2O7 films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of Ruddlesden-Popper (R-P) nickelate superconductors under high pressure heralds a new chapter of high-transition temperature (high-Tc) superconductivity. Recently, ambient-pressure superconductivity is achieved in R-P bilayer nickelate thin films through epitaxial compressive strain, unlocking in-depth investigations into the superconducting characteristics. Here, through electrical transport study, we report the observation of spin-glass superconductivity with hysteretic magnetoresistance and glass-like dynamics in the bilayer nickelate (La, Pr, Sm)3Ni2O7 films. The superconductivity develops in a two-step transition, with onset Tc exceeding 50 K and zero-resistance Tc around 15 K. Remarkably, magnetoresistance hysteresis, indicative of time-reversal symmetry breaking, is observed exclusively during the second-step transition to zero resistance. The hysteresis is observed under both out-of-plane and in-plane magnetic fields with significant anisotropy, and exhibits coalescing minima at zero field, fundamentally distinct from trapped vortices or long-range-ordered magnetism with coercivity. Successive oxygen reductions simultaneously suppress the superconductivity and hysteresis, revealing their mutual connections to the selective electronic orbitals. The removal of magnetic field triggers spontaneous and logarithmically slow resistance relaxations in the second-step transition, signatures of glassy dynamics, indicating that the superconducting ground state is correlated with an electronic spin-glass order. Our findings uncover an unprecedented superconducting state in the nickelate superconductors, providing phenomenological and conceptual advances for future investigations on high-Tc superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Getting the manifold right: The crucial role of orbital resolution in DFT+U for mixed d-f electron compounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately modeling compounds with partially filled $d$ and $f$ shells remains a hard challenge for density-functional theory, due to large self-interaction errors stemming from local or semi-local exchange-correlation functionals. Hubbard $U$ corrections can mitigate such errors, but are often detrimental to the description of hybridized states, leading to spurious force contributions and wrong lattice structures. Here, we show that careful disentanglement of localized and delocalized states leads to accurate predictions of electronic states and structural distortions in ternary monouranates (AUO$_4$, where A represents Mn, Co, or Ni), for which standard $U$ corrections generally fail. Crucial to achieving such accuracy is a minimization of the mismatch between the spatial extension of the projector functions and the true coordination geometry. This requires Wannier-like alternatives to atomic-orbital projector functions, or corrections of Hubbard manifolds exclusively comprised of the most localized A-$3d$, U-$5f$ and O-$2p$ orbitals. These findings open up the computational prediction of fundamental properties of actinide solids of critical technological importance.</description>

      <title>Microscopic field theories of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct effective field theories of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect from matrix Chern-Simons theory for $N$ electrons, corresponding to matrix dimension $N$. We first consider a quantum Hall droplet within finite $N$ matrix Chern-Simons theory. Taking into account the differential geometry of the matrix Chern-Simons droplet for a partially-filled fuzzy two-sphere, we first generalize the quantization procedure by replacing the Poisson bracket, a classical Lie derivative, with a quantum counterpart, the Lie derivative for a deformed fuzzy sphere. This yields the topological invariant introduced in earlier works on the quantum skyrmion Hall effect and previously unidentified fusion rules. This is consistent with treatment of a spin $S$ of multiplicity $2S+1$ as a quantum Hall droplet within matrix Chern-Simons theory for $N=2S+1$ spinless electrons and a generalization of a Jain composite particle for a Laughlin state. We then construct $D$-dimensional arrays of coupled small $N$ matrix Chern-Simons droplets as effective field theories of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect. In higher-symmetry constructions, this yields what appears to be a D+1 dimensional $U(N)$ Yang-Mills theory, but actually contains $\delta$ extra fuzzy dimensions from the finite $N$ MCS theory as well as deformations from $U(N)$ due to partial filling of the fuzzy spheres. In this construction, the Chern-Simons level is $k+1$ for each small $N$ droplet, while the entire array can be interpreted as an unbounded matrix Chern-Simons theory at level $k$. Such constructions at $k=2$ are consistent with earlier results for the multiplicative Chern insulator. We also formulate the quantum skyrmion Hall effect in terms of a Lagrangian for an array of potentially distinct, small $N$ droplets within anisotropic fuzzification. We discuss the relevance of these results to spin lattice models and lattice gauge theories.</description>

Abstract: Hyperbolic lattices present a unique opportunity to venture beyond the conventional paradigm of crystalline many-body physics and explore correlated phenomena in negatively curved space. As a theoretical benchmark for such investigations, we extend Kitaev's spin-1/2 honeycomb model to hyperbolic lattices and exploit their non-Euclidean space-group symmetries to solve the model exactly. We elucidate the ground-state phase diagram on the $\{8,3\}$ lattice and find a gapped $\mathbb{Z}_2$ spin liquid with Abelian anyons, a gapped chiral spin liquid with non-Abelian anyons and chiral edge states, and a Majorana metal whose finite low-energy density of states is dominated by non-Abelian Bloch states.</description>

      <title>From strong to weak correlations in breathing-mode kagome van der Waals materials: Nb$_3$(F,Cl,Br,I)$_8$ as a robust and versatile platform for many-body engineering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10320v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By combining ab initio downfolding with cluster dynamical mean-field theory, we study the degree of correlations in monolayer, bilayer and bulk breathing-mode kagome van der Waals materials Nb$_3$(F,Cl,Br,I)$_8$. Our new material-specific many-body model library shows that in low-temperature bulk structures the Coulomb correlation strength steadily increases from I to F, allowing us to identify Nb$_3$I$_8$ as a weakly correlated insulator, Nb$_3$Br$_8$ and Nb$_3$Cl$_8$ as strongly correlated insulators, and Nb$_3$F$_8$ as a prototypical bulk Mott-insulator. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements comparing Nb$_3$Br$_8$ and Nb$_3$I$_8$ allow us to experimentally confirm these findings by revealing spectroscopic footprints of the degree of correlation. Our calculations uncover how the thickness and the stacking affect the degree of correlations and predict that the entire material family can be tuned into correlated charge-transfer or Mott-insulating phases upon doping. Our magnetic property analysis based on our model parameter library additionally confirms that inter-layer magnetic interactions drive the lattice phase transition to the low-temperature structures. The accompanying bilayer hybridization through inter-layer dimerization yields magnetic singlet-like ground states in the Cl, Br, and I compounds. We further prove that all low-temperature compounds are dynamically stable and that electron-phonon coupling to the low-energy subspace is suppressed. Our findings establish Nb$_3$X$_8$ as a robust, versatile, and tunable class for van der Waals-based Coulomb and Mott engineering with a rich phase diagram and allow us to speculate on the symmetry-breaking effects necessary for the recently observed Josephson diode effect in NbSe$_2$/Nb$_3$Br$_8$/NbSe$_2$ heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Itinerant topological magnons and spin excitons in twisted transition metal dichalcogenides: Mapping electron topology to spin counterpart</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10991v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Twisted transition metal dichalcogenides (tTMDs) provide a highly tunable platform to explore the interplay between strong correlation and topology. Among them, the properties involving the charge degree of freedom have been extensively studied, while those related to spin are much less investigated. Motivated by the recent discovery of integer and fractional quantum anomalous Hall effects in tMoTe$_2$, where the flat-band ferromagnetism is one of the essential prerequisites, we investigate theoretically the spin excitations out of the flat-band ferromagnetic ground state in tMoTe$_2$. Remarkably, we identify the itinerant magnons and spin excitons with nontrivial topology. We elaborate that the topology of these itinerant spin excitations, which are described as particle-hole bound states, inherits directly from that of the underlying electrons and is essentially different from that in local spin systems. Thus, we establish a direct relationship of the topology between the many-body excitations and their fundamental constituents. We further demonstrate that by tuning the displacement field, a topological transition for both the magnon and spin exciton happens, leading to a step-like change and bifurcation in the thermal Hall conductance, which could serve as unique and compelling evidence to be tested experimentally.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous magnon decays from nonrelativistic time-reversal symmetry breaking in altermagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20146v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quasiparticles are central to condensed matter physics, but their stability can be undermined by quantum many-body interactions. Magnons, quasiparticles in quantum magnets, are particularly intriguing because their properties are governed by both real and spin space. While crystal symmetries may be low, spin interactions often remain approximately isotropic, limiting spontaneous magnon decay. Textbook wisdom holds that collinear Heisenberg magnets follow a dichotomy: ferromagnets host stable magnons, while antiferromagnetic magnons may decay depending on dispersion curvature. Up to now, relativistic spin-orbit coupling and noncollinear order that connect spin space to real space, were shown to introduce more complex magnon instability mechanisms. Here, we show that even in nonrelativistic isotropic collinear systems, this conventional dichotomy is disrupted in altermagnets. Altermagnets, a newly identified class of collinear magnets, exhibit compensated spin order with nonrelativistic time-reversal symmetry breaking and even-parity band splitting. Using kinematic analysis, nonlinear spin-wave theory, and quantum simulations, we reveal that even weak band splitting opens a decay phase space, driving quasiparticle breakdown. Additionally, d-wave altermagnets form a rare ``island of stability'' at the Brillouin zone center. Our findings establish a quasiparticle stability trichotomy in collinear Heisenberg magnets and position altermagnets as a promising platform for unconventional spin dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12463v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We find a strongly enhanced entanglement within the pseudogap regime of the Hubbard model. This entanglement is estimated from the quantum Fisher information and, avoiding the ill-conditioned analytical continuation, the quantum variance. Both are lower bounds for the actual entanglement that can be calculated from the (antiferromagnetic) susceptibility, obtained here with the dynamical vertex approximation. Our results qualitatively agree with experimental neutron scattering experiments for various cuprates. Theory predicts a $\ln(1/T)$ divergence of the entanglement for low temperatures $T$, which is however cut-off by the onset of superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Unified Magnetoelectric Mechanism for Spin Splitting in Magnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22227v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We identify a magnetoelectric correction that completes the theoretical description of spin splitting (SS) in magnetic systems. Derived from the Dirac equation, this term couples local magnetic moments to the scalar electric potential, providing a third fundamental mechanism, alongside Zeeman and spin-orbit coupling (SOC), that governs SS in ferromagnets, antiferromagnets, and altermagnets. In compensated magnets, the proposed relativistic correction depends on the difference in electric potential between symmetry-inequivalent motifs, $\mathcal{H}_{\text{ME}} = -\mu_{\text{B}}\eta_0(\mathcal{V}_1 - \mathcal{V}_2)\boldsymbol{\sigma} \cdot \boldsymbol{m}$, which explains how finite SS emerges in the absence of SOC and enables a complete classification of momentum dependence and motif connectivity across all 32 point groups. Through illustrative examples, we show that distinct SS behaviors - quadratic ($d$-wave altermagnets), linear ($p$-wave altermagnets or spin Zeeman effect), and $k$-independent (SS at $\Gamma$ or fully compensated ferrimagnets) - are specific manifestations of the proposed magnetoelectric relativistic mechanism, each governed by electric quadrupoles, dipoles, or monopoles, respectively. The formalism naturally extends to higher-order multipoles and more complex symmetries. This work establishes a unified framework for SS in magnets and provides a predictive tool for analyzing symmetry-allowed SS in magnetic materials.</description>

      <title>Instability of Nagaoka State and Quantum Phase Transition via Kinetic Frustration Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08410v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the Nagaoka-Thouless (NT) ferromagnetic instability in the strongly interacting $t$-$t'$ Hubbard model by continuously breaking particle-hole symmetry on a tunable square-triangular lattice geometry. We use an analytic approach to show that the fully spin-polarized state becomes unstable to a metastable spin-polaron when the kinetic frustration $t'/t$ exceeds a critical, dimension-dependent value. Large-scale density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations reveal a quantum phase transition from the NT ferromagnet to a spiral spin-density wave, which evolves continuously into the Haerter-Shastry antiferromagnet in the large-frustration limit. Remarkably, this transition remains robust at low but finite hole density, making it accessible in cold-atom and moir\'e Hubbard platforms under strong interactions. A variational analysis further captures the instability mechanism at finite density via frustration-induced magnon band deformation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08300v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a tensor network method for approximating thermal equilibrium states of quantum many-body systems at low temperatures. Whereas the usual approach starts from infinite temperature and evolves the state in imaginary time (towards lower temperature), our ansatz is constructed from the zero-temperature limit, the ground state, which can be found with a standard tensor network approach. Motivated by properties of the ground state for conformal field theories, our ansatz is especially well-suited near criticality. Moreover, it allows an efficient computation of thermodynamic quantities and entanglement properties. We demonstrate the performance of our approach with a tree tensor network ansatz, although it can be extended to other tensor networks, and present results illustrating its effectiveness in capturing the finite-temperature properties in one- and two-dimensional scenarios. In particular, in the critical 1D case we show how the ansatz reproduces the finite temperature scaling of entanglement in a CFT.</description>

Abstract: Superconductivity in the bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ occurs when the interlayer Ni-O-Ni bond angle becomes straight under pressure, suggesting a strong relationship between the crystal structure and the emergence of superconductivity. In this study, we theoretically propose a way to control the crystal structure of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ toward the tetragonal symmetry via light irradiation instead of pressure using the idea of nonlinear phononics. Here, resonant optical excitation of an infrared-active (IR) lattice vibration induces a nonlinear Raman-mode displacement through the anharmonic phonon-phonon coupling. We calculate the light-induced phonon dynamics on the anharmonic lattice potential determined by first-principles calculation. We find that the interlayer Ni-O-Ni bond angle gets slightly closer to straight when an appropriate IR mode is selectively excited. Our study suggests that light irradiation can be a promising way for structural control of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.</description>

      <title>Planar quantum low-density parity-check codes with open boundaries</title>

Abstract: Although high-threshold and low-overhead quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes, such as bivariate bicycle (BB) codes, can reduce the physical-qubit cost by an order of magnitude compared to the Kitaev toric code, their torus layout remains difficult for physical implementation. In this work, we introduce the first systematic procedure to convert BB codes into fully planar, open-boundary qLDPC codes, preserving their performance. We present planar code families with logical dimensions $6 \leq k\leq13$, e.g., $[[78, 6, 6]]$, $[[107, 7, 7]]$, $[[268, 8, 12]]$, $[[405, 9, 15]]$, $[[348, 10, 13]]$, $[[450, 11, 15]]$, $[[386, 12, 12]]$, $[[362, 13, 11]]$, all with geometrically local weight-6 stabilizers. Allowing weight-8 stabilizers produces a $[[282,12,14]]$ code, exhibiting an efficiency metric ($kd^2/n$) an order of magnitude higher than the surface code. The construction combines boundary anyon condensation with the ``lattice grafting'' optimization, yielding high-performance qLDPC codes natively compatible with planar hardware architectures. It also uncovers Sierpinski-type fractal logical operators whose distance scales with the fractal area on finite lattices. These planar qLDPC codes provide an implementable route to resource-efficient, high-threshold fault tolerance and a flexible framework for future code design on realistic two-dimensional hardware.</description>

      <title>Impact of Broken Inversion Symmetry on Molecular States in multi-Weyl fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20258v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study inversion-symmetry (IS) breaking in impurity dimers coupled to topological multi-Weyl systems in the low-energy dispersion domain. In the IS-preserved multi-Weyl semimetal phase, Hubbard bands split into symmetric and antisymmetric molecular-like subbands. Breaking IS induces a transition to a multi-Weyl metal, lifting the degeneracy of the Weyl node and closing the pseudogap. This causes opposite energy shifts: valence-band symmetric (antisymmetric) subbands red- (blue-) shift, reversing in the conduction band until a degeneracy point. Beyond this threshold, symmetric bands flatten near band cutoffs, whereas antisymmetric bands form quasi-zero energy modes asymptotically approaching -- yet never crossing -- the Fermi level. Crucially, identical molecular symmetries maintain nondegeneracy even as energy separation vanishes with stronger IS breaking. Our results demonstrate symmetry-selective mechanisms for topological molecular states in multi-Weyl systems.</description>

      <title>Robust field re-entrant superconductivity in ferromagnetic infinite-layer rare-earth nickelates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14666v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superconductivity and ferromagnetism are naturally competing, while their interplay can give rise to exotic quantum phases, such as triplet pairing, exemplified by heavy-fermion compounds like UTe$_2$, where magnetic fluctuations stabilise multiple superconducting states. However, such phenomena have remained elusive in high-temperature superconductors. Here we report the discovery of robust field-induced re-entrant superconductivity in heavily Eu-doped infinite-layer nickelate Sm$_{0.95-x}$Ca$_{0.05}$Eu$_x$NiO$_2$. In the heavily over-doped regime, we observe a remarkable superconducting state that emerges under high magnetic fields ($&gt;$ 6 Tesla) after the initial suppression of zero-field superconductivity. Both zero-resistance transport and Meissner diamagnetic effect confirm the superconducting nature of this high-field phase, which persists up to at least 45 Tesla. This re-entrant behaviour is featured by the coexistence of ferromagnetism and superconductivity on distinct sublattices -- magnetic Eu$^{2+}$ ions and the Ni-O planes, respectively. Such an exotic state may arise from the compensation between external and internal exchange fields (Jaccarino-Peter effect) combined with magnetic fluctuation-enhanced pairing near quantum criticality. Our findings establish infinite-layer nickelates as a unique platform for high-temperature ferromagnetic superconductivity, opening new avenues for discovering and manipulating unconventional quantum phases in strongly correlated materials.</description>
