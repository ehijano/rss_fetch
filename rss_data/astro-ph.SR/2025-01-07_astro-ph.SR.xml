      <title>Sporadic Dips from Extended Debris Transiting the Metal-Rich White Dwarf SBSS 1232+563</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the discovery of deep but sporadic transits in the flux of SBSS 1232+563, a metal-rich white dwarf polluted by disrupted exoplanetary debris. Nearly 25 years of photometry from multiple sky surveys reveal evidence of occasional dimming of the white dwarf, most notably evident in an 8-months-long event in 2023 that caused a &gt;40% drop in flux from the star. In-transit follow-up shows additional short-timescale (minutes- to hours-long) dimming events. TESS photometry suggests a coherent 14.842-hr signal that could represent the dominant orbital period of debris. Six low-resolution spectra collected at various transit depths over two decades show no evidence of significant changes in the observed elemental abundances. SBSS 1232+563 demonstrates that debris transits around white dwarfs can be sporadic, with many years of inactivity before large-amplitude dimming events.</description>

      <title>The Lack of RR Lyrae Variables in Ultrafaint Dwarf Galaxy Sextans II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: RR Lyrae in ultrafaint dwarf (UFD) galaxies, if found, would be valuable to constrain the distances of these UFD. In this work, we report our search of RR Lyrae in a recently discovered UFD -- Sextans II. Based on multiband ($griz$) time-series archival DECam imaging data, we do not find any RR Lyrae in Sextans II. On the contrary, the sparse multiband DECam light curves allowed recovery of a known foreground RR Lyrae, BB Sex, which happened to fall within the DECam images, and its pulsation period was correctly identified. Therefore, it is possible that Sextans II lacks RR Lyrae, similar to several other fainter UFDs (with $M_V \gtrsim -5.0$~mag) that do not have RR Lyrae.</description>

      <title>Differentiating the acceleration mechanisms in the slow and Alfv\'enic slow solar wind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the corona, plasma is accelerated to hundreds of kilometers per second, and heated to temperatures hundreds of times hotter than the Sun's surface, before it escapes to form the solar wind. Decades of space-based experiments have shown that the energization process does not stop after it escapes. Instead, the solar wind continues to accelerate and it cools far more slowly than a freely-expanding adiabatic gas. Recent work suggests that fast solar wind requires additional momentum beyond what can be provided by the observed thermal pressure gradients alone whereas it is sufficient for the slowest wind. The additional acceleration for fast wind can be provided through an Alfv\'en wave pressure gradient. Beyond this fast-slow categorization, however, a subset of slow solar wind exhibits high Alfv\'enicity that suggest Alfv\'en waves could play a larger role in its acceleration compared to conventional slow wind outflows. Through a well-timed conjunction between Solar Orbiter and Parker Solar Probe, we trace the energetics of slow wind to compare with a neighboring Alfv\'enic slow solar wind stream. An analysis that integrates remote and heliospheric properties and modeling of the two distinct solar wind streams finds Alfv\'enic slow solar wind behaves like fast wind, where a wave pressure gradient is required to reconcile its full acceleration, while non-Alfv\'enic slow wind can be driven by its non-adiabatic electron and proton thermal pressure gradients. Derived coronal conditions of the source region indicate good model compatibility but extended coronal observations are required to effectively trace solar wind energetics below Parker's orbit.</description>

      <title>Analyses of features of magnetic cycles at different amounts of dynamo supercriticality: Solar dynamo is about two times critical</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growth of a large-scale magnetic field in the Sun and stars is usually possible when the dynamo number (D) is above a critical value Dc. As the star ages, its rotation rate and thus D decrease. Hence, the question is how far the solar dynamo is from the critical dynamo transition. To answer this question, we have performed a set of simulations using Babcock-Leighton type dynamo models at different values of dynamo supercriticality and analyzed various features of magnetic cycle. By comparing the recovery rates of the dynamo from the Maunder minimum and statistics (numbers and durations) of the grand minima and maxima with that of observations and we show that the solar dynamo is only about two times critical and thus not highly supercritical. The observed correlation between the polar field proxy and the following cycle amplitudes and Gnevyshev-Ohl rule are also compatible with this conclusion.</description>

      <title>The Solar Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope on board Aditya-L1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Solar Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (SUIT) is an instrument on the Aditya-L1 mission of the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) launched on September 02, 2023. SUIT continuously provides, near-simultaneous full-disk and region-of-interest images of the Sun, slicing through the photosphere and chromosphere and covering a field of view up to 1.5 solar radii. For this purpose, SUIT uses 11 filters tuned at different wavelengths in the 200{--}400~nm range, including the Mg~{\sc ii} h~and~k and Ca~{\sc ii}~H spectral lines. The observations made by SUIT help us understand the magnetic coupling of the lower and middle solar atmosphere. In addition, for the first time, it allows the measurements of spatially resolved solar broad-band radiation in the near and mid ultraviolet, which will help constrain the variability of the solar ultraviolet irradiance in a wavelength range that is central for the chemistry of the Earth's atmosphere. This paper discusses the details of the instrument and data products.</description>

      <title>Lorentz force mediation of turbulent dynamo transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how the strength of the Lorentz force alters stellar convection zone dynamics in a suite of buoyancy-dominated, three-dimensional, spherical shell convective dynamo models. This is done by varying only the magnetic Prandtl number, $Pm$, the non-dimensional form of the fluid's electrical conductivity $\sigma$. Because the strength of the dynamo magnetic field and the Lorentz force scale with $Pm$, it is found that the fluid motions, the pattern of convective heat transfer, and the mode of dynamo generation all differ across the $0.25 \leq Pm \leq 10$ range investigated here. For example, we show that strong magnetohydrodynamic effects cause a fundamental change in the surface zonal flows: differential rotation switches from solar-like (prograde equatorial zonal flow) for larger electrical conductivities to an anti-solar differential rotation (retrograde equatorial zonal flow) at lower electrical conductivities. This study shows that the value of the bulk electrical conductivity is important not only for sustaining dynamo action, but can also drive first-order changes in the characteristics of the magnetic, velocity, and temperature fields. It is also associated with the relative strength of the Lorentz force in the system as measured by the local magnetic Rossby number, $Ro_\ell^M$, which we show is crucial in setting the characteristics of the large-scale convection regime that generates those dynamo fields.</description>

      <title>VLT VIMOS Integral Field Spectroscopy of the nova remnant FH Ser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: FH Ser experienced a slow classical nova outburst in February 1970 that was the first one observed at UV, optical, and IR wavelengths. Its nova remnant is elliptical in shape, with multiple knots, and a peculiar ring-like filament along its minor axis. This work aims at unveiling its true 3D spatio-kinematical structure to investigate the effects of early shaping and to assess its mass and kinetic energy using VLT VIMOS integral field spectroscopic observations. The data cube has been analyzed using 3D visualisations that reveal different structural components. FH Ser consists of a tilted prolate ellisoidal shell, most prominent in H-alpha, and a ring-like structure, most prominent in [N II]. The ellipsoidal shell has equatorial and polar velocities of 505 and 630 km/s, respectively, with its major axis tilted by 52 deg with respect to the line of sight. The inclination angle of the symmetry axis of the ring is similar, i.e., it can be described as an equatorial belt of the main ellipsoidal shell. The ionized mass is 2.6E-4 solar mass, with a kinetic energy of 1.6E45 erg. The presence of two different structural components in FH Ser with similar orientation can be linked to a density enhancement along a plane, most likely the orbital plane at the time of the nova event. The acquisition of integral field spectroscopic observations of nova remnants is most required to disentangle different structural components and to assess their 3D physical structure.</description>

      <title>Distributions of wide binary stars in theory and in Gaia data: I. Generalized Ambartsumian (1937) approach and the family of power-law distributions of eccentricity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The orbital parameter space of wide, weakly bound binary stars has been shaped by the still poorly known circumstances of their formation, as well as by subsequent dynamical evolution in parent clusters and in the field. The advance of the Gaia mission astrometry takes statistical studies of wide stellar systems to an unprecedented level of precision and scope. On the theoretical side of the problem, the old approach proposed by Jeans and developed by Ambartsumian is revisited here. It is shown how certain simplifying assumptions about the phase density of binary systems in the framework of general copula distributions can lead to a family of analytical representations for the marginal distribution of orbital eccentricity, including accommodating and flexible power-law models. We further demonstrate the application of these models in forward Monte Carlo simulations of the measured motion angles between the relative velocity and separation vectors on the example of 170K listed Gaia binary systems, providing inference in the intrinsic distribution of orbital eccentricity.</description>

      <title>Variation of global and local flows in the solar convection zone during activity cycles 24 and 25</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Convection, differential rotation, and meridional circulation of solar plasma are studied based on helioseismic data covering the period from May 2010 to August 2024, significantly prolonged compared to that previously considered. Depth variation in the spatial spectrum of convective motions indicates a superposition of differently scaled flows. The giant-cell-scale component of the velocity field demonstrates a tendency to form meridionally elongated (possibly bananashaped) structures. The integrated spectral power of the flows is anticorrelated with the solar-activity level in the near-surface layers and positively correlates with it in deeper layers. An extended 22-year cycle of zonal flows ("torsional oscillations" of the Sun) and variations of the meridional flows are traced. A secondary meridional flow observed at the epoch of the maximum of Solar Cycle 24 to be directed equatorward in the subsurface layers is clearly manifest in Cycle 25.</description>

      <title>Equatorial Enhancement in the Dustiest OH/IR Stars in the Galactic Bulge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have detected the 10 um silicate feature and the 11.3 um crystalline forsterite feature in absorption in 21 oxygen-rich AGB stars in the Galactic Bulge. The depths of the 10 um feature indicate highly-obscured circumstellar environments. The additional crystalline features may suggest either an extended envelope or dust formation in a high-density environment. We have also modeled the Spectral Energy Distributions of the sample using radiative transfer models, and compared the results to wind speeds measured using 1612 MHz circumstellar OH masers, as well as previous estimates of circumstellar properties. The sixteen sources with measured pulsation periods appear on sequence D of the mid-infrared Period-Luminosity relation, associated with the Long Secondary Period. We suspect that all of these sources are in fact fundamental mode pulsators. At least two sources appear on the fundamental mode sequence when accounting for the dust content. For the remainder, these sources are also likely fundamental mode pulsators with extended envelopes. Taken as a whole, the high optical depths, crystalline features, discrepancies between observed and modeled wind speeds, pulsation periods longer than other fundamental mode pulsators, and SED and pulsation properties similar to those with known equatorially-enhanced circumstellar envelopes (e.g. OH 26.5+0.6 and OH 30.1-0.7) lead us to believe that these sources are likely to be equatorially-enhanced.</description>

      <title>On the Role of Chapman's Hydrostatic Solar Wind Mechanism in Parker's Hydrodynamic Solar Wind Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The global role of Chapman's hydrostatic solar wind mechanism in Parker's hydrodynamic solar wind model is investigated by using the de Laval nozzle analogy (Clauser, Parker) for the latter model. The action of solar gravity in Parker's hydrodynamic solar wind model is shown to be geometrically equivalent to a renormalization of the wind channel area, which is described precisely by Chapman's hydrostatic density profile. So, Chapman's hydrostatic solar wind mechanism appears to continue to be operative, on a global level (not just locally near the coronal base), in Parker's hydrodynamic solar wind model, the effects of solar gravity in Parker's hydrodynamic model being essentially encapsulated by Chapman's hydrostatic model. This result is shown to be robust by considering both isothermal gas and polytropic gas models for the solar wind.</description>

      <title>A Scenario for Origin of Global 4 mHz Oscillations in Solar Corona</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a spherically symmetric model of solar atmosphere, which consists of the whole chromosphere and low corona below the $1.25$ solar radius. It is a hydrodynamic model with heating in the chromosphere through an artificial energy flux. We performed a series of simulations with our model and found oscillations with a peak frequency of $\sim$4 $\rm{mHz}$ in the power spectrum. We confirmed that this resulted from the $p$-mode excited in the transition region and amplified in a resonant cavity situated in the height range $\sim$$4\times10^3$--$2\times10^4$ km. This result is consistent with global observations of Alfv\'enic waves in corona and can naturally explain the observational ubiquity of $4\ \rm{mHz}$ without the difficulty of the $p$-mode passing through the acoustic-damping chromosphere. We also confirmed that acoustic shock waves alone cannot heat the corona to the observed temperature, and found mass upflows in the height range $\sim$$7\times10^3$--$7\times10^4$ km in our model, which pumped the dense and cool plasma into the corona and might be the mass supplier for solar prominences.</description>

      <title>Challenges in identifying the coronal hole wind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar wind is frequently categorized based on its respective solar source region. Two well-established categorizations of the coronal hole wind, the scheme based on the charge-state composition, and the scheme based on proton plasma, identify a very different fraction of solar wind in the data from the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) as coronal hole wind during the solar activity minimum at the end of solar cycle 24. We investigate possible explanations for the different identifications of the coronal wind in 2009 in the scheme based on the charge-state composition (almost only coronal hole wind) and in the scheme based on the proton plasma (almost no coronal hole wind at the same time). We compared the properties of the respective coronal hole wind types and their changes with solar activity cycle in 2001- 2010. As a comparison reference, we included the coronal hole wind as identified by an unsupervised machine-learning approach, k-means, in our analysis. We find that the scheme based on charge-state composition likely misidentifies some slow solar wind as coronal hole wind during the solar activity minimum. The k-means classification we considered includes two types of coronal hole wind, the first of which is dominant during the solar activity maximum, whereas the second is dominant during the solar activity minimum. A low fraction of coronal hole wind from low-latitude coronal holes observed by ACE in 2009 is plausible because during this time period, a very small number of low-latitude coronal holes was observed. The results imply that the origin-oriented solar wind classification needs to be revisited, and they also suggest that an explicit inclusion of the phase of the solar activity cycle can be expected to improve the classification of the solar wind.</description>

      <title>Gaussian process regression of temperature-dependent radial velocities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gaussian processes (GPs) described by quasi-periodic covariance functions have in recent years become a widely used tool to model the impact of stellar activity on radial velocity (RV) measurements. We perform a GP regression analysis on solar RV time series measured from spectral segments formed at different temperatures within the photosphere in order to evaluate the relation between the best-fit GP kernel hyperparameters and the observed activity signal as a function of temperature. The posterior distributions of the hyperparameters show subtle differences between high- and low-activity phases and as a function of the spectral formation temperature range, which could have implications on the characteristics of the activity signal and its optimal modelling. For the temperature-dependent RVs, we find that at high and low activity alike, the minimal RV dispersion is obtained at intermediately cool temperature ranges (4000-4750 K), for both the observed and GP model-subtracted RVs. Finally, we compare and correlate our temperature-dependent RVs with RV components derived from disk-resolved Dopplergrams of the Sun, for which we find a consistently strong correlation between RVs related to hotter temperature ranges and the dominant RV component due to the inhibition of convection.</description>

      <title>Resolving the mass transfer in the symbiotic recurrent nova T Coronae Borealis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: T Coronae Borealis (T CrB) is a symbiotic recurrent nova with an 80-year recurrence interval whose next eruption is imminent. We aim to resolve the accretion mechanism of the binary system governing the mass transfer during its super-active phase. Using phase-resolved high-resolution spectroscopy, we analyze the zoo of spectral-line profiles arising from the symbiotic activity. We perform Doppler tomography of selected emission lines to resolve the system's gaseous components and their different velocity regimes. We find evidence of enhanced accretion through Roche lobe overflow during the super-active phase, as traced by the oxygen, helium, and hydrogen lines. The accretion disc is found to be fully viscously evolved and extends up to its maximal radius. By mapping the kinematics of lines probing different excitation energies, we can identify distinct interaction sites. These include the bright spot at the stream impact on the accretion disc outer radius, the irradiation at the red-giant facing side, the stream-disc overflow, the accretion disk wind, and an expanding bipolar nebula. The bipolar jet emerged at the rise of the super-active phase and underwent an acceleration phase of about five years. The temporal evolution of the lines supports the scenario where the departure from quiescence started in the disc, likely triggered by a disc instability similar to what occurs in dwarf novae outburst, leading to an increased mass accretion and causing important irradiation of the giant that has further enhanced the mass-transfer rate during the super-active phase. Conclusions. Symbiotic recurrent novae, such as T CrB, are governed by similar mass-transfer mechanisms as found in cataclysmic variables despite their different orbital properties (longer orbital periods imposing larger accretion discs) and evolutionary pathways.</description>

      <title>Shock and SEP Modeling Study for the 5 September 2022 SEP Event</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On September 5, 2022, during Parker Solar Probe's (PSP) 13th encounter, a fast shock wave and a related solar energetic particle (SEP) event were observed as the spacecraft approached the perihelion of its orbit. Observations from the Integrated Science Investigation of the Sun (ISOIS) instrument suite show that SEPs arrived at the spacecraft with a significant delay from the onset of the parent solar eruption and that the first arriving SEPs exhibited an Inverse Velocity Dispersion (IVD) for energetic protons above $\sim$1~MeV. Utilizing data from multiple spacecraft we investigate the eruption dynamics and shock wave propagation. Our analysis includes 3D shock modeling and SEP transport simulations to examine the origins of this SEP event and explore the causes of the delayed SEP onset and the observed IVD. The data-driven SEP simulation reproduces the SEP event onset observed at PSP, its evolving energy spectrum and the IVD. This IVD is attributed to a relatively slow, ongoing particle acceleration process occurring at the flank of the expanding shock wave intercepted by PSP. This has significant implications for the role of shocks in the release of SEPs at widespread events and for methods used to infer the SEP release times. Furthermore, the match between the simulation and observations worsens when cross-field diffusion is considered, indicating that SEP diffusion had a minor effect on this event. These findings underscore the complexity of SEP events and emphasize the need for advanced modelling approaches to better understand the role of shock waves and other physical processes in SEP acceleration and release.</description>

      <title>Solar variability in the Mg II h and k lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar irradiance and its variations in the ultraviolet (UV) control the photochemistry in Earth's atmosphere and influence Earth's climate. The variability of Mg II h and k core-to-wing ratio, also known as the Mg II index, is highly correlated with the solar UV irradiance variability. Because of this, Mg II index is routinely used as a proxy for solar UV irradiance variability, which can help to get insights into the influence of solar UV irradiance variability on Earth's climate. Measurements of the Mg II index, however, have only been carried out since 1978 and do not cover the climate relevant timescales longer than a few decades. Here we present a model to calculate the Mg II index and its variability based on the well-established SATIRE (Spectral And Total Irradiance REconstruction) model. We demonstrate that our model calculations yield an excellent agreement with the observed Mg II index variations, both on the solar activity cycle and on the solar rotation timescales. Using this model, we synthesize Mg II index timeseries on climate relevant timescales of decades and longer. Here we present the timeseries of the Mg II index spanning nearly three centuries.</description>

      <title>Spectra of standing kink waves in loops and the effects of the lower solar atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the effects of the lower solar atmosphere on the spectrum of standing kink oscillations of coronal loops, in both the decaying and decayless regime, is essential for developing more advanced tools for coronal seismology. We aim to reveal the effects of the chromosphere on the spatial profiles and frequencies of the standing kink modes, create synthetic emission maps to compare with observations, and study the results using spatial and temporal coronal seismology techniques. We excited transverse oscillations in a 3D straight flux tube using (a) a broadband footpoint driver, (b) a sinusoidal velocity pulse, and (c) an off-centre Gaussian velocity pulse, using the PLUTO code. The flux tube is gravitationally stratified, with footpoints embedded in chromospheric plasma. Using the FoMo code, we created synthetic observations of our data in the Fe IX 17.1 nm line and calculated the spectra with the Auto-NUWT code. We also numerically solved the generalised eigenvalue system for the 1D wave equation to determine the effects of the stratification on the kink modes of our system. The synthetic observations of the loops perturbed by the velocity pulses show a single dominant mode that our 1D analysis reveals to be the third harmonic of the system. For the broadband driver, the synthetic emission shows multiple frequency bands, associated with both the loop and the driver. Finally, using seismological techniques, we highlight the possibility of misidentifying the observed third, sixth, and ninth harmonics with the first, second, and third harmonics of the coronal part of longer loops. Unless more advanced techniques of spatial seismology are used with many data points from observations along the entire loop length, this misidentification can result in overestimating the mean magnetic field by a factor equal to the period ratio of the fundamental over the third harmonic.</description>

      <title>The coronal power spectrum from MHD mode conversion above sunspots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sunspots are intense regions of magnetic flux that are rooted deep below the photosphere. It is well established that sunspots host magnetohydrodynamic waves, with numerous observations showing a connection to the internal acoustic (or p-)modes of the Sun. The p-modes are fast waves below the equipartition layer and are thought to undergo a double mode conversion as they propagate upwards into the atmosphere of sunspots, which can generate Alfv\'{e}nic modes in the upper atmosphere. We employ 2.5D magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) numerical simulations to investigate the adiabatic wave propagation and examine the resulting power spectra of coronal Alfv\'{e}nic waves. A broadband wave source is used that has a 1D power spectrum which mimics aspects of the observed p-mode power spectrum. We examine magnetoacoustic wave propagation and mode conversion from the photosphere to the corona. Frequency filtering of the upwardly propagating acoustic waves is a natural consequence of a gravitationally stratified atmosphere, and plays a key role in shaping the power spectra of mode converted waves. We demonstrate that the slow, fast magnetoacoustic waves and Alfv\'{e}n waves above the equipartition layer have similarly shaped power spectra, which are modified versions of the driver spectrum. Notably, the results reveal that the coronal wave power spectra have a peak at a higher frequency than that of the underlying p-mode driver. This matches observations of coronal Alfv\'enic waves and further supports the role of mode conversion process as a mechanism for Alfv\'enic wave generation in the Sun's atmosphere.</description>

      <title>JOYS: The [D/H] abundance derived from protostellar outflows across the Galactic disk measured with JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The total deuterium abundance [D/H] in the universe is set by just two processes: the creation of deuterium in Big Bang Nucleosynthesis at an abundance of [D/H]$=2.58\pm0.13\times10^{-5}$, and its destruction within stellar interiors. Measurements of the total [D/H] abundance can potentially provide a probe of Galactic chemical evolution, however, most measurements of [D/H] are only sensitive to the gas-phase deuterium, and the amount of deuterium sequestered in carbonaceous dust grains is debated. With the launch of JWST, it is now possible to measure the gas-phase [D/H] at unprecedented sensitivity and distances through observation of mid-IR lines of H$_2$ and HD. We employ data from the JWST Observations of Young protoStars (JOYS) program to measure the gas-phase [D/H] abundance with a rotation diagram analysis towards 5 nearby low-mass and 5 distant high-mass protostellar outflows. The gas-phase [D/H] varies between low-mass sources by up to a factor of $\sim4$, despite these sources likely having formed in a region of the Galactic disk that would be expected to have nearly constant total [D/H]. Most measurements of gas-phase [D/H] from our work or previous studies produce [D/H] $\lesssim 1.0\times10^{-5}$, a factor of $2-4$ lower than found from local UV absorption lines and as expected from Galactic chemical evolution models. The variations in [D/H] between our low-mass sources and the low [D/H] with respect to Galactic chemical evolution models suggest that our observations are not sensitive to the total [D/H]. Significant depletion of deuterium onto carbonaceous dust grains is a possible explanation, and tentative evidence of enhanced [D/H] towards shock positions with higher gas-phase Fe abundance is seen in the HH 211 outflow. Deeper observations of HD and H$_2$ in shocked environments and modelling of dust-grain destruction are warranted to test for the effects of depletion.</description>

      <title>Planetary Edge Trends (PET). I. The Inner Edge-Stellar Mass Correlation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The position of the innermost planet (i.e., the inner edge) in a planetary system provides important information about the relationship of the entire system to its host star properties, offering potentially valuable insights into planetary formation and evolution processes. In this work, based on the Kepler Data Release 25 (DR25) catalog combined with LAMOST and Gaia data, we investigate the correlation between stellar mass and the inner edge position across different populations of small planets in multi-planetary systems, such as super-Earths and sub-Neptunes. By correcting for the influence of stellar metallicity and analyzing the impact of observational selection effects, we confirm the trend that as stellar mass increases, the position of the inner edge shifts outward. Our results reveal a stronger correlation between the inner edge and stellar mass with a power-law index of 0.6-1.1, which is larger compared to previous studies. The stronger correlation in our findings is primarily attributed to two factors: first, the metallicity correction applied in this work enhances the correlation; second, the previous use of occurrence rates to trace the inner edge weakens the observed correlation. Through comparison between observed statistical results and current theoretical models, we find that the pre-main-sequence (PMS) dust sublimation radius of the protoplanetary disk best matches the observed inner edge stellar mass. Therefore, we conclude that the inner dust disk likely limits the innermost orbits of small planets, contrasting with the inner edges of hot Jupiters, which are associated with the magnetospheres of gas disks, as suggested by previous studies. This highlights that the inner edges of different planetary populations are likely regulated by distinct mechanisms.</description>

      <title>The Influence of General Relativity on the Spins of Celestial Bodies in Inclined Orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Through the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect, several hot Jupiters have been found to exhibit spin-orbit misalignment, and even retrograde orbits. The high obliquity observed in these planets can be attributed to two primary formation mechanisms, as summarized in the existing literature. First, the host star's spin becomes misaligned with the planetary disk during the late stages of star formation, primarily due to chaotic accretion and magnetic interactions between the star and the planetary disk. Second, the orbital inclination of an individual planet can be excited by dynamical processes such as planet-planet scattering, the Lidov-Kozai cycle, and secular chaos within the framework of Newtonian mechanics. This study introduces a third mechanism, where, within the framework of general relativity, the post-Newtonian spin-orbit coupling term induces precession of the host star's spin around the orbital angular momentum. The orbital inclination, relative to a reference plane, can expand the range of deviation in the spatial orientation of the bodies' spins from the plane's normal. The varying amplitude and period of spin precession for both the star and the planet are derived theoretically, and the results, which can be applied without restriction, agree well with numerical simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: GRS 1915+105 is a well-known X-ray binary system composed of a black hole with a low-mass companion star and is recognized for emitting relativistic jets. Imazato et al. (2021) performed extensive polarimetry in a near-infrared (NIR) Ks band from 2019 April through December when GRS 1915+105 experienced an X-ray low luminous state and found almost stable polarization of P=2.42% +/- 0.08%. We performed NIR polarimetry of the field stars around GRS 1915+105 in 2023 April and October, and found that the field stars that are not listed in Gaia DR3 and StarHorse2 catalogues show well aligned polarization that is consistent with GRS 1915+105' s polarization. Those suggest that the interstellar clouds existing beyond 4 kpc causes the large interstellar extinction and that the polarization the GRS 1915+105 is mostly originated from the magnetically aligned dust grains within the clouds. Therefore, the jet-origin synchrotron radiation polarization would have given only minor contribution in the NIR band in 2019 Apr-Dec.</description>

      <title>Interactions among binary black holes in star clusters: eccentric gravitational wave captures and triple formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aims. Numerical simulations of star clusters with black holes find that there is only a single dynamically active binary black hole (BBH), at odds with the theoretical expectation of ~5 dynamically-formed - or, 'three-body' - BBHs in clusters with a few hundred BHs. We test the recent suggestion that this tension is because interactions among three-body BBHs were neglected in the theory.
  Methods. We use the public catalogue of Cluster Monte Carlo models to obtain a sample of strong BBH-BBH interactions, which we integrate using the 3.5PN equations of motion. We explore the nature of the BBHs involved in BBH-BBH interactions in star clusters, as well as the various outcomes: gravitational wave (GW) captures and the associated eccentricities at the frequencies of ground-based GW detectors, as well as BH triple formation and their contribution to BBH mergers via the Lidov-Kozai mechanism.
  Results. We find that almost all BBHs involved in BBH-BBH interactions are indeed three-body binaries and that BBH formation and disruption in BBH-BBH interactions occur at approximately the same rate, providing an explanation for the finding of a single dynamically-active BBH in N-body models. An important implication is that the resulting rates of GW capture and triple formation are independent of uncertain initial binary properties. We obtain a local rate of GW captures of $\mathcal{R}(z\simeq0)\rm\simeq1Gpc^{-3}yr^{-1}$, as well as their eccentricity distribution and redshift dependence. We find that a BBH-BBH interaction is more likely to trigger a GW merger than a BH-BBH interaction. We also find that stable triples that are assembled in BBH-BBH interactions are very wide and not likely to merge via von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai oscillations because they quickly break up in subsequent interactions with BHs and BBHs. Our results will help with the interpretation of future GW signals from eccentric BBHs</description>

      <title>Production of linear alkanes via the solid-state hydrogenation of interstellar polyynes</title>

Abstract: Highly unsaturated carbon chains, including polyynes, have been detected in many astronomical regions and planetary systems. With the success of the QUIJOTE survey of the TMC-1, the community has seen a "boom" in the number of detected carbon chains. On the other hand, the Rosetta mission revealed the release of fully saturated hydrocarbons, C$_3$H$_8$, C$_4$H$_{10}$, C$_5$H$_{12}$, and (under specific conditions) C$_6$H$_{14}$ with C$_7$H$_{16}$, from the comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. The detection of the latter two is attributed to dust-rich events. Similarly, the analysis of samples returned from asteroid Ryugu by Hayabusa2 mission indicates the presence of long saturated aliphatic chains in Ryugu's organic matter. The surface chemistry of unsaturated carbon chains under conditions resembling those of molecular clouds can provide a possible link among these independent observations. However, laboratory-based investigations to validate such a chemistry is still lacking. In the present study, we aim to experimentally verify the formation of fully saturated hydrocarbons by the surface hydrogenation of C$_{2n}$H$_2$ ($n&gt;1$) polyynes under ultra-high vacuum conditions at 10 K. We undertook a two-step experimental technique. First, a thin layer of C$_2$H$_2$ ice was irradiated by UV-photons ($\geq$ 121 nm) to achieve a partial conversion of C$_2$H$_2$ into larger polyynes: C$_4$H$_2$ and C$_6$H$_2$. Afterwards, the obtained photoprocessed ice was exposed to H atoms to verify the formation of various saturated hydrocarbons. In addition to C$_2$H$_6$, which was investigated previously, the formation of larger alkanes, including C$_4$H$_{10}$ and (tentatively) C$_6$H$_{14}$, is confirmed by our study. A qualitative analysis of the obtained kinetic data indicates that hydrogenation of HCCH and HCCCCH triple bonds proceeds at comparable rates, given a surface temperature of 10 K.}</description>

      <title>Electrostatic instability of non-spherical dust in sub-stellar clouds</title>

Abstract: Charged dust clouds play an important role in the evolution of sub-stellar atmospheres through electrical discharges such as lightning events or inter-grain discharges. The consequent plasma activation presents an alternative source of disequilibrium chemistry, potentially triggering a set of chemical reactions otherwise energetically unavailable. The aim of this paper is to address the problem of the electrostatic stability of charged spheroidal dust grains in sub-stellar clouds and its impact on inter-grain electrostatic discharges, the available area for atmospheric gas-phase surface chemistry, the particle eccentricity distribution function and observed polarization signatures. This paper has derived the criterion for the allowed values of dust eccentricity that are electrostatically stable as a function of grain size $a\in[0.2,1.8]~\mu$m, floating potential $\phi_{f}\in[1, 10]$~V and tensile strength $\Sigma_{s}=10^{3}$~Pa. As a consequence of electrostatic instability we also calculate the expected electric field enhancement at the spheroidal poles, the increased surface area of a dust grain, the truncation of the particle eccentricity distribution function and the resultant degree of polarization. Dust grains with an eccentricity below a critical value will be electrostatically stable; whereas, grains with an eccentricity above a critical value will be unstable. The results presented here are applicable not only to spheroidal dust grains but any non-spherical dust grains where non-uniform surface electric fields or inhomogeneous tensile strengths could be susceptible to electrostatic instability. In this context electrostatic erosion presents a mechanism that may produce bumpy, irregularly shaped or porous grains.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of the Beta Pictoris planetary system and possibility of an additional planet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Beta Pictoris system is characterized by a dusty debris disk, in addition to the presence of two already known planets. This makes it a particularly interesting case for studying the formation and evolution of planetary systems at a stage where giant planets have already formed, most of the protoplanetary gas has dissipated, and terrestrial planets could emerge. Our goal here is to explore the possibility of additional planets orbiting beyond the outermost known one, $\beta$ Pic b. More specifically, we aim to assess whether additional planets in the system could explain the discrepancy between the predicted cutoff of the disk inner cavity at $\sim$28 au with only two planets, and the observed one at $\sim$50 au. We perform an exhaustive dynamical modeling of the debris disk and the carving of its inner edge, by introducing one or two additional planets beyond $\beta$ Pic b, coplanar with the disk. Guided by theoretical predictions for the parameter space - mass, semi-major axis, eccentricity - allowed for additional planets, we further carry out a set of N-body simulations, using the symplectic integrator RMVS3. Our simulations indicate that an additional planet with a low eccentricity of 0.05, a mass between 0.15 and 1 $M_{Jup}$, and a semi-major axis between 30 and 36 au, would be consistent with the observations of an inner debris disk edge at 50 au. We have also explored the hypotheses of a higher eccentricity and the presence of two additional lower mass planets instead of one, which could also account for these observations. While we have found that one or even two additional planets could explain the observed location of the disk inner edge, these hypothetical planets remain in most cases below the current observational limits of high contrast imaging. Future observational campaigns with improved sensitivity will help lowering these limits and perhaps detect that planet.</description>

      <title>Small-scale and large-scale dynamos in global convection simulations of solar-like stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08967v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has been recently shown numerically that a small-scale dynamo (SSD) instability could be possible in solar-like low magnetic Prandtl number plasmas. It has been proposed that the presence of SSD can potentially have a significant impact on the dynamics of the large-scale dynamo (LSD) in the stellar convection zones. Studying these two dynamos, SSD and LSD, together in a global magnetoconvection model requires high-resolution simulations and large amounts of computational resources. Starting from a well-studied global convective dynamo model that produces cyclic magnetic fields, we systematically increased the resolution and lowered the diffusivities to enter the regime of Reynolds numbers that enable the excitation of SSD on top of the LSD. We studied how the properties of convection, generated differential rotation profiles, and LSD solutions change with the presence of SSD. We performed semi-global convective dynamo simulations in a spherical wedge with the Pencil Code. The resolutions of the models were increased in 4 steps by a total factor of 16 to achieve maximal Re and Rm of above 500. We found that the differential rotation is strongly quenched by the presence of the LSD and SSD. Even though the small-scale magnetic field only mildly decreases with increasing Re, the large-scale field strength decreases significantly. We do not find the SSD dynamo significantly quenching the convective flows as claimed recently by other authors; in contrast, the convective flows first grow and then saturate for increasing Re. Furthermore, the angular momentum transport is highly affected by the presence of small-scale magnetic fields, which are mostly generated by LSD. These fields not only change the Reynolds stresses, but also generate dynamically important Maxwell stresses. The LSD evolution in terms of its pattern and field distribution is rather independent of the increase in Rm.</description>

      <title>Variability of Central Stars of Planetary Nebulae with the Zwicky Transient Facility. I. Methods, Short-Timescale Variables, Binary Candidates, and the Unusual Nucleus of WeSb 1</title>

Abstract: Over the past several decades, time-series photometry of CSPNe has yielded significant results including, but not limited to, discoveries of nearly 100 binary systems, insights into pulsations and winds in young white dwarfs, and studies of stars undergoing very late thermal pulses. We have undertaken a systematic study of optical photometric variability of cataloged CSPNe, using the light curves from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF). By applying appropriate variability metrics, we arrive at a list of 94 highly variable CSPN candidates. Based on the timescales of the light-curve activity, we classify the variables broadly into short- and long-timescale variables. In this first paper in this series, we focus on the former, which is the majority class comprising 83 objects. We report periods for six sources for the first time, and recover several known periodic variables. Among the aperiodic sources, most exhibit a jitter around a median flux with a stable amplitude, and a few show outbursts. We draw attention to WeSb 1, which shows a different kind of variability: prominent deep and aperiodic dips, resembling transits from a dust/debris disk. We find strong evidence for a binary nature of WeSb 1 (possibly an F-type subgiant companion). The compactness of the emission lines and inferred high electron densities make WeSb 1 a candidate for either an EGB 6-type planetary nucleus, or a symbiotic system inside an evolved planetary nebula, both of which are rare objects. To demonstrate further promise with ZTF, we report three additional newly identified periodic sources that do not appear in the list of highly variable sources. Finally, we also introduce a two-dimensional metric space defined by the von Neumann statistics and Pearson Skew and demonstrate its effectiveness in identifying unique variables of astrophysical interest, like WeSb 1.</description>

      <title>Forecasting High-Speed Solar Wind Streams from Solar Images</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05068v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The solar wind, a stream of charged particles originating from the Sun and transcending interplanetary space, poses risks to technology and astronauts. In this work, we develop a prediction model to forecast the solar wind speed at the Earth. We focuse on high-speed streams (HSSs) and their solar source regions, coronal holes. As input, we use the coronal hole area, extracted from solar extreme ultraviolet (EUV) images and mapped on a fixed grid, as well as the solar wind speed 27 days before. We use a polynomial regression model and a distribution transformation to predict the solar wind speed with a lead time of four days. Our forecast achieves a root mean square error (RMSE) of 68.1 km/s for the solar wind speed prediction and an RMSE of 76.8 km/s for the HSS peak velocity prediction for 2010 to 2019. We also demonstrate the applicability of our model to the current solar cycle 25 in an operational setting, resulting in an RMSE of 80.3 km/s and an HSS peak velocity RMSE of 92.2 km/s. The study shows that a small number of physical features explains most of the solar wind variation, and that focusing on these features with simple machine learning algorithms even outperforms current approaches based on deep neural networks and MHD simulations. In addition, we explain why the typically used loss function, the mean squared error, systematically underestimates the HSS peak velocities, aggravates operational space weather forecasts, and how a distribution transformation can resolve this issue.</description>

      <title>Redshifting the Study of Cold Brown Dwarfs and Exoplanets: the Mid-Infrared Wavelength Region as an Indicator of Surface Gravity and Mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03549v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: JWST is opening many avenues for exploration. For cold brown dwarfs and exoplanets, JWST has opened the door to the mid-infrared wavelength region, where such objects emit significant energy. For the first time, astronomers have access to mid-infrared spectroscopy for objects colder than 600 K. The first spectra appear to validate the model suite known as ATMO 2020++: atmospheres which include disequilibrium chemistry and have a non-adiabatic pressure-temperature relationship. Preliminary fits to JWST spectroscopy of Y dwarfs show that the slope of the energy distribution from lambda = 4.5 um to lambda = 10 um is very sensitive to gravity. We explore this phenomenon using PH3-free ATMO 2020++ models and updated WISE W2 - W3 colors. We find that an absolute 4.5 um flux measurement constrains temperature, and the ratio of the 4.5 um flux to the 10 - 15 um flux is sensitive to gravity and less sensitive to metallicity. We identify 10 T dwarfs with red W2 - W3 colors which are likely to be very low gravity, young, few-Jupiter-mass objects; one of these is the previously known COCONUTS-2b. The unusual Y dwarf WISEPA J182831.08+265037.8 is blue in W2 - W3 and we find that the 4 to 18 um JWST spectrum is well reproduced if the system is a pair of high gravity 400 K dwarfs. Recently published JWST colors and luminosity-based effective temperatures for late-T and Y dwarfs further corroborate the ATMO 2020++ models, demonstrating the potential for significant improvement in our understanding of cold very low-mass bodies in the solar neighborhood.</description>

      <title>MINDS: JWST/NIRCam imaging of the protoplanetary disk PDS 70</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04855v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Context. Two protoplanets have recently been discovered within the PDS 70 protoplanetary disk. JWST/NIRCam offers a unique opportunity to characterize them and their birth environment at wavelengths difficult to access from the ground. Aims. We aim to image the circumstellar environment of PDS 70 at 1.87 $\mu$m and 4.83 $\mu$m, assess the presence of Pa-$\alpha$ emission due to accretion onto the protoplanets, and probe any IR excess indicative of heated circumplanetary material. Methods. We obtain non-coronagraphic JWST/NIRCam images of PDS 70 within the MINDS (MIRI mid-INfrared Disk Survey) program. We leverage the Vortex Image Processing (VIP) package for data reduction, and develop dedicated routines for optimal stellar PSF subtraction, unbiased imaging of the disk, and protoplanet flux measurement in this type of dataset. A radiative transfer model of the disk is used to disentangle the contributions from the disk and the protoplanets. Results. We re-detect both protoplanets and identify extended emission after subtracting a disk model, including a large-scale spiral-like feature. We interpret its signal in the direct vicinity of planet c as tracing the accretion stream feeding its circumplanetary disk, while the outer part of the feature may rather reflect asymmetric illumination of the outer disk. We also report a bright signal consistent with a previously proposed protoplanet candidate enshrouded in dust, near the 1:2:4 mean-motion resonance with planets b and c. The 1.87 $\mu$m flux of planet b is consistent with atmospheric model predictions, but not that of planet c. We discuss potential origins for this discrepancy, including significant Pa-$\alpha$ line emission. The 4.83 $\mu$m fluxes of planets b and c suggest enshrouding dust or heated CO emission from their circumplanetary environment.</description>

      <title>Neutrino beaming in ultraluminous X-ray pulsars as a result of gravitational lensing by neutron stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12573v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: X-ray pulsars experiencing extreme mass accretion rates can produce neutrino emission in the MeV energy band. Neutrinos in these systems are emitted in close proximity to the stellar surface and subsequently undergo gravitational bending in the space curved by a neutron star. This process results in the formation of a distinct beam pattern of neutrino emission and gives rise to the phenomenon of neutrino pulsars. The energy flux of neutrinos, when averaged over the neutron star's pulsation period, can differ from the isotropic neutrino energy flux, which impacts the detectability of bright pulsars in neutrinos. We investigate the process of neutrino beam pattern formation, accounting for neutron star transparency to neutrinos and gravitational bending. Based on simulated neutrino beam patterns, we estimate the potential difference between the actual and apparent neutrino luminosity. We show that the apparent luminosity can greatly exceed the actual luminosity, albeit only in a small fraction of cases, depending on the specific equation of state and the mass of the star. For example, the amplification can exceed a factor of ten for $\approx0.05\%$ of typical neutron stars with mass of $1.4\,M_\odot$. Strong amplification is less probable for neutron stars of higher mass. In the case of strange stars, a fraction of high energy neutrinos can be absorbed and the beam pattern, as well as the amplification of apparent neutrino luminosity, depend on neutrino energy.</description>

      <title>Geometric correction for wind accretion in binary systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01755v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton (BHL) accretion model is widely used to describe how a compact object accretes material from a companion's stellar wind in binary systems. However, its standard implementation becomes inaccurate when the wind velocity ($v_\mathrm{w}$) is comparable to or less than the orbital velocity ($v_\mathrm{o}$), predicting non-physical accretion efficiencies above unity. This limits its applicability to systems with low wind-to-orbital velocity ratios ($w= v_\mathrm{w} / v_\mathrm{o} \leq 1$), such as symbiotic systems. We revisit the implementation of the BHL model and introduce a geometric correction factor that accounts for the varying orientation of the accretion cylinder relative to the wind direction. This correction ensures physically plausible accretion efficiencies ($\eta \leq 1$) for all $w$ in circular orbits. Our new implementation naturally predicts the flattening of the accretion efficiency observed in numerical simulations for $w &lt; 1$, without the need for ad hoc adjustments. We also peer into the implications of our prescription for the less-explored case of eccentric orbits, highlighting the key role of the geometric correction factor in shaping the accretion process. We compare our predictions with numerical simulations, finding good agreement for a wide range of parameters. Applications to the symbiotic star R~Aqr and the X-ray binary LS 5039 are presented. This improved implementation offers a more accurate description of wind accretion in binary systems, with implications for stellar evolution, population synthesis, and observational data interpretation.</description>

      <title>The First Spin-Orbit Obliquity of an M dwarf/brown dwarf System: An eccentric and aligned TOI-2119 b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18567v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the first instance of an M dwarf/brown dwarf obliquity measurement for the TOI-2119 system using the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect. TOI-2119 b is a transiting brown dwarf orbiting a young, active early M dwarf ($T_{\rm{eff}}$ = 3553 K). It has a mass of 64.4 M$_{\rm{J}}$ and radius of 1.08 R$_{\rm{J}}$, with an eccentric orbit ($e$ = 0.3) at a period of 7.2 days. For this analysis, we utilise NEID spectroscopic transit observations and ground based simultaneous transit photometry from the Astrophysical Research Consortium (ARC) and the Las Campanas Remote Observatory (LCRO). We fit all available data of TOI-2119 b to refine the brown dwarf parameters and update the ephemeris. The classical Rossiter-McLaughlin technique yields a projected star-planet obliquity of $\lambda=-0.8\pm1.1^\circ$ and a three-dimensional obliquity of $\psi=15.7\pm5.5^\circ$. Additionally, we spatially resolve the stellar surface of TOI-2119 utilising the Reloaded Rossiter-McLaughlin technique to determine the projected star-planet obliquity as $\lambda=1.26 \pm 1.3^{\circ}$. Both of these results agree within $2\sigma$ and confirm the system is aligned, where TOI-2119 b joins an emerging group of aligned brown dwarf obliquities. We also probe stellar surface activity on the surface of TOI-2119 in the form of centre-to-limb variations as well as the potential for differential rotation. Overall, we find tentative evidence for centre-to-limb variations on the star but do not detect evidence of differential rotation.</description>
