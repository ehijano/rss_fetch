      <title>Randomized Transport Plans via Hierarchical Fully Probabilistic Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An optimal randomized strategy for design of balanced, normalized mass transport plans is developed. It replaces -- but specializes to -- the deterministic, regularized optimal transport (OT) strategy, which yields only a certainty-equivalent plan. The incompletely specified -- and therefore uncertain -- transport plan is acknowledged to be a random process. Therefore, hierarchical fully probabilistic design (HFPD) is adopted, yielding an optimal hyperprior supported on the set of possible transport plans, and consistent with prior mean constraints on the marginals of the uncertain plan. This Bayesian resetting of the design problem for transport plans -- which we call HFPD-OT -- confers new opportunities. These include (i) a strategy for the generation of a random sample of joint transport plans; (ii) randomized marginal contracts for individual source-target pairs; and (iii) consistent measures of uncertainty in the plan and its contracts. An application in algorithmic fairness is outlined, where HFPD-OT enables the recruitment of a more diverse subset of contracts -- than is possible in classical OT -- into the delivery of an expected plan. Also, it permits fairness proxies to be endowed with uncertainty quantifiers.</description>

      <title>Learning with Adaptive Conservativeness for Distributionally Robust Optimization: Incentive Design for Voltage Regulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Information asymmetry between the Distribution System Operator (DSO) and Distributed Energy Resource Aggregators (DERAs) obstructs designing effective incentives for voltage regulation. To capture this effect, we employ a Stackelberg game-theoretic framework, where the DSO seeks to overcome the information asymmetry and refine its incentive strategies by learning from DERA behavior over multiple iterations. We introduce a model-based online learning algorithm for the DSO, aimed at inferring the relationship between incentives and DERA responses. Given the uncertain nature of these responses, we also propose a distributionally robust incentive design model to control the probability of voltage regulation failure and then reformulate it into a convex problem. This model allows the DSO to periodically revise distribution assumptions on uncertain parameters in the decision model of the DERA. Finally, we present a gradient-based method that permits the DSO to adaptively modify its conservativeness level, measured by the size of a Wasserstein metric-based ambiguity set, according to historical voltage regulation performance. The effectiveness of our proposed method is demonstrated through numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>DUST: A Framework for Data-Driven Density Steering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of data-driven stochastic optimal control of an unknown LTI dynamical system. Assuming the process noise is normally distributed, we pose the problem of steering the state's mean and covariance to a target normal distribution, under noisy data collected from the underlying system, a problem commonly referred to as covariance steering (CS). A novel framework for Data-driven Uncertainty quantification and density STeering (DUST) is presented that simultaneously characterizes the noise affecting the measured data and designs an optimal affine-feedback controller to steer the density of the state to a prescribed terminal value. We use both indirect and direct data-driven design approaches based on the notions of persistency of excitation and subspace predictors to exactly represent the mean and covariance dynamics of the state in terms of the data and noise realizations. Since both the mean and the covariance steering sub-problems are plagued with distributional uncertainty arising from noisy data collection, we first estimate the noise realization from this dataset and subsequently compute tractable upper bounds on the estimation errors. The moment steering problems are then solved to optimality using techniques from robust control and robust optimization. Lastly, we present an alternative control design approach based on the certainty equivalence principle and interpret the problem as one of CS under multiplicative uncertainties. We analyze the performance and efficacy of each of these data-driven approaches using a case study and compare them with their model-based counterparts.</description>

      <title>Designing model predictive control strategies for grid-interactive water heaters for load shifting applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model predictive control (MPC) strategies allow residential water heaters to shift load in response to dynamic price signals. Crucially, the performance of such strategies is sensitive to various algorithm design choices. In this work, we develop a framework for implementing model predictive controls on residential water heaters for load shifting applications. We use this framework to analyze how four different design factors affect control performance and thermal comfort: (i) control model fidelity, (ii) temperature sensor configuration, (iii) water draw estimation methodology, and (iv) water draw forecasting methodology. We propose new methods for estimating water draw patterns without the use of a flow meter. MPC strategies are compared under two different time-varying price signals through simulations using a high-fidelity tank model and real-world draw data. Results show that control model fidelity and the number of temperature sensors have the largest impact on electricity costs, while the water draw forecasting methodology has a significant impact on thermal comfort and the frequency of runout events. Results provide practical insight into effective MPC design for water heaters in home energy management systems.</description>

      <title>Narrowband Electromagnetic Coupling Matrix in Coupled-Resonator Microwave Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel methodology to unleash electromagnetic coupling matrix information in coupled-resonator microwave circuits has been recently proposed [1]. This information is derived from Maxwell's equations and the natural language of electromagnetics is employed. As a result, the coupling matrix coefficients stand only for electromagnetics. In this work, we enhance this approach to reveal valuable design information for microwave engineering, showing the electromagnetic (EM) coupling among all EM resonators and ports. By the same token, the similarities with the well-known classical coupling matrix theory are addressed. We bridge this gap since the classical theory is the preferential language among microwave engineers.
  Classical coupling matrix theory is a narrowband model for electromagnetics. Thus, we carry out a narrowband approximation in the electromagnetic coupling matrix. This makes it possible to describe the EM coupling coefficients in the same framework as classical circuits. As a result, proper comparison between both coupling matrices is allowed.
  Finally, both coupling matrix approaches have a common ground, namely, get physical insight and valuable information for design purposes in coupled-resonator microwave circuits. However, only the electromagnetic coupling matrix details all EM behavior, including parasitic and leakage couplings, and the higher-order mode influence in the microwave circuit. Several microwave circuits, such as filters and diplexers, will show the possibilities of this new technique and its relation to classical coupling matrix theory.</description>

      <title>Dirichlet Logistic Gaussian Processes for Evaluation of Black-Box Stochastic Systems under Complex Requirements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The requirement-driven performance evaluation of a black-box cyber-physical system (CPS) that utilizes machine learning methods has proven to be an effective way to assess the quality of the CPS. However, the distributional evaluation of the performance has been poorly considered. Although many uncertainty estimation methods have been advocated, they have not successfully estimated highly complex performance distributions under small data. In this paper, we propose a method to distributionally evaluate the performance under complex requirements using small input-trajectory data. To handle the unknown complex probability distributions under small data, we discretize the corresponding performance measure, yielding a discrete random process over an input region. Then, we propose a semiparametric Bayesian model of the discrete process based on a Dirichlet random field whose parameter function is represented by multiple logistic Gaussian processes (LGPs). The Dirichlet posterior parameter function is estimated through the LGP posteriors in a reasonable and conservative fashion. We show that the proposed Bayesian model converges to the true discrete random process as the number of data becomes large enough. We also empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method by simulation.</description>

      <title>Practical Design of Probabilistic Constellation Shaping for Physical Layer Security in Visible Light Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies a practical design of probabilistic constellation shaping (PCS) for physical layer security in visible light communications (VLC). In particular, we consider a wiretap VLC channel employing a probabilistically shaped $M$-ary pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) constellation. Considering the requirements for reliability of the legitimate user's channel, flickering-free transmission, and symmetric constellation distribution, the optimal constellation distributions to maximize modulation-constrained secrecy capacity or the bit error rate (BER) of eavesdropper's channel are investigated for both scenarios of known and unknown eavesdropper's channel state information (CSI). To formulate the constraint on the channel reliability, tractable closed-form expressions for the upper bound and approximate BER of $M$-ary PAM under an arbitrary symbol probability are derived. The design problem is shown to be non-convex due to the non-convex BER constraint. By proving that the upper bound BER is a concave function of the constellation distribution, a suboptimal solution based on the convex-concave procedure (CCCP) is presented. Our findings reveal that while the uniform signaling can only satisfy the BER constraint when the optical power is beyond a certain value, the proposed PCS design works in the entire region of the optical power. Some insights into the optimal constellation distribution with respect to the emitted optical power are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Advancing Nonlinear System Stability Analysis with Hessian Matrix Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces an innovative method for ensuring global stability in a broad array of nonlinear systems. The novel approach enhances the traditional analysis based on Jacobian matrices by incorporating the Taylor series boundary error of estimation and the eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix, resulting in a fresh criterion for global stability. The main strength of this methodology lies in its unrestricted nature regarding the number of equilibrium points or the system's dimension, giving it a competitive edge over alternative methods for global stability analysis. The efficacy of this method has been validated through its application to two established benchmark systems within the industrial domain. The results suggest that the expanded Jacobian stability analysis can ensure global stability under specific circumstances, which are thoroughly elaborated upon in the manuscript. The proposed approach serves as a robust tool for assessing the global stability of nonlinear systems and holds promise for advancing the realms of nonlinear control and optimization.</description>

      <title>Joint Design of Probabilistic Constellation Shaping and Precoding for Multi-user VLC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a joint design of probabilistic constellation shaping (PCS) and precoding to enhance the sum-rate performance of multi-user visible light communications (VLC) broadcast channels subject to signal amplitude constraint. In the proposed design, the transmission probabilities of bipolar $M$-pulse amplitude modulation ($M$-PAM) symbols for each user and the transmit precoding matrix are jointly optimized to improve the sum-rate performance. The joint design problem is shown to be a complex non-convex problem due to the non-convexity of the objective function. To tackle the problem, the firefly algorithm (FA), a nature-inspired heuristic optimization approach, is employed to solve a local optima to the original non-convex optimization problem. The FA-based approach, however, suffers from high computational complexity. Therefore, we propose a low-complexity design based on zero-forcing (ZF) precoding, which is solved using an alternating optimization (AO) approach. Simulation results reveal that the proposed joint design with PCS significantly improves the sum-rate performance compared to the conventional design with uniform signaling. Some insights into the optimal symbol distributions of the two joint design approaches are also provided.</description>

      <title>Model-free optimal controller for discrete-time Markovian jump linear systems: A Q-learning approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research paper introduces a model-free optimal controller for discrete-time Markovian jump linear systems (MJLSs), employing principles from the methodology of reinforcement learning (RL). While Q-learning methods have demonstrated efficacy in determining optimal controller gains for deterministic systems, their application to systems with Markovian switching remains unexplored. To address this research gap, we propose a Q-function involving the Markovian mode. Subsequently, a Q-learning algorithm is proposed to learn the unknown kernel matrix using raw input-state information from the system. Notably, the study proves the convergence of the proposed Q-learning optimal controller gains to the model-based optimal controller gains after proving the convergence of a value iteration algorithm as the first step. Addition of excitation noise to input which is required to ensure the leaning performance does not lead to any bias. Unlike the conventional optimal controller, the proposed method does not require any knowledge on system dynamics and eliminates the need for solving coupled algebraic Riccati equations arising in optimal control of MJLSs. Finally, the efficiency of the proposed method is demonstrated through a simulation study.</description>

      <title>Dedicated Nonlinear Control of Robot Manipulators in the Presence of External Vibration and Uncertain Payload</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robot manipulators are often tasked with working in environments with vibrations and are subject to load uncertainty. Providing an accurate tracking control design with implementable torque input for these robots is a complex topic. This paper presents two approaches to solve this problem. The approaches consider joint space tracking control design in the presence of nonlinear uncertain torques caused by external vibration and payload variation. The properties of the uncertain torques are used in both approaches. The first approach is based on the boundedness property, while the second approach considers the differentiability and boundedness together. The controllers derived from each approach differ from the perspectives of accuracy, control effort, and disturbance properties. A Lyapunov-based analysis is utilized to guarantee the stability of the control design in each case. Simulation results validate the approaches and demonstrate the performance of the controllers. The derived controllers show stable results at the cost of the mentioned properties.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we propose and demonstrate an adaptive-sliding mode control for trajectory tracking control of robot manipulators subjected to uncertain dynamics, vibration disturbance, and payload variation disturbance. Throughout this work we seek a controller that is, robust to the uncertainty and disturbance, accurate, and implementable. To perform these requirements, we use a nonlinear Lyapunov-based approach for designing the controller and guaranteeing its stability. MATLAB-SIMULINK software is used to validate the approach and demonstrate the performance of the controller. Simulation results show that the derived controller is stable, robust to the disturbance and uncertainties, accurate, and implementable.</description>

      <title>Closed-loop Diffusion Control of Complex Physical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The control problems of complex physical systems have wide applications in science and engineering. Several previous works have demonstrated that generative control methods based on diffusion models have significant advantages for solving these problems. However, existing generative control methods face challenges in handling closed-loop control, which is an inherent constraint for effective control of complex physical systems. In this paper, we propose a Closed-Loop Diffusion method for Physical systems Control (CL-DiffPhyCon). By adopting an asynchronous denoising schedule for different time steps, CL-DiffPhyCon generates control signals conditioned on real-time feedback from the environment. Thus, CL-DiffPhyCon is able to speed up diffusion control methods in a closed-loop framework. We evaluate CL-DiffPhyCon on the 1D Burgers' equation control and 2D incompressible fluid control tasks. The results demonstrate that CL-DiffPhyCon achieves notable control performance with significant sampling acceleration.</description>

      <title>An Artificial Neural Network based approach for Harmonic Component Prediction in a Distribution Line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With a growth in the use of nonlinear devices, in both generation and consumption, it is imminent that we require accurate and quick control for active filters to suppress harmonics. Time delays between input and output is catastrophic for such filters, which rely on real-time operation. Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are capable of properly modelling complex nonlinear systems through adjustments in their learned parameters. Once these networks are properly trained, they can produce highly accurate predictions at an instantaneous time frame. Leveraging these qualities, various complex control systems may be replaced by neural networks to provide quick and precise responses. This paper proposes an ANN based approach for the prediction of individual harmonic components. By extracting and analyzing the magnitudes of harmonic components obtained from the survey of a particular area through real-time measurements, a sequential pattern in their occurrence is observed. Various neural network architectures are trained using the collected data and their performance are evaluated. The best performing model, whose loss is minimum, is then used to observe the harmonic cancellation for a particular case through a simplified simulation in hardware-in-the-loop. These neural network structures, that produce instantaneous and accurate outputs, provide a better response time. On top of that, it can limit the required input measurements/parameters to basic ones like time, currents and a few other pertaining to a particular locality, such as maximum demand and number of households.</description>

      <title>Multi-Scale Cell Decomposition for Path Planning using Restrictive Routing Potential Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In burgeoning domains, like urban goods distribution, the advent of aerial cargo transportation necessitates the development of routing solutions that prioritize safety. This paper introduces Larp, a novel path planning framework that leverages the concept of restrictive potential fields to forge routes demonstrably safer than those derived from existing methods. The algorithm achieves it by segmenting a potential field into a hierarchy of cells, each with a designated restriction zone determined by obstacle proximity. While the primary impetus behind Larp is to enhance the safety of aerial pathways for cargo-carrying Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), its utility extends to a wide array of path planning scenarios. Comparative analyses with both established and contemporary potential field-based methods reveal Larp's proficiency in maintaining a safe distance from restrictions and its adeptness in circumventing local minima.</description>

      <title>LLM-Empowered Resource Allocation in Wireless Communications Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent success of large language models (LLMs) has spurred their application in various fields. In particular, there have been efforts to integrate LLMs into various aspects of wireless communication systems. The use of LLMs in wireless communication systems has the potential to realize artificial general intelligence (AGI)-enabled wireless networks. In this paper, we investigate an LLM-based resource allocation scheme for wireless communication systems. Specifically, we formulate a simple resource allocation problem involving two transmit pairs and develop an LLM-based resource allocation approach that aims to maximize either energy efficiency or spectral efficiency. Additionally, we consider the joint use of low-complexity resource allocation techniques to compensate for the reliability shortcomings of the LLM-based scheme. After confirming the applicability and feasibility of LLM-based resource allocation, we address several key technical challenges that remain in applying LLMs in practice.</description>

      <title>Few-shot Scooping Under Domain Shift via Simulated Maximal Deployment Gaps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous lander missions on extraterrestrial bodies need to sample granular materials while coping with domain shifts, even when sampling strategies are extensively tuned on Earth. To tackle this challenge, this paper studies the few-shot scooping problem and proposes a vision-based adaptive scooping strategy that uses the deep kernel Gaussian process method trained with a novel meta-training strategy to learn online from very limited experience on out-of-distribution target terrains. Our Deep Kernel Calibration with Maximal Deployment Gaps (kCMD) strategy explicitly trains a deep kernel model to adapt to large domain shifts by creating simulated maximal deployment gaps from an offline training dataset and training models to overcome these deployment gaps during training. Employed in a Bayesian Optimization sequential decision-making framework, the proposed method allows the robot to perform high-quality scooping actions on out-of-distribution terrains after a few attempts, significantly outperforming non-adaptive methods proposed in the excavation literature as well as other state-of-the-art meta-learning methods. The proposed method also demonstrates zero-shot transfer capability, successfully adapting to the NASA OWLAT platform, which serves as a state-of-the-art simulator for potential future planetary missions. These results demonstrate the potential of training deep models with simulated deployment gaps for more generalizable meta-learning in high-capacity models. Furthermore, they highlight the promise of our method in autonomous lander sampling missions by enabling landers to overcome the deployment gap between Earth and extraterrestrial bodies.</description>

      <title>A Course in Dynamic Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: These lecture notes are derived from a graduate-level course in dynamic optimization, offering an introduction to techniques and models extensively used in management science, economics, operations research, engineering, and computer science. The course emphasizes the theoretical underpinnings of discrete-time dynamic programming models and advanced algorithmic strategies for solving these models. Unlike typical treatments, it provides a proof for the principle of optimality for upper semi-continuous dynamic programming, a middle ground between the simpler countable state space case \cite{bertsekas2012dynamic}, and the involved universally measurable case \cite{bertsekas1996stochastic}. This approach is sufficiently rigorous to include important examples such as dynamic pricing, consumption-savings, and inventory management models. The course also delves into the properties of value and policy functions, leveraging classical results \cite{topkis1998supermodularity} and recent developments. Additionally, it offers an introduction to reinforcement learning, including a formal proof of the convergence of Q-learning algorithms. Furthermore, the notes delve into policy gradient methods for the average reward case, presenting a convergence result for the tabular case in this context. This result is simple and similar to the discounted case but appears to be new.</description>

      <title>Learning Provably Robust Policies in Uncertain Parametric Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a data-driven approach for learning MDP policies that are robust across stochastic environments whose transition probabilities are defined by parameters with an unknown distribution. We produce probably approximately correct (PAC) guarantees for the performance of these learned policies in a new, unseen environment over the unknown distribution. Our approach is based on finite samples of the MDP environments, for each of which we build an approximation of the model as an interval MDP, by exploring a set of generated trajectories. We use the built approximations to synthesise a single policy that performs well (meets given requirements) across the sampled environments, and furthermore bound its risk (of not meeting the given requirements) when deployed in an unseen environment. Our procedure offers a trade-off between the guaranteed performance of the learned policy and the risk of not meeting the guarantee in an unseen environment. Our approach exploits knowledge of the environment's state space and graph structure, and we show how additional knowledge of its parametric structure can be leveraged to optimize learning and to obtain tighter guarantees from less samples. We evaluate our approach on a diverse range of established benchmarks, demonstrating that we can generate highly performing and robust policies, along with guarantees that tightly quantify their performance and the associated risk.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Trajectory Optimization for Demonstration Imitation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Humans often learn new skills by imitating the experts and gradually developing their proficiency. In this work, we introduce Stochastic Trajectory Optimization for Demonstration Imitation (STODI), a trajectory optimization framework for robots to imitate the shape of demonstration trajectories with improved dynamic performance. Consistent with the human learning process, demonstration imitation serves as an initial step, while trajectory optimization aims to enhance robot motion performance. By generating random noise and constructing proper cost functions, the STODI effectively explores and exploits generated noisy trajectories while preserving the demonstration shape characteristics. We employ three metrics to measure the similarity of trajectories in both the time and frequency domains to help with demonstration imitation. Theoretical analysis reveals relationships among these metrics, emphasizing the benefits of frequency-domain analysis for specific tasks. Experiments on a 7-DOF robotic arm in the PyBullet simulator validate the efficacy of the STODI framework, showcasing the improved optimization performance and stability compared to previous methods.</description>

      <title>Training on the Fly: On-device Self-supervised Learning aboard Nano-drones within 20 mW</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Miniaturized cyber-physical systems (CPSes) powered by tiny machine learning (TinyML), such as nano-drones, are becoming an increasingly attractive technology. Their small form factor (i.e., ~10cm diameter) ensures vast applicability, ranging from the exploration of narrow disaster scenarios to safe human-robot interaction. Simple electronics make these CPSes inexpensive, but strongly limit the computational, memory, and sensing resources available on board. In real-world applications, these limitations are further exacerbated by domain shift. This fundamental machine learning problem implies that model perception performance drops when moving from the training domain to a different deployment one. To cope with and mitigate this general problem, we present a novel on-device fine-tuning approach that relies only on the limited ultra-low power resources available aboard nano-drones. Then, to overcome the lack of ground-truth training labels aboard our CPS, we also employ a self-supervised method based on ego-motion consistency. Albeit our work builds on top of a specific real-world vision-based human pose estimation task, it is widely applicable for many embedded TinyML use cases. Our 512-image on-device training procedure is fully deployed aboard an ultra-low power GWT GAP9 System-on-Chip and requires only 1MB of memory while consuming as low as 19mW or running in just 510ms (at 38mW). Finally, we demonstrate the benefits of our on-device learning approach by field-testing our closed-loop CPS, showing a reduction in horizontal position error of up to 26% vs. a non-fine-tuned state-of-the-art baseline. In the most challenging never-seen-before environment, our on-device learning procedure makes the difference between succeeding or failing the mission.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The non-commutative nature of quantum mechanics imposes fundamental constraints on system dynamics, which in the linear realm are manifested by the physical realizability conditions on system matrices. These restrictions endow system matrices with special structure. The purpose of this paper is to study such structure by investigating zeros and poses of linear quantum systems. In particular, we show that $-s_0^\ast$ is a transmission zero if and only if $s_0$ is a pole, and which is further generalized to the relationship between system eigenvalues and invariant zeros. Additionally, we study left-invertibility and fundamental tradeoff for linear quantum systems in terms of their zeros and poles.</description>

      <title>Learning-Based Optimal Control with Performance Guarantees for Unknown Systems with Latent States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.17963v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As control engineering methods are applied to increasingly complex systems, data-driven approaches for system identification appear as a promising alternative to physics-based modeling. While the Bayesian approaches prevalent for safety-critical applications usually rely on the availability of state measurements, the states of a complex system are often not directly measurable. It may then be necessary to jointly estimate the dynamics and the latent state, making the quantification of uncertainties and the design of controllers with formal performance guarantees considerably more challenging. This paper proposes a novel method for the computation of an optimal input trajectory for unknown nonlinear systems with latent states based on a combination of particle Markov chain Monte Carlo methods and scenario theory. Probabilistic performance guarantees are derived for the resulting input trajectory, and an approach to validate the performance of arbitrary control laws is presented. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated in a numerical simulation.</description>

      <title>Comparison of Unscented Kalman Filter Design for Agricultural Anaerobic Digestion Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.15958v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dynamic operation of biological processes, such as anaerobic digestion (AD), requires reliable process monitoring to guarantee stable operating conditions at all times. Unscented Kalman filters (UKF) are an established tool for nonlinear state estimation, and there exist numerous variants of UKF implementations, treating state constraints, improvements of numerical performance and different noise cases. So far, however, a unified comparison of proposed methods emphasizing the algorithmic details is lacking. The present study thus examines multiple unconstrained and constrained UKF variants, addresses aspects crucial for direct implementation and applies them to a simplified AD model. The constrained UKF considering additive noise delivered the most accurate state estimations. The long run time of the underlying optimization could be vastly reduced through pre-calculated gradients and Hessian of the associated cost function, as well as by reformulation of the cost function as a quadratic program. However, unconstrained UKF variants showed lower run times at competitive estimation accuracy. This study provides useful advice to practitioners working with nonlinear Kalman filters by paying close attention to algorithmic details and modifications crucial for successful implementation.</description>

      <title>Innovation-triggered Learning with Application to Data-driven Predictive Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15824v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data-driven control has attracted lots of attention in recent years, especially for plants that are difficult to model based on first principles. In particular, a key issue in data-driven approaches is how to make efficient use of data as the abundance of data becomes overwhelming. To address this issue, this work proposes an innovation-triggered learning framework and a corresponding data-driven controller design approach with guaranteed stability. Specifically, we consider a linear time-invariant system with unknown dynamics. A set-membership approach is introduced to learn a parametric uncertainty set for the unknown dynamics. Then, a data selection mechanism is proposed by online evaluating the innovation contained in the sampled data, wherein the innovation is quantified by its effect of shrinking the parametric uncertainty set. Next, after introducing a stability criterion using the set-membership estimate of the system dynamics, a robust data-driven predictive controller is designed by minimizing a worst-case cost function. The closed-loop stability of the data-driven predictive controller equipped with the innovation-triggered learning protocol is discussed within a high probability framework. Finally, comparative numerical experiments are performed to verify the validity of the proposed approach, and the characteristics and the design principle of the learning hyper-parameter are also discussed.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a unified framework for identifying interpretable nonlinear dynamical models that preserve physical properties. The proposed approach integrates physical principles with black-box basis functions to compensate for unmodeled dynamics, ensuring accuracy over long prediction horizons and computational efficiency. Additionally, we introduce penalty terms to enforce physical consistency and stability during training. We provide a comprehensive analysis of theoretical properties related to multi-step nonlinear system identification, establishing bounds on parameter estimation errors and conditions for gradient stability and sparsity recovery. The proposed framework demonstrates significant potential for improving model accuracy and reliability in various engineering applications, making a substantial step towards the effective use of combined off-white and sparse black models in system identification. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated on a nonlinear system identification benchmark.</description>

      <title>Distribution System Reconfiguration to Mitigate Load Altering Attacks via Stackelberg Games</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07065v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The integration of IoT-controllable devices in power systems (such as smart electric vehicle charging stations, heat pumps, etc.), despite their apparent benefits, raises novel cybersecurity concerns. These vulnerabilities in these devices can be leveraged to launch load-altering attacks (LAAs) that can potentially compromise power system safety. In this paper, we analyze the impact of LAAs on the voltage profile of distribution systems. We derive closed-form expressions to quantify the attack impact. Using the insights derived from this analysis, we propose a method to mitigate LAAs based on reconfiguring the distribution system as a reactive defense approach. We study optimal defense strategies using a non-cooperative sequential game theory approach that is robust to LAAs. The proposed solution takes the potential errors in the attack localization into account. Our results show that attacks launched on the deepest nodes in the distribution network result in the highest detrimental impact on the grid voltage profile. Furthermore, the proposed game-theoretic strategy successfully mitigates the effect of the attack while ensuring minimum system reconfiguration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21259v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The modern power grid has seen a rise in the integration of non-linear loads, presenting a significant concern for operators. These loads introduce unwanted harmonics, leading to potential issues such as overheating and improper functioning of circuit breakers. In pursuing a more sustainable grid, the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) and photovoltaic (PV) systems in residential networks has increased. Understanding and examining the effects of high-order harmonic frequencies beyond $1.5$ kHz is crucial to understanding their impact on the operation and planning of electrical distribution systems under varying nonlinear loading conditions. This study investigates a diverse set of critical power electronic loads within a household modeled using PSCAD/EMTdc, analyzing their unique harmonic spectra. This information is utilized to run the time-series harmonic analysis program in OpenDSS on a modified IEEE 34 bus test system model. The impact of high-order harmonics is quantified using metrics that evaluate total harmonic distortion (THD), transformer harmonic-driven eddy current loss component, and propagation of harmonics from the source to the substation transformer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.01032v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes group-based distributed optimization (DO) algorithms on top of intelligent partitioning for the optimal power flow (OPF) problems. Radial partitioning of the graph of a network is introduced as a systematic way to split a large-scale problem into more tractable sub-problems, which can potentially be solved efficiently with methods such as convex relaxations. Spectral parameter selection is introduced for group-based DO as a crucial hyper-parameter selection step in DO. A software package DiCARP is created, which is implemented in Python using the Pyomo optimization package. Our numerical results for different power network instances show that our designed algorithm returns more accurate solutions to the tested problems with fewer iterations than component-based DO. Our results confirm the importance of smart partitioning and parameter selection for large-scale optimization problems on networks.</description>

      <title>Time-Dependent Low-Rank Input-Output Operator for Forced Linearized Dynamics with Unsteady Base Flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.00790v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the linear growth of disturbances due to external forcing is crucial for flow stability analysis, flow control, and uncertainty quantification. These applications typically require a large number of forward simulations of the forced linearized dynamics, often in a brute-force fashion. When dealing with simple steady-state or periodic base flows, there exist powerful and cost-effective solution operator techniques. Once these solution operators are constructed, they can be used to determine the response to various forcings with negligible computational cost. However, these methods do not apply to problems with arbitrarily time-dependent base flows. This paper develops and investigates reduced-order modeling with time-dependent bases (TDBs) to build low-rank solution operators for forced linearized dynamics with arbitrarily time-dependent base flows. In particular, we use forced optimally time-dependent decomposition (f-OTD), which extracts the time-dependent correlated structures of the flow response to various excitations. Several demonstrations are included to illustrate the utility of the f-OTD low-rank approximation for performing global transient stability analysis. Additionally, we demonstrate the application of f-OTD in computing the post-transient response of linearized Navier-Stokes equations to a large number of impulses, which has applications in flow control.</description>

      <title>Variation Bayesian Interference for Multiple Extended Targets or Unresolved Group Targets Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15226v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a tracking method for multiple extended targets or unresolvable group targets based on the Variational Bayesian Inference (VBI). Firstly, based on the most commonly used Random Matrix Model (RMM), the joint states of a single target are modeled as a Gamma Gaussian Inverse Wishart (GGIW) distribution, and the multi-target joint association variables are involved in the estimation together as unknown information with a prior distribution. A shape evolution model and VBI are employed to address the shortcomings of the RMM. Through the VBI, we can derive the approximate variational posterior for the exact multi-target posterior. Furthermore, to demonstrate the applicability of the method in real-world tracking scenarios, we present two potential lightweight schemes. The first is based on clustering, which effectively prunes the joint association events. The second is a simplification of the variational posterior through marginal association probabilities. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method using simulation experiments, and the proposed method outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and adaptability. This manuscript is only a preprint version, a completer and more official version will be uploaded as soon as possible</description>
