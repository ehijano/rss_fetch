      <title>Twisted braids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Twisted knot theory, introduced by M.O. Bourgoin, is a generalization of virtual knot theory. It naturally yields the notion of a twisted braid, which is closely related to the notion of a virtual braid due to Kauffman. In this paper, we first prove that any twisted link can be described as the closure of a twisted braid, which is unique up to certain basic moves. This is the analogue of the Alexander Theorem and the Markov Theorem for classical braids and links. Then we also give reduced presentations for the twisted braid group and the flat twisted braid group. These reduced presentations are based on the fact that these twisted braid groups on $n$ strands are generated by a single braiding element and a single bar element plus the generators of the symmetric group on $n$ letters.</description>

      <title>Pin the loop taut: a one-player topologame</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a $1$-player game called \emph{pin the loop} and analyse its complexity. A loop is a generic immersion of the circle in a surface, considered up to isotopy. A loop is taut when it is minimally intersecting in its homotopy class. A pinning set of a loop is a set of points $P$ in the surface avoiding the loop, such that the loop is taut in the surface punctured at $P$. The pinning number is the minimal cardinal of its pinning sets, and a pinning set is optimal if it has that cardinal.
  We show that the decision problem associated to computing the pinning number of a plane loop is \texttt{NP-complete}. We implement a polynomial algorithm to check if a given point-set is pinning, adapting a method of Birman--Series for computing intersection numbers of curves in surfaces. After improving a theorem of Hass--Scott characterising taut loops in surfaces, we reduce the problem to a boolean formula whose solutions correspond to the pinning sets. Finally, we reduce the vertex-cover problem for graphs to an instance of the pinning problem for plane loops.
  Our results imply that given a closed geodesic in a complete Riemannian surface with punctures, it is hard to guess the location of the punctures from the sole isotopy class of the geodesic in the compactified surface.</description>

      <title>2-torsion in instanton Floer homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the existence of $2$-torsion in instanton Floer homology with $\mathbb{Z}$ coefficients for closed $3$-manifolds and singular knots. First, we show that the non-existence of $2$-torsion in the framed instanton Floer homology $I^\sharp(S_n^3(K);\mathbb{Z})$ of any nonzero integral $n$-surgery along a knot $K$ in $S^3$ would imply that $K$ is fibered. Also, we show that $I^\sharp(S_{r}^3(K);\mathbb{Z})$ for any nontrivial $K$ with $r=1,1/2,1/4$ always has $2$-torsion. These two results indicate that the existence of $2$-torsion is expected to be a generic phenomenon for Dehn surgeries along knots. Second, we show that for genus-one knots with nontrivial Alexander polynomials and for unknotting-number-one knots, the unreduced singular instanton knot homology $I^\sharp(S^3,K;\mathbb{Z})$ always has $2$-torsion. Finally, some crucial lemmas that help us demonstrate the existence of $2$-torsion are motivated by analogous results in Heegaard Floer theory, which may be of independent interest. In particular, we show that, for a knot $K$ in $S^3$, if there is a nonzero rational number $r$ such that the dual knot $\widetilde{K}_r$ inside $S^3_r(K)$ is Floer simple, then $S^3_r(K)$ must be an L-space and $K$ must be an L-space knot.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that for a non-trivial element $c$ in $\widehat{HF}(-Y)$, there exists a tight contact structure $\xi$ on $Y$ whose contact invariant realizes $c$ if and only if there exists a non-trivial fibered knot $K$ such that $-\tau_c(K)=g(K)$. Moreover, when such a fibered knot $K$ does exist, $\xi$ can be chosen to satisfy the extra condition that $K$ admits a Legendrian representative with Thurston-Bennequin number tb$(K)$ equal to $0$ in $(Y,\xi)$.</description>

Abstract: We provide new examples of 3-manifolds with weight one fundamental group and the same integral homology as the lens space $L(2k,1)$ which are not surgery on any knot in the three-sphere. Our argument uses Furuta's 10/8-theorem, and is simple and combinatorial to apply.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show how the multivariable signature and Alexander polynomial of a colored link can be computed from a single symmetric matrix naturally defined from a colored link diagram. In the case of a single variable, it coincides with the matrix introduced by Kashaev in [arXiv:1801.04632], which was recently proven to compute the Levine-Tristram signature and the Alexander polynomial of oriented links [arXiv:2311.01923, arXiv:2310.16729]. As a corollary, we obtain a multivariable extension of Kauffman's determinantal model of the Alexander polynomial, recovering a result of Zibrowius [arXiv:1601.04915v1].</description>

      <title>Trace field degrees in the Torelli group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that for $g\ge 2$, all integers $1 \le d \le 3g-3$ arise as trace field degrees of pseudo-Anosov mapping classes in the Torelli group of the closed orientable surface of genus $g$. Our method uses the Thurston-Veech construction of pseudo-Anosov maps, and we provide examples where the stretch factor has algebraic degree any even number between two and $6g-6$. This validates a claim by Thurston from the 1980s.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we describe the intersection between geodesic and conformal currents on closed hyperbolic three-manifolds.
  We use this to prove some sharp bounds which involve the Liouville entropy of a negatively curved metric, the minimal surface entropy, and the area ratio. Using these ideas we also give a new proof of the Mostow Rigidity Theorem in the three-dimensional case.</description>

      <title>Non-hyperbolic 3-manifolds and 3D field theories for 2D Virasoro minimal models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using 3D-3D correspondence, we construct 3D dual bulk field theories for general Virasoro minimal models $M(P,Q)$. These theories correspond to Seifert fiber spaces $S^2 ((P,R-P),(Q,-S),(3,1))$ with two integers $(R,S)$ satisfying $PS-QR =1$. In the unitary case, where $|P-Q|=1$, the bulk theory has a mass gap and flows to a unitary topological field theory (TQFT) in the IR, which is expected to support the chiral Virasoro minimal model at the boundary under an appropriate boundary condition. For the non-unitary case, where $|P-Q|&gt;1$, the bulk theory flows to a 3D $\mathcal{N}=4$ rank-0 superconformal field theory, whose topologically twisted theory supports the chiral minimal model at the boundary. We also provide a concrete field theory description of the 3D bulk theory using $T[SU(2)]$ theories. Our proposals are supported by various consistency checks using 3D-3D relations and direct computations of various partition functions.</description>

      <title>Salter's question on the image of the Burau representation of $B_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1974, Birman posed the question of under what conditions a matrix with Laurent polynomial entries is in the image of the Burau representation. In 1984, Squier observed that the matrices in the image are contained in a unitary group. In 2021, Salter formulated a specific question: whether the central quotient of the Burau image group is the central quotient of a certain subgroup of the unitary group. We solve this question negatively in the simplest nontrivial case, $n=3$, algorithmically constructing a counterexample.</description>

      <title>The Chern-Simons Functional Integral, Kauffman's Bracket Polynomial, and other link invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study Chern-Simons Gauge Theory in axial gauge on ${\mathbb R}^3.$ This theory has a quadratic Lagrangian and therefore expectations can be computed nonperturbatively by explicit formulas, giving an (unbounded) linear functional on a space of polynomial functions in the gauge fields, as a mathematically well-defined avatar of the formal functional integral. We use differential-geometric methods to extend the definition of this linear functional to expectations of products of Wilson loops corresponding to oriented links in ${\mathbb R}^3,$ and derive skein relations for them. In the case $G=SU(2)$ we show that these skein relations are closely related to those of the Kauffman bracket polynomial, which is closely related to the Jones polynomial. We also study the case of groups of higher rank. We note that in the absence of a cubic term in the action, there is no quantization condition on the coupling $\lambda,$ which can be any complex number. This is in line with the fact that the Jones polynomial, in contrast to the manifold invariants of Witten and Reshetikhin-Turaev, is defined for any value of the coupling. The appearance of the parameter $e^{\frac1{2\lambda}}$ in the expectations and skein relations is also natural. Likewise, the extension of the theory to noncompact groups presents no difficulties. Finally we show how computations similar to ours, but for gauge fields in two dimensions, yield the Goldman bracket.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by work of Dolgopyat and N\'andori, we establish a general method for upgrading limit theorems for Birkhoff sums and cocycles over dynamical systems to mixing limit theorems under mild ergodicity and hyperbolicity assumptions. Building on previous work of Al-Saqban and Forni, we apply this method to obtain mixing limit theorems for particular subbundles of the Kontsevich-Zorich cocycle. In forthcoming work of Arana-Herrera and Honaryar these results are applied to study the arithmetic/homological complexity of long simple closed geodesics on negatively curved surfaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the asymptotic behaviour of the cohomology of subgroups $\Gamma$ of an algebraic group $G$ with coefficients in the various irreducible rational representations of $G$ and raise a conjecture about it. Namely, we expect that the dimensions of these cohomology groups approximate the $\ell^2$-Betti numbers of $\Gamma$ with a controlled error term. We provide positive answers when $G$ is a product of copies of $SL_2$. As an application, we obtain new proofs of J. Lott's and W. L\"uck's computation of the $\ell^2$-Betti numbers of hyperbolic $3$-manifolds and W. Fu's upper bound on the growth of cusp forms for non totally real fields, which is sharp in the imaginary quadratic case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2101.05169v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This is a companion paper to an earlier work of the authors. In this paper, we provide an axiomatic definition of Floer homology for balanced sutured manifolds and prove that the graded Euler characteristic $\chi_{\rm gr}$ of this homology is fully determined by the axioms we proposed. As a result, we conclude that $\chi_{\rm gr}(SHI(M,\gamma))=\chi_{\rm gr}(SFH(M,\gamma))$ for any balanced sutured manifold $(M,\gamma)$. In particular, for any link $L$ in $S^3$, the Euler characteristic $\chi_{\rm gr}(KHI(S^3,L))$ recovers the multi-variable Alexander polynomial of $L$, which generalizes the knot case. Combined with the authors' earlier work, we provide more examples of $(1,1)$-knots in lens spaces whose $KHI$ and $\widehat{HFK}$ have the same dimension. Moreover, for a rationally null-homologous knot in a closed oriented 3-manifold $Y$, we construct canonical $\mathbb{Z}_2$-gradings on $KHI(Y,K)$, the decomposition of $I^\sharp(Y)$ discussed in the previous paper, and the minus version of instanton knot homology $\underline{\rm KHI}^-(Y,K)$ introduced by the first author.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2104.05984v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new `Thom class' formulation of topological T-duality for principal torus bundles. This definition is equivalent to the established one of Bunke, Rumpf, and Schick but has the virtue of removing the global assumptions on the H-flux required in the old definition. With the new definition, we provide easier and more transparent proofs of the classification of T-duals and generalise the local formulation of T-duality for circle bundles by Bunke, Schick, and Spitzweck to the torus case.</description>

Furthermore, we point out that the set of modular knots around any torus knot in $S^3$ together with the missing torus knot also obey the Chebotarev law, and deduce an equidistribution theorem for the classical Rademacher symbol.</description>

      <title>An enhanced Euler characteristic of sutured instanton homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.10490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.10490v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a balanced sutured manifold $(M,\gamma)$, we construct a decomposition of $SHI(M,\gamma)$ with respect to torsions in $H=H_1(M;\mathbb{Z})$, which generalizes the decomposition of $I^\sharp(Y)$ in previous work of the authors. This decomposition can be regarded as a candidate for the counterpart of the torsion spin$^c$ decompositions in $SFH(M,\gamma)$. Based on this decomposition, we define an enhanced Euler characteristic $\chi_{\rm en}(SHI(M,\gamma))\in\mathbb{Z}[H]/\pm H$ and prove that $\chi_{\rm en}(SHI(M,\gamma))=\chi(SFH(M,\gamma))$. This provides a better lower bound on $\dim_\mathbb{C}SHI(M,\gamma)$ than the graded Euler characteristic $\chi_{\rm gr}(SHI(M,\gamma))$. As applications, we prove instanton knot homology detects the unknot in any instanton L-space and show that the conjecture $KHI(Y,K)\cong \widehat{HFK}(Y,K)$ holds for all $(1,1)$-L-space knots and constrained knots in lens spaces, which include all torus knots and many hyperbolic knots in lens spaces.</description>

      <title>On elementary invariants of genus one knots and Seifert surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.04707v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This elementary article introduces easy-to-manage invariants of genus one knots in homology 3-spheres. To prove their invariance, we investigate properties of an invariant of 3-dimensional genus two homology handlebodies called the Alexander form. The Alexander form of a 3-manifold E with boundary contains all Reidemeister torsions of link exteriors obtained by attaching two-handles along the boundary of E. It is a useful tool for studying Alexander polynomials and Reidemeister torsions. We extract invariants of genus one Seifert surfaces from the Alexander form of their exteriors.</description>

      <title>On two-bridge ribbon knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07539v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that a two-bridge ribbon knot $K(m^2 , m k \pm 1)$ with $m &gt; k &gt;0$ and $(m,k)=1$ admits a symmetric union presentation with partial knot which is a two-bridge knot $K(m,k)$. Similar descriptions for all the other two-bridge ribbon knots are also given.</description>

      <title>Some Observations on projective Stiefel Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14207v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the upper characteristic rank of the projective Stiefel manifolds over $\mathbb R, \mathbb C$ and $\mathbb H$ and of the flip Stiefel manifolds. We provide bounds for the cup lengths of these spaces. We also provide necessary conditions for existence of $S^3$-map between quaternionic Stiefel manifolds using Fadell-Husseini index.</description>

      <title>Some Generalizations of Mirzakhani's Recursion and Masur-Veech Volumes via Topological Recursions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.14154v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Via Andersen-Borot-Orantin's geometric recursion, a twist of the topological recursion was proposed, and a recursion for the Masur-Veech polynomials was uncovered. The purpose of this article is to explore generalizations of Mirzakhani's recursion based on physical two-dimensional gravity models related to the Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity and to provide an introduction to various realizations of topological recursion. For generalized Mirzakhani's recursions involving a Masur-Veech type twist, we derive Virasoro constraints and cut-and-join equations, and also show some computations of generalized volumes for the physical two-dimensional gravity models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.13540v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we are concerned with free-abelian times surface groups, and show that they contain, up to isomorphism, infinitely many fixed subgroups of automorphisms. Moreover, we give a complete classification of their aut-fixed subgroups.</description>

      <title>Equivariant Topological T-Duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.06064v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological T-duality is a relationship between pairs (E, P ) over a fixed space X, where E over X is a principal torus bundle and P over E is a twist, such as a gerbe of principal PU(H)-bundle. This is of interest to topologists because of the T-duality transformation: a T-duality relation between pairs (E, P ) and (F, Q ) comes with an isomorphism (with degree shift) between the twisted K-theory of E and the twisted K-theory of F. We formulate topological T-duality in the equivariant setting, following the definition of Bunke, Rumpf, and Schick. We define the T-duality transformation in equivariant K-theory and show that it is an isomorphism for actions of compact Lie groups, equal to its own inverse and uniquely characterized by naturality and a normalization for trivial situations.</description>
