      <title>Evaporative damping in open system theory of Bose-Einstein Condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a new damping mechanism in the open quantum systems description of Bose-Einstein condensates. It stems from previously neglected terms in the derivation of the stochastic projective Gross-Pitaevskii equation (SPGPE), accounting for a nonlinear evaporation of particles from the coherent into the incoherent region. We demonstrate that the mechanism, while so far assumed to be of minor importance, is comparable in strength to the widely employed number damping. We also provide a simplified (pseudo)-local and a dimensionally reduced form of this evaporative damping. The process completes the SPGPE description of ultracold Bose gases giving a full first-principles picture of their evolution at finite temperature.</description>

      <title>Trion ordering in the attractive three-color Hubbard model on a $\pi$-flux square lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultracold multicomponent fermions (atoms/molecules) loaded in optical lattices provide an ideal platform for simulating SU($N$) Hubbard models that host unconventional many-body quantum states beyond SU(2). A prime example is the attractive three-color Hubbard model, in which trion states emerge at strong coupling. Nevertheless, much of its trion ordering on two-dimensional lattices remains uncertain. Here, we employ the determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) method to simulate the attractive three-color Hubbard model on a $\pi$-flux square lattice at half filling. We show that color-dependent attractive interaction can induce coexisting charge density wave (CDW) and N\'eel ordered states in the three-color $\pi$-flux Hubbard model. In particular, enhanced charge fluctuations (cf. honeycomb lattice) cause much stronger N\'eel ordering on the $\pi$-flux square lattice. The coexisting charge and N\'eel orders survive up to a melting temperature, at which they vanish simultaneously. The Ginzburg-Landau (GL) analysis on the coexistence of CDW and N\'eel orders demonstrates how color-dependent Hubbard interactions stabilize coexisting orders from the perspective of GL free energy principle.</description>

      <title>Quasiparticle spectra of mixtures of dipolar and non-dipolar condensates at zero and finite temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the low-lying collective quasiparticle modes of a quasi-one-dimensional mixture of Bose-Einstein condensates having dipolar and non-dipolar atomic species. The dipolar atomic species have permanent magnetic dipolar moments. We employ Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov theory to investigate the distinct collective spectra at zero and finite temperatures corresponding to phase separation phenomena stemming from the dipole-dipole interaction of dipolar atomic species. When the dipolar interaction is tuned to be repulsive, the number of zero-energy modes decreases, reflecting the system's tendency towards mixing. For a large number of atoms, we show that the attractive (repulsive) dipolar interaction strengths lead to ground states with non-dipolar (dipolar) atomic species at the periphery, and this leads to a discontinuity in quasiparticle mode evolution. We finally reveal that miscibility driven by thermal fluctuations at finite temperatures exhibits dipole mode hardening, confirmed by the loss of long-range phase coherence through the correlation function. The mode mixing in the dispersion relations ascertains a dipolar strength-dependent miscibility transition and the low-lying quasiparticle mode evolution.</description>

      <title>Multicomponent condensates: a flexible platform for soliton physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a series of experimental investigations on binary mixtures of Bose-Einstein condensates. Our focus lies on the regime where the interaction parameters place the system at the threshold of miscibility. We demonstrate that the dynamics of such mixtures can be effectively reduced to a single nonlinear equation. This framework is illustrated through the discussion of stable solitonic solutions in one and two dimensions. Furthermore, we show that employing a binary mixture enables exploration beyond the dynamics governed by the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation, allowing us to address other fundamental equations in nonlinear physics, such as the Landau-Lifshitz equation describing the motion of spin chains in ferromagnetic materials.</description>

      <title>Entanglement transition in unitary system-bath dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The evolution of a system coupled to baths is commonly described by a master equation that, in the long-time limit, yields a steady-state density matrix. However, when the same evolution is unraveled into quantum trajectories, it is possible to observe a transition in the scaling of entanglement within the system as the system-bath coupling increases - a phenomenon that is invisible in the trajectory-averaged reduced density matrix of the system. Here, we go beyond the paradigm of trajectories from master equations and explore whether a qualitatively analogous entanglement-scaling transition emerges in the unitary evolution of the combined system-bath setup. We investigate the scaling of entanglement in a unitary quantum setup composed of a 2D lattice of free fermions, where each site is coupled to a fermionic bath. Varying the system-bath coupling reveals a transition from logarithmic-law to area-law scaling, visible in the logarithmic fermionic negativity, mutual information, and also in the correlations. This occurs while the system's steady-state properties are trivial, highlighting that the signatures of these different scalings are within the bath-bath correlations.</description>

      <title>Interactions of electrons and Rydberg excitons in two-dimensional semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rydberg excitons in two-dimensional semiconductors provide sensitive and non-destructive probes of physics in proximal sample layers that host correlated electronic states. In particular, electron or hole doping of the sample layer is heralded by a strong frequency shift and loss of transition strength of 2s excitons in the sensor layer; these features have been attributed to the formation of a bound state of a 2s exciton and a remote electron. Through a theoretical analysis of exciton-electron scattering, we show that the experimental spectra can only be explained by electron-mediated hybridization of 2s, 2p and interlayer excitons, leading to a new type of many-body state which we term Rydberg attractive polaron. We anticipate that this new understanding will ensure a more accurate assessment of the signatures of correlated electrons in two dimensional materials.</description>

      <title>Absence of charged pion condensation in a magnetic field with parallel rotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the critical temperature of a relativistic Bose-Einstein condensate of charged bosons driven by rotation in a parallel magnetic field [Y. Liu and I. Zahed, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf120}, 032001 (2018)]. For non-interacting bosons, the critical temperature can only be determined for a system with fixed angular momentum. We find that the critical temperature of the non-interacting system vanishes due to the fact that the system is quasi-one-dimensional, indicating that non-interacting bosons cannot undergo Bose-Einstein condensation. For interacting bosons, we investigate a system with quartic self-interaction. We show that the order parameter vanishes and the off-diagonal long-range order is absent at any nonzero temperature because of the quasi-one-dimensional feature, in accordance with the Coleman-Mermin-Wagner-Hohenberg theorem.</description>

      <title>Trapped Fermions Through Kolmogorov-Arnold Wavefunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a variational Monte Carlo framework for trapped one-dimensional mixture of spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ fermions using Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KANs) to construct universal neural-network wavefunction ans\"atze. The method can, in principle, achieve arbitrary accuracy, limited only by the Monte Carlo sampling and was checked against exact results at sub-percent precision. For attractive interactions, it captures pairing effects, and in the impurity case it agrees with known results. We present a method of systematic transfer learning in the number of network parameters, allowing for efficient training for a target precision. We vastly increase the efficiency of the method by incorporating the short-distance behavior of the wavefunction into the ans\"atz without biasing the method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15163v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bogoliubov waves are fundamental excitations of Bose-Einstein Condensates (BECs). They emerge from a perturbed ground state and interact nonlinearly, triggering turbulent cascades. Here, we study turbulent BECs theoretically and numerically using the 3D Gross-Pitaevskii model and its associated wave-kinetic equations. We derive a new Kolmogorov-like stationary spectrum for short Bogoliubov waves and find a complete analytical expression for the spectrum in the long-wave acoustic regime. We then use our predictions to explain the BEC equation of state reported in [Dora et al. Nature 620,521 (2023)], and to suggest new experimental settings.</description>

      <title>Exploring light-induced phases of 2D materials in a modulated 1D quasicrystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11984v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Light-induced quantum phases offer the potential for simple and powerful tuning of material properties. For example, simply illuminating 2D materials in the integer quantum Hall regime with polarized light is predicted to drive quantum phase transitions. Such phenomena are largely beyond the current frontier of solid state experiments due to technical limitations on laser intensity and material purity. However, the Harper-Hofstadter mapping which relates a two-dimensional integer quantum Hall system to a 1D quasicrystal enables the same polarization-dependent light-induced phase transitions to be observed using a quantum gas in a driven quasiperiodic optical lattice. We report results of such an experiment. We observe an interlaced phase diagram of localization-delocalization phase transitions as a function of drive polarization and amplitude. Elliptically polarized driving can stabilize an extended critical phase featuring multifractal wavefunctions; we observe signatures of this phenomenon in anomalous polarization-dependent subdiffusive transport. In this regime, increasing the strength of the quasiperiodic potential can enhance rather than suppress transport. These experiments demonstrate a simple method for synthesizing exotic multifractal states and exploring light-induced quantum phases across different dimensionalities.</description>

      <title>Double Supersolid Phase in a Bosonic t-J-V Model with Rydberg Atoms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16820v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in Rydberg tweezer arrays bring novel opportunities for programmable quantum simulations beyond previous capabilities. In this work, we investigate a bosonic t-J-V model currently realized with Rydberg atoms. Through large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we uncover an emergent double supersolid (DSS) phase with the coexistence of two superfluids and crystalline order. Tunable long-range tunneling and repulsive hole-hole interactions enable a rich phase diagram featuring a double superfluid phase, a DSS phase, and an antiferromagnetic insulator. Intriguingly, within the DSS regime we observe an unconventional thermal enhancement of crystalline order. Our results establish the bosonic t-J-V model as a promising and experimentally accessible platform for exploring exotic quantum phases in Rydberg atom arrays.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21670v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM) predicts the spontaneous formation of topological defects in a continuous phase transition driven at a finite rate. We propose the generation of spontaneous quantum turbulence (SQT) via the KZM during Bose-Einstein condensation induced by a thermal quench. Using numerical simulations of the stochastic projected Gross-Pitaevskii equation in two spatial dimensions, we describe the formation of a newborn Bose-Einstein condensate proliferated by quantum vortices. We establish the nonequilibrium universality of SQT through the Kibble-Zurek and Kolmogorov scaling of the incompressible kinetic energy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21709v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a canonical formalism for computing quantum fluctuations of certain discrete degrees of freedom in systems governed by integrable partial differential equations with known Hamiltonian structure, provided these models are classical-field approximations of underlying many-body quantum systems. We then apply the formalism to both the 2-soliton and 3-soliton breather solutions of the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation, assuming the breathers are created from an initial elementary soliton by quenching the coupling constant. In particular, we compute the immediate post-quench quantum fluctuations in the positions, velocities, norms, and phases of the constituent solitons. For each case, we consider both the white-noise and correlated-noise models for the fluctuation vacuum state. Unlike previous treatments of the problem, our method allows for analytic solutions. Additionally, in the correlated-noise case, we consider the particle-number-conserving (also called $U(1)$-symmetry-conserving) Bogoliubov modes, i.e., modes with the proper correction to preserve the total particle number. We find that in most (but not all) cases, these corrections do not change the final result.</description>

      <title>Generalized Gibbs Ensemble from Eigenstate Entanglement Hamiltonian</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00939v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Relaxed quantum systems with conservation laws are believed to be approximated by the Generalized Gibbs Ensemble (GGE), which incorporates the constraints of certain conserved quantities serving as integrals of motion. By drawing an analogy between eigenstate reduced density matrix and GGE, we conjecture that a natural set of conserved quantities for GGE can emerge from the reduced density matrices of properly chosen eigenstates by the entanglement Hamiltonian superdensity matrix (EHSM) framework, and we demonstrate this explicitly for models mappable to free fermions. The framework proposes that such conserved quantities are linear superpositions of eigenstate entanglement Hamiltonians of a larger auxiliary system, where the eigenstates are Fock states occupying what we call the common eigenmodes, which remain eigenmodes when truncated within the physical subsystem. For 1D homogeneous free fermions with (anti-)periodic boundary conditions, which maps to 1D hardcore bosons with nearest neighbor hoppings, these conserved quantities lead to a non-Abelian GGE, which predicts the relaxation of both fermion and boson bilinears more accurately than the conventional Abelian GGE. Generalization of this framework may provide novel numerical insights for quantum integrability.</description>

      <title>Observation of quantum free fall and the consistency with the equivalence principle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14535v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The unification of quantum theory and the general theory of relativity - describing gravity, is one of the most important challenges in science. Einstein's general theory of relativity is based on the principle of equivalence, and has been confirmed to great accuracy for large bodies. However, in the quantum domain the equivalence principle has been predicted to take a unique form involving a gauge phase, equal to the quantum phase of a free-falling object. To measure this phase, we realize a novel cold-atom interferometer in which one wave-packet stays static in the laboratory frame while the other is in free fall. The observed relative-phase of the wave-packets confirms the predicted phase of a free-falling object, and shows that in our low energy regime, the equivalence principle may be applied to the quantum domain. Our observation constitutes a fundamental test of the interface between quantum theory and gravity. The new interferometer also opens the door for further probing of the latter interface, as well as to searches for new physics.</description>

Abstract: The narrow transition from the lowest rovibrational level of the $\mathrm{X}^{1}\Sigma^{+}$ electronic ground state to the lowest vibrational level of the $\mathrm{b}^{3}\Pi_{0}$ potential provides opportunities for achieving magic-wavelength trapping of ultracold bialkali molecules for enhancing their rotational coherence times. Guided by existing spectroscopic data of several perturbed and deeply-bound rovibrational states of the $\mathrm{A}^{1}\Sigma^{+}$ potential [Grochola et al., Chem. Phys. Lett., 2012, 535, 17-20], we conducted a targeted spectroscopic search and report the first observation of the lowest vibrational level of the $\mathrm{b}^{3}\Pi_{0}$ state in $^{6}\mathrm{Li}^{40}\mathrm{K}$. The transition frequency from $|\mathrm{X}^{1}\Sigma^{+},\,v=0,\,J=0&gt;$ to $|\mathrm{b}^{3}\Pi_{0},\,v'=0,\,J'=1&gt;$ is determined to be 314,230.5(5)GHz. Assisted by microwave spectroscopy, we resolved the rotational structure of $|\mathrm{b}^{3}\Pi_{0},\,v'=0&gt;$ and extracted a rotational constant of $h\times8.576(44)$ GHz for the $\mathrm{b}^{3}\Pi_{0}$ state. From this, we deducted an energy separation between $|\mathrm{b}^{3}\Pi_{0},v'=0,J'=0&gt;$ and $|\mathrm{X}^{1}\Sigma^{+},v=0,J=0&gt;$ of $hc\times$10,481.03(2) $\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$. Our work provides timely and precise information on the deeply-bound region of the $\mathrm{b}^{3}\Pi_{0}$ triplet excited potential of LiK, and benefits future applications of ultracold LiK isotopologues in quantum simulation and quantum computation that demand long coherence times.</description>

      <title>A Self Propelled Vortex Dipole Model on a Catenoid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00923v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate vortex dipoles on surfaces of variable negative curvature, focusing on a catenoid of arbitrary throat radius as a concrete example. We construct the effective dynamical system including mutual and geometric self-interaction terms and show that the resulting Hamiltonian dynamics makes dipoles follow catenoid geodesics, in agreement with recent works, Gustafsson (J. Nonlinear Sci. 32, 62, 2022) and by Drivas, Glukhovskiy and Khesin (Int. Math. Res. Not. 2024, 14, 10880-10894). We utilize the symplectic structure to find a conserved momentum map J related to the U(1) symmetry along the azimuthal direction. We verify the conservation of both the Hamiltonian and this momentum for arbitrary throat radius. We then demonstrate direct and exchange scattering of classical vortices on the catenoid, and we contrast this with the collective rotational motion (with azimuthal drift) that arises for chiral pairs. Finally, we build a finite-dipole dynamical system on the catenoid and show that the self-propulsion terms emerge to leading order in the dipole size. This provides a concrete realization, on a curved minimal surface, of the intuitive statement that a finite dipole propels orthogonal to the dipole axis, with a speed modulated by curvature.</description>
