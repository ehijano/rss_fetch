      <title>A Field Theory Framework of Incompressible Fluid Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study develops an effective theoretical framework that couples two vector fields: the velocity field $\mathbf{u}$ and an auxiliary vorticity field $\boldsymbol{\xi}$. Together, these fields form a larger conserved dynamical system. Within this framework, the incompressible Navier-Stokes (NS) equation and a complementary vorticity equation with negative viscosity are derived. By introducing the concept of light-cone vorticity $\boldsymbol{\eta}_\pm = \mathbf{w} \pm \boldsymbol{\xi}$, the paper constructs a unified framework for coupled dynamics. Furthermore, it explores the mechanism of spontaneous symmetry breaking from $SU(2)$ gauge theory to $U(1) \times U(1)$, which leads to the emergence of the coupled vector field theory in the non-relativistic limit. This approach uncovers a connection between fluid dynamics and fundamental gauge theories, suggesting that the NS equations describe a subsystem where dissipation results from energy transfer between the velocity and auxiliary fields. The study concludes by linking the complete dynamical framework to the Abrikosov-Nielsen-Olesen-Zumino (ANOZ) theory, a non-Abelian generalization of Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory, offering new insights into fluid dynamics and quantum fluid theory.</description>

      <title>Acoustothermal Effect: Mechanism and Quantification of the Heat Source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examined theoretically, experimentally and numerically the origin of the acoustothermal effect using a standing surface acoustic wave actuated sessile water droplet system. Despite a wealth of experimental studies and a few recent theoretical explorations, a profound understanding of the acoustothermal mechanism remains elusive. This study bridges the existing knowledge gap by pinpointing the fundamental causes of acoustothermal heating. Theory broadly applicable to any acoustofluidic system at arbitrary Reynolds numbers going beyond the regular perturbation analysis is presented. Relevant parameters responsible for the phenomenon are identified and an exact closed form expression delineating the underlining mechanism is presented. Furthermore, an analogy between the acoustothermal effect and electromagnetic heating is drawn, thereby deepening understanding of the acoustothermal process.</description>

      <title>Characterization of low-viscosity electrorheological fluids: Technical Issues and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electrorheological (ER) characterization of low-viscosity fluids is paramount for producing micro- and nanoscale products through electrohydrodynamic (EHD) techniques, such as EHD-jet printing, electrospray, and electrospinning. Key properties such as viscosity, surface tension, dielectric properties, electrical conductivity, and relaxation time significantly influence both the quality and properties of the final products and the efficiency of the industrial process. ER characterization is essential for studying the macroscopic effects of the interaction between these physicochemical properties under controlled flow kinematics. Researchers may face several technical challenges in performing rigorous ER characterization of low-viscosity fluids. This characterization is crucial for formulating inks compatible with the EHD process and for understanding fluid dynamics in EHD processes to ensure stable printing conditions and achieve high-resolution, accurate prints. This work highlights the inherent limitations of current ER cells and proposes methodologies to mitigate their impact on measurement accuracy. Furthermore, we explore the potential of microfluidic technologies to offer innovative solutions for the ER characterization of low-viscosity fluids.</description>

      <title>An assessment of event-based imaging velocimetry for online dimensionality reduction in turbulent flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the potential of neuromorphic EBV cameras for fast latent coordinate representation in turbulent flows. Unlike conventional imaging systems, EBV cameras asynchronously capture changes in temporal contrast at each pixel, delivering high-frequency output with reduced data bandwidth and enhanced sensitivity, particularly in low-light conditions. Pulsed EBIV is assessed against traditional PIV through two synchronized experiments: a submerged water jet and airflow around a square rib in a channel. The assessment includes a detailed comparison of flow statistics and spectral content, alongside an evaluation of reduced-order modeling capabilities using POD. The event stream from the EBV camera is converted into pseudo-snapshots, from which velocity fields are computed using standard PIV processing techniques. These fields are then compared after interpolation onto a common grid. Modal analysis demonstrates that EBIV can successfully identify dominant flow structures, along with their energy and dynamics, accurately discerning singular values, spatial modes, and temporal modes. While noise contamination primarily affects higher modes-less critical for flow control applications-overall performance remains robust. Additionally, comparisons of LOR validate EBIV's capability to provide reliable reduced-order models of turbulent flows, essential for flow control purposes. These findings position EBV sensors as a promising technology for real-time, imaging-based closed-loop flow control systems.</description>

      <title>Heat spots as structural elements of synoptic turbulence model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The large-scale dynamics of heat spots in a thin layer of incompressible rotating fluid under the action of Coriolis and gravity is considered to obtain a simple model of synoptic turbulence. The derivation of equations describing the evolution of the spots is based on the use of the variational principle, perturbation theory, and the assumption of geostrophic balance. Exact solutions with piecewise constant contour curvature are found. The simplest of them look like circular spots that move with constant velocity depending on their radius. More complex solutions, such as ``loop solitons'', are shown to have fractal structure and are constructed by the gluing method. Heat spots can act as structural elements of turbulence. In particular, we show that the spectral energy density for the velocity field of a random ensemble of heat spots has the power asymptotics $E\propto k^{\alpha}$ with exponents $\alpha=2$ at $k\bar{R}&lt;1$, and $\alpha=-1$ at $k\bar{R}&gt;1$, where $\bar{R}$ is the average (over ensemble) radius of spot.</description>

      <title>Multi-Group Maximum Entropy Method: Modeling Translational Non-Equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The most rigorous physical description of non-equilibrium gas dynamics is rooted in the numerical solution of the Boltzmann equation. Yet, the large number of degrees of freedom and the wide range of both spatial and temporal scales render these equations intractable for many relevant problems. This study constructs a reduced-order model for the Boltzmann equation, by combining coarse-graining modeling framework with the maximum entropy principle. This is accomplished by projecting the high-dimensional Boltzmann equation onto a carefully chosen lower-dimensional subspace, resulting from the discretization of the velocity space into sub-volumes. Within each sub-volume, the distribution function is reconstructed through the maximum entropy principle, ensuring compliance with the detailed balance. The resulting set of conservation equations comprises mass, momentum, and energy for each sub-volume, allowing for flexibility in the description of the velocity distribution function. This new set of governing equations, while retaining many of the mathematical characteristics of the conventional Navier-Stokes equations far outperforms them in terms of applicability. The proposed methodology is applied to the Bhatnagar, Gross, and Krook (BGK) formulation of the Boltzmann equation. To validate the model's accuracy, we simulate the non-equilibrium relaxation of a gas under spatially uniform conditions. Additionally, the model is used to analyze the shock structure of a 1-D standing shockwave across an extensive range of Mach numbers. Notably, both the non-equilibrium velocity distribution functions and macroscopic metrics derived from our model align remarkably with the direct solutions of the Boltzmann equation.</description>

      <title>A geometric characterization of steady laminar flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the steady states of the Euler equations on the periodic channel or annulus. We show that if these flows are laminar (layered by closed non-contractible streamlines which foliate the domain), then they must be either parallel or circular flows. We also show that a large subset of these shear flows are isolated from non-shear stationary states. For Poiseuille flow, $(v(y),0)=(y^2,0)$, our result shows that all stationary solutions in a sufficiently small $C^2$ neighborhood are shear flows. We then show that if $v(y)=y^n$ with $n \geq 1$, then in any $C^{n-}$ neighborhood, there exist smooth non-shear steady states, traveling waves, and quasiperiodic solutions of any number of non-commensurate frequencies. This proves the rigidity near Poiseuille is sharp. Finally, we prove that on general compact doubly connected domains, laminar steady Euler flows with constant velocity on the boundary must also be either parallel or circular, and the domain a periodic channel or an annulus. This shows that laminar free boundary Euler solutions must have Euclidean symmetry.</description>

      <title>Modeling sea ice in the marginal ice zone as a dense granular flow with rheology inferred from discrete element model data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08123v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The marginal ice zone (MIZ) represents the periphery of the sea ice cover. In this region, the macroscale behavior of the sea ice results from collisions and enduring contact between ice floes. This configuration closely resembles that of dense granular flows, which have been modeled successfully with the $\mu(I)$ rheology. Here, we present a continuum model based on the $\mu(I)$ rheology which treats sea ice as a compressible fluid, with the local sea ice concentration given by a dilatancy function $\Phi(I)$. We infer expressions for $\mu(I)$ and $\Phi(I)$ by nonlinear regression using data produced with a discrete element method (DEM) which considers polygonal-shaped ice floes. We do this by driving the sea ice with a one-dimensional shearing ocean current. The resulting continuum model is a nonlinear system of equations with the sea ice velocity, local concentration, and pressure as unknowns. The rheology is given by the sum of a plastic and a viscous term. In the context of a periodic patch of ocean, which is effectively a one dimensional problem, and under steady conditions, we prove this system to be well-posed, present a numerical algorithm for solving it, and compare its solutions to those of the DEM. These comparisons demonstrate the continuum model's ability to capture most of the DEM's results accurately. The continuum model is particularly accurate for ocean currents faster than 0.25 m/s; however, for low concentrations and slow ocean currents, the continuum model is less effective in capturing the DEM results. In the latter case, the lack of accuracy of the continuum model is found to be accompanied by the breakdown of a balance between the average shear stress and the integrated ocean drag extracted from the DEM.</description>

      <title>Air jet impact craters on granular surfaces: a universal scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04988v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Craters form as the lander's exhaust interacts with the planetary surfaces. Understanding this phenomenon is imperative to ensure safe landings. We investigate crater morphology, where a turbulent air jet impinges on the granular surfaces. To reveal the fundamental aspect of this phenomenon, systematic experiments are performed with various air jet velocities, nozzle positions, and grain properties. The resultant crater morphology is characterized by an aspect ratio. We find a universal scaling law in which the aspect ratio is scaled by the dimensionless variable consisting of air velocity at the nozzle, speed of sound in air, nozzle diameter, nozzle tip distance from the surface, grain diameter, the density of grains, and density of air. The obtained scaling reveals the crossover of the length scales governing crater aspect ratio, providing a useful guideline for ensuring safe landings. Moreover, we report a novel drop shaped subsurface cratering phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Interpretable A-posteriori Error Indication for Graph Neural Network Surrogate Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07548v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data-driven surrogate modeling has surged in capability in recent years with the emergence of graph neural networks (GNNs), which can operate directly on mesh-based representations of data. The goal of this work is to introduce an interpretability enhancement procedure for GNNs, with application to unstructured mesh-based fluid dynamics modeling. Given a black-box baseline GNN model, the end result is an interpretable GNN model that isolates regions in physical space, corresponding to sub-graphs, that are intrinsically linked to the forecasting task while retaining the predictive capability of the baseline. These structures identified by the interpretable GNNs are adaptively produced in the forward pass and serve as explainable links between the baseline model architecture, the optimization goal, and known problem-specific physics. Additionally, through a regularization procedure, the interpretable GNNs can also be used to identify, during inference, graph nodes that correspond to a majority of the anticipated forecasting error, adding a novel interpretable error-tagging capability to baseline models. Demonstrations are performed using unstructured flow field data sourced from flow over a backward-facing step at high Reynolds numbers, with geometry extrapolations demonstrated for ramp and wall-mounted cube configurations.</description>
