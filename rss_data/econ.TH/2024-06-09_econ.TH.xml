      <title>Network Threshold Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the general class of games where agents: (1) are embedded on a network, (2) have two possible actions, and (3) these actions are strategic complements. We use a measure of network cohesiveness -- the k-core -- to provide a novel characterisation of the equilibria. After transforming the network appropriately, the k-core fully describes both the minimal and maximal equilibria, and also provides a partial characterisation of all others. This framework is also the binary action version of the large class of network games with strategic complements and continuous actions.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Exit Queues for Proof-of-Stake Blockchains: A Mechanism Design Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus protocols have provable safety and liveness properties for static validator sets. In practice, however, the validator set changes over time, potentially eroding the protocol's security guarantees. For example, systems with accountable safety may lose some of that accountability over time as adversarial validators exit. As a result, protocols must rate limit entry and exit so that the set changes slowly enough to ensure security. Here, the system designer faces a fundamental trade-off. Slower exits increase friction, making it less attractive to stake in the first place. Faster exits provide more utility to stakers but weaken the protocol's security.
  This paper provides the first systematic study of exit queues for Proof-of-Stake blockchains. Given a collection of validator-set consistency constraints imposed by the protocol, the social planner's goal is to provide a constrained-optimal mechanism that minimizes disutility for the participants. We introduce the MINSLACK mechanism, a dynamic capacity first-come-first-served queue in which the amount of stake that can exit in a period depends on the number of previous exits and the consistency constraints. We show that MINSLACK is optimal when stakers equally value the processing of their withdrawal. When stakers values are heterogeneous, the optimal mechanism resembles a priority queue with dynamic capacity. However, this mechanism must reserve exit capacity for the future in case a staker with a much higher need for liquidity arrives. We conclude with a survey of known consistency constraints and highlight the diversity of existing exit mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Coherent Distorted Beliefs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.09879v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many models of economics assume that individuals distort objective probabilities. We propose a simple consistency condition on distortion functions, which we term distortion coherence, that ensures that the function commutes with conditioning on an event. We show that distortion coherence restricts belief distortions to have a particular function form: power-weighted distortions, where distorted beliefs are proportional to the original beliefs raised to a power and weighted by a state-specific value. We generalize our findings to allow for distortions of the probabilities assigned to both states and signals, which nests the functional forms widely used in studying probabilistic biases (e.g., Grether, 1980 and Benjamin, 2019). We show how coherent distorted beliefs are tightly related to several extant models of motivated beliefs: they are the outcome of maximizing anticipated expected utility subject to a generalized Kullback-Liebler cost of distortion. Moreover, in the domain of lottery choice, we link coherent distortions to explanations of non-expected utility like the Allais paradox: individuals who maximize subjective expected utility maximizers conditional on coherent distorted beliefs are equivalent to the weighted utility maximizers studied by Chew [1983].</description>
