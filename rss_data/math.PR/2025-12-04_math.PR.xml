      <title>Invariant measures for the open KPZ equation: an analytic perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ergodic theory of the open KPZ equation has seen significant progress in recent years, with explicit invariant measures described in a series of works by Corwin--Knizel, Barraquand--Le Doussal, and Bryc--Kuznetsov--Wang--Weso{\l}owski. In this paper, we provide a stochastic analytic proof of the formula for the invariant measures. Our approach starts from the Gaussian invariant measure for the case of homogeneous boundary conditions. We approximate the inhomogeneous problem by a homogeneous one with a singular boundary potential. Using tools including change of measure, time reversal for Markov processes, and It\^o's formula, we then reduce the problem to analyzing the KPZ nonlinearity in a thin boundary layer. Finally, using the theory of regularity structures, we establish a central limit theorem for the time-integrated nonlinearity near the boundary, which completes the proof of the invariance. Although it is known that different boundary parameters give rise to distinct physical regimes for the invariant measures, our method is robust and does not rely on any particular choice of boundary parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a family of infinite-dimensional reduced Heisenberg groups which can be viewed as infinite-dimensional homogeneous spaces. Such a space is an analogue of finite-dimensional reduced Heisenberg groups in infinite dimensions. We study properties of the hypoelliptic heat kernel measure on this space, including hypoelliptic logarithmic Sobolev inequalities there.</description>

      <title>Tridiagonal random matrices, an analytic approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the limiting distribution of the eigenvalues for random tridiagonal matrix models. The limiting distribution is well described by its moments. Here, an analytical approach allows us, as in the case of Wigner matrices, to relax the assumptions on the random variables. With this method, we proved the convergence of the spectral distribution under an assumption on the second moment. We discuss also about an algebraic approach for the tridiagonal models, which are more complicated than the classic freeness.</description>

      <title>A dynamic competitive equilibrium model of irreversible capacity investment with stochastic demand and heterogeneous producers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate a continuous-time competitive equilibrium model of irreversible capacity investment in which a continuum of heterogeneous producers supplies a single non-durable good subject to exogenous stochastic demand. Each producer optimally adjusts both output and capacity over time in response to endogenous price signals, while investment decisions are irreversible. Market clearing holds continuously, with prices evolving endogenously to balance aggregate supply and demand through a constant-elasticity demand function driven by a stochastic base component. The model admits a mean-field interpretation, as each producer's decisions both influence and are influenced by the aggregate behaviour of all others. We show that the equilibrium price process can be expressed as a nonlinear functional of the exogenous base demand, leading to a three-dimensional singular stochastic control problem for each producer. We derive an explicit solution to the associated Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, including a closed-form characterisation of the free-boundary surface separating investment and waiting regions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Smoluchowski-Kramers approximation in rough path topology with state-dependent damping is explored. The second-order Langevin equation has a form of fast-slow system after suitable change-of-variable, and then its solution is lifted as a rough path in a natural manner. Moment estimates of both the original path and the lift are given, followed by which, averaging technique and convergence theorem in rough path topology are used to pass the limit.</description>

      <title>Convergence of Random Walks in $\ell_p$-Spaces of Growing Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the limit theorem for paths of random walks with $n$ steps in $\mathbb{R}^d$ as $n$ and $d$ both go to infinity. For this, the paths are viewed as finite metric spaces equipped with the $\ell_p$-metric for $p\in[1,\infty)$. Under the assumptions that all components of each step are uncorrelated, centered, have finite $2p$-th moments, and are identically distributed, we show that such random metric space converges in probability to a deterministic limit space with respect to the Gromov-Hausdorff distance. This result generalises earlier work by Kabluchko and Marynych for $p=2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a novel type of connection between random walks and analytic number theory. Working with a random walk on the circle group $\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}$ in which each step is a random integer multiple of a given quadratic irrational $\alpha$, we show that the rate of convergence to uniformity in the quadratic Wasserstein metric (also known as the periodic $L^2$ discrepancy) is governed by deep arithmetic invariants of the ring of algebraic integers of the real quadratic field $\mathbb{Q}(\alpha)$, such as fundamental units and special values of zeta functions.</description>

      <title>CFO-Robust Detection for 5G PRACH under Fading Channels: Analytical Modeling and Performance Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Physical Random Access Channel (PRACH) is essential for initial access and synchronization in both 5G and future 6G networks; however, its detection is highly sensitive to impairments such as high user density, large carrier frequency offset (CFO), and fast fading. Although prior studies have examined PRACH detection, they are often restricted to specific scenarios or lack a comprehensive analytical characterization of performance. We introduce a unified analytical framework that characterizes the statistical distribution of the received power delay profile (PDP) under flat Rayleigh fading and supports both coherent combining (CC) and power combining (PC) repetition strategies. For each strategy, we derive optimal threshold expressions and closed-form detection probabilities. Furthermore, we analyze two key cases depending on the coherence time: identical and independent channel realizations per repetition. Secondly, we exploit the correlation induced by CFO across cyclic shifts to design a novel low-complexity detector that exploits PDP dependencies. Numerical results indicate that PC outperforms CC when repetitions experience independent channels, while CC can be preferable under identical realizations in limited settings. On the other hand, the proposed CFO-aware detector delivers improved robustness under severe CFO conditions.</description>

      <title>Permanental rank versus determinantal rank of random matrices over finite fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is motivated by basic complexity and probability questions about permanents of random matrices over finite fields, and in particular, about properties separating the permanent and the determinant. Fix $q = p^m$ some power of an odd prime, and let $k \leq n$ both be growing. For a uniformly random $n \times k$ matrix $A$ over $\mathbb{F}_q$, we study the probability that all $k \times k$ submatrices of $A$ have zero permanent; namely that $A$ does not have full "permanental rank". When $k = n$, this is simply the probability that a random square matrix over $\mathbb{F}_q$ has zero permanent, which we do not understand. We believe that the probability in this case is $\frac{1}{q} + o(1)$, which would be in contrast to the case of the determinant, where the answer is $\frac{1}{q} + \Omega_q(1)$. Our main result is that when $k$ is $O(\sqrt{n})$, the probability that a random $n \times k$ matrix does not have full permanental rank is essentially the same as the probability that the matrix has a $0$ column, namely $(1 +o(1)) \frac{k}{q^n}$. In contrast, for determinantal (standard) rank the analogous probability is $\Theta(\frac{q^k}{q^n})$. At the core of our result are some basic linear algebraic properties of the permanent that distinguish it from the determinant.</description>

      <title>Novelty detection on path space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We frame novelty detection on path space as a hypothesis testing problem with signature-based test statistics. Using transportation-cost inequalities of Gasteratos and Jacquier (2023), we obtain tail bounds for false positive rates that extend beyond Gaussian measures to laws of RDE solutions with smooth bounded vector fields, yielding estimates of quantiles and p-values. Exploiting the shuffle product, we derive exact formulae for smooth surrogates of conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) in terms of expected signatures, leading to new one-class SVM algorithms optimising smooth CVaR objectives. We then establish lower bounds on type-$\mathrm{II}$ error for alternatives with finite first moment, giving general power bounds when the reference measure and the alternative are absolutely continuous with respect to each other. Finally, we evaluate numerically the type-$\mathrm{I}$ error and statistical power of signature-based test statistic, using synthetic anomalous diffusion data and real-world molecular biology data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In financial and actuarial research, distortion and Haezendonck-Goovaerts risk measures are attractive due to their strong properties. They have so far been treated separately. In this paper, following a suggestion by Goovaerts, Linders, Van Weert, and Tank, we introduce and study a new class of risk measure that encompasses the distortion and Haezendonck-Goovaerts risk measures, aptly called the distortion Haezendonck-Goovaerts risk measures. They will be defined on a larger space than the space of bounded risks. We provide situations where these new risk measures are coherent, and explore their risk theoretic properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work is concerned with the numerical approximation of the two-dimensional stochastic Navier-Stokes equation with transport noise and no-slip boundary conditions on a convex polygonal domain. The analysis is challenged by the solution's low spatial regularity and the non-Lipschitz nonlinearity. We derive a convergence rate in the mean-square sense for a spatial semidiscretization. Furthermore, for the full discretization, we prove convergence in probability and establish an explicit rate with respect to the time step.</description>

      <title>Optimal Transportation and Alignment Between Gaussian Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optimal transport (OT) and Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) alignment provide interpretable geometric frameworks for comparing, transforming, and aggregating heterogeneous datasets -- tasks ubiquitous in data science and machine learning. Because these frameworks are computationally expensive, large-scale applications often rely on closed-form solutions for Gaussian distributions under quadratic cost. This work provides a comprehensive treatment of Gaussian, quadratic cost OT and inner product GW (IGW) alignment, closing several gaps in the literature to broaden applicability. First, we treat the open problem of IGW alignment between uncentered Gaussians on separable Hilbert spaces by giving a closed-form expression up to a quadratic optimization over unitary operators, for which we derive tight analytic upper and lower bounds. If at least one Gaussian measure is centered, the solution reduces to a fully closed-form expression, which we further extend to an analytic solution for the IGW barycenter between centered Gaussians. We also present a reduction of Gaussian multimarginal OT with pairwise quadratic costs to a tractable optimization problem and provide an efficient algorithm to solve it using a rank-deficiency constraint. To demonstrate utility, we apply our results to knowledge distillation and heterogeneous clustering on synthetic and real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>The time fractional stochastic partial differential equations with non-local operator on $\mathbb{R}^{d}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates a class of time-fractional stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) on $\mathbb{R}^d$, driven by both Gaussian and L\'{e}vy space-time white noises. The equation involves Caputo time-derivatives of orders $\alpha, \sigma_1, \sigma_2$ and a non-local operator $\phi(\Delta)$ generated by a Bernstein function $\phi$. We first establish the local existence and uniqueness of mild solutions in the $L_p$-framework for $1 \leq p \leq 2$. For the case $p &gt; 2$, where the $L_p$-theory fails, we develop a Sobolev space framework based on the scales of Besov and Triebel--Lizorkin spaces associated with $\phi(\Delta)$. Within this setting, we prove the solvability and regularity of weak solutions. Our analysis relies on detailed estimates of the fundamental solutions, stochastic convolutions, Littlewood--Paley theory, and a fixed point argument. The results presented here extend and unify several previous works on fractional SPDEs by incorporating a general class of non-local operators and L\'{e}vy noises.</description>

      <title>Classification of diffusion processes in dimension $d$ via the Carleman approach with applications to models involving additive, multiplicative or square-root noises</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Carleman approach is well-known in the field of deterministic classical dynamics as a method to replace a finite number $d$ of non-linear differential equations by an infinite-dimensional linear system. Here this approach is applied to a system of $d$ stochastic differential equations for $[x_1(t),..,x_d(t)]$ when the forces and the diffusion-matrix elements are polynomials, in order to write the linear system governing the dynamics of the averaged values ${\mathbb E} ( x_1^{n_1}(t) x_2^{n_2}(t) ... x_d^{n_d}(t) )$ labelled by the $d$ integers $(n_1,..,n_d)$. The natural decomposition of the Carleman matrix into blocks associated to the global degree $n=n_1+n_2+..+n_d$ is useful to identify the models that have the simplest spectral decompositions in the bi-orthogonal basis of right and left eigenvectors. This analysis is then applied to models with a single noise per coordinate, that can be either additive or multiplicative or square-root, or with two types of noises per coordinate, with many examples in dimensions $d=1,2$. In $d=1$, the Carleman matrix governing the dynamics of the moments ${\mathbb E} ( x^{n}(t) )$ is diagonal for the Geometric Brownian motion, while it is lower-triangular for the family of Pearson diffusions containing the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck and the Square-Root processes, as well as the Kesten, the Fisher-Snedecor and the Student processes that converge towards steady states with power-law-tails. In dimension $d=2$, the Carleman matrix governing the dynamics of the correlations ${\mathbb E} ( x_1^{n_1}(t) x_2^{n_2}(t) )$ has a natural decomposition into blocks associated to the global degree $n=n_1+n_2$, and we discuss the simplest models where the Carleman matrix is either block-diagonal or block-lower-triangular or block-upper-triangular.</description>

Abstract: We consider the question of showing a log-Sobolev inequality for the Gibbs measure of the focusing Schr\"odinger equation built by Lebowitz-Rose-Speer (1988), formally given by
  $$ d\rho \propto \exp\big(\frac 1 p\int_{\mathbb T} |u|^p d x - \frac 12\int_{\mathbb T} |\nabla u|^2 d x - \frac 12\int_{\mathbb T} |u|^2 d x\big) \mathbf 1_{\| u \|_{L^2(\mathbb T)}^2 \le K}dud\overline{u}. $$
  When $2 \le p \le 4$, we show that these measures indeed satisfy a log-Sobolev inequality. When $p&gt; 4$, we show a lower bound for the Hessian of the potential, which implies that the known techniques to show these inequalities cannot apply to the measure $\rho$.</description>

      <title>Bounded-degree graphs of non-negative Ollivier-Ricci curvature have subexponential growth and diffusive random walk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the geometric properties of graphs with non-negative Ollivier-Ricci curvature, a discrete analogue of non-negative Ricci curvature in Riemannian geometry. We prove that for each $d&lt;\infty$ there exists a constant $C_d$ such that if $G=(V,E)$ is a finite graph with non-negative Ollivier-Ricci curvature and with degrees bounded by $d$ then the average log-volume growth and random walk displacement satisfy \[
  \frac{1}{|V|} \sum_{x\in V} \log \#B(x,r) \leq \exp\left[C_d \sqrt{\log r}\right] = r^{o(1)} \] and \[
  \frac{1}{|V|} \sum_{x\in V} \mathbf{E}_x [d(X_0,X_n)^2] \leq n \exp\left[C_d \sqrt{\log n}\right] = n^{1+o(1)} \] for every $n,r\geq 2$. This significantly strengthens a result of Salez (GAFA 2022), who proved that the average displacement of the random walk is $o(n)$ and deduced that non-negatively curved graphs of bounded degree cannot be expanders. Our results also apply to infinite transitive graphs and, more generally, to bounded-degree unimodular random rooted graphs of non-negative Ollivier-Ricci curvature.</description>

      <title>A Strict Comparison Principle for Integro-Differential Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman Equations on Domains with Boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work provides a comparison principle for viscosity solutions to boundary value problems on (partially) bounded, cylindrical spaces. The comparison principle is based on a test function framework, that allows for the simultaneous treatment of diffusive as well as jump terms. Estimates in the proof of the comparison principle incorporate the use of Lyapunov functions that act as growth bounds for the solutions, effectively yielding a theory for unbounded viscosity solutions. We apply the results to a wide class of parabolic equations and elliptic problems on a space with corners.</description>

      <title>Moderate deviations in first-passage percolation for bounded weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12797v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the moderate and large deviations in first-passage percolation (FPP) with bounded weights on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ for $d \geq 2$. Write $T(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y})$ for the first-passage time and denote by $\mu(\mathbf{u})$ the time constant in direction $\mathbf{u}$. In this paper, we establish that, if one assumes that the sublinear error term $T(\mathbf{0}, N\mathbf{u}) - N\mu(\mathbf{u})$ is of order $N^\chi$, then under some unverified (but widely believed) assumptions, for $\chi &lt; a &lt; 1$, \begin{align*}
  &amp;\mathbb{P}\bigl(T(\mathbf{0}, N\mathbf{u}) &gt; N\mu(\mathbf{u}) + N^a\bigr) = \exp{\Big(-\,N^{\frac{d(1+o(1))}{1-\chi}(a-\chi)}\Big)},\end{align*} \begin{align*}
  &amp;\mathbb{P}\bigl(T(\mathbf{0}, N\mathbf{u}) &lt; N\mu(\mathbf{u}) - N^a\bigr) = \exp{\Big(-\,N^{\frac{1+o(1)}{1-\chi}(a-\chi)}\Big)}, \end{align*} with accompanying estimates in the borderline case $a=1$. Moreover, the exponents $\frac{d}{1-\chi}$ and $\frac{1}{1-\chi}$ also appear in the asymptotic behavior near $0$ of the rate functions for upper and lower tail large deviations. Notably, some of our estimates are established rigorously without relying on any unverified assumptions. Our main results highlight the interplay between fluctuations and the decay rates of large deviations, and bridge the gap between these two regimes.
  A key ingredient of our proof is an improved concentration via multi-scale analysis for several moderate deviation estimates, a phenomenon that has previously appeared in the contexts of two-dimensional last-passage percolation and two-dimensional rotationally invariant FPP.</description>

      <title>Frog model on $\mathbb{Z}$ with random survival parameter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09766v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the frog model on \( \mathbb{Z} \) with geometric lifetimes, introducing a random survival parameter. Active and inactive particles are placed at the vertices of \( \mathbb{Z} \). The lifetime of each active particle follows a geometric random variable with parameter \( 1-p \), where \( p \) is randomly sampled from a distribution \( \pi \). Each active particle performs a simple random walk on \( \mathbb{Z} \) until it dies, activating any inactive particles it encounters along its path. In contrast to the usual case where \( p \) is fixed, we show that there exist non-trivial distributions \( \pi \) for which the model survives with positive probability. More specifically, for $\pi\sim Beta(\alpha,\beta)$, we establish the existence of a critical value \( \beta=0.5 \), that separates almost sure extinction from survival with positive probability. Furthermore, we show that the model is recurrent whenever it survives with positive probability.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Analysis of the Total Quasi-Steady State Approximation for the Michaelis--Menten Enzyme Kinetic Reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20145v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a stochastic model of the Michaelis-Menten (MM) enzyme kinetic reactions in terms of Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) driven by Poisson Random Measures (PRMs). It has been argued that among various Quasi-Steady State Approximations (QSSAs) for the deterministic model of such chemical reactions, the total QSSA (tQSSA) is the most accurate approximation, and it is valid for a wider range of parameter values than the standard QSSA (sQSSA). While the sQSSA for this model has been rigorously derived from a probabilistic perspective at least as early as 2006 in Ball et al. (2006), a rigorous study of the tQSSA for the stochastic model appears missing. We fill in this gap by deriving it as a Functional Law of Large Numbers (FLLN), and also studying the fluctuations around this approximation as a Functional Central Limit Theorem (FCLT).</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we prove that under the domination condition: \begin{equation*} {\cal{E}}^{-\mu,-\nu}[-\xi|{\cal{F}}_t]\leq\rho_t(\xi)\leq{\cal{E}}^{\mu,\nu}[-\xi|{\cal{F}}_t],\quad \forall\xi\in \mathcal{L}^{\exp}_T\ (\text{resp.}\ L^2(\mathcal{F}_T)),\ \forall t\in[0,T], \end{equation*} where ${\cal{E}}^{\mu,\nu}$ is the $g$-expectation with generator $\mu|z|+\nu|z|^2, \mu\geq0, \nu\geq0$, the dynamic convex (resp. coherent) risk measure $\rho$ admits a representation as a $g$-expectation, whose generator $g$ is convex (resp. sublinear) in the variable $z$ and has a quadratic (resp. linear) growth. As an application, we show that such dynamic convex (resp. coherent) risk measure $\rho$ admits a dual representation, where the penalty term (resp. the set of probability measures) is characterized by the corresponding generator $g$.</description>

      <title>Finite free probability and $S$ transforms of Jacobi processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02758v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the $S$ transforms of Jacobi processes in the frameworks of free and finite free probability theories. We begin by deriving a partial differential equation satisfied by the free $S$ transform of the free Jacobi process, and we provide a detailed analysis of its characteristic curves. We turn next our attention to the averaged characteristic polynomial of the Hermitian Jacobi process and to the dynamic of its roots, referred to as the \emph{frozen Jacobi process}. In particular, we prove, for a specific set of parameters, that the former aligns up to a Szeg\"o variable transformation with the Hermite unitary polynomial. We also provide an expansion of the averaged characteristic polynomial of the Hermitian process in the basis of Jacobi polynomials. Finally, we establish the convergence of the frozen Jacobi process to the free Jacobi process in high dimensions by using the finite free S transform. In doing so, we prove a general result, interesting in its own, on the convergence of the finite differences of the finite free $S$ transform, which paves the way to obtain asymptotics of differential-difference equations satisfied by time-dependent finite free S-transforms of polynomial sequences with positive roots.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a spoke-arc decomposition of non-crossing annular pair partitions $NC_2(p,q)$ that records spoke type and orientation, isolates spoke-level contributions, and factorizes the dependence on the ellipticity parameter $\gamma$ into a spoke factor and arc weights. This yields closed-form descriptions of the limiting covariance of Gaussian elliptic matrices. As a corollary, we show that an independent family of Gaussian elliptic random matrices is asymptotically second-order free.</description>

Abstract: The mixed fractional Brownian motion, the sum of independent fractional and standard Brownian motions, is known to be a semimartingale if the Hurst exponent $H$ of its fractional component is greater than $3/4$.

      <description>arXiv:2512.02250v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a new proof of the abstract random tensor estimate. This estimate was initially proven by Deng, Nahmod, and Yue (2022) using the moment method. The key new tool in our proof is the direct use of the non-commutative Khintchine inequality with the probabilistic decoupling of the product of Gaussians. Hermite and generalized Laguerre-type polynomials allow us to account for pairings in the real and complex-valued Gaussians, respectively, and remove the square-free (tetrahedral) requirement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13501v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new class of first passage time optimization driven by threshold resetting, inspired by many natural processes where crossing a critical limit triggers failure, degradation or transition. In here, search agents are collectively reset when a threshold is reached, creating event-driven, system-coupled simultaneous resets that induce long-range interactions. We develop a unified framework to compute search times for these correlated stochastic processes, with ballistic- and diffusive- searchers as key examples uncovering diverse optimization behaviors. A cost function, akin to breakdown penalties, reveals that optimal resetting can forestall larger losses. This formalism generalizes to broader stochastic systems with multiple degrees of freedom.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the existence and uniqueness of solutions to a class of non-Lipschitz G-BSDEs and the corresponding stochastic recursive optimal control problem. More precisely, we suppose that the generator of G-BSDE is uniformly continuous and monotonic with respect to the first unknown variable. Using the comparison theorem for G-BSDE and the stability of viscosity solutions, we establish the dynamic programming principle and the connection between the value function and the viscosity solution of the associated Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation.We provide an example of continuous time Epstein-Zin utility to demonstrate the application of our study.</description>

      <title>Markov Chains Approximate Message Passing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.02384v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms have long been observed to obtain near-optimal performance in various Bayesian inference settings. However, developing a supporting theory that makes these studies rigorous has proved challenging.
  In this paper, we study the classical spiked Wigner inference problem, where one aims to recover a planted Boolean spike from a noisy matrix measurement. We relate the recovery performance of Glauber dynamics on the annealed posterior to the performance of Approximate Message Passing (AMP), which is known to achieve Bayes-optimal performance. Our main results rely on the analysis of an auxiliary Markov chain called restricted Gaussian dynamics (RGD). Concretely, we establish the following results:
  1. RGD can be reduced to an effective one-dimensional recursion which mirrors the evolution of the AMP iterates.
  2. From a warm start, RGD rapidly converges to a fixed point in correlation space, which recovers Bayes-optimal performance when run on the posterior.
  3. Conditioned on widely believed mixing results for the SK model, we recover the phase transition for non-trivial inference.</description>
