      <title>New Spin Structure Constraints on Hyperfine Splitting and Proton Size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 1S hyperfine splitting in hydrogen is measured to an impressive ppt precision and will soon be measured to ppm precision in muonic hydrogen. The latter measurement will rely on theoretical predictions, which are limited by knowledge of the proton polarizability effect $\Delta_\text{pol}$. Data-driven evaluations of $\Delta_\text{pol}$ have long been in significant tension with baryon chiral perturbation theory. Here we present improved results for $\Delta_\text{pol}$ driven by new spin structure data, reducing the long-standing tension between theory and experiment and halving the dominating uncertainty in hyperfine splitting calculations.</description>

      <title>Final results of the measurement to search for rare decays of naturally occurring osmium isotopes with ultra-low background gamma-ray spectrometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A long-term measurement was conducted to search for $\alpha$, double-$\alpha$ and double-$\beta$ decays with $\gamma$ quanta emission in naturally occurring osmium isotopes. This study took advantage of two ultra-low background HPGe detectors and one ultra-low background BEGe detector at the Gran Sasso National Laboratory (LNGS) of the INFN. Over almost 5 years of data were taken using high-purity osmium samples of approximately 173 g. The half-life limits set for a decays of $^{184}$Os to the first $2^+$ 103.6 keV excited level of $^{180}$W ($T_{1/2} &gt; 9.3 \times 10^{15}$ yr) and of $^{186}$Os to the first $2^+$ 100.1 keV of $^{182}$W ($T_{1/2} &gt; 4.8 \times 10^{17}$ yr) exceed substantially the present theoretical predictions that are at level of $T_{1/2} \sim (0.6 - 3) \times 10^{15}$ yr for $^{184}$Os and $T_{1/2} \sim (0.3 - 2) \times 10^{17}$ yr for $^{186}$Os. New half-life limits on the 2EC and EC$\beta^+$ decay of $^{184}$Os to the ground and excited levels of $^{184}$W were set at level of $T_{1/2} &gt; 10^{16} - 10^{17}$ yr; a lower limit on the $2\beta^-$ decay of $^{192}$Os to the $2^+$ 316.5 keV excited level of $^{192}$Pt was estimated as $T_{1/2} &gt; 6.1 \times 10^{20}$ yr. The half-life limits for $2\alpha$ decay of $^{189}$Os and $^{192}$Os were set for the first time at level of $T_{1/2} &gt; 10^{20}$ yr.</description>

      <title>Fudan Multi-purpose Active TArget Time Projection Chamber (fMeta-TPC) for Photonnuclear Reaction Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active Target Time Projection Chambers (AT-TPCs) are state-of-the-art tools in the field of low-energy nuclear physics, particularly suitable for experiments using low-intensity radioactive ion beams or gamma rays. The Fudan Multi-purpose Active Target Time Projection Chamber (fMeta-TPC) with 2048 channels has been developed to study $\alpha$-clustering nuclei. {\fcb In this work, the focus is on the study of the photonuclear reaction with the Laser Compton Scattering (LCS) gamma source, especially for the decay of the highly excited $\alpha$-cluster state.} The design of fMeta-TPC is described and a comprehensive evaluation of its offline performance is performed by ultraviolet (UV) laser and $^{241}$Am $\alpha$ source. The result shows that the intrinsic angular resolution of the detector is within 0.30$^{\circ}$ and has an energy resolution of 6.85\% for 3.0 MeV $\alpha$ particles. The gain uniformity of the detector is about 10\% (RMS/Mean), tested by the $^{55}$Fe X-ray source.</description>

      <title>The neutron array of the compact spectrometer for heavy ion experiments in Fermi energy region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emission of neutrons from heavy ion reactions is an important observable for studying the asymmetric nuclear equation of state and the reaction dynamics. A 20-unit neutron array has been developed and mounted on the compact spectrometer for heavy ion experiments (CSHINE) to measure the neutron spectra, neutron-neutron and neutron-proton correlation functions. Each unit consists of a $\rm 15\times 15\times 15~cm^3$ plastic scintillator coupled to a $ \phi=52 ~\rm mm$ photomultiplier. The Geant4 simulation with optical process is performed to investigate the time resolution and the neutron detection efficiency. The inherent time resolution of 212 ps is obtained by cosmic ray coincidence test. The n-$\gamma$ discrimination and time-of-flight performance are given by $\rm ^{252}Cf$ radioactive source test and beam test. The neutron energy spectra have been obtained in the angle range $30^\circ \le \theta_{\rm lab} \le 51^\circ$ in the beam experiment of $^{124}$Sn+$^{124}$Sn at 25 MeV/u with CSHINE.</description>

      <title>Impact of recent updates to neutrino oscillation parameters on the effective Majorana neutrino mass in 0$\nu\beta\beta$ Decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19624v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate how recent updates to neutrino oscillation parameters and the sum of neutrino masses influence the sensitivity of neutrinoless double-beta (0$\nu\beta\beta$) decay experiments. Incorporating the latest cosmological constraints on the sum of neutrino masses and laboratory measurements on oscillations, we determine the sum of neutrino masses for both the normal hierarchy (NH) and the inverted hierarchy (IH). Our analysis reveals a narrow range for the sum of neutrino masses, approximately 0.06 eV/c$^2$ for NH and 0.102 eV/c$^2$ for IH. Utilizing these constraints, we calculate the effective Majorana masses for both NH and IH scenarios, establishing the corresponding allowed regions. Importantly, we find that the minimum neutrino mass is non-zero, as constrained by the current oscillation parameters. Additionally, we estimate the half-life of 0$\nu\beta\beta$ decay using these effective Majorana masses for both NH and IH. Our results suggest that upcoming ton-scale experiments will comprehensively explore the IH scenario, while 100-ton-scale experiments will effectively probe the parameter space for the NH scenario, provided the background index can achieve 1 event/kton-year in the region of interest.</description>
