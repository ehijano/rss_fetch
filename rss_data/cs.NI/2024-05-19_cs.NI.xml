      <title>Smart Routing with Precise Link Estimation: DSEE-Based Anypath Routing for Reliable Wireless Networking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In dynamic and resource-constrained environments, such as multi-hop wireless mesh networks, traditional routing protocols often falter by relying on predetermined paths that prove ineffective in unpredictable link conditions. Shortest Anypath routing offers a solution by adapting routing decisions based on real-time link conditions. However, the effectiveness of such routing is fundamentally dependent on the quality and reliability of the available links, and predicting these variables with certainty is challenging. This paper introduces a novel approach that leverages the Deterministic Sequencing of Exploration and Exploitation (DSEE), a multi-armed bandit algorithm, to address the need for accurate and real-time estimation of link delivery probabilities. This approach augments the reliability and resilience of the Shortest Anypath routing in the face of fluctuating link conditions. By coupling DSEE with Anypath routing, this algorithm continuously learns and ensures accurate delivery probability estimation and selects the most suitable way to efficiently route packets while maintaining a provable near-logarithmic regret bound. We also theoretically prove that our proposed scheme offers better regret scaling with respect to the network size than the previously proposed Thompson Sampling-based Opportunistic Routing (TSOR).</description>

      <title>A First Look at Immersive Telepresence on Apple Vision Pro</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the widespread adoption of "work-from-home" policies, videoconferencing applications (e.g., Zoom) have become indispensable for remote communication. However, these systems lack immersiveness, leading to the so-called "Zoom fatigue" and degrading communication efficiency. The recent debut of Apple Vision Pro, a mixed reality headset that supports "spatial persona", aims to offer an immersive telepresence experience with these applications. In this paper, we conduct a first-of-its-kind in-depth and empirical study to analyze the performance of immersive telepresence with four applications, Apple FaceTime, Cisco Webex, Microsoft Teams, and Zoom, on Vision Pro. We find that only FaceTime provides a truly immersive experience with spatial personas, whereas other applications still operate 2D personas. Our measurement results reveal that (1) FaceTime delivers semantic information to optimize bandwidth consumption, which is even lower than that of 2D persona for other applications, and (2) it employs visibility-aware optimizations to reduce rendering overhead. However, the scalability of FaceTime remains limited, with a simple server allocation strategy that potentially leads to high network delay among users.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Cluster Analysis to Detect and Track Novelty in Network Telescopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of cybersecurity, tracking the activities of coordinated hosts over time is a daunting task because both participants and their behaviours evolve at a fast pace. We address this scenario by solving a dynamic novelty discovery problem with the aim of both re-identifying patterns seen in the past and highlighting new patterns. We focus on traffic collected by Network Telescopes, a primary and noisy source for cybersecurity analysis. We propose a 3-stage pipeline: (i) we learn compact representations (embeddings) of hosts through their traffic in a self-supervised fashion; (ii) via clustering, we distinguish groups of hosts performing similar activities; (iii) we track the cluster temporal evolution to highlight novel patterns. We apply our methodology to 20 days of telescope traffic during which we observe more than 8 thousand active hosts. Our results show that we efficiently identify 50-70 well-shaped clusters per day, 60-70% of which we associate with already analysed cases, while we pinpoint 10-20 previously unseen clusters per day. These correspond to activity changes and new incidents, of which we document some. In short, our novelty discovery methodology enormously simplifies the manual analysis the security analysts have to conduct to gain insights to interpret novel coordinated activities.</description>

      <title>Implementation of OpenAPI Wireshark Dissectors to Validate SBI Messages of 5G Core Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel Wireshark dissector designed to facilitate the analysis of Service-Based Interface (SBI) communication in 5G Core Networks. Our approach involves parsing the OpenAPI schemes provided by the 5G specification to automatically generate the dissector code. Our tool enables the validation of 5G Core Network traces to ensure compliance with the specifications. Through testing against three open-source 5G Core Network projects, we identified several issues where messages deviate from specification standards, highlighting the significance of our implementation in ensuring protocol conformity and network reliability.</description>

      <title>Optimal Service Placement, Request Routing and CPU Sizing in Cooperative Mobile Edge Computing Networks for Delay-Sensitive Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study joint optimization of service placement, request routing, and CPU sizing in a cooperative MEC system. The problem is considered from the perspective of the service provider (SP), which delivers heterogeneous MEC-enabled delay-sensitive services, and needs to pay for the used resources to the mobile network operators and the cloud provider, while earning revenue from the served requests. We formulate the problem of maximizing the SP's total profit subject to the computation, storage, and communication constraints of each edge node and end-to-end delay requirements of the services as a mixed-integer non-convex optimization problem, and prove it to be NP-hard.
  To tackle the challenges in solving the problem, we first introduce a design trade-off parameter for different delay requirements of each service, which maintains flexibility in prioritizing them, and transform the original optimization problem by the new delay constraints. Then, by exploiting a hidden convexity, we reformulate the delay constraints into an equivalent form. Next, to handle the challenge of the complicating (integer) variables, using primal decomposition, we decompose the problem into an equivalent form of master and inner sub-problems over the mixed and real variables, respectively. We then employ a cutting-plane approach for building up adequate representations of the extremal value of the inner problem as a function of the complicating variables and the set of values of the complicating variables for which the inner problem is feasible. Finally, we propose a solution strategy based on generalized Benders decomposition and prove its convergence to the optimal solution within a limited number of iterations. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme significantly outperforms the existing mechanisms in terms of the SP's profit, cache hit ratio, running time, and end-to-end delay.</description>

      <title>On the Application of Reliability Theory to Cellular Network Mobility Performance Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving connectivity reliability is one of the significant challenges for 5G and beyond 5G cellular networks. The present understanding of reliability in the context of mobile communication does not adequately cover the stochastic temporal aspects of the network, such as the duration and spread of packet errors that an outage session may cause. Rather, it simply confines the definition to the percentage of successful packet delivery. In this letter, we offer an elaborate modeling of the outage for a cellular mobile network by showcasing the different types of outages and their contiguity characteristic. Thereafter, using the outage metrics, we define two new key performance indicators (KPIs), namely mean outage time and mean time between outages as counterparts to akin KPIs that already exist in classical reliability theory, i.e., mean down time and mean time between failures. Using a system-level simulation where user mobility is a crucial component, it is shown that these newly defined KPIs can be used to quantify the reliability requirements of different user applications in cellular services.</description>

      <title>FitNets: An Adaptive Framework to Learn Accurate Traffic Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning precise distributions of traffic features (e.g., burst sizes, packet inter-arrival time) is still a largely unsolved problem despite being critical for management tasks such as capacity planning or anomaly detection. A key limitation nowadays is the lack of feedback between the control plane and the data plane. Programmable data planes offer the opportunity to create systems that let data- and control plane to work together, compensating their respective shortcomings.
  We present FitNets, an adaptive network monitoring system leveraging feedback between the data- and the control plane to learn accurate traffic distributions. In the control plane, FitNets relies on Kernel Density Estimators which allow to provably learn distributions of any shape. In the data plane, FitNets tests the accuracy of the learned distributions while dynamically adapting data collection to the observed distribution fitness, prioritizing under-fitted features.
  We have implemented FitNets in Python and P4 (including on commercially available programmable switches) and tested it on real and synthetic traffic traces. FitNets is practical: it is able to estimate hundreds of distributions from up to 60 millions samples per second, while providing accurate error estimates and adapting to complex traffic patterns.</description>

      <title>Pragmatic Communication for Remote Control of Finite-State Markov Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pragmatic or goal-oriented communication can optimize communication decisions beyond the reliable transmission of data, instead aiming at directly affecting application performance with the minimum channel utilization. In this paper, we develop a general theoretical framework for the remote control of finite-state Markov processes, using pragmatic communication over a costly zero-delay communication channel. To that end, we model a cyber-physical system composed of an encoder, which observes and transmits the states of a process in real-time, and a decoder, which receives that information and controls the behavior of the process. The encoder and the decoder should cooperatively optimize the trade-off between the control performance (i.e., reward) and the communication cost (i.e., channel use). This scenario underscores a pragmatic (i.e., goal-oriented) communication problem, where the purpose is to convey only the data that is most valuable for the underlying task, taking into account the state of the decoder (hence, the pragmatic aspect). We investigate two different decision-making architectures: in pull-based remote control, the decoder is the only decision-maker, while in push-based remote control, the encoder and the decoder constitute two independent decision-makers, leading to a multi-agent scenario. We propose three algorithms to optimize our system (i.e., design the encoder and the decoder policies), discuss the optimality guarantees ofs the algorithms, and shed light on their computational complexity and fundamental limits.</description>

      <title>DEthna: Accurate Ethereum Network Topology Discovery with Marked Transactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03881v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In Ethereum, the ledger exchanges messages along an underlying Peer-to-Peer (P2P) network to reach consistency. Understanding the underlying network topology of Ethereum is crucial for network optimization, security and scalability. However, the accurate discovery of Ethereum network topology is non-trivial due to its deliberately designed security mechanism. Consequently, existing measuring schemes cannot accurately infer the Ethereum network topology with a low cost. To address this challenge, we propose the Distributed Ethereum Network Analyzer (DEthna) tool, which can accurately and efficiently measure the Ethereum network topology. In DEthna, a novel parallel measurement model is proposed that can generate marked transactions to infer link connections based on the transaction replacement and propagation mechanism in Ethereum. Moreover, a workload offloading scheme is designed so that DEthna can be deployed on multiple distributed probing nodes so as to measure a large-scale Ethereum network at a low cost. We run DEthna on Goerli (the most popular Ethereum test network) to evaluate its capability in discovering network topology. The experimental results demonstrate that DEthna significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines. Based on DEthna, we further analyze characteristics of the Ethereum network revealing that there exist more than 50% low-degree Ethereum nodes that weaken the network robustness.</description>

      <title>Resource Allocation in Mobile Networks: A Decision Model Of Jockeying in Queues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11054v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Use-case-specific network slicing in decentralized multi-tenancy cloud environments is a promising approach to bridge the gap between the demand and supply of resources in next-generation communication networks. Our findings associate different slice profiles to queues in a multi-server setting, such that tenants continuously assess their preferences and make rational decisions to minimize the queuing delay.
  Deviated from classical approaches that statistically model the jockeying phenomena in queuing systems, our work pioneers to setup a behavioral model of jockeying impatient tenants. This will serve as a basis for decentralized management of multi-queue systems, where the decision to jockey is individually made by each tenant upon its up-to-date assessment of expected waiting time.
  Additionally, we carry out numerical simulations to empirically unravel the parametric dependencies of the tenants' jockeying behavior.</description>

      <title>Design and Performance Evaluation of SEANet, a Software-defined Networking Platform for the Internet of Underwater Things</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01009v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents the design and performance evaluation of the SEANet platform, a software-defined acoustic modem designed for enhancing underwater networking and Internet of Underwater Things (IoUT) applications. Addressing the limitations of traditional acoustic modems, which suffer from low data rates and rigid architectures, SEANet introduces a versatile, adaptive framework capable of reconfiguring all layers of the protocol stack in real-time to accommodate diverse marine applications. The platform integrates high-performance, wideband data converters with modular hardware and software components, enabling real-time adaptation to changing environmental and operational conditions. Experimental evaluations conducted in oceanic settings demonstrate the SEANet capability to significantly exceed the performance of existing commercial underwater modems, supporting data rates up to 150 kbit/s and effectively doubling the performance metrics of conventional systems. Our robust testing also highlights the SEANet proficiency in channel estimation, Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing (OFDM) link establishment, and interoperability through the JANUS communication standard. Our results underscore the SEANet potential to transform underwater communication technologies, providing a scalable and efficient solution that supports high data rate applications and fosters the expansion of IoUT deployments.</description>

      <title>Node Feature Augmentation Vitaminizes Network Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.12751v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Network alignment (NA) is the task of discovering node correspondences across multiple networks. Although NA methods have achieved remarkable success in a myriad of scenarios, their effectiveness is not without additional information such as prior anchor links and/or node features, which may not always be available due to privacy concerns or access restrictions. To tackle this challenge, we propose Grad-Align+, a novel NA method built upon a recent state-of-the-art NA method, the so-called Grad-Align, that gradually discovers a part of node pairs until all node pairs are found. In designing Grad-Align+, we account for how to augment node features in the sense of performing the NA task and how to design our NA method by maximally exploiting the augmented node features. To achieve this goal, Grad-Align+ consists of three key components: 1) centrality-based node feature augmentation (CNFA), 2) graph neural network (GNN)-aided embedding similarity calculation alongside the augmented node features, and 3) gradual NA with similarity calculation using aligned cross-network neighbor-pairs (ACNs). Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that Grad-Align+ exhibits (a) the superiority over benchmark NA methods, (b) empirical validations as well as our theoretical findings to see the effectiveness of CNFA, (c) the influence of each component, (d) the robustness to network noises, and (e) the computational efficiency.</description>
