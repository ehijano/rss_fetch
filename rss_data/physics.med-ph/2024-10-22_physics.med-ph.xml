      <title>Implicit neural representation for free-breathing MR fingerprinting (INR-MRF): co-registered 3D whole-liver water T1, water T2, proton density fat fraction, and R2* mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: To develop an MRI technique for free-breathing 3D whole-liver quantification of water T1, water T2, proton density fat fraction (PDFF), R2*. Methods: An Eight-echo spoiled gradient echo pulse sequence with spiral readout was developed by interleaving inversion recovery and T2 magnetization preparation. We propose a neural network based on a 4D and a 3D implicit neural representation (INR) which simultaneously learns the motion deformation fields and the static reference frame MRI subspace images respectively. Water and fat singular images were separated during network training, with no need of performing retrospective water-fat separation. T1, T2, R2* and proton density fat fraction (PDFF) produced by the proposed method were validated in vivo on 10 healthy subjects, using quantitative maps generated from conventional scans as reference. Results: Our results showed minimal bias and narrow 95% limits of agreement on T1, T2, R2* and PDFF values in the liver compared to conventional breath-holding scans. Conclusions: INR-MRF enabled co-registered 3D whole liver T1, T2, R2* and PDFF mapping in a single free-breathing scan.</description>

      <title>PET mapping of receptor occupancy using joint direct parametric reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Receptor occupancy (RO) studies using PET neuroimaging play a critical role in the development of drugs targeting the central nervous system (CNS). The conventional approach to estimate drug receptor occupancy consists in estimation of binding potential changes between two PET scans (baseline and post-drug injection). This estimation is typically performed separately for each scan by first reconstructing dynamic PET scan data before fitting a kinetic model to time activity curves. This approach fails to properly model the noise in PET measurements, resulting in poor RO estimates, especially in low receptor density regions. Objective: In this work, we evaluate a novel joint direct parametric reconstruction framework to directly estimate distributions of RO and other kinetic parameters in the brain from a pair of baseline and post-drug injection dynamic PET scans. Methods: The proposed method combines the use of regularization on RO maps with alternating optimization to enable estimation of occupancy even in low binding regions. Results: Simulation results demonstrate the quantitative improvement of this method over conventional approaches in terms of accuracy and precision of occupancy. The proposed method is also evaluated in preclinical in-vivo experiments using 11C-MK-6884 and a muscarinic acetylcholine receptor 4 positive allosteric modulator drug, showing improved estimation of receptor occupancy as compared to traditional estimators. Conclusion: The proposed joint direct estimation framework improves RO estimation compared to conventional methods, especially in intermediate to low-binding regions. Significance: This work could potentially facilitate the evaluation of new drug candidates targeting the CNS.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Impact of Age and Sex on Cataract Surgery Complications and Outcomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background/Objectives: Cataract surgery, a very common and critical procedure for restoring vision, has outcomes that can vary based on patient demographics. This study aimed to elucidate the effects of age and sex on the risk factors, intraoperative complications, and postoperative outcomes of cataract surgery.
  Subjects/Methods: Conducted as a single-center retrospective cohort study, it analyzed 691 eyes from 589 individuals who underwent surgery at a tertiary referral center, utilizing data from electronic medical records to assess preoperative risk factors, intraoperative complications, and pre- and post-operative best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) along with demographic data.
  Results: The main results highlighted that males aged 65-75 years exhibited significantly higher rates of functional postoperative BCVA (91% for males vs. 79% for females, p=0.007), a disparity that is not explained by differences in surgical complications or risk factor prevalence. Furthermore, the study identified age-specific thresholds where BCVA improvements significantly declined beyond 65 years for females and 75 years for males. The likelihood of worsened BCVA post-surgery increased with age for both sexes, with a significant decline in BCVA improvement transitioning from 55-65 years to 65-75 years age groups.
  Conclusions: The findings underscore the critical influence of both sex and age on cataract surgery outcomes, revealing significant sex-specific age thresholds that signal lesser improvements in postoperative BCVA. These insights advocate for the integration of patient age and sex into preoperative evaluations to better tailor the timing and planning of cataract surgery, ultimately aiming to optimize clinical outcomes.</description>

      <title>Latency correction in sparse neuronal spike trains with overlapping global events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background: In Kreuz et al., J Neurosci Methods 381, 109703 (2022) two methods were proposed that perform latency correction, i.e., optimize the spike time alignment of sparse neuronal spike trains with well defined global spiking events. The first one based on direct shifts is fast but uses only partial latency information, while the other one makes use of the full information but relies on the computationally costly simulated annealing. Both methods reach their limits and can become unreliable when successive global events are not sufficiently separated or even overlap.
  New Method: Here we propose an iterative scheme that combines the advantages of the two original methods by using in each step as much of the latency information as possible and by employing a very fast extrapolation direct shift method instead of the much slower simulated annealing.
  Results: We illustrate the effectiveness and the improved performance, measured in terms of the relative shift error, of the new iterative scheme not only on simulated data with known ground truths but also on single-unit recordings from two medial superior olive neurons of a gerbil.
  Comparison with Existing Method(s): The iterative scheme outperforms the existing approaches on both the simulated and the experimental data. Due to its low computational demands, and in contrast to simulated annealing, it can also be applied to very large datasets.
  Conclusions: The new method generalizes and improves on the original method both in terms of accuracy and speed. Importantly, it is the only method that allows to disentangle global events with overlap.</description>

      <title>AutoFLUKA: A Large Language Model Based Framework for Automating Monte Carlo Simulations in FLUKA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, particularly using FLUKA, are essential for replicating real-world scenarios across scientific and engineering fields. Despite the robustness and versatility, FLUKA faces significant limitations in automation and integration with external post-processing tools, leading to workflows with a steep learning curve, which are time-consuming and prone to human errors. Traditional methods involving the use of shell and Python scripts, MATLAB, and Microsoft Excel require extensive manual intervention and lack flexibility, adding complexity to evolving scenarios. This study explores the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) and AI agents to address these limitations. AI agents, integrate natural language processing with autonomous reasoning for decision-making and adaptive planning, making them ideal for automation. We introduce AutoFLUKA, an AI agent application developed using the LangChain Python Framework to automate typical MC simulation workflows in FLUKA. AutoFLUKA can modify FLUKA input files, execute simulations, and efficiently process results for visualization, significantly reducing human labor and error. Our case studies demonstrate that AutoFLUKA can handle both generalized and domain-specific cases, such as Microdosimetry, with an streamlined automated workflow, showcasing its scalability and flexibility. The study also highlights the potential of Retrieval Augmentation Generation (RAG) tools to act as virtual assistants for FLUKA, further improving user experience, time and efficiency. In conclusion, AutoFLUKA represents a significant advancement in automating MC simulation workflows, offering a robust solution to the inherent limitations. This innovation not only saves time and resources but also opens new paradigms for research and development in high energy physics, medical physics, nuclear engineering space and environmental science.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning-based Detection of Bacterial Swarm Motion Using a Single Image</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Distinguishing between swarming and swimming, the two principal forms of bacterial movement, holds significant conceptual and clinical relevance. This is because bacteria that exhibit swarming capabilities often possess unique properties crucial to the pathogenesis of infectious diseases and may also have therapeutic potential. Here, we report a deep learning-based swarming classifier that rapidly and autonomously predicts swarming probability using a single blurry image. Compared with traditional video-based, manually-processed approaches, our method is particularly suited for high-throughput environments and provides objective, quantitative assessments of swarming probability. The swarming classifier demonstrated in our work was trained on Enterobacter sp. SM3 and showed good performance when blindly tested on new swarming (positive) and swimming (negative) test images of SM3, achieving a sensitivity of 97.44% and a specificity of 100%. Furthermore, this classifier demonstrated robust external generalization capabilities when applied to unseen bacterial species, such as Serratia marcescens DB10 and Citrobacter koseri H6. It blindly achieved a sensitivity of 97.92% and a specificity of 96.77% for DB10, and a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 97.22% for H6. This competitive performance indicates the potential to adapt our approach for diagnostic applications through portable devices or even smartphones. This adaptation would facilitate rapid, objective, on-site screening for bacterial swarming motility, potentially enhancing the early detection and treatment assessment of various diseases, including inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) and urinary tract infections (UTI).</description>

      <title>Shot-noise limited, 10 MHz swept-source optical coherence tomography for retinal imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Akinetic swept-sources are essential for high-speed optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging. Time-stretched supercontinuum (TSSC) lasers have proven to be efficient for multi-MHz swept-sources. However, lack of low-noise broadband lasers and of large dispersion devices in the water low-absorption band at 1060 nm have limited the biomedical applications of TSSC lasers. In this letter, an approach to tune the wavelength around 1050 nm over 90 nm with low-noise at 10 MHz is presented. This is based on all-normal dispersion (ANDi) supercontinuum dynamics, and employs a long chirped fiber Bragg grating (CFBG) to time-stretch a broadband pulse with a duty cycle of 93 %. Retinal images are demonstrated, with a sensitivity of 84 dB - approaching the shot noise limit. We believe this high-speed low-noise swept-source will greatly promote the development of OCT techniques for biomedical applications.</description>
