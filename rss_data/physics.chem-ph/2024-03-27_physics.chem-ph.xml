      <title>Atomistic Descriptor Optimization Using Complementary Euclidean and Geodesic Distance Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Descriptors are physically-inspired schemes for representing atomistic systems that play a central role in the construction of models of potential energy surfaces. Although physical intuition can be flexibly encoded into descriptor schemes, they are generally ultimately guided only by the spatial or topological arrangement of atoms in the system. Here, we propose a novel approach for the optimization of descriptors based on encoding information about geodesic distances along potential energy manifolds into the hyperparameters of commonly used descriptor schemes. To accomplish this, we combine two ideas: (1) a differential-geometric approach for the fast estimation of approximate geodesic distances; and (2) an information-theoretic evaluation metric - information imbalance - for measuring the shared information between two distance measures. Using the MD22 datasets of ethanol, malonaldehyde, and aspirin, we first show that Euclidean (in Cartesian coordinates) and geodesic distances are inequivalent distance measures, indicating the need for updated ground-truth distance measures that go beyond the Euclidean distance. We then utilize a Bayesian optimization framework to show that descriptors (in this case, atom-centered symmetry functions) can be optimized to maximally express a certain type of distance information, such as Euclidean or geodesic information. We also show that modifying the Bayesian optimization algorithm to minimize a combined Euclidean+geodesic objective function can yield descriptors that not only express both Euclidean and geodesic distance information simultaneously, but in fact resolve substantial disagreements between descriptors optimized to encode only one type of distance measure. We discuss the relevance of our approach to the design of more physically rich and informative descriptors that can encode useful, alternative information about molecular systems.</description>

      <title>Determination of output composition in reaction-advection-diffusion systems on network reactors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider reaction-transport processes in open reactors in which systems of first order reactions involving a number of gas species and solid catalysts can occur at localized active regions. Reaction products flow out of the reactor into vacuum conditions and are collected at an exit boundary. The output composition problem (OCP) is to determine the composition (molar fractions) of the collected gas after the reactor is fully emptied. We provide a solution to this problem in the form of a boundary-value problem for a system of time-independent partial differential equations. We then consider network-like reactors, which can be approximated by a network consisting of a collection of nodes and 1-dimensional branches, with reactions taking place at nodes. For these, it is possible to solve the OCP in a simple and effective way, giving explicit formulas for the output composition as a function of the reaction coefficients and parameters associated with the geometric configuration of the system. Several examples are given to illustrate the method.</description>

      <title>Electrolyte effects on the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction: a mean-field approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces the combination of an advanced double layer model with electrochemical kinetics to explain electrolyte effects on the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction. It is known from experimental studies that the alkaline hydrogen evolution current shows a strong dependence on the concentration and identity of cations in the electrolyte, but is independent of pH. To explain these effects, we formulate the faradaic current in terms of the electric potential in the double layer, which is calculated using a mean-field model that takes into account the cation and anion sizes as well as the electric dipole moment of water molecules. We consider that the Volmer step consists of two activated processes: a water reduction sub-step and a sub-step in which a hydroxide ion is transferred from the interface to the electrolyte bulk. Either of these sub-steps may limit the rate. The developed models for these sub-steps qualitatively explain experimental observations, including cation effects, pH-independence, and the trend reversal between gold and platinum electrodes. We also assess the quantitative accuracy of the water reduction-limited current model; we suggest that the predicted functional relationship is valid as long as the hydrogen bonding structure of water near the electrode is sufficiently maintained.</description>

      <title>DMRG-tailored coupled cluster method in the 4c-relativistic domain: General implementation and application to the NUHFI and NUF$_3$ molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heavy atom compounds represent a challenge for computational chemistry, due to the need for simultaneous treatment of relativistic and correlation effects. Often such systems exhibit also strong correlation which hampers the application of perturbation theory or single-reference coupled cluster (CC) methods. As a viable alternative, we have proposed to externally correct the CC method using the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) wave functions, yielding the DMRG-tailored CC method. In a previous paper [J. Chem. Phys. {\bf 152}, 174107 (2020)] we have reported a first implementation of this method in the relativistic context, which was restricted to molecules with real double group symmetry. In this work we present a fully general implementation of the method, covering complex and quaternion double groups as well. The 4c-TCC method thus becomes applicable to polyatomic molecules including heavy atoms. For assessment of the method, we performed calculations of the chiral uranium compound NUHFI, which was previously studied in the context of the enhancement of parity violation effects. In particular, we performed calculations of a cut of the potential energy surface of this molecule along the dissociation of the N-U bond, where the system exhibits a strong multireference character. Since there are no experimental data for NUHFI, we have performed also an analogous study of the (more symmetric) NUF$_3$ molecule, where the vibrational frequency of the N-U bond can be compared with spectroscopic data.</description>

      <title>Non-empirical prediction of the length-dependent ionization potential in molecular chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ionization potential of molecular chains is well-known to be a tunable nano-scale property that exhibits clear quantum confinement effects. State-of-the-art methods can accurately predict the ionization potential in the small molecule limit and in the solid-state limit, but for intermediate, nano-sized systems prediction of the evolution of the electronic structure between the two limits is more difficult. Recently, optimal tuning of range-separated hybrid functionals has emerged as a highly accurate method for predicting ionization potentials. This was first achieved for molecules using the ionization potential theorem (IPT) and more recently extended to solid-state systems, based on an \textit{ansatz} that generalizes the IPT to the removal of charge from a localized Wannier function. Here, we study one-dimensional molecular chains of increasing size, from the monomer limit to the infinite polymer limit using this approach. By comparing our results with other localization-based methods and where available with experiment, we demonstrate that Wannier-localization-based optimal tuning is highly accurate in predicting ionization potentials for any chain length, including the nano-scale regime.</description>

      <title>IR Spectroscopy of Carboxylate-Passivated Semiconducting Nanocrystals: Simulation and Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surfaces of colloidal nanocrystals are frequently passivated with carboxylate ligands which exert significant effects on their optoelectronic properties and chemical stability. Experimentally, binding geometries of such ligands are typically investigated using vibrational spectroscopy, but the interpretation of the IR signal is usually not trivial. Here, using machine-learning (ML) algorithms trained on DFT data, we simulate an IR spectrum of a lead-rich PbS nanocrystal passivated with butyrate ligands. We obtain a good agreement with the experimental signal and demonstrate that the observed line shape stems from a very wide range of `tilted-bridge'-type geometries and does not indicate a coexistence of `bridging' and `chelating' binding modes as has been previously assumed. This work illustrates limitations of empirical spectrum assignment and demonstrates the effectiveness of ML-driven molecular dynamics simulations in reproducing IR spectra of nanoscopic systems.</description>

      <title>Sort &amp; Slice: A Simple and Superior Alternative to Hash-Based Folding for Extended-Connectivity Fingerprints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extended-connectivity fingerprints (ECFPs) are a ubiquitous tool in current cheminformatics and molecular machine learning, and one of the most prevalent molecular feature extraction techniques used for chemical prediction. Atom features learned by graph neural networks can be aggregated to compound-level representations using a large spectrum of graph pooling methods; in contrast, sets of detected ECFP substructures are by default transformed into bit vectors using only a simple hash-based folding procedure. We introduce a general mathematical framework for the vectorisation of structural fingerprints via a formal operation called substructure pooling that encompasses hash-based folding, algorithmic substructure-selection, and a wide variety of other potential techniques. We go on to describe Sort &amp; Slice, an easy-to-implement and bit-collision-free alternative to hash-based folding for the pooling of ECFP substructures. Sort &amp; Slice first sorts ECFP substructures according to their relative prevalence in a given set of training compounds and then slices away all but the $L$ most frequent substructures which are subsequently used to generate a binary fingerprint of desired length, $L$. We computationally compare the performance of hash-based folding, Sort &amp; Slice, and two advanced supervised substructure-selection schemes (filtering and mutual-information maximisation) for ECFP-based molecular property prediction. Our results indicate that, despite its technical simplicity, Sort &amp; Slice robustly (and at times substantially) outperforms traditional hash-based folding as well as the other investigated methods across prediction tasks, data splitting techniques, machine-learning models and ECFP hyperparameters. We thus recommend that Sort &amp; Slice canonically replace hash-based folding as the default substructure-pooling technique to vectorise ECFPs for supervised molecular machine learning.</description>

      <title>Vertex corrections to conductivity in the Holstein model: A numerical-analytical study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The optical-conductivity profile carries information on electronic dynamics in interacting quantum many-body systems. Its computation is a formidable task that is usually approached by invoking the single-particle (bubble) approximation and neglecting the vertex corrections. Their importance remains elusive even in model Hamiltonian calculations. Here, we combine analytical arguments with our recent breakthroughs in numerically exact and approximate calculations of finite-temperature real-time correlation functions to thoroughly assess the importance of vertex corrections in the one-dimensional Holstein polaron model. We find, both analytically and numerically, vanishing vertex corrections to optical conductivity in the limits of zero electron--phonon interaction, zero electronic bandwidth, and infinite temperature. Furthermore, our numerical results show that vertex corrections to the electron mobility also vanish in many parameter regimes between these limits. In some of these cases, the vertex corrections still introduce important qualitative changes to the optical-conductivity profile in comparison to the bubble approximation even though the self-energy remains approximately local. We trace these changes back to the bubble approximation not fully capturing a time-limited slow-down of the electron on intermediate time scales between ballistic and diffusive transport. We find that the vertex corrections are overall most pronounced for intermediate electron--phonon interaction and may increase or decrease the bubble-approximation mobility depending on the values of model parameters.</description>

      <title>Structure and thermodynamics of supported lipid membranes on hydrophobic van der Waals surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the adsorption and physical characteristics of supported lipid membranes is crucial for their effective use as model cell membranes. Their morphological and thermodynamic properties at the nanoscale have traditionally been studied on hydrophilic substrates, such as mica and silicon oxide, which have proved to facilitate the reconstruction of biomembranes. However, in more recent years, with the advent of the van der Waals crystals technology, two-dimensional crystals such as graphene have been proposed as potential substrates in biosensing devices. Membranes formed on these crystals are expected to behave differently owing to their intrinsic hydrophobicity, however thus far knowledge of their morphological and thermodynamic properties is lacking. Here we present a comprehensive nanoscale analysis of the adsorption of phosphatidylcholine lipid monolayers on two of the most commonly used van der Waals crystals, graphite and hexagonal boron nitride. Both morphological and thermodynamic properties of the lipid membranes were investigated using temperature-controlled atomic force microscopy. Our experiments show that the lipids adsorb onto the crystals, forming monolayers with their orientation dependent upon their concentration. Furthermore, we found that the hydrophobicity of van der Waals crystals determines a strong increase in the transition temperature of the lipid monolayer compared to that observed on hydrophilic substrates. These results are important for understanding the properties of lipid membranes at solid surfaces and extending their use to novel drug delivery and biosensing devices made of van der Waals crystals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Equilibrium rate theories play a crucial role in understanding rare, reactive events. However, they are inapplicable to a range of irreversible processes in systems driven far from thermodynamic equilibrium like active and biological matter. Here, we develop a general, computationally efficient nonequilibrium rate theory in the weak-noise limit based on an instanton approximation to the stochastic path integral and illustrate its wide range of application in the study of rare nonequilibrium events. We demonstrate excellent agreement of the instanton rates with numerically exact results for a particle under a non-conservative force. We also study phase transitions in an active field theory. We elucidate how activity alters the stability of the two phases and their rates of interconversion in a manner that can be well-described by modifying classical nucleation theory</description>

Abstract: We analyze how Langevin dynamics is affected by the friction coefficient using an invariant subspace projection of the associated Koopman operator. This provides the friction-dependent metastable macro-states of the dynamical system as well as the transition rates in the entire phase space. We used the algorithm ISOKANN for a wide range of friction coefficient values and reproduced results consistent with the Kramers turnover.</description>

      <title>Unraveling a cavity induced molecular polarization mechanism from collective vibrational strong coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.06004v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that collective vibrational strong coupling of molecules in thermal equilibrium can give rise to significant local electronic polarizations in the thermodynamic limit. We do so by first showing that the full non-relativistic Pauli-Fierz problem of an ensemble of strongly-coupled molecules in the dilute-gas limit reduces in the cavity Born-Oppenheimer approximation to a cavity-Hartree equation for the electronic structure. Consequently, each individual molecule experiences a self-consistent coupling to the dipoles of all other molecules, which amount to non-negligible values in the thermodynamic limit (large ensembles). Thus collective vibrational strong coupling can alter individual molecules strongly for localized "hotspots" within the ensemble. Moreover, the discovered cavity-induced polarization pattern possesses a zero net polarization, which resembles a continuous form of a spin glass (or better polarization glass). Our findings suggest that the thorough understanding of polaritonic chemistry, requires a self-consistent treatment of dressed electronic structure, which can give rise to numerous, so far overlooked, physical mechanisms.</description>
