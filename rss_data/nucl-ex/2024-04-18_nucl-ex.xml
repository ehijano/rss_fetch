      <title>Systematic shell-model analysis of $2\nu\beta\beta$ decay of $^{76}$Ge and $^{96}$Zr to the ground and excited states of $^{76}$Se and $^{96}$Mo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we have studied the $2\nu\beta\beta$ decay of $^{76}$Ge and $^{96}$Zr isotopes utilizing large-scale shell-model calculations. The GWBXG effective interaction has been employed in the calculation of $2\nu\beta\beta$-decay nuclear matrix elements (NMEs). We have tested the effective interaction by comparing the predicted spectroscopic properties, such as energy spectra and transition probabilities, with the available experimental data. The variation of cumulative NMEs with respect to the $1^+$ state energies of the intermediate nucleus is also studied, corresponding to $0^+_{\rm g.s}\rightarrow0^+_{\rm g.s}$, $0^+_{\rm g.s}\rightarrow0^+_{2}$, and $0^+_{\rm g.s}\rightarrow2^+_{1}$ transitions between the parent and granddaughter nuclei. The extracted half-lives using the shell-model predicted NMEs show good agreement with the recent experimental data. The comparison of the shell-model predicted NMEs with previous NMEs available in the literature is discussed. Also, the computed branching ratios for the $2\nu\beta\beta$ decay of $^{76}$Ge and both the $2\nu\beta\beta$ and single-$\beta$ decay of $^{96}$Zr are reported.</description>

      <title>Laser excitation of the $^{229}$Th nuclear isomeric transition in a solid-state host</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: LiSrAlF$_6$ crystals doped with $^{229}$Th are used in a laser-based search for the nuclear isomeric transition. Two spectroscopic features near the nuclear transition energy are observed. The first is a broad excitation feature that produces red-shifted fluorescence that decays with a timescale of a few seconds. The second is a narrow, laser-linewidth-limited spectral feature at $148.38219(4)_{\textrm{stat}}(20)_{\textrm{sys}}$ nm ($2020407.3(5)_{\textrm{stat}}(30)_{\textrm{sys}}$ GHz) that decays with a lifetime of $568(13)_{\textrm{stat}}(20)_{\textrm{sys}}$ s. This feature is assigned to the excitation of the $^{229}$Th nuclear isomeric state, whose energy is found to be $8.355733(2)_{\textrm{stat}}(10)_{\textrm{sys}}$ eV in $^{229}$Th:\thor:LiSrAlF$_6$.</description>

      <title>Lattice QCD Calculation of Electroweak Box Contributions to Superallowed Nuclear and Neutron Beta Decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.16755v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first lattice QCD calculation of the universal axial $\gamma W$-box contribution $\square_{\gamma W}^{VA}$ to both superallowed nuclear and neutron beta decays. This contribution emerges as a significant component within the theoretical uncertainties surrounding the extraction of $|V_{ud}|$ from superallowed decays. Our calculation is conducted using two domain wall fermion ensembles at the physical pion mass. To construct the nucleon 4-point correlation functions, we employ the random sparsening field technique. Furthermore, we incorporate long-distance contributions to the hadronic function using the infinite-volume reconstruction method. Upon performing the continuum extrapolation, we arrive at $\square_{\gamma W}^{VA}=3.65(8)_{\mathrm{lat}}(1)_{\mathrm{PT}}\times10^{-3}$. Consequently, this yields a slightly higher value of $|V_{ud}|=0.97386(11)_{\mathrm{exp.}}(9)_{\mathrm{RC}}(27)_{\mathrm{NS}}$, reducing the previous $2.1\sigma$ tension with the CKM unitarity to $1.8\sigma$. Additionally, we calculate the vector $\gamma W$-box contribution to the axial charge $g_A$, denoted as $\square_{\gamma W}^{VV}$, and explore its potential implications.</description>

      <title>About the magnitude of the $\gamma^\ast N \to N(1520)$ transverse amplitudes near $Q^2=0$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10654v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $\gamma^\ast N \to N(1520)$ transition has a property that differs from the other low-lying nucleon resonance amplitudes: the magnitude of the transverse helicity amplitudes.The transition helicity amplitudes are defined in terms of square-transfer momentum $q^2$, or $Q^2=-q^2$. Near the photon point ($Q^2=0$) there is a significant difference in the magnitude of the transverse amplitudes: $A_{3/2}$ is very large and $A_{1/2}$ is very small. This atypical behavior contrasts with the relation between the amplitudes at the pseudothreshold [the limit where the nucleon and the $N(1520)$ are both at rest and $Q^2 &lt;0$], where $A_{3/2} = A_{1/2}/\sqrt{3}$, and also in the large-$Q^2$ region, where theory and data suggest that $A_{3/2}$ is suppressed relative to $A_{1/2}$. In the present work, we look for the source of the suppression of the $A_{1/2}$ amplitude at $Q^2=0$. The result is easy to understand in first approximation, when we look into the relation between the transverse amplitudes and the elementary form factors, defined by a gauge-invariant parametrization of the $\gamma^\ast N \to N(1520)$ transition current, near $Q^2=0$. There is a partial cancellation between contributions of two elementary form factors near $Q^2=0$. We conclude, however, that the correlation between the two elementary form factors at $Q^2=0$ is not sufficient to explain the transverse amplitude data below $Q^2 = 1$ GeV$^2$. The description of the dependence of the transverse amplitudes on $Q^2$ requires the determination of the scale of variation of the elementary form factors in the range $Q^2=0$...0.5 GeV$^2$,a region with almost non existent data. We conclude at the end that the low-$Q^2$ data for the transverse amplitudes can be well described when we relate the scale of variation of the elementary form factors with the nucleon dipole form factor.</description>
