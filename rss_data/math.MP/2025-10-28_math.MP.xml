      <title>Asymptotics for eigenvalues of one-dimensional Dirac operators in the weak coupling limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive new results on the asymptotic behavior of eigenvalues of perturbed one-dimensional massive Dirac operators in the weak coupling limit. Two classes of potentials are considered. For bounded Hermitian potentials $V$ satisfying $|V(x)| \lesssim |x|^{-1}$ for large $|x|$, we recover the leading term, which may include a logarithmic correction if $V(x) \sim |x|^{-1}$ at infinity. For possibly non-Hermitian $L^1$ potentials satisfying a suitable moment condition, we obtain the second term in the asymptotic expansion. The first result is based on a min-max principle adapted to the non-relativistic limit, while the second result is obtained via the Birman-Schwinger principle and resolvent expansions.</description>

      <title>Conformally symplectic Chaplygin reduction in rubber rolling of surfaces of revolution over the plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rubber rolling (no-slip and no-twist) of a convex body on the plane under the influence of gravity is a SE(2) Chaplygin system, that reduces to the sphere of Poisson vectors. I comment upon an observation by A.V Borisov and I.S. Mamaev (Regular and Chaotic Dynamics, 13(5):443-490, 2008) for the case of surfaces of revolution [also in A. V. Borisov, I. S. Mamaev and I. A. Bizyaev (Regular and Chaotic Dynamics, 18(3):277-328, 2013)]. They show that this case is quite special: the additional integral of motion is elementary, while for marble rolling it is not elementary. I connect this finding with recent work about Chaplygin reduced systems that are conformally symplectic (Luis Garcia Naranjo and Juan C. Marrero. The geometry of nonholonomic Chaplygin systems revisited. Nonlinearity, 33(3):1297, 2020).</description>

      <title>A Two-HCIZ Gaussian Matrix Model for Non-intersecting Brownian Bridges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a one-matrix model for non-intersecting Brownian bridges with multiple starts and ends: it is a Gaussian Hermitian ensemble 'dressed' by two Harish-Chandra-Itzykson-Zuber (HCIZ) integrals encoding the boundary data. We prove that, at finite $n$ (including confluent multiplicities), its eigenvalue law coincides with the Karlin-McGregor distribution. A structural "single-HCIZ collapse" of the partition function, with an explicit $t$-dependent prefactor, identifies it as a $2$D-Toda $\tau$-function in Miwa variables and leads to Virasoro constraints via Schwinger-Dyson equations. In the reduction $(p,q)=(2,1)$, the model matches the external-field ensemble spectrally while exhibiting distinct angular statistics (Haar-distributed eigenvectors). These results provide the matrix-integral origin for the mixed-type multiple orthogonal polynomial/Riemann-Hilbert description and enable direct finite-$n$ identities and large-$n$ asymptotics.</description>

      <title>r-Matrices for integrable systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider some algebraic and geometric aspects of the theory of integrable systems in finite dimensions, associated with the existence of a classical $r$-matrix, first introduced by Sklyanin as the classical analogue of the quantum version. The importance of the notion of the $r$-matrix in this context relies on the fact that it connects the Hamiltonian structure of integrable equations with the factorisation problem which provides their explicit solution.
  In this framework, the Lax matrix is interpreted as the coadjoint orbit of a Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$, and the existence of a non-dynamical $r$-matrix allows the introduction of a second Lie algebra structure on $\mathfrak{g}$. Depending on the properties of the $r$-matrix associated with the specific system, we distinguish between bialgebras and dialgebras. Bialgebras are associated with a skew-symmetric $r$-matrix, were introduced by Drinfeld, and connected to the interplay between the two Lie algebras structures on $\mathfrak{g}$ and its dual $\mathfrak{g}^*$ respectively. Dialgebras refer to a larger class of $r$-matrix and are related to the factorisation properties of the system, were introduced by Semenov-Tian-Shansky and consist in two Lie algebras $\mathfrak{g}$ and $\mathfrak{g}_R$ coexisting on the same vector space.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of the semi-discrete Gardner equation under two types of non-vanishing boundary conditions: heteropolar solitons and kinks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we will use inverse scattering transform to study the semi-discrete Gardner equation under two types of non-vanishing boundary conditions, and investigate two interesting nonlinear waves in the presence of discrete spectrum, namely heteropolar solitons and kinks. When $u_n\rightarrow -\frac{a}{2b}$ as $n\rightarrow \pm \infty$, this is a symmetric boundary condition, for which the heteropolar solitons, i.e., two kinds of single soliton solutions with different polarities will be obtained. If considering two sets of discrete eigenvalues, there will be two types of soliton collisions, head-on and overtaking collision, depending on the position of discrete spectrum. Interestingly, the energy gathered at the moment of collision with different polarities, producing the so-called rogue wave phenomenon with a large amplitude more than twice the background, and its generation mechanism is briefly analyzed. When $u_n\rightarrow \frac{c_{\pm}\sqrt{ a^2+4b }-a}{2b}$ as $n\rightarrow \pm \infty$, the kink, i.e., the undercompressive dispersive shock wave, will be obtained under the specific step-like boundary condition.</description>

      <title>Super Higher-Teichm\"uller Geometry and Loop Amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a supersymmetric extension of the Fock-Goncharov cluster ensemble associated with a split basic classical Lie supergroup $G$ and a marked bordered surface $S$. The resulting structure defines a super higher-Teichm\"uller geometry: a split super--thickening of $(\mathscr A_{G,S}, \mathscr X_{G,S})$ equipped with a mutation atlas preserving a canonical super log-symplectic form. Each super seed carries an integer weight matrix $W$ encoding Cartan weights of an abelian odd slice, transforming by the column $g$--vector rule and giving rise to a flat logarithmic superconnection and a canonical super volume form. On this geometric foundation we define a canonical logarithmic superform $\Omega_{\mathrm{super}}^{(L)}$ on a loop fibration $\pi_L : \mathscr X^{(L)}_{G,S} \!\to\! \mathscr X_{G,S}$ as the relative lift of the base super volume. For $G = PGL(4|4)$, the corresponding super period $P_{\mathrm{super}} = \int_{C} \Omega_{\mathrm{super}}^{(L)}$ encodes the loop amplitude data of planar $N = 4$ super Yang--Mills, expressed through a unified and triangulation-independent formula that satisfies Steinmann and cluster adjacency, with the even sector given by Chen iterated integrals and the odd sector captured by an invariant BCFW delta.</description>

      <title>Renormalized Energy and Vortex Interaction in Finsler Ginzburg-Landau Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a Finsler Ginzburg--Landau framework for the analysis of vortex interactions in anisotropic superconductors. Within this setting, the Finsler structure encodes directional dependence of the condensate energy, yielding a renormalized energy W_F that governs both equilibrium and dynamics of vortices. We derive the Gamma--limit, establish the analytical structure and stability of W_F, and show that vortex motion follows a Finsler gradient flow exhibiting anisotropic dissipation and drift. This approach provides a unified geometric and physical model for anisotropic superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Crystallization of discrete $N$-particle systems at high temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is the second paper in a series studying the global asymptotics of discrete $N$-particle systems with inverse temperature parameter $\theta$ in the high temperature regime. In the first paper, we established necessary and sufficient conditions for the Law of Large Numbers at high temperature in terms of Jack generating functions. In this paper, we derive a functional equation for the moment generating function of the limiting measure, which enables its analysis using analytic tools. We apply this functional equation to compute the densities of the high temperature limits of the pure Jack measures. As a special case, we obtain the high temperature limit of the large fixed-time distribution of the discrete-space $\beta$-Dyson Brownian motion of Gorin-Shkolnikov. Two special cases of our densities are the high temperature limits of discrete versions of the G$\beta$E, computed by Allez-Bouchaud-Guionnet in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 109 (2012), 094102; arXiv:1205.3598], and L$\beta$E, computed by Allez-Bouchaud-Majumdar-Vivo in [J. Phys. A, vol. 46, no. 1 (2013), 015001; arXiv:1209.6171]. Moreover, we prove the following crystallization phenomenon of the particles in the high temperature limit: the limiting measures are uniformly supported on disjoint intervals with unit gaps and their locations correspond to the zeros of explicit special functions with all roots located in the real line. We also show that these zeros correspond to the spectra of certain unbounded Jacobi operators.</description>

      <title>Constrained instantons in scalar field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Instantons, localised saddle points of the action, play an important role in describing non-perturbative aspects of quantum field theories, for example vacuum decay or violation of conservation laws associated with anomalous symmetries. However, there are theories in which no saddle point exists. In this paper, we revisit the idea of constrained instantons, proposed initially by Affleck in 1981, and develop it into a complete method for computing the vacuum decay rate in such cases. We apply this approach to the massive scalar field theory with a negative quartic self-interaction using two different constraints. We solve the field equations numerically and find a two-branch structure, with two distinct solutions for each value of the constraint. By counting the negative modes, we identify one branch of solutions as the constrained instantons and the other as the minima of the action subject to the constraint. We discuss their significance for the computation of the vacuum decay rate.</description>

      <title>The dynamics around the collinear points of the elliptic three-body problem: A normal form approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of the collinear points in the planar, restricted three-body problem, assuming that the primaries move on an elliptic orbit around a common barycenter. The equations of motion can be conveniently written in a rotating pulsating barycentric frame, taking the true anomaly as independent variable. We consider the Hamiltonian modeling this problem in the extended phase space and we imple ment a normal form to make a center manifold reduction. The normal form provides an approximate solution for the Cartesian coordinates, which allows us to construct several kinds of orbits, most notably planar and vertical Lyapunov orbits, and halo orbits. We compare the analytical results with a numerical simulation, which requires special care in the selection of the initial conditions.</description>

      <title>Form-preserving transformations of wave and Wigner functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solutions of the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation are mapped to other solutions for a (possibly) different potential by so-called form-preserving transformations. These time-dependent transformations of the space and time coordinates can produce remarkable solutions with surprising properties. A classic example is the force-free accelerating Airy beam found by Berry and Balazs. We review the 1-dimensional form-preserving transformations and show that they also yield Senitzky coherent excited states and the free dispersion of any harmonic-oscillator stationary state. Form preservation of the $D$- and 3-dimensional Schr\"odinger equation with both a scalar and a vector potential is then considered. Time-dependent rotations may be included when a vector potential is present; we find a general transformation formula for this case. Quantum form-preserving maps are also considered in phase space. First, the wave-function transformation is shown to produce a simple result for Wigner functions: they transform as a true phase-space probability would. The explicit transformation formula explains and generalizes the rigid evolution of curves in phase space that characterize the Airy beam and the coherent excited states. Then we recover the known form-preserving transformations from the Moyal equation obeyed by Wigner functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.21953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work investigates different models of rotational dynamics of two rigid bodies with the shape of an ellipsoid, moving under their gravitational influence. The focus of this study is on their behavior, their linear stability, and numerical investigation of the main resonances. We assume that the spin axes of the two bodies are perpendicular to the orbital plane and coinciding with the direction of their shortest physical axis. In the basic approximation, we assume that the orbits of the centers of mass are Keplerian and we retain the lowest order of the potential, according to which the rotational motions of the two bodies are decoupled, the so-called spin-orbit problem. When considering highest order approximation of the potential, the rotational motions become coupled giving rise to the so-called spin-spin problem. Finally, we release the assumption that the orbit is Keplerian, which implies that the rotational dynamics is coupled to the variation of the orbital elements. The resulting system is called the full spin-spin problem. We also consider the above models under the assumption that one or both bodies are non rigid; the dissipative effect is modeled by a linear function of the rotational velocity, depending on some dissipative and drift coefficients. We consider three main resonances, namely the (1:1,1:1), (3:2,3:2), (1:1,3:2) resonances and we start by analyzing the linear stability of the equilibria in the conservative and dissipative settings (after averaging and keeping only the resonant angle), showing that the stability depends on the value of the orbital eccentricity. By a numerical integration of the equations of motion, we compare the spin-orbit and spin-spin problems to highlight the influence of the coupling term of the potential in the conservative and dissipative case...</description>

      <title>An Algebraic-Recursive Approach to Generate Higher-Order Symmetry Operators for Schr\"odinger and Klein-Gordon equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article explores an algebraic-recursive approach to construct differential operators that commute with a central operator $\hat{H}$ in quantum mechanics. Starting from the Schr\"odinger equation for a free particle, the work derives first-order symmetry generators, such as translations, rotations, and boosts, and examines their algebraic basis encompassing Lie and Jordan algebras. The analysis is then extended to higher-order operators, demonstrating how they can be constructed from the first-order ones through algebraic operations and Lie algebra simplification. This methodology is applied to the Klein-Gordon equation in Minkowski space-time, yielding relativistic symmetry operators. Furthermore, we defined an approximation to fractional symmetry operators of the Schrodinger equation, and a perturbative approach is employed for a case where the commutation is more general, illustrated with a one-dimensional harmonic oscillator and the fourth-order Klein-Gordon equation. The results include a general formula for the number of operators as a function of the order and the dimension of the algebraic basis, providing a reduced-form development of the differential higher-order centralizers' basis.</description>

      <title>Random walks in space-time random media in all spatial dimensions: the full subcritical fluctuation regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In arbitrary spatial dimension $d\ge 1$, we study a generalized model of random walks in a time-varying random environment (RWRE) defined by a stochastic flow of kernels. We consider the quenched probability distribution of the random walker under a scaling where the time is of order $N$ and the spatial window is of size $N^{1/2}$. This spatial window may not necessarily be centered close to the origin.
  We show that as $N\to \infty$ there are Gaussian fluctuations up to a certain specific spatial centering radius $\psi_N$ in the tail of the quenched probability distribution, which we call the critical scale. This critical scale depends on the spatial dimension of the underlying random walk, specifically $\psi_N = O(N^{3/4})$ when $d=1$, $\psi_N = O( N/\sqrt{\log N})$ when $d=2$, and $\psi_N = O(N)$ when $d\ge 3$. In the particular case of centering the fluctuation window at the origin, our results recover and generalize some known fluctuation results for related models. However, farther from the origin, the previous literature is more sparse. The noise coefficient in the limiting Gaussian field is nontrivial and depends on the invariant measure of the two-point motion of the underlying RWRE model. We furthermore reconcile some of these coefficient formulas with previous works.
  As part of the proof, we introduce a general class of Markov chains with short-range interactions that admit nice estimates and limit formulas. One of the key technical results for such Markov chains is that in $d\ge 2$, one can propagate test functions backwards in time to obtain precise limiting moment formulas.</description>

      <title>Long-time behaviors of the two-component nonlinear Klein-Gordon equation: higher-order asymptotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work investigates the long-time asymptotic behaviors of solutions to the initial value problem of the two-component nonlinear Klein-Gordon equation by inverse scattering transform and Riemann-Hilbert formulism. Two reflection coefficients are defined and their properties are analyzed in detail. The Riemann-Hilbert problem associated with the initial value problem is constructed in term of the two reflection coefficients. The Deift-Zhou nonlinear steepest descent method is then employed to analyze the Riemann-Hilbert problem, yielding the long-time asymptotics of the solution in different regions. Specifically, a higher-order asymptotic expansion of the solution inside the light cone is provided, and the leading term of this asymptotic solution is compared with results from direct numerical simulations, showing excellent agreement. This work not only provides a comprehensive analysis of the long-time behaviors of the two-component nonlinear Klein-Gordon equation but also offers a robust framework for future studies on similar nonlinear systems with third-order Lax pair.</description>

      <title>Exact time-evolving resonant states for open double quantum-dot systems with spin degrees of freedom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study time-evolving resonant states in an open double quantum-dot system, taking into account spin degrees of freedom as well as both on-dot and interdot Coulomb interactions. We exactly derived a non-Hermite effective Hamiltonian acting on the subspace of two quantum dots, where the non-Hermiticity arises from an effect of infinite external leads connected to the quantum dots. By diagonalizing the effective Hamiltonian, we identify four types of two-body resonant states. For the initial states of localized two electrons with opposite spins on the quantum dots, we exactly solve the time-dependent Schroedinger equation and obtain time-evolving two-body resonant states. The time-evolving resonant states are normalizable since their wave function grows exponentially only inside a finite space interval that expands in time with electron velocity. By using the exact solution, we analyze the survival and transition probabilities of localized two electrons on the quantum dots.</description>

      <title>Van Hove singularities in stabilizer entropy densities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The probability distribution of a measure of non-stabilizerness, also known as magic, is investigated for Haar-random pure quantum states. Focusing on the stabilizer R\'enyi entropies, the associated probability density functions (PDFs) are found to display distinct non-analytic features analogous to Van Hove singularities in condensed matter systems. For a single qubit, the stabilizer purity exhibits a logarithmic divergence at a critical value corresponding to a saddle point on the Bloch sphere. This divergence occurs at the $|H\rangle$-magic states, which hence can be identified as states for which the density of non-stabilizerness in the Hilbert space is infinite. An exact expression for the PDF is derived for the case $\alpha = 2$, with analytical predictions confirmed by numerical simulations. The logarithmic divergence disappears for dimensions $d \ge 3$, in agreement with the behavior of ordinary Van Hove singularities on flat manifolds. In addition, it is shown that, for one qubit, the linear stabilizer entropy is directly related to the partial incompatibility of quantum measurements, one of the defining properties of quantum mechanics, at the basis of Stern-Gerlach experiments.</description>

      <title>Four-dimensional topological Yang-Mills-Higgs theories with BRST instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that four-dimensional topological Yang-Mills theories, when suitably coupled to Higgs-like fields, admit representations in terms of massive gauge fields in a non-trivial neighborhood of the minima moduli. In the adjoint representation, BRST instability is present beyond tree-level, and closely resembles the Coleman-Weinberg mechanism. The fundamental representation requires realification $SU(N) \hookrightarrow SO(2N)$, but exhibits a more pronounced instability at tree-level. Stable topological solitons (vertices/monopoles) are generically present in the adjoint case. These instabilities indicate the reintroduction of local degrees of freedom into the physical spectrum of these topological field theories. In particular, the realified fundamental case may provide a promising framework for 4d topological gravity models. In addition, our results offer rare examples of BRST symmetry breaking in non-Abelian gauge theories with trivial Gribov problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.22742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper I study properties of the generators $\triangle_\gamma$ of non-local Dirichlet forms $\mathcal{E}^\mu_\gamma$ on ultrametric spaces which are the path space of simple stationary Bratteli diagrams. The measures used to define the Dirichlet forms are taken to be the Gibbs measures $\mu_\psi$ associated to H\"older continuous potentials $\psi$ for one-sided shifts. I also define a cohomology $H_{lc}(X_B)$ for $X_B$ which can be seen as dual to the homology of Bowen and Franks. Besides studying spectral properties of $\triangle_\gamma$, I show that for $\gamma$ large enough (with sharp bounds depending on the diagram and the measure theoretic entropy $h_{\mu_\psi}$ of $\mu_\psi$) there is a unique harmonic representative of any class $c\in H_{lc}(X_B)$.</description>

      <title>$\mathrm{U}(N)$ lattice Yang-Mills in the 't Hooft regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a mass gap, prove the existence of a unique infinite volume limit, and give a new proof of the large $N$ limit for $\mathrm{U}(N)$ lattice Yang-Mills theory in the 't Hooft regime. These results were previously obtained for $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ and $\mathrm{SO}(N)$ lattice Yang-Mills theories as applications of the mixing of the associated Langevin dynamics, which is verified via the Bakry-\'Emery criterion [SZZ23]. For $\mathrm{U}(N)$, however, this approach fails because its Ricci curvature is not uniformly positive, and as a result the Bakry-\'Emery condition cannot be easily verified. To overcome this obstacle, we recast the $\mathrm{U}(N)$ theory as a random-environment $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ model, where the randomness arises from a $\mathrm{U}(1)$ field, and combine cluster-expansion and Langevin-dynamics techniques to analyze the resulting $\mathrm{U}(1)\times\mathrm{SU}(N)$ model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.22867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For spin and fermionic systems in any spatial dimension, we establish that the superpolynomial decay behavior of mutual information and conditional mutual information is a universal property of gapped pure- and mixed-state phases, i.e., all systems in such a phase possess this property if one system in this phase possesses this property. We further demonstrate that the (conditional) mutual information indeed decays superpolynomially in a large class of phases, including chiral phases. As a byproduct, we sharpen the notion of mixed-state phases.</description>

      <title>Gauss Principle in Incompressible Flow: Unified Variational Perspective on Pressure and Projection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Following recent work (Gonzalez and Taha 2022; Peters and Ormiston 2025), this manuscript clarifies what the Gauss-Appell principle determines in incompressible, inviscid flow and how it connects to classical projection methods. At a fixed time, freezing the velocity and varying only the material acceleration leads to minimization of a quadratic subject to acceleration-level constraints. First-order conditions yield a Poisson-Neumann problem for a reaction pressure whose gradient removes the non-solenoidal and wall-normal content of the provisional residual, i.e. the Leray-Hodge projection. Thus, Gauss-Appell enforces the instantaneous kinematic constraints and recovers Euler at the instant. In steady flows, this principle cannot select circulation or stagnation points because these are properties of the velocity state, not the instantaneous acceleration correction. The principle only determines the reaction pressure for an already-specified velocity field. The impressed/reaction pressure decomposition can be supplemented with orthogonality conditions, allowing physical inputs (e.g. circulation, freestream) to be embedded while maintaining exact constraint enforcement. This variational viewpoint provides a diagnostic for computational incompatibility: In a practical computation, spikes in projection effort may signal problematic boundary conditions or under-resolution, and clarifies how pressure instantaneously maintains solenoidality without creating or destroying vorticity. The goal of this note is simply to lend more clarity to the application of the Gauss principle, and to connect it concretely to well known concepts including potential flow theory, projection algorithms, and recent variational approaches.</description>

      <title>Exotic B-series representation of the Feller semigroup for It\^o diffusions and the MSR path integral</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the expansion of the Feller semigroup of a one-dimensional It\^o diffusion as a power series in time. Taking our moves from previous results on expansions labelled by exotic trees, we derive an explicit expression for the combinatorial factors involved, that leads to an exotic Butcher series representation. A key step is the extension of the notion of tree factorial and Connes-Moscovici weight to this richer family of rooted trees. The ensuing expression is suitable for a comparison with the perturbative path integral construction of the statistics of the diffusion, known in the literature as Martin-Siggia-Rose formalism. Resorting to multi-indices to represent pre-Feynman diagrams, we show that the latter coincides with the exotic B-series representation of the semigroup, giving it a solid mathematical foundation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, a detailed examination of a specific case of a generalized quasi-Einstein manifold (GQE)n is provided. It begins by exploring generalized quasi-Einstein spacetimes under certain conditions. The analysis then focuses on cases that admit a parallel time-like vector field. Among the findings, it is demonstrated that such spacetimes can be categorized as generalized Robertson-Walker spacetimes, Robertson-Walker spacetimes, and quasi-constant curvature spacetimes. Additionally, the physical implications of these results are discussed. It is also investigated (GQE)4 spacetimes, which accept F(R)-gravity and feature a parallel unit time-like vector field. Finally, various energy conditions are analyzed based on the results related to F(R)-gravity.</description>

      <title>Generalized boundary rigidity and minimal surface transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a generalized boundary rigidity problem, which investigates whether the areas of embedded minimal surfaces can uniquely determine a Riemannian manifold with boundary. We prove that for a conformal perturbation of an analytic metric in dimension $n+1$ ($n \geq 2$), the metric is determined by these volumes under an ampleness condition. Furthermore, we establish H\"older stability for this determination. This result extends earlier works in dimension $2+1$. Instead of relying on reductions to Calder\'on type problems and complex geometrical optics solutions, we study the linearized forward operator that gives rise to the minimal surface transform, a generalization of the X-ray/Radon transform. We demonstrate that this transform fits into the framework of double fibration transforms and satisfies the Bolker condition in the sense of Guillemin. Under certain assumptions, including a foliation condition, we prove invertibility of this transform on an analytic manifold as well as recovery of the analytic wave front set. The methods developed in this paper offer new tools for addressing the generalized boundary rigidity problem and expand the scope of applications of double fibration transforms. We anticipate that these techniques will also be applicable to other geometric inverse problems. Beyond mathematics, our results have implications for the AdS/CFT correspondence in physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the probability that the origin is connected to the boundary of the box of size $n$ (the one-arm probability) in several percolation models related to the Ising model. We prove that different universality classes emerge at criticality.
  - For the FK-Ising measure in a box of size $n$ with wired boundary conditions, we prove that this probability decays as $1/n$ in dimensions $d&gt;4$, and as $1/n^{1+o(1)}$ when $d=4$.
  - For the infinite volume FK-Ising measure, we prove that this probability decays as $1/n^2$ in dimensions $d&gt;6$, and as $1/n^{2+o(1)}$ when $d=6$.
  - For the sourceless double random current measure, we prove that this probability decays as $1/n^{d-2}$ in dimensions $d&gt;4$.
  Additionally, for the infinite volume FK-Ising measure, we show that the one-arm probability is $1/n^{1+o(1)}$ in dimension $d=4$, and at least $1/n^{3/2}$ in dimension $d=5$. This establishes that the FK-Ising model has upper-critical dimension equal to $6$, in contrast to the Ising model, where it is known to be less or equal to $4$, thus solving a conjecture of Chayes, Coniglio, Machta, and Schtengel.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a problem with three equivalent formulations: describing Gibbs measures for five-vertex model in quadrant; classifying coherent systems on a p-deformation of the Gelfand-Tsetlin graph related to Grothendieck polynomials; finding the Martin boundary for discrete time TASEP with p-geometric jumps. We find a wide family of the Gibbs measures, parameterized by certain analytic functions. A subset of our measures have probabilistic interpretation as interacting particle systems with fixed particles speeds. In contrast to previous related boundary problems, we find that admissible speeds are not arbitrary, but must be larger than $\frac{p}{1-p}$. For this subset we further establish Law of Large Numbers and Central Limit Theorem, connecting the fluctuations to families of independent GUE eigenvalues. As a consequence, the measures from the subset are extreme points of the Martin boundary. It remains open whether our list of measures is exhaustive.</description>

      <title>The critical case for the concentration of eigenfunctions on singular Riemannian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a compact Riemannian manifold with boundary with a certain class of critical singular Riemannian metrics that are singular at the boundary. The corresponding Laplace-Beltrami operator can be seen as a Grushin-type operator plus a potential. We show in the critical case that the average density of eigenfunctions for the Laplace-Beltrami operator with eigenvalues below $\lambda&gt;0$ is distributed over all length scales between $\lambda^{-1/2}$ and $1$ near the boundary. We give a precise description of this distribution as $\lambda\to\infty$.</description>

      <title>Resonances and resonance expansions for point interactions on the half-space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12998v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we describe the resonances of the singular perturbation of the Laplacian on the half space $\Omega =\mathbb R^3_+$ given by the self-adjoint operator named $\delta$-interaction. We will assume Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions on $\partial \Omega$. At variance with the well known case of $\mathbb R^3$, the resonances constitute an infinite set, here completely characterized. Moreover, we prove that resonances have an asymptotic distribution satisfying a modified Weyl law and we give the semiclassical asymptotics. Finally we give applications of the results to the asymptotic behavior of the abstract wave and Schr\"odinger dynamics generated by the Laplacian with a point interaction on the half-space</description>

      <title>Exact Solution for Two $\delta$-Interacting Bosons on a Ring in the Presence of a $\delta$-Barrier: Asymmetric Bethe Ansatz for Spatially Odd States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17371v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we apply the recently proposed Asymmetric Bethe Ansatz method to the problem of two one-dimensional, short-range-interacting bosons on a ring in the presence of a $\delta$-function barrier. Only half of the Hilbert space--namely, the two-body states that are odd under point inversion about the position of the barrier--is accessible to this method. The other half is presumably non-integrable. We consider benchmarking the recently proposed $1/g$ expansion about the hard-core boson point [A. G. Volosniev, D. V. Fedorov, A. S. Jensen, M. Valiente, N. T. Zinner, Nature Communications 5, 5300 (2014)] as one application of our results. Additionally, we find that when the $\delta$-barrier is converted to a $\delta$-well with strength equal to that of the particle-particle interaction, the system exhibits the spectrum of its non-interacting counterpart while its eigenstates display features of a strongly interacting system. We discuss this phenomenon in the "Summary and Future Research" section of our paper.</description>

      <title>Effective Dynamics for Weakly Interacting Bosons in an Iterated High-Density Thermodynamic Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00839v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the time evolution of weakly interacting Bose gases on a three-dimensional torus of arbitrary volume. The coupling constant is supposed to be inversely proportional to the density, which is considered to be large and independent of the particle number. We take into account a class of initial states exhibiting quasi-complete Bose-Einstein condensation. For each fixed time in a finite interval, we prove the convergence of the one-particle reduced density matrix towards the projection onto the normalised order parameter describing the condensate - evolving according to the Hartree equation - in the iterated limit where the volume (and therefore the particle number), and subsequently the density go to infinity. The rate of convergence depends only on the density and on the decay of both the expected number of particles and the energy of the initial quasi-vacuum state.</description>

      <title>Operator-Consistent Physics-Informed Learning for Wafer Thermal Reconstruction in Lithography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09207v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thermal field reconstruction in post-exposure bake (PEB) is critical for advanced lithography, yet current physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) suffer from inconsistent accuracy due to a misalignment between geometric coordinates, physical fields, and differential operators. To resolve this, we introduce a novel architecture that unifies these elements on a single computation graph by integrating LSTM-gated mechanisms within a Liquid Neural Network (LNN) backbone. This specific combination of gated liquid layers is necessary to dynamically regulate the network's spectral behavior and enforce operator-level consistency, which ensures stable training and high-fidelity predictions. Applied to a 2D PEB scenario with internal heat generation and convective boundaries, our model formulates residuals via differential forms and a composite loss functional. The results demonstrate rapid convergence, uniformly low errors, strong agreement with FEM benchmarks, and stable training without late-stage oscillations, outperforming existing baselines in accuracy and robustness. Our framework thus establishes a reliable foundation for high-fidelity thermal modeling and offers a transferable strategy for operator-consistent neural surrogates in other physical domains.</description>

      <title>Cost of Simulating Entanglement in Steering Scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.09060v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement is a fundamental feature of quantum mechanics, yet certain entangled states that are unsteerable can be classically simulated in steering scenarios, making them unable to exhibit quantum steering. Despite their significance, a systematic comparison of such entangled states has not been explored. In this work, we quantify the resource content of unsteerable quantum states in terms of the amount of shared randomness required to simulate the assemblages they generate in the steering scenario. We rigorously demonstrate that the simulation cost is unbounded even for certain unsteerable two-qubit states. Moreover, the simulation cost of entangled two-qubit states is always strictly larger than that for any separable state.
  A significant portion of our results rests on the relationship between the simulation cost of two-qubit Werner states and that of noisy spin measurements. Using noisy spin measurements as our central example, we also investigate the minimum number of outcomes a parent measurement requires to simulate a given set of compatible measurements. Although certain continuous measurement families admit a finite-outcome parent measurement, we identify scenarios where the simulation cost is unbounded. Our results establish previously unknown lower bounds and upper bounds on the shared randomness simulation cost, supported by connections between the simulation cost of noisy spin measurements and various geometric inequalities, including ones from the zonotope approximation problem in Banach space theory.</description>

      <title>General integrated rate law for complex self-assembly reactions reveals the mechanism of amyloid-beta co-aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15932v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Analyzing kinetic experiments on protein aggregation using integrated rate laws has led to numerous advances in our understanding of the fundamental chemical mechanisms behind amyloidogenic disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. However, the description of biologically relevant processes may require rate equations that are too complex to solve using existing methods, hindering mechanistic insights into these processes. An example of significance is co-aggregation in environments containing multiple amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide alloforms, which may play a crucial role in the biochemistry of Alzheimer's disease but whose mechanism is still poorly understood. Here, we use the mathematics of symmetry to derive a general integrated rate law valid for most plausible linear self-assembly reactions. We use it in conjunction with experimental data to determine the mechanism of co-aggregation of the most physiologically abundant Abeta alloforms: Abeta42, Abeta40, Abeta38 and Abeta37 peptides. We find that Abeta42 fibril surfaces catalyze the formation of co-oligomers, which accelerate new Abeta40, Abeta38 and Abeta37 fibril formation whilst inhibiting secondary nucleation of new Abeta42 fibrils. The simplicity, accuracy and broad applicability of our general integrated rate law will enable kinetic analysis of more complex filamentous self-assembly reactions, both with and without co-aggregation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.01489v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a generalisation of the Moore-Tachikawa varieties for the case in which the target category of the 2D TFT is a hyperk$\ddot{\text{a}}$hler quotient. The setup requires generalising the bordism operators of Moore and Segal to the case involving lack of reparametrisation-invariance on the Riemann surface, ultimately enabling to relate this to the issue of defining a Drinfeld center for composite class ${\cal S}$ theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.01618v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study It\^o SDE systems driven by oscillating functions of a single It\^o diffusion process. In the limit when oscillations become fast, we show that the solution process converges in law to the process defined by an SDE system driven by a multivariate Wiener process whose covariance we calculate explicitly. Interestingly, the limiting system of SDEs are most naturally stated using the Stratonovich integral. The problem has been originally motivated by experimental work and special cases of theorems proved here provide a rigorous treatment of equations arising from physics.</description>

      <title>Geometric derivation and structure-preserving simulation of quasi-geostrophy on the sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13707v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a geometric derivation of the quasi-geostrophic equations on the sphere, starting from the rotating shallow water equations. We utilise perturbation series methods in vorticity and divergence variables. The derivation employs asymptotic analysis techniques, leading to a global quasi-geostrophic potential vorticity model on the sphere without approximation of the Coriolis parameter. The resulting model forms a closed system for the evolution of potential vorticity with a rich mathematical structure, including Lagrangian and Hamiltonian descriptions. Formulated using the Lie-Poisson bracket reveals the geometric invariants of the quasi-geostrophic model. Motivated by these geometric results, simulations of quasi-geostrophic flow on the sphere are presented based on structure-preserving Lie-Poisson time-integration. We explicitly demonstrate the preservation of Casimir invariants and show that the hyperbolic quasi-geostrophic equations can be simulated in a stable manner over long time. We show the emergence of longitudonal jets, wrapped around the circumference of the sphere in a general direction that is perpendicular to the axis of rotation.</description>

      <title>$\Delta_T$ Noise in Mesoscopic Hybrid Junctions: Influence of Barrier Strength and Thermal Bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10990v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum noise is a fundamental probe of quantum transport phenomena, offering insights into current correlations and wave-particle duality. A particularly intriguing form of such noise, $\Delta_T$ noise, emerges under a finite temperature difference in the absence of charge current at zero voltage bias. In this work, we investigate $\Delta_T$ noise in mesoscopic hybrid junctions incorporating insulating barriers, where the average charge current remains zero at zero bias. Using quantum shot noise measurements, we demonstrate that $\Delta_T$ noise in metal-insulator-superconductor (NIS) junctions is approximately $16$ times greater than in metal-insulator-metal (NIN) counterparts. Our analysis further reveals that $\Delta_T$ noise exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on barrier strength, rising to a peak before declining, while increasing monotonically with the applied temperature bias. These findings underscore the rich interplay between thermal gradients and barrier properties in determining quantum noise characteristics in hybrid mesoscopic systems.</description>

      <title>Exploring $G$-ality defects in 2-dim QFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12151v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Tambara-Yamagami (TY) fusion category symmetry $\text{TY}(\mathbb{A},\chi,\epsilon)$ describes the enhanced non-invertible self-duality symmetry of a $2$-dim QFT under gauging a finite Abelian group $\mathbb{A}$. We generalize the enhanced non-invertible symmetries by considering twisted gauging which allows stacking $\mathbb{A}$-SPTs before and after the gauging. Such non-invertible symmetries can be obtained from invertible anyon permutation symmetries of the $3$-dim SymTFT. Consider a finite group $G$ formed by (un)twisted gaugings of $\mathbb{A}$, a $2$-dim QFT invariant under topological manipulations in $G$ admits non-invertible \textit{$G$-ality defects}. We study the classification and the physical implication of the $G$-ality defects using the SymTFT and the group-theoretical fusion categories, with three concrete examples. 1) Triality with $\mathbb{A} = \mathbb{Z}_N \times \mathbb{Z}_N$ where $N$ is coprime with $3$. The classification was previously determined by Jordan and Larson where the data is similar to the $\text{TY}$ fusion categories, and we determine the anomaly of these fusion categories. 2) $p$-ality with $\mathbb{A} = \mathbb{Z}_p \times \mathbb{Z}_p$ where $p$ is an odd prime. We consider two such categories $\mathcal{P}_{\pm,m}$ which are distinguished by different choices of the symmetry fractionalization, a new data that does not appear in the TY classification, and show that they have distinct anomaly structures and spin selection rules. 3) $S_3$-ality with $\mathbb{A} = \mathbb{Z}_N \times \mathbb{Z}_N$. We study their classification explicitly for $N &lt; 20$ via SymTFT, and provide a group-theoretical construction for certain $N$. We find $N=5$ is the minimal $N$ to admit an $S_3$-ality and $N=11$ is the minimal $N$ to admit a group-theoretical $S_3$-ality.</description>

      <title>Gelation in Vector Multiplicative Coalescence and Extinction in Multi-Type Poisson Branching Processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06910v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note, we present a novel connection between a multi-type (vector) multiplicative coalescent process and a multi-type branching process with Poisson offspring distributions. More specifically, we show that the equations that govern the phenomenon of gelation in the vector multiplicative coalescent process are equivalent to the equations that yield the extinction probabilities of the corresponding multi-type Poisson branching process. We then leverage this connection with two applications, one in each direction. The first is a new quick proof of gelation in the vector multiplicative coalescent process, and the second is a new series expression for the extinction probabilities of the multi-type Poisson branching process. We also use random graphs to give a new derivation of the solution to the modified Smoluchowski coagulation equations, which describe the vector multiplicative coalescent process.</description>

Abstract: Global solution curve and exact multiplicity of positive solutions for a class of fourth-order beam equations with clamped boundary conditions are derived. The results extend atheorem of P. Korman (2004) by allowing the presence of a singularity in the nonlinearity. The paper also establishes an a priori estimate for C3-norm of positive solutions, which is optimal in Holder regularity. Applications to MEMS/NEMS models are presented.</description>

      <title>Dynamical localization and eigenvalue asymptotics: long-range hopping lattice operators with electric field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02692v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove power-law dynamical localization for polynomial long-range hopping lattice operators with uniform electric field under any bounded perturbation. Actually, we introduce new arguments in the study of dynamical localization for long-range models with unbounded potentials, involving the Min-Max Principle and a notion of Power-Law ULE. Unlike existing results in the literature, our approach does not rely on KAM techniques or on Green's function estimates, but rather on the asymptotic behavior of the eigenvalues and the potential. It is worth underlining that our general results can be applied to other models, such as Maryland-type potentials.</description>

      <title>Non-Markovian Noise Mitigation: Practical Implementation, Error Analysis, and the Role of Environment Spectral Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05019v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum error mitigation(QEM), an error suppression strategy without the need for additional ancilla qubits for noisy intermediate-scale quantum~(NISQ) devices, presents a promising avenue for realizing quantum speedups of quantum computing algorithms on current quantum devices. However, prior investigations have predominantly been focused on Markovian noise. In this paper, we propose a non-Markovian Noise Mitigation(NMNM) method by extending the probabilistic error cancellation (PEC) method in the QEM framework to treat non-Markovian noise. We present the derivation of a time-local quantum master equation where the decoherence coefficients are directly obtained from bath correlation functions(BCFs), key properties of a non-Markovian environment that will make the error mitigation algorithms environment-aware. We further establish a direct connection between the overall approximation error and sampling overhead of QEM and the spectral property of the environment. Numerical simulations performed on a spin-boson model further validate the efficacy of our approach.</description>

      <title>Topological consequences of null-geodesic refocusing and applications to $Z^x$ manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23565v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $(M,h)$ be a connected, complete Riemannian manifold, let $x\in M$ and $l&gt;0$. Then $M$ is called a $Z^x$ manifold if all geodesics starting at $x$ return to $x$ and it is called a $Y^x_l$ manifold if every unit-speed geodesic starting at $x$ returns to $x$ at time $l$. It is unknown whether there are $Z^x$ manifolds that are not $Y^x_l$-manifolds for some $l&gt;0$. By the B\'erard-Bergery theorem, any $Y^x_l$ manifold of dimension at least $2$ is compact with finite fundamental group. We prove the same result for $Z^x$ manifolds $M$ for which all unit-speed geodesics starting at $x$ return to $x$ in uniformly bounded time. We also prove that any $Z^x$ manifold $(M,h)$ with $h$ analytic is a $Y^x_l$ manifold for some $l&gt;0$. We start by defining a class of globally hyperbolic spacetimes (called observer-refocusing) such that any $Z^x$ manifold is the Cauchy surface of some observer-refocusing spacetime. We then prove that under suitable conditions the Cauchy surfaces of observer-refocusing spacetimes are compact with finite fundamental group and show that analytic observer-refocusing spacetimes of dimension at least $3$ are strongly refocusing. We end by stating a contact-theoretic conjecture analogous to our results in Riemannian and Lorentzian geometry.</description>

      <title>Higher-derivative Heterotic Kerr-Sen Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20077v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We obtain the four-derivative corrections to the Kerr-Sen solution in heterotic supergravity, which includes the Gibbons-Maeda-Garfinkle-Horowitz-Strominger solution as a limiting case. In particular, we first embed the Kerr solution into heterotic supergravity and compute the higher-derivative corrections. We then obtain the corrections to the Kerr-Sen solution by performing an $O(2,1)$ boost of the Kerr solution, which, in contrast to the two-derivative case, requires field redefinitions to make the $O(2,1)$ invariance of the action manifest. Finally, we compute the multipole moments and find that they are distinct from those of the Kerr solution at the four-derivative level. We also find that the multipole moments are distinct from those of the Kerr-Newman solution in Einstein-Maxwell theory at the four-derivative level, even for the most general choice of four-derivative corrections. This gives a way to experimentally distinguish traces of string theory in gravitational wave data.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness of the periodic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with concentrated nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00594v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the solution theory of the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with a concentrated nonlinearity on the torus. In particular, we establish existence and uniqueness of global energy-conserving solutions for initial data in $H^1$. Our approach is based on two approximation schemes, namely the concentrated limit of a smoothed nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation and the inviscid limit of a concentrated complex Ginzburg--Landau equation. We also prove the existence and uniquness of solutions below the energy space. To our knowledge, this is the first rigorous solution theory for a periodic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with a concentrated nonlinearity.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17115v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a number of 1+1d lattice models with anti-unitary symmetries that simultaneously reflect space and reverse time. Some of these symmetries are anomalous, leading to Lieb-Schultz-Mattis-type constraints, thus excluding a trivially gapped phase. Examples include a mod 8 anomaly in the Majorana chain and various mod 2 anomalies in the spin chain. In some cases, there is an exact, non-anomalous lattice symmetry that flows in the continuum to CPT. In some other cases, the CPT symmetry of the continuum theory is emergent or absent. Depending on the model, the anomaly of the lattice model is matched in the continuum in different ways. In particular, it can be mapped to an emergent anomaly of an emanant symmetry.</description>

      <title>Short-time blowup statistics of a Brownian particle in repulsive potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01252v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of an overdamped Brownian particle in a repulsive scale-invariant potential $V(x) \sim -x^{n+1}$. For $n &gt; 1$, a particle starting at position $x$ reaches infinity in a finite, randomly distributed time. We focus on the short-time tail $T \to 0$ of the probability distribution $P(T, x, n)$ of the blowup time $T$ for integer $n &gt; 1$. Krapivsky and Meerson [Phys. Rev. E \textbf{112}, 024128 (2025)] recently evaluated the leading-order asymptotics of this tail, which exhibits an $n$-dependent essential singularity at $T = 0$. Here we provide a more accurate description of the $T \to 0$ tail by calculating, for all $n = 2, 3, \dots$, the previously unknown large pre-exponential factor of the blowup-time probability distribution. To this end, we apply a WKB approximation -- at both leading and subleading orders -- to the Laplace-transformed backward Fokker--Planck equation governing $P(T, x, n)$. For even $n$, the WKB solution alone suffices. For odd $n$, however, the WKB solution breaks down in a narrow boundary layer around $x = 0$. In this case, it must be supplemented by an ``internal'' solution and a matching procedure between the two solutions in their common region of validity.</description>

      <title>Large deviation principles for the Gross Pitaevskii Gibbs measure at low temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13206v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the large deviation principle for the conditional Gibbs measure associated with the focusing Gross Pitaevskii equation in the low temperature regime. This conditional measure is of mixed type, being canonical in energy and microcanonical in particle number. In particular, our result extends the large deviation principle for the mixed ensemble studied by Ellis, Jordan, Otto, and Turkington to a more singular setting, where the interaction potential is unbounded and the conditional event involves diverging renormalization constants. As a consequence of the large deviation principle, the Gibbs measure concentrates along the soliton manifold in the low temperature limit.</description>
