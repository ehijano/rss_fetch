      <title>Price Levels in Heterogeneous-Agent Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a model of the Fiscal Theory of the Price Level (FTPL) in a Bewley-Huggett-Aiyagari framework with heterogeneous agents. The model is set in continuous time, and ex post heterogeneity arises due to idiosyncratic, uninsurable income shocks. Such models have a natural interpretation as mean-field games, introduced by Huang, Caines, and Malham\'e and by Lasry and Lions. We highlight this connection and discuss the existence and multiplicity of stationary equilibria in models with and without capital. Our focus is on the mathematical analysis, and we prove the existence of two equilibria in which the government runs constant primary deficits, which in turn implies the existence of multiple price levels.</description>

      <title>TEE-BFT: Pricing the Security of Data Center Execution Assurance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blockchains face inherent limitations when communicating outside their own ecosystem, largely due to the Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) 3f+1 security model. Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) are a promising mitigation because they allow a single trusted broker to interface securely with external systems.
  This paper develops a cost-of-collusion principal-agent model for compromising a TEE in a Data Center Execution Assurance design. The model isolates the main drivers of attack profitability: a K-of-n coordination threshold, independent detection risk q, heterogeneous per-member sanctions F_i, and a short-window flow prize (omega) proportional to the value secured (beta times V).
  We derive closed-form deterrence thresholds and a conservative design bound (V_safe) that make collusion unprofitable under transparent parameter choices. Calibrations based on time-advantaged arbitrage indicate that plausible TEE parameters can protect on the order of one trillion dollars in value. The analysis informs the design of TEE-BFT, a blockchain architecture that combines BFT consensus with near-stateless TEEs, distributed key generation, and on-chain attestation to maintain security when interacting with external systems.</description>

      <title>The Effect of Using Popular Mathematical Puzzles on The Mathematical Thinking of Syrian Schoolchildren</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we provide a good overview of the problems and the background of mathematics education in Syrian schools. We aimed to study the effect of using popular mathematical puzzles on the mathematical thinking of schoolchildren, by conducting a paired experimental study (pre-test and post-test control group design) of the data we obtained through a sample taken from students of sixth-grade primary school students in Syria the Lady Mary School in Syria, in order to evaluate the extent of the impact of popular mathematical puzzles on students' ability to solve problems and mathematical skills, and then the skills were measured and the results were analyzed using a t-test as a tool for statistical analysis.</description>

      <title>Robust Welfare under Imperfect Competition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study welfare analysis for policy changes when supply behavior is only partially known. We augment the robust-demand approach of Kang and Vasserman (2025) with two supply primitives--intervals of feasible pass-through and conduct (market-power) parameters--applied to two equilibrium snapshots. A simple accounting identity distills the supply-side contribution to welfare to a simple integral expression. From there, we deduce that the bounds are produced by a single-threshold "bang-bang" inverse pass-through function. This, plus a modification of Kang and Vasserman's (2025) demand-side characterization, delivers simple bounds for consumer surplus, producer surplus, tax revenue, total surplus, and deadweight loss. We also study an ad valorem extension.</description>

      <title>On fairness of multi-center allocation problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21812v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate Ekici (2024b)'s multi-center allocation problems, focusing on fairness in this context. We introduce three fairness notions that respect centers' priorities: internal fairness, external fairness, and procedural fairness. The first notion eliminates envy among agents within the same center, the second prohibits envy across different centers, and the third rules out envy from an ex-ante perspective through agents' trading opportunities. We provide two characterizations of a natural extension of the top-trading-cycles mechanism (TTC) through our fairness notions. Precisely, we show that in the presence of strategy-proofness and pair efficiency, internal fairness and external fairness together characterize TTC (Theorem 1). Also, strategy-proofness combined solely with procedural fairness also characterizes TTC (Theorem 2). Furthermore, by adding internal fairness, we establish our third TTC characterization, by relaxing Ekici's queuewise rationality to another voluntary participation condition, the center lower bound (Theorem 3). Finally, we define a core solution within this model and characterize it through TTC (Theorem 4). Our findings offer practical insights for market designers, particularly in contexts such as international cooperation in medical programs and worker exchange programs.</description>

      <title>The Learning Approach to Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00227v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a unified framework for analyzing games in greater depth. In the existing literature, players' strategies are typically assigned scalar values, and equilibrium concepts are used to identify compatible choices. However, this approach neglects the internal structure of players, thereby failing to accurately model observed behaviors.
  To address this limitation, we propose an abstract definition of a player, consistent with constructions in reinforcement learning. Instead of defining games as external settings, our framework defines them in terms of the players themselves. This offers a language that enables a deeper connection between games and learning. To illustrate the need for this generality, we study a simple two-player game and show that even in basic settings, a sophisticated player may adopt dynamic strategies that cannot be captured by simpler models or compatibility analysis.
  For a general definition of a player, we discuss natural conditions on its components and define competition through their behavior. In the discrete setting, we consider players whose estimates largely follow the standard framework from the literature. We explore connections to correlated equilibrium and highlight that dynamic programming naturally applies to all estimates. In the mean-field setting, we exploit symmetry to construct explicit examples of equilibria. Finally, we conclude by examining relations to reinforcement learning.</description>
