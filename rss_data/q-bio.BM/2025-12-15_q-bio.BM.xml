      <title>Model Reduction of Multicellular Communication Systems via Singular Perturbation: Sender Receiver Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate multicellular sender receiver systems embedded in hydrogel beads, where diffusible signals mediate interactions among heterogeneous cells. Such systems are modeled by PDE ODE couplings that combine three dimensional diffusion with nonlinear intracellular dynamics, making analysis and simulation challenging. We show that the diffusion dynamics converges exponentially to a quasi steady spatial profile and use singular perturbation theory to reduce the model to a finite dimensional multiagent network. A closed form communication matrix derived from the spherical Green's function captures the effective sender receiver coupling. Numerical results show the reduced model closely matches the full dynamics while enabling scalable simulation of large cell populations.</description>

      <title>Task-Specific Sparse Feature Masks for Molecular Toxicity Prediction with Chemical Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reliable in silico molecular toxicity prediction is a cornerstone of modern drug discovery, offering a scalable alternative to experimental screening. However, the black-box nature of state-of-the-art models remains a significant barrier to adoption, as high-stakes safety decisions demand verifiable structural insights alongside predictive performance. To address this, we propose a novel multi-task learning (MTL) framework designed to jointly enhance accuracy and interpretability. Our architecture integrates a shared chemical language model with task-specific attention modules. By imposing an L1 sparsity penalty on these modules, the framework is constrained to focus on a minimal set of salient molecular fragments for each distinct toxicity endpoint. The resulting framework is trained end-to-end and is readily adaptable to various transformer-based backbones. Evaluated on the ClinTox, SIDER, and Tox21 benchmark datasets, our approach consistently outperforms both single-task and standard MTL baselines. Crucially, the sparse attention weights provide chemically intuitive visualizations that reveal the specific fragments influencing predictions, thereby enhancing insight into the model's decision-making process.</description>

      <title>Large Language Model Agent for Modular Task Execution in Drug Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02925v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a modular framework powered by large language models (LLMs) that automates and streamlines key tasks across the early-stage computational drug discovery pipeline. By combining LLM reasoning with domain-specific tools, the framework performs biomedical data retrieval, literature-grounded question answering via retrieval-augmented generation, molecular generation, multi-property prediction, property-aware molecular refinement, and 3D protein-ligand structure generation. The agent autonomously retrieved relevant biomolecular information, including FASTA sequences, SMILES representations, and literature, and answered mechanistic questions with improved contextual accuracy compared to standard LLMs. It then generated chemically diverse seed molecules and predicted 75 properties, including ADMET-related and general physicochemical descriptors, which guided iterative molecular refinement. Across two refinement rounds, the number of molecules with QED &gt; 0.6 increased from 34 to 55. The number of molecules satisfying empirical drug-likeness filters also rose; for example, compliance with the Ghose filter increased from 32 to 55 within a pool of 100 molecules. The framework also employed Boltz-2 to generate 3D protein-ligand complexes and provide rapid binding affinity estimates for candidate compounds. These results demonstrate that the approach effectively supports molecular screening, prioritization, and structure evaluation. Its modular design enables flexible integration of evolving tools and models, providing a scalable foundation for AI-assisted therapeutic discovery.</description>
