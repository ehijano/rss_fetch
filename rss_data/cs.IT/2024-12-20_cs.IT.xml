      <title>Approximation Schemes for Age of Information Minimization in UAV Grid Patrols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the critical need for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to patrol grid systems in hazardous and dynamically changing environments, this study addresses a routing problem aimed at minimizing the time-average Age of Information (AoI) for edges in general graphs. We establish a lower bound for all feasible patrol policies and demonstrate that this bound is tight when the graph contains an Eulerian cycle. For graphs without Eulerian cycles, it becomes challenging to identify the optimal patrol strategy due to the extensive range of feasible options. Our analysis shows that restricting the strategy to periodic sequences still results in an exponentially large number of possible strategies. To address this complexity, we introduce two polynomial-time approximation schemes, each involving a two-step process: constructing multigraphs first and then embedding Eulerian cycles within these multigraphs. We prove that both schemes achieve an approximation ratio of 2. Further, both analytical and numerical results suggest that evenly and sparsely distributing edge visits within a periodic route significantly reduces the average AoI compared to strategies that merely minimize the route travel distance. Building on this insight, we propose a heuristic method that not only maintains the approximation ratio of 2 but also ensures robust performance across varying random graphs.</description>

      <title>Additive codes attaining the Griesmer bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Additive codes may have better parameters than linear codes. However, still very few cases are known and the explicit construction of such codes is a challenging problem. Here we show that a Griesmer type bound for the length of additive codes can always be attained with equality if the minimum distance is sufficiently large. This solves the problem for the optimal parameters of additive codes when the minimum distance is large and yields many infinite series of additive codes that outperform linear codes.</description>

      <title>Directivity-Aware Degrees of Freedom Analysis for Extremely Large-Scale MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) communications, enabled by numerous antenna elements integrated into large antenna surfaces, can provide increased effective degree of freedom (EDoF) to achieve high diversity gain. However, it remains an open problem that how the EDoF is influenced by the directional radiation pattern of antenna elements. In this work, empowered by the wavenumber-domain channel representation, we analyze the EDoF in a general case where the directivity of antennas, determined by the antenna structure and element spacing, is considered. Specifically, we first reveal the uneven distribution of directivity-aware wavenumber-domain coupling coefficients, i.e., channel gain towards different directions, in the isotropic Rayleigh fading channel. EDoF is then calculated based on such distribution of coupling coefficients. A numerical method is also provided to obtain coupling coefficients via electromagnetic full-wave simulations. Due to the influence of antenna directivity, how EDoF and ergodic channel capacity vary with the element spacing are explored via simulations for different antenna types.</description>

      <title>Logic Induced High-Order Reasoning Network for Event-Event Relation Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To understand a document with multiple events, event-event relation extraction (ERE) emerges as a crucial task, aiming to discern how natural events temporally or structurally associate with each other. To achieve this goal, our work addresses the problems of temporal event relation extraction (TRE) and subevent relation extraction (SRE). The latest methods for such problems have commonly built document-level event graphs for global reasoning across sentences. However, the edges between events are usually derived from external tools heuristically, which are not always reliable and may introduce noise. Moreover, they are not capable of preserving logical constraints among event relations, e.g., coreference constraint, symmetry constraint and conjunction constraint. These constraints guarantee coherence between different relation types,enabling the generation of a uniffed event evolution graph. In this work, we propose a novel method named LogicERE, which performs high-order event relation reasoning through modeling logic constraints. Speciffcally, different from conventional event graphs, we design a logic constraint induced graph (LCG) without any external tools. LCG involves event nodes where the interactions among them can model the coreference constraint, and event pairs nodes where the interactions among them can retain the symmetry constraint and conjunction constraint. Then we perform high-order reasoning on LCG with relational graph transformer to obtain enhanced event and event pair embeddings. Finally, we further incorporate logic constraint information via a joint logic learning module. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method with state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets.</description>

      <title>On the structure of the Schur squares of Twisted Generalized Reed-Solomon codes and application to cryptanalysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Twisted generalized Reed-Solomon (TGRS) codes constitute an interesting family of evaluation codes, containing a large class of maximum distance separable codes non-equivalent to generalized Reed-Solomon (GRS) ones. Moreover, the Schur squares of TGRS codes may be much larger than those of GRS codes with same dimension. Exploiting these structural differences, in 2018, Beelen, Bossert, Puchinger and Rosenkilde proposed a subfamily of Maximum Distance Separable (MDS) Twisted Reed-Solomon (TRS) codes over $\mathbb{F}_q$ with $\ell$ twists $q \approx n^{2^{\ell}}$ for McEliece encryption, claiming their resistance to both Sidelnikov Shestakov attack and Schur products--based attacks. In short, they claimed these codes to resist to classical key recovery attacks on McEliece encryption scheme instantiated with Reed-Solomon (RS) or GRS codes. In 2020, Lavauzelle and Renner presented an original attack on this system based on the computation of the subfield subcode of the public TRS code.
  In this paper, we show that the original claim on the resistance of TRS and TGRS codes to Schur products based--attacks is wrong. We identify a broad class of codes including TRS and TGRS ones that is distinguishable from random by computing the Schur square of some shortening of the code. Then, we focus on the case of single twist (i.e., $\ell = 1$), which is the most efficient one in terms of decryption complexity, to derive an attack. The technique is similar to the distinguisher-based attacks of RS code-based systems given by Couvreur, Gaborit, Gauthier-Uma\~na, Otmani, Tillich in 2014.</description>

      <title>Split Learning in Computer Vision for Semantic Segmentation Delay Minimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel approach to minimize the inference delay in semantic segmentation using split learning (SL), tailored to the needs of real-time computer vision (CV) applications for resource-constrained devices. Semantic segmentation is essential for applications such as autonomous vehicles and smart city infrastructure, but faces significant latency challenges due to high computational and communication loads. Traditional centralized processing methods are inefficient for such scenarios, often resulting in unacceptable inference delays. SL offers a promising alternative by partitioning deep neural networks (DNNs) between edge devices and a central server, enabling localized data processing and reducing the amount of data required for transmission. Our contribution includes the joint optimization of bandwidth allocation, cut layer selection of the edge devices' DNN, and the central server's processing resource allocation. We investigate both parallel and serial data processing scenarios and propose low-complexity heuristic solutions that maintain near-optimal performance while reducing computational requirements. Numerical results show that our approach effectively reduces inference delay, demonstrating the potential of SL for improving real-time CV applications in dynamic, resource-constrained environments.</description>

      <title>Alpha-NML Universal Predictors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2202.12737v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by the connection between classical regret measures employed in universal prediction and R\'{e}nyi divergence, we introduce a new class of universal predictors that depend on a real parameter $\alpha\geq 1$. This class interpolates two well-known predictors, the mixture estimators, that include the Laplace and the Krichevsky-Trofimov predictors, and the Normalized Maximum Likelihood (NML) estimator. We point out some advantages of this new class of predictors and study its benefits from two complementary viewpoints: (1) we prove its optimality when the maximal R\'{e}nyi divergence is considered as a regret measure, which can be interpreted operationally as a middle ground between the standard average and worst-case regret measures; (2) we discuss how it can be employed when NML is not a viable option, as an alternative to other predictors such as Luckiness NML. Finally, we apply the $\alpha$-NML predictor to the class of discrete memoryless sources (DMS), where we derive simple formulas to compute the predictor and analyze its asymptotic performance in terms of worst-case regret.</description>

      <title>New Constructions of Optimal Binary LCD Codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.00906v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Linear complementary dual (LCD) codes can provide an optimum linear coding solution for the two-user binary adder channel. LCD codes also can be used to against side-channel attacks and fault non-invasive attacks. Let $d_{LCD}(n, k)$ denote the maximum value of $d$ for which a binary $[n,k, d]$ LCD code exists. In \cite{BS21}, Bouyuklieva conjectured that $d_{LCD}(n+1, k)=d_{LCD}(n, k)$ or $d_{LCD}(n, k) + 1$ for any lenth $n$ and dimension $k \ge 2$. In this paper, we first prove Bouyuklieva's conjecture \cite{BS21} by constructing a binary $[n,k,d-1]$ LCD codes from a binary $[n+1,k,d]$ $LCD_{o,e}$ code, when $d \ge 3$ and $k \ge 2$. Then we provide a distance lower bound for binary LCD codes by expanded codes, and use this bound and some methods such as puncturing, shortening, expanding and extension, we construct some new binary LCD codes. Finally, we improve some previously known values of $d_{LCD}(n, k)$ of lengths $38 \le n \le 40$ and dimensions $9 \le k \le 15$. We also obtain some values of $d_{LCD}(n, k)$ with $41 \le n \le 50$ and $6 \le k \le n-6$.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic Information Theory-Based Statistical Channel Model for Improved Channel Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.12446v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electromagnetic information theory (EIT) is an emerging interdisciplinary subject that integrates classical Maxwell electromagnetics and Shannon information theory. The goal of EIT is to uncover the information transmission mechanisms from an electromagnetic (EM) perspective in wireless systems. Existing works on EIT are mainly focused on the analysis of EM channel characteristics, degrees-of-freedom, and system capacity. However, these works do not clarify how to integrate EIT knowledge into the design and optimization of wireless systems. To fill in this gap, in this paper, we propose an EIT-based statistical channel model with simplified parameterization. Thanks to the simplified closed-form expression of the EMCF, it can be readily applied to various channel modeling and inference tasks. Specifically, by averaging the solutions of Maxwell's equations over a tunable von Mises distribution, we obtain a spatio-temporal correlation function (STCF) model of the EM channel, which we name as the EMCF. Furthermore, by tuning the parameters of the EMCF, we propose an EIT-based covariance estimator (EIT-Cov) to accurately capture the channel covariance. Since classical MMSE estimators can exploit prior information contained in the channel covariance matrix, we further propose the EIT-MMSE channel estimator by substituting EMCF for the covariance matrix. Simulation results show that both the proposed EIT-Cov covariance estimator and the EIT-MMSE channel estimator outperform their baseline algorithms, thus proving that EIT is beneficial to wireless communication systems.</description>

      <title>Wideband Beamforming for RIS Assisted Near-Field Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11141v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A near-field wideband beamforming scheme is investigated for reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) assisted multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, in which a deep learning-based end-to-end (E2E) optimization framework is proposed to maximize the system spectral efficiency. To deal with the near-field double beam split effect, the base station is equipped with frequency-dependent hybrid precoding architecture by introducing sub-connected true time delay (TTD) units, while two specific RIS architectures, namely true time delay-based RIS (TTD-RIS) and virtual subarray-based RIS (SA-RIS), are exploited to realize the frequency-dependent passive beamforming at the RIS. Furthermore, the efficient E2E beamforming models without explicit channel state information are proposed, which jointly exploits the uplink channel training module and the downlink wideband beamforming module. In the proposed network architecture of the E2E models, the classical communication signal processing methods, i.e., polarized filtering and sparsity transform, are leveraged to develop a signal-guided beamforming network. Numerical results show that the proposed E2E models have superior beamforming performance and robustness to conventional beamforming benchmarks. Furthermore, the tradeoff between the beamforming gain and the hardware complexity is investigated for different frequency-dependent RIS architectures, in which the TTD-RIS can achieve better spectral efficiency than the SA-RIS while requiring additional energy consumption and hardware cost.</description>

      <title>Deep Reinforcement Learning Enhanced Rate-Splitting Multiple Access for Interference Mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05974v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study explores the application of the rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) technique, vital for interference mitigation in modern communication systems. It investigates the use of precoding methods in RSMA, especially in complex multiple-antenna interference channels, employing deep reinforcement learning. The aim is to optimize precoders and power allocation for common and private data streams involving multiple decision-makers. A multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) framework is employed to address this complexity, where decentralized agents collectively learn to optimize actions in a continuous policy space. We also explore the challenges posed by imperfect channel side information at the transmitter. Additionally, decoding order estimation is addressed to determine the optimal decoding sequence for common and private data sequences. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed RSMA method based on MADDPG, achieving the upper bound in single-antenna scenarios and closely approaching theoretical limits in multi-antenna scenarios. Comparative analysis shows superiority over other techniques such as MADDPG without rate-splitting, maximal ratio transmission (MRT), zero-forcing (ZF), and leakage-based precoding methods. These findings highlight the potential of deep reinforcement learning-driven RSMA in reducing interference and enhancing system performance in communication systems.</description>

      <title>Beamforming Optimization for Continuous Aperture Array (CAPA)-based Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13677v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The beamforming optimization in continuous aperture array (CAPA)-based multi-user communications is studied. In contrast to conventional spatially discrete antenna arrays, CAPAs can exploit the full spatial degrees of freedom (DoFs) by emitting information-bearing electromagnetic (EM) waves through continuous source current distributed across the aperture. Nevertheless, such an operation renders the beamforming optimization problem as a non-convex integral-based functional programming problem, which is challenging for conventional discrete optimization methods. A couple of low-complexity approaches are proposed to solve the functional programming problem. 1) Calculus of variations (CoV)-based approach: Closed-form structure of the optimal continuous source patterns are derived based on CoV, inspiring a low-complexity integral-free iterative algorithm for solving the functional programming problem. 2) Correlation-based zero-forcing (Corr-ZF) approach: Closed-form ZF source current patterns that completely eliminate the inter-user interference are derived based on the channel correlations. By using these patterns, the original functional programming problem is transformed to a simple power allocation problem, which can be solved using the classical water-filling approach with reduced complexity. Our numerical results validate the effectiveness of the proposed designs and reveal that: i) compared to the state-of-the-art Fourier-based discretization approach, the proposed CoV-based approach not only improves communication performance but also reduces computational complexity by up to hundreds of times for large CAPA apertures and high frequencies, and ii) the proposed Corr-ZF approach achieves asymptotically optimal performance compared to the CoV-based approach.</description>

      <title>Learning Discretized Neural Networks under Ricci Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.03390v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study Discretized Neural Networks (DNNs) composed of low-precision weights and activations, which suffer from either infinite or zero gradients due to the non-differentiable discrete function during training. Most training-based DNNs in such scenarios employ the standard Straight-Through Estimator (STE) to approximate the gradient w.r.t. discrete values. However, the use of STE introduces the problem of gradient mismatch, arising from perturbations in the approximated gradient. To address this problem, this paper reveals that this mismatch can be interpreted as a metric perturbation in a Riemannian manifold, viewed through the lens of duality theory. Building on information geometry, we construct the Linearly Nearly Euclidean (LNE) manifold for DNNs, providing a background for addressing perturbations. By introducing a partial differential equation on metrics, i.e., the Ricci flow, we establish the dynamical stability and convergence of the LNE metric with the $L^2$-norm perturbation. In contrast to previous perturbation theories with convergence rates in fractional powers, the metric perturbation under the Ricci flow exhibits exponential decay in the LNE manifold. Experimental results across various datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior and more stable performance for DNNs compared to other representative training-based methods.</description>

      <title>Radiance Field Delta Video Compression in Edge-Enabled Vehicular Metaverse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11857v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) offload computationally intensive tasks to multi-access edge computing (MEC) servers via vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication, enabling applications within the vehicular metaverse, which transforms physical environment into the digital space enabling advanced analysis or predictive modeling. A core challenge is physical-to-virtual (P2V) synchronization through digital twins (DTs), reliant on MEC networks and ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC). To address this, we introduce radiance field (RF) delta video compression (RFDVC), which uses RF-encoder and RF-decoder architecture using distributed RFs as DTs storing photorealistic 3D urban scenes in compressed form. This method extracts differences between CAV-frame capturing actual traffic and RF-frame capturing empty scene from the same camera pose in batches encoded and transmitted over the MEC network. Experiments show data savings up to 71% against H.264 codec and 44% against H.265 codec under different conditions as lighting changes, and rain. RFDVC also demonstrates resilience to transmission errors, achieving up to +0.29 structural similarity index measure (SSIM) improvement at block error rate (BLER) = 0.35 in non-rainy and +0.25 at BLER = 0.2 in rainy conditions, ensuring superior visual quality compared to standard video coding (VC) methods across various conditions.</description>

      <title>On the metric mean dimensions of saturated sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09218v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Saturated set and its reduced case, the set of generic points, constitute two significant types of fractal-like sets in multifractal analysis of dynamical systems. In the context of infinite entropy systems, this paper aims to give some qualitative aspects of saturated sets and the set of generic points in both topological and measure-theoretic perspectives. For systems with specification property, we establish the certain variational principles for saturated sets in terms of Bowen and packing metric mean dimensions, and show the upper capacity metric mean dimension of saturated sets have full metric mean dimension. All results are useful for understanding the topological structures of dynamical systems with infinite topological entropy.
  As applications, we further exhibit some qualitative aspects of metric mean dimensions of level sets and the set of mean Li-Yorke pairs in infinite entropy systems.</description>
