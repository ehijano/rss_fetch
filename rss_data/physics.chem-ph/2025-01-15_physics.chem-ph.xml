      <title>Richardson-Gaudin states of non-zero seniority I: matrix elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Seniority-zero wavefunctions describe bond-breaking processes qualitatively. As eigenvectors of a model Hamiltonian, Richardson-Gaudin states provide a clear physical picture and allow for systematic improvement via standard single reference approaches. Until now, this treatment has been done in the seniority-zero channel. In this manuscript, the corresponding states with higher seniorities are identified, and their couplings through the Coulomb Hamiltonian are computed. In every case, the couplings between the states are computed from the cofactors of their effective overlap matrix. Proof of principle calculations demonstrate that a single reference configuration interaction is comparable with seniority-based configuration interaction computations at a substantially reduced cost. The next manuscript in this series will identify the corresponding Slater-Condon rules and make the computations feasible.</description>

      <title>Impedance of a hydrogen--fed SOFC anode: Analytical and numerical models based on the dusty gas transport model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analytical low-current and numerical high--current models for the impedance of a hydrogen--fed anode of an anode--supported button SOFC are developed. The models use the dusty gas transport model for the binary H$_2$--H$_2$O mixture. We show that neglecting the pressure gradient may lead to a severe underestimation of the effective hydrogen diffusivity in the support layer. A least-squares fitting of the analytical model to a literature spectrum of a button cell is demonstrated. The analytical impedance allows to indicate traps when using equivalent circuits with the Warburg finite-length element for fitting experimental spectra. The model parameters include the Knudsen hydrogen diffusivity, hydraulic permeability, porosity/tortuosity ratio of the support layer and the ionic conductivity, double layer capacitance, and HOR Tafel slope of the active layer. All of the above parameters can be obtained by fitting the models to experimental spectra.</description>

      <title>Strong coupling M{\o}ller-Plesset perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Perturbative approaches are methods to efficiently tackle many-body problems, offering both intuitive insights and analysis of correlation effects. However, their application to systems where light and matter are strongly coupled is non-trivial. Specifically, the definition of suitable orbitals for the zeroth-order Hamiltonian represents a significant theoretical challenge. While reviewing previously investigated orbital choices, this work presents an alternative polaritonic orbital basis suitable for the strong coupling regime. We develop a quantum electrodynamical (QED) M{\o}ller-Plesset perturbation theory using orbitals obtained from the strong coupling QED Hartree-Fock. We assess the strengths and limitations of the different approaches and emphasize the essential role of using a consistent molecular orbital framework to achieve an accurate description of cavity-induced electron-photon correlation effects.</description>

      <title>Superoxide anion (O$_{2}\negthinspace^{-}$) collisions with CO$_{2}$ molecules in the energy range 50-950 eV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel gas-phase molecular scattering study is reported for O$_{2}\negthinspace^{-}$ colliding with CO$_{2}$ for impact energies ranging from 50 to 950 eV. The absolute total electron detachment, relative total and partial ionization cross sections have been measured within this energy range and the positive ion yield of those produced during the collisions has been obtained. The primary anionic beam projectile is produced in a pulsed hollow cathode discharge induced plasma, and its interactions with the neutral molecular target occur in a gas cell at a well-known constant pressure. For impact energies above 500 eV high mass (m $&gt;$ 44 u) charged complexes have been detected. With the aid of a theoretical study, using ab initio methods, we propose a mechanism to infer on the formation of these cationic species, which have been assigned as projectile-target stable compounds (CO$_{3}\negthinspace^{+}$ and CO$_{4}\negthinspace^{+}$).</description>

      <title>Ultrasensitive Electrochemical Sensor for Perfluorooctanoic Acid Detection Using Two-dimensional Aluminium Quasicrystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), often referred as "forever chemicals," are pervasive environmental pollutants due to their resistance to degradation. Among these, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) poses significant threats to human health, contaminating water sources globally. Here, we have demonstrated the potential of a novel electrochemical sensor based on two-dimensional (2D) aluminium-based multicomponent quasicrystals (2D-Al QC) for the ultrasensitive sub-picomolar level detection of PFOA. The 2D-Al QC-inked electrode was employed here to detect PFOA by differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). The limit of detection (LoD) achieved is 0.59 +/- 0.05 pM. The sensor was evaluated for selectivity with other interfering compounds, repeatability of cycles, and reproducibility for five similar electrodes with a deviation of 0.8 %. The stability of the sensor has also been analysed after ninety days ,which shows a minimal variation of 15%. Spectroscopic techniques and theoretical calculations were further utilized to understand the interaction between the 2D-Al QC and PFOA. The results demonstrate that the 2D-Al QC offers a promising platform for the rapid and sensitive detection of PFOA, potentially addressing current environmental monitoring challenges.</description>

      <title>Planetary Nebulae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Planetary nebulae are formed by the matter ejected by low-to-intermediate mass stars (~0.8-8 times the mass of the Sun) towards the end of their lives. As hydrogen and then helium fuel sources run out, stars expand. During these giant phases stars also lose sizable amounts of mass. During the second giant phase, after the exhaustion of core helium, the mass loss is so great that stars lose a large fraction of their mass (50 - 90%), leaving behind a small, hot core, known as a white dwarf, surrounded by a nebula. Planetary nebulae are the result of many processes that shape and alter their ionization structure and chemical composition. The resulting nebula, illuminated by the ultraviolet-rich spectrum of the remnant very hot stellar core, is a spectacle of beauty and science. In this chapter, we show that these objects are invaluable laboratories for astrophysics, astrochemistry, and astromineralogy studies, with impact in many areas of Astronomy.</description>

      <title>Double Microwave Shielding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop double microwave shielding, which has recently enabled evaporative cooling to the first Bose-Einstein condensate of polar molecules [Bigagli et al., Nature 631, 289 (2024)]. Two microwave fields of different frequency and polarization are employed to effectively shield polar molecules from inelastic collisions and three-body recombination. Here, we describe in detail the theory of double microwave shielding. We demonstrate that double microwave shielding effectively suppresses two- and three-body losses. Simultaneously, dipolar interactions and the scattering length can be flexibly tuned, enabling comprehensive control over interactions in ultracold gases of polar molecules. We show that this approach works for a wide range of molecules. This opens the door to studying many-body physics with strongly interacting dipolar quantum matter.</description>

      <title>FragPT2: Multi-Fragment Wavefunction Embedding with Perturbative Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05250v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Embedding techniques allow the efficient description of correlations within localized fragments of large molecular systems, while accounting for their environment at a lower level of theory. We introduce FragPT2: a novel embedding framework that addresses multiple interacting active fragments. Fragments are assigned separate active spaces, constructed by localizing canonical molecular orbitals. Each fragment is then solved with a multi-reference method, self-consistently embedded in the mean field from other fragments. Finally, inter-fragment correlations are reintroduced through multi-reference perturbation theory. Our framework provides an exhaustive classification of inter-fragment interaction terms, offering a tool to analyze the relative importance of various processes such as dispersion, charge transfer, and spin exchange. We benchmark FragPT2 on challenging test systems, including \ce{N_2} dimers, multiple aromatic dimers, and butadiene. We demonstrate that our method can be succesful even for fragments defined by cutting through a covalent bond.</description>

      <title>Three-states model for calculating the $X$-$X$ rovibrational transition intensities in hydroxyl radical</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12353v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The best available line list of OH [Brooke et al. (2016)] contains the high-quality line frequencies, yet the line intensities need refinement because the model function used to interpolate the RKR potential and to extrapolate it into the repulsion region was not analytic [Medvedev et al. Mol. Phys. (2024)], and also because the coupling between the ground $X^2\Pi$ and first excited $A^2\Sigma^+$ electronic states was treated by the perturbation theory. In this paper, we performed ab initio calculations of all necessary molecular functions at $r=0.4$-8.0 bohr, and then we construct fully analytic model functions entering the Hamiltonian. The model functions were fitted to both the \ai\ data and the available experimental data on the line positions and energy levels, the relative line intensities, and the transition dipole moments derived from the measured permanent dipoles. The system of three coupled Schr\"odinger equations for two multiplet components of the $X$ state plus the $A$ state was solved to calculate the energy levels and the line intensities. The new set of the \EinA\ permits to decrease the scatter of the logarithmic populations of the ro-vibrational levels derived from the observed radiation fluxes [Noll et al. (2020)], to achieve better agreement with the measured relative intensities, and to obtain significant differences in the intensities of the $\Lambda$ doublets for large $v$ and $J$ as observed by Noll et al. The $X$-$A$ coupling fully modifies the Q-line intensities at high $J$ by removing the well-known $J^{-2}$ dependence. A new line list is constructed where the transition frequencies are from Brooke \etal\ and the \EinA\ are from the present study. However, not all the problems with the intensities were resolved, presumably due to the neglect of the interaction with the $^4\Sigma^-,^2\Sigma^-$ and $^4\Pi$ repulsive electronic terms.</description>

      <title>Quantum Chemical and Trajectory Surface Hopping Molecular Dynamics Study of Iodine-based BODIPY Photosensitizer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10893v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A computational study of I-BODIPY (2-ethyl-4,4-difluoro-6,7-diiodo-1,3-dimethyl-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene) was conducted to investigate its photophysical properties as a potential triplet photosensitizer for singlet oxygen generation. Multireference CASPT2 and CASSCF methods were used to calculate vertical excitation energies and spin-orbit couplings (SOCs) in a model monoiodinated BODIPY molecule to assess the applicability of the single-reference ADC(2) method.
  Time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) with the Tamm-Dancoff approximation (TDA) was tested against ADC(2) using different exchange-correlation functionals, employing a two-component pseudopotential basis set for iodine. SOC magnitudes between excited states were discussed using the Slater-Condon rules. The geometry dependence of SOCs for the lowest states was also examined.
  TD-DFT/B3LYP and TD-DFT(TDA)/BHLYP were selected for subsequent absorption spectra and trajectory surface hopping (TSH) molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Two bright states were identified in I-BODIPY's visible spectrum, showing a red shift due to iodine substitution. Excited-state MD simulations, including nonadiabatic effects and SOCs, were performed to investigate relaxation after photoexcitation to the S1 state.
  TSH MD simulations revealed that intersystem crossings occur on a similar timescale to internal conversions. After triplet population growth, a "saturation" phase was reached with a triplet-to-singlet ratio of about 4:1. The calculated triplet quantum yield of 0.85 agrees qualitatively with the experimental singlet oxygen generation yield of 0.99.</description>

      <title>Refining Coarse-Grained Molecular Topologies: A Bayesian Optimization Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02707v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations are essential for accurately predicting the physical and chemical properties of large molecular systems across various pressure and temperature ensembles. However, the high computational costs associated with All-Atom (AA) MD simulations have led to the development of Coarse-Grained Molecular Dynamics (CGMD), providing a lower-dimensional compression of the AA structure into representative CG beads, offering reduced computational expense at the cost of predictive accuracy. Existing CGMD methods, such as CG-Martini (calibrated against experimental data), aim to generate an embedding of a topology that sufficiently generalizes across a range of structures. Detrimentally, in attempting to specify parameterization with applicability across molecular classes, it is unable to specialize to domain-specific applications, where sufficient accuracy and computational speed are critical. This work presents a novel approach to optimize derived results from CGMD simulations by refining the general-purpose Martini3 topologies for domain-specific applications using Bayesian Optimization methodologies. We have developed and validated a CG potential applicable to any degree of polymerization, representing a significant advancement in the field. Our optimized CG potential, based on the Martini3 framework, aims to achieve accuracy comparable to AAMD while maintaining the computational efficiency of CGMD. This approach bridges the gap between efficiency and accuracy in multiscale molecular simulations, potentially enabling more rapid and cost-effective molecular discovery across various scientific and technological domains.</description>
