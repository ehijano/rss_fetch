      <title>Breaking Rank -- A Novel Unscented Kalman Filter for Parameter Estimations of a Lumped-Parameter Cardiovascular Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We make modifications to the unscented Kalman filter (UKF) which bestow almost complete practical identifiability upon a lumped-parameter cardiovascular model with 10 parameters and 4 output observables - a highly non-linear, stiff problem of clinical significance. The modifications overcome the challenging problems of rank deficiency when applying the UKF to parameter estimation. Rank deficiency usually means only a small subset of parameters can be estimated. Traditionally, pragmatic compromises are made, such as selecting an optimal subset of parameters for estimation and fixing non-influential parameters. Kalman filters are typically used for dynamical state tracking, to facilitate the control u at every time step. However, for the purpose of parameter estimation, this constraint no longer applies. Our modification has transformed the utility of UKF for the parameter estimation purpose, including minimally influential parameters, with excellent robustness (i.e., under severe noise corruption, challenging patho-physiology, and no prior knowledge of parameter distributions). The modified UKF algorithm is robust in recovering almost all parameters to over 98% accuracy, over 90% of the time, with a challenging target data set of 50, 10-parameter samples. We compare this to the original implementation of the UKF algorithm for parameter estimation and demonstrate a significant improvement.</description>

      <title>Weights on finite fields and failures of the MacWilliams identities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the 1960s, MacWilliams proved that the Hamming weight enumerator of a linear code over a finite field completely determines, and is determined by, the Hamming weight enumerator of its dual code. In particular, if two linear codes have the same Hamming weight enumerator, then their dual codes have the same Hamming weight enumerator.
  In contrast, there is a wide class of weights on finite fields whose weight enumerators have the opposite behavior: there exist two linear codes having the same weight enumerator, but their dual codes have different weight enumerators.</description>

      <title>State-Dependent Fading Gaussian Channel with Common Reconstruction Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The task of jointly communicating a message and reconstructing a common estimate of the channel state is examined for a fading Gaussian model with additive state interference. The state is an independent and identically distributed Gaussian sequence known noncausally at the transmitter, and the instantaneous fading coefficient is perfectly known at both the transmitter and the receiver. The receiver is required to decode the transmitted message and, in addition, reconstruct the state under a common reconstruction constraint ensuring that its estimate coincides with that at the transmitter. A complete characterization of the optimal rate distortion tradeoff region for this setting is the main result of our work. The analytical results are also validated through numerical examples illustrating the rate distortion and power distortion tradeoffs.</description>

      <title>DeepFP: Deep-Unfolded Fractional Programming for MIMO Beamforming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work proposes a mixed learning-based and optimization-based approach to the weighted-sum-rates beamforming problem in a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless network. The conventional methods, i.e., the fractional programming (FP) method and the weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE) algorithm, can be computationally demanding for two reasons: (i) they require inverting a sequence of matrices whose sizes are proportional to the number of antennas; (ii) they require tuning a set of Lagrange multipliers to account for the power constraints. The recently proposed method called the reduced WMMSE addresses the above two issues for a single cell. In contrast, for the multicell case, another recent method called the FastFP eliminates the large matrix inversion and the Lagrange multipliers by using an improved FP technique, but the update stepsize in the FastFP can be difficult to decide. As such, we propose integrating the deep unfolding network into the FastFP for the stepsize optimization. Numerical experiments show that the proposed method is much more efficient than the learning method based on the WMMSE algorithm.</description>

      <title>Context-aware Privacy Bounds for Linear Queries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linear queries, as the basis of broad analysis tasks, are often released through privacy mechanisms based on differential privacy (DP), the most popular framework for privacy protection. However, DP adopts a context-free definition that operates independently of the data-generating distribution. In this paper, we revisit the privacy analysis of the Laplace mechanism through the lens of pointwise maximal leakage (PML). We demonstrate that the distribution-agnostic definition of the DP framework often mandates excessive noise. To address this, we incorporate an assumption about the prior distribution by lower-bounding the probability of any single record belonging to any specific class. With this assumption, we derive a tight, context-aware leakage bound for general linear queries, and prove that our derived bound is strictly tighter than the standard DP guarantee and converges to the DP guarantee as this probability lower bound approaches zero. Numerical evaluations demonstrate that by exploiting this prior knowledge, the required noise scale can be reduced while maintaining privacy guarantees.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.03126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The choice of an isomorphism, a duality, between a finite abelian group $A$ and its character group allows one to define dual codes of additive codes over $A$. Properties of dualities and dual codes are studied, continuing work of Delsarte from 1973 and more recent work of Dougherty and his collaborators.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we determine the minimum distance of the Euclidean dual of the cyclic code $\mathcal{C}_n$ generated by the $n$th cyclotomic polynomial $Q_n(x)$ over $\mathbb{F}_q$, for every positive integer $n$ co-prime to $q$. In particular, we prove that the minimum distance of $\mathcal{C}_{n}^{\perp}$ is a function of $n$, namely $2^{\omega(n)}$. This was precisely the conjecture posed by us in \cite{BHAGAT2025}.</description>

      <title>On the Capacity Region of Individual Key Rates in Vector Linear Secure Aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide new insights into an open problem recently posed by Yuan-Sun [ISIT 2025], concerning the minimum individual key rate required in the vector linear secure aggregation problem. Consider a distributed system with $K$ users, where each user $k\in [K]$ holds a data stream $W_k$ and an individual key $Z_k$. A server aims to compute a linear function $\mathbf{F}[W_1;\ldots;W_K]$ without learning any information about another linear function $\mathbf{G}[W_1;\ldots;W_K]$, where $[W_1;\ldots;W_K]$ denotes the row stack of $W_1,\ldots,W_K$. The open problem is to determine the minimum required length of $Z_k$, denoted as $R_k$, $k\in [K]$. In this paper, we characterize a new achievable region for the rate tuple $(R_1,\ldots,R_K)$. The region is polyhedral, with vertices characterized by a binary rate assignment $(R_1,\ldots,R_K) = (\mathbf{1}(1 \in \mathcal{I}),\ldots,\mathbf{1}(K\in \mathcal{I}))$, where $\mathcal{I}\subseteq [K]$ satisfies the \textit{rank-increment condition}: $\mathrm{rank}\left(\bigl[\mathbf{F}_{\mathcal{I}};\mathbf{G}_{\mathcal{I}}\bigr]\right) =\mathrm{rank}\bigl(\mathbf{F}_{\mathcal{I}}\bigr)+N$. Here, $\mathbf{F}_\mathcal{I}$ and $\mathbf{G}_\mathcal{I}$ are the submatrices formed by the columns indexed by $\mathcal{I}$. Our results uncover the novel fact that it is not necessary for every user to hold a key, thereby strictly enlarging the best-known achievable region in the literature. Furthermore, we provide a converse analysis to demonstrate its optimality when minimizing the number of users that hold keys.</description>

      <title>Compressed Qubit Noise Spectroscopy: Piecewise-Linear Modeling and Rademacher Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Random pulse sequences are a powerful method for qubit noise spectroscopy, enabling efficient reconstruction of sparse noise spectra. Here, we advance this method in two complementary directions. First, we extend the method using a regularizer based on the total generalized variation (TGV) norm, in order to reconstruct a larger class of noise spectra, namely piecewise-linear noise spectra, which more realistically model many physical systems. We show through numerical simulations that the new method resolves finer spectral features, while maintaining an order-of-magnitude speedup over conventional approaches to noise spectroscopy. Second, we simplify the experimental implementation of the method, by introducing Rademacher measurements for reconstructing sparse noise spectra. These measurements use pseudorandom pulse sequences that can be generated in real time from a short random seed, reducing experimental complexity without compromising reconstruction accuracy. Together, these developments broaden the reach of random pulse sequences for accurate and efficient noise characterization in realistic quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Normalized Conditional Mutual Information Surrogate Loss for Deep Neural Classifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel information theoretic surrogate loss; normalized conditional mutual information (NCMI); as a drop in alternative to the de facto cross-entropy (CE) for training deep neural network (DNN) based classifiers. We first observe that the model's NCMI is inversely proportional to its accuracy. Building on this insight, we introduce an alternating algorithm to efficiently minimize the NCMI. Across image recognition and whole-slide imaging (WSI) subtyping benchmarks, NCMI-trained models surpass state of the art losses by substantial margins at a computational cost comparable to that of CE. Notably, on ImageNet, NCMI yields a 2.77% top-1 accuracy improvement with ResNet-50 comparing to the CE; on CAMELYON-17, replacing CE with NCMI improves the macro-F1 by 8.6% over the strongest baseline. Gains are consistent across various architectures and batch sizes, suggesting that NCMI is a practical and competitive alternative to CE.</description>

      <title>The Sequence Reconstruction of Permutations under Hamming Metric with Small Errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02844v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The sequence reconstruction problem asks for the recovery of a sequence from multiple noisy copies, where each copy may contain up to $r$ errors. In the case of permutations on \(n\) letters under the Hamming metric, this problem is closely related to the parameter $N(n,r)$, the maximum intersection size of two Hamming balls of radius $r$. While previous work has resolved \(N(n,r)\) for small radii (\(r \leq 4\)) and established asymptotic bounds for larger \(r\), we present new exact formulas for \(r \in \{5,6,7\}\) using group action techniques. In addition, we develop a formula for \(N(n,r)\) based on the irreducible characters of the symmetric group \(S_n\), along with an algorithm that enables computation of \(N(n,r)\) for larger parameters, including cases such as \(N(43,8)\) and \(N(24,14)\).</description>

      <title>Quantum-Enhanced Neural Contextual Bandit Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic contextual bandits are fundamental for sequential decision-making but pose significant challenges for existing neural network-based algorithms, particularly when scaling to quantum neural networks (QNNs) due to issues such as massive over-parameterization, computational instability, and the barren plateau phenomenon. This paper introduces the Quantum Neural Tangent Kernel-Upper Confidence Bound (QNTK-UCB) algorithm, a novel algorithm that leverages the Quantum Neural Tangent Kernel (QNTK) to address these limitations.
  By freezing the QNN at a random initialization and utilizing its static QNTK as a kernel for ridge regression, QNTK-UCB bypasses the unstable training dynamics inherent in explicit parameterized quantum circuit training while fully exploiting the unique quantum inductive bias. For a time horizon $T$ and $K$ actions, our theoretical analysis reveals a significantly improved parameter scaling of $\Omega((TK)^3)$ for QNTK-UCB, a substantial reduction compared to $\Omega((TK)^8)$ required by classical NeuralUCB algorithms for similar regret guarantees. Empirical evaluations on non-linear synthetic benchmarks and quantum-native variational quantum eigensolver tasks demonstrate QNTK-UCB's superior sample efficiency in low-data regimes. This work highlights how the inherent properties of QNTK provide implicit regularization and a sharper spectral decay, paving the way for achieving ``quantum advantage'' in online learning.</description>

      <title>Similarity-Sensitive Entropy: Induced Kernels and Data-Processing Inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study an entropy functional $H_K$ that is sensitive to a prescribed similarity structure on a state space. For finite spaces, $H_K$ coincides with the order-1 similarity-sensitive entropy of Leinster and Cobbold. We work in the general measure-theoretic setting of kernelled probability spaces $(\Omega,\mu,K)$ introduced by Leinster and Roff, and develop basic structural properties of $H_K$.
  Our main results concern the behavior of $H_K$ under coarse-graining. For a measurable map $f:\Omega\to Y$ and input law $\mu$, we define a law-induced kernel on $Y$ whose pullback minimally dominates $K$, and show that it yields a coarse-graining inequality and a data-processing inequality for $H_K$, for both deterministic maps and general Markov kernels. We also introduce conditional similarity-sensitive entropy and an associated mutual information, and compare their behavior to the classical Shannon case.</description>

      <title>Finite Memory Belief Approximation for Optimal Control in Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study finite memory belief approximation for partially observable (PO) stochastic optimal control (SOC) problems. While belief states are sufficient for SOC in partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs), they are generally infinite-dimensional and impractical. We interpret truncated input-output (IO) histories as inducing a belief approximation and develop a metric-based theory that directly relates information loss to control performance. Using the Wasserstein metric, we derive policy-conditional performance bounds that quantify value degradation induced by finite memory along typical closed-loop trajectories. Our analysis proceeds via a fixed-policy comparison: we evaluate two cost functionals under the same closed-loop execution and isolate the effect of replacing the true belief by its finite memory approximation inside the belief-level cost. For linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) systems, we provide closed-form belief mismatch evaluation and empirically validate the predicted mechanism, demonstrating that belief mismatch decays approximately exponentially with memory length and that the induced performance mismatch scales accordingly. Together, these results provide a metric-aware characterization of what finite memory belief approximation can and cannot achieve in PO settings.</description>

      <title>On the permutation automorphisms of binary cubic codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10667v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A binary linear code whose permutation automorphism group has a fixed point free permutation of order $3$ is called a binary cubic code. The scope of this paper is to investigate the structural properties of binary cubic codes. Let $C$ be a binary cubic $[n,k]$ code. In this paper, we prove that if $n\geq 30$ and $C$ has permutation automorphism group of order three, then $k\geq 6$. Additionally, we show that if $n &lt; 30$ and $k\leq 4$, then the permutation automorphism group of $C$ has order greater than three. Moreover, along the way, we provide some results on the structure of the higher dimensional cubic codes. In particular, we present some results concerning the structure of the putative extremal self-dual $[72,36,16]$ code under the assumption that it is cubic.</description>

      <title>On Differential and Boomerang Properties of a Class of Binomials over Finite Fields of Odd Characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11486v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the differential and boomerang properties of a class of binomial $F_{r,u}(x) = x^r(1 + u\chi(x))$ over the finite field $\mathbb{F}_{p^n}$, where $r = \frac{p^n+1}{4}$, $p^n \equiv 3 \pmod{4}$, and $\chi(x) = x^{\frac{p^n -1}{2}}$ is the quadratic character in $\mathbb{F}_{p^n}$. We show that $F_{r,\pm1}$ is locally-PN with boomerang uniformity $0$ when $p^n \equiv 3 \pmod{8}$. To the best of our knowledge, it is the second known non-PN function class with boomerang uniformity $0$, and the first such example over odd characteristic fields with $p &gt; 3$. Moreover, we show that $F_{r,\pm1}$ is locally-APN with boomerang uniformity at most $2$ when $p^n \equiv 7 \pmod{8}$. We also provide complete classifications of the differential and boomerang spectra of $F_{r,\pm1}$. Furthermore, we thoroughly investigate the differential uniformity of $F_{r,u}$ for $u\in \mathbb{F}_{p^n}^* \setminus \{\pm1\}$.</description>

      <title>Constructions of binary self-orthogonal singly-even minimal linear codes violating the Aschikhmin-Barg condition with few weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12240v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We first establish a simple yet powerful necessary and sufficient condition for a binary linear code to be SO, leading to a complete characterization of singly-even codes in this family. We further derive necessary and sufficient conditions on Boolean and vectorial Boolean functions for generating such codes via a standard construction method. Building on this foundation, we propose three general frameworks for constructing binary SO singly-even minimal non-AB linear codes with few weights. The first two approaches are based on designing Boolean and vectorial Boolean functions that simultaneously satisfy multiple conditions. The third method generates new SO codes from existing ones. As a result, we obtain many infinite classes of binary self-orthogonal singly-even minimal linear codes violating the AB condition with few weights and fully determined weight distributions. Particularly, numerical results show that some duals of our codes are optimal or near-optimal.</description>

      <title>Confusions and Erasures of Error-Bounded Block Decoders with Finite Blocklength</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16665v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates two distinct types of block errors - undetected errors (confusions) and erasures - in additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels with error-bounded block decoders operating in the finite blocklength (FBL) regime. While block error rate (BLER) is a common metric, it does not distinguish between confusions and erasures, which can have significantly different impacts in cross-layer protocol design, despite upper-layer protocols universally assuming physical (PHY) errors manifest as packet erasures rather than undetected corruptions - an assumption lacking rigorous PHY-layer validation. We present a systematic analysis of confusions and erasures under BLER-constrained maximum likelihood (ML) decoding. Through sphere-packing analysis, we provide analytical bounds for both block confusion and erasure probabilities, and derive the sensitivities of these bounds to blocklength and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on this topic in the FBL regime. Our findings provide theoretical validation for the block erasure channel abstraction commonly assumed in medium access control (MAC) and network layer protocols, confirming that, for practical FBL codes, block confusions are negligible compared to block erasures, especially at large blocklengths and high SNR.</description>

      <title>A Method For Bounding Tail Probabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13662v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a method for upper and lower bounding the right and the left tail probabilities of continuous random variables (RVs). For the right tail probability of RV $X$ with probability density function $f (x)$, this method requires first setting a continuous, positive, and strictly decreasing function $g (x)$ such that $-f (x)/g' (x)$ is a decreasing and increasing function, $\forall x&gt;x_0$, which results in upper and lower bounds, respectively, given in the form $-f (x) g (x)/g' (x)$, $\forall x&gt;x_0$, where $x_0$ is some point. Similarly, for the upper and lower bounds on the left tail probability of $X$, this method requires first setting a continuous, positive, and strictly increasing function $g (x)$ such that $f (x)/g' (x)$ is an increasing and decreasing function, $\forall x&lt;x_0$, which results in upper and lower bounds, respectively, given in the form $f (x) g (x)/g' (x)$, $\forall x&lt;x_0$. We provide some examples of good candidates for the function $g (x)$. We also establish connections between the new bounds and Markov's inequality and Chernoff's bound. In addition, we provide an iterative method for obtaining ever tighter lower and upper bounds, under certain conditions. As an application, we use the proposed method to derive a novel closed-form asymptotic expression of the converse bound on the capacity of the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel in the finite-blocklength regime, which is tighter than the closed-form asymptotic expression by Polyanskiy-Poor-Verd\'u. Finally, we provide numerical examples where we show the tightness of the bounds obtained by the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Secure Semantic Communications in the Age of Generative and Agentic AI: Threats and Opportunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01791v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Semantic communication (SemCom) improves communication efficiency by transmitting task-relevant information instead of raw bits and is expected to be a key technology for 6G networks. Recent advances in generative AI (GenAI) further enhance SemCom by enabling robust semantic encoding and decoding under limited channel conditions. However, these efficiency gains also introduce new security and privacy vulnerabilities. Due to the broadcast nature of wireless channels, eavesdroppers can also use powerful GenAI-based semantic decoders to recover private information from intercepted signals. Moreover, rapid advances in agentic AI enable eavesdroppers to perform long-term and adaptive inference through the integration of memory, external knowledge, and reasoning capabilities. This allows eavesdroppers to further infer user private behavior and intent beyond the transmitted content. Motivated by these emerging challenges, this paper comprehensively rethinks the security and privacy of SemCom systems in the age of generative and agentic AI. We first present a systematic taxonomy of eavesdropping threat models in SemCom systems. Then, we provide insights into how GenAI and agentic AI can enhance eavesdropping threats. Meanwhile, we also highlight potential opportunities for leveraging GenAI and agentic AI to design privacy-preserving SemCom systems.</description>
