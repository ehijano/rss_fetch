      <title>Nonlinear optical pumping to a diamond NV center dark state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The photodynamics of diamond nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers limits their performance in many quantum technologies. Quenching of photoluminescence, which degrades NV readout, is commonly ascribed to a dark state that is not fully understood. Using a nanoscale cavity to generate intense infrared fields that quench NV emission nonlinearly with field intensity, we show that the dark state is accessed by two-photon pumping into the $^4A_2$ quartet state of the neutrally charged NV (NV$^0$). We constrain this state's energy relative to the NV$^0$ ground-state ($^2E$) to $&gt;0.58$\,eV and the recombination energy threshold to the NV$^-$ ground state ($^3A_2$) to $&lt;2.01$ eV. Furthermore, we show that accessing this state allows sensing of local infrared fields. This new understanding will allow predictions of the limits of NV technologies reliant upon intense fields, including levitated systems, spin--optomechanical devices, and absorption--based magnetometers.</description>

      <title>String-Breaking Dynamics in Quantum Adiabatic and Diabatic Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Confinement prohibits isolation of color charges, e.g., quarks, in nature via a process called string breaking: the separation of two charges results in an increase in the energy of a color flux, visualized as a string, connecting those charges. Eventually, creating additional charges is energetically favored, hence breaking the string. Such a phenomenon can be probed in simpler models, including quantum spin chains, enabling enhanced understanding of string-breaking dynamics. A challenging task is to understand how string breaking occurs as time elapses, in an out-of-equilibrium setting. This work establishes the phenomenology of dynamical string breaking induced by a gradual increase of string tension over time. It, thus, goes beyond instantaneous quench processes and enables tracking the real-time evolution of strings in a more controlled setting. We focus on domain-wall confinement in a family of quantum Ising chains. Our results indicate that, for sufficiently short strings and slow evolution, string breaking can be described by the transition dynamics of a two-state quantum system akin to a Landau-Zener process. For longer strings, a more intricate spatiotemporal pattern emerges: the string breaks by forming a superposition of bubbles (domains of flipped spins of varying sizes), which involve highly excited states. We finally demonstrate that string breaking driven only by quantum fluctuations can be realized in the presence of sufficiently long-ranged interactions. This work holds immediate relevance for studying string breaking in quantum-simulation experiments.</description>

      <title>Commutation Relations in Adiabatic Elimination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The method of adiabatic elimination has been widely adopted in quantum optics in the past several decades. In the study of cavity-based light-matter interactions, the bad-cavity limit is often encountered, where the damping rate of the cavity is much larger than the interaction strength. The fast-damped cavity will quickly relax to a quasi-stationary state, and one can eliminate the cavity from the equation of motion by setting its time derivative to zero. Elimination of the cavity in the bad-cavity limit can reduce the dimensionality of the equations of motion of the system. However, we find that the adiabatic elimination procedure performed in the quantum Langevin equation leads to an incorrect commutation relation, which was rarely discussed in the former studies, as far as we know. Here, we show the incorrect commutation relation arises from the fact that the high frequency of the vacuum noise should be cut off to perform adiabatic elimination, but the noise with high frequency cutoff is still treated as white noise with infinite bandwidth and delta commutation relation. We also study the correlation function and show that the high frequency part of noise contributes very little when averaged over the bath. Therefore, the adiabatic elimination method can reduce the complexity of the calculations while maintaining physical reliability.</description>

      <title>Room-temperature amplified transduction of infrared to visible photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Frequency transduction, which converts photons from one energy level to another, provides a way to bridge different quantum devices. The frequency transduction has been studied across various systems and frequency ranges, depending on the applications. In particular, infrared photons are ideal for long-distance communication, but their detection efficiency is often low. Converting infrared photons to visible light, where affordable detectors with high quantum efficiency are widely available, would offer significant advantages. Here, we report an experimental demonstration of transduction of 1500-nm photons to 553-nm photons at room temperature using barium atoms of a three-level $\Lambda$ system. In our experiment conducted in free space, we could amplify the visible photons, achieving an internal efficiency of 1.49, exceeding unity. We also observed that the minimum transduction bandwidth is determined by the total decay rate of the excited state in the $\Lambda$-type energy levels. Moreover, we propose ways to improve the internal efficiency by 200-fold and to implement polarization-sensitive transduction in our scheme to be applicable in quantum information. The present work is a step forward for the integration of quantum devices at different energy levels as well as for the development of efficient infrared-photon detectors.</description>

      <title>Exact Quantum Trace Formula from Complex Periodic Orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Gutzwiller trace formula establishes a profound connection between the quantum spectrum and classical periodic orbits. However, its application is limited by its reliance on the semiclassical saddle point approximation. In this work, we explore the full quantum version of the trace formula using the Lefschetz thimble method by incorporating complexified periodic orbits. Upon complexification, classical real periodic orbits are transformed into cycles on compact Riemann surfaces. Our key innovation lies in the simultaneous complexification of the periods of cycles, resulting in a fully quantum trace formula that accounts for all contributions classified by the homology classes of the associated Riemann surfaces. This formulation connects the quantum spectrum to contributions across all complex time directions, encompassing all relevant homology classes. Our approach naturally unifies and extends two established methodologies: periodic orbits in real time, as in Gutzwiller's original work, and quantum tunneling in imaginary time, as in the instanton method.</description>

      <title>Local Operations in Multiparty Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a multipartite systems, local operations are conducted by one party and the results are communicated to the other parties. Such models have been studied under the framework of LOCC and SLOCC. In this paper, we study when can an action of one party be simulated by another. We obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for when can a unitary action be simulated in a bipartite system. We also show that arbitrary operations can be simulated by any party as long as the given multipartite state is Schmidt decomposable. Moreover, we obtain condition for simulation of local measurements in arbitrary tripartite systems.</description>

      <title>Combining Squeezing and Transition Sensitivity Resources for Quantum Metrology by Asymmetric Non-Linear Rabi model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Squeezing and transition criticality are two main sensitivity resources for quantum metrology (QM), combination of them may yield an upgraded metrology protocol for higher upper bound of measurement precision (MP). We show that such a combination is feasible in light-matter interactions by a realizable asymmetric non-linear quantum Rabi model (QRM). Indeed, the non-linear coupling possesses a squeezing resource for diverging MP while the non-monotonous degeneracy lifting by the asymmetries induces an additional tunable transition which further enhances the MP by several orders, as demonstrated by the quantum Fisher information. Moreover, the protocol is immune from the problem of diverging preparation time of probe state that may hinder the conventional linear QRM in application of QM. This work establishes a paradigmatic case of combining different sensitivity resources to manipulate QM and maximize MP.</description>

      <title>Classical optimization with imaginary time block encoding on quantum computers: The MaxCut problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finding ground state solutions of diagonal Hamiltonians is relevant for both theoretical as well as practical problems of interest in many domains such as finance, physics and computer science. These problems are typically very hard to tackle by classical computing and quantum computing could help in speeding up computations and efficiently tackling larger problems. Here we use imaginary time evolution through a new block encoding scheme to obtain the ground state of such problems and apply our method to MaxCut as an illustration. Our method, which for simplicity we call ITE-BE, requires no variational parameter optimization as all the parameters in the procedure are expressed as analytical functions of the couplings of the Hamiltonian. We demonstrate that our method can be successfully combined with other quantum algorithms such as quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA). We find that the QAOA ansatz increases the post-selection success of ITE-BE, and shallow QAOA circuits, when boosted with ITE-BE, achieve better performance than deeper QAOA circuits. For the special case of the transverse initial state, we adapt our block encoding scheme to allow for a deterministic application of the first layer of the circuit.</description>

      <title>Unified monogamy relations for the generalized $W$-class states beyond qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The monogamy of entanglement stands as an indispensable feature within multipartite quantum systems. We study monogamy relations with respect to any partitions for the generalized $W$-class (GW) states based on the unified-($q,s$) entanglement (UE). We provide the monogamy relation based on the squared UE for a reduced density matrix of a qudit GW state, as well as tighter monogamy relations based on the $\alpha$th ($\alpha\geq2$) power of UE. Furthermore, for an $n$-qudit system $ABC_1...C_{n-2}$, generalized monogamy relation and upper bound satisfied by the $\beta$th ($0\leq\beta\leq1$) power of UE for the GW states under the partition $AB$ and $C_1...C_{n-2}$ are established. In particular, two partition-dependent residual entanglements for the GW states are analyzed in detail.</description>

      <title>Digital-Analog Quantum Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine Learning algorithms are extensively used in an increasing number of systems, applications, technologies, and products, both in industry and in society as a whole. They enable computing devices to learn from previous experience and therefore improve their performance in a certain context or environment. In this way, many useful possibilities have been made accessible. However, dealing with an increasing amount of data poses difficulties for classical devices. Quantum systems may offer a way forward, possibly enabling to scale up machine learning calculations in certain contexts. On the other hand, quantum systems themselves are also hard to scale up, due to decoherence and the fragility of quantum superpositions. In the short and mid term, it has been evidenced that a quantum paradigm that combines evolution under large analog blocks with discrete quantum gates, may be fruitful to achieve new knowledge of classical and quantum systems with no need of having a fault-tolerant quantum computer. In this Perspective, we review some recent works that employ this digital-analog quantum paradigm to carry out efficient machine learning calculations with current quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-protected Landau-Zener-St\"uckelberg-Majorana interference and non-adiabatic topological transport of edge states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We systematically investigate Landau-Zener-St\"uckelberg-Majorana (LZSM) interference under chiral-mirror-like symmetry and propose its application to non-adiabatic topological transport of edge states. Protected by this symmetry, complete destructive interference emerges and can be characterized through occupation probability. This symmetry-protected LZSM interference enables state transitions to be achieved within remarkably short time scales. To demonstrate our mechanism, we provide two distinctive two-level systems as examples and survey them in detail. By tuning evolution speed or increasing holding time, the complete destructive interferences are observed. Furthermore, we make use of this mechanism for topological edge states of Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chain by taking them as an isolated two-level system. Through carefully designed time sequences, we construct symmetry-protected LZSM interference of topological edge states, enabling non-adiabatic topological transport. Our work unveils an alternative way to study quantum control, quantum state transfer, and quantum communication via non-adiabatic topological transport.</description>

      <title>Towards ultrastrong-coupling quantum thermodynamics using a superconducting flux qubit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermodynamics in quantum circuits aims to find improved functionalities of thermal machines, highlight fundamental phenomena peculiar to quantum nature in thermodynamics, and point out limitations in quantum information processing due to coupling of the system to its environment. An important aspect to achieve some of these goals is the regime of strong coupling that has remained until now a domain of theoretical works only. Our aim is to demonstrate strong coupling features in heat transport using a superconducting flux qubit that has been shown to reach strong to deep-ultra strong coupling regimes. Here we show experimental evidence of strong coupling by observing a hybridized state of the qubit with the cavities coupled to it, leading to a triplet-like thermal transport via this combined system around the minimum energy of the qubit, at power levels of tens of femtowatts, exceeding by an order of magnitude from the earlier ones. We also demonstrate close to 100% on-off switching ratio of heat current by applying small magnetic flux to the qubit. Our experiment opens a way towards testing debated questions in strong coupling thermodynamics such as what heat in this regime is. We also present a theoretical model that aligns with our experimental findings and explains the mechanism behind heat transport in our device. Furthermore, we provide a new tool for quantum thermodynamics aimed at realizing true quantum heat engines and refrigerators with enhanced power and efficiency, leveraging ultra-strong coupling between the system and environment.</description>

      <title>Efficient symmetric and asymmetric Bell-state transfers in a dissipative Jaynes-Cummings model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetric or asymmetric state transfer along a path encircling an exceptional point (EP) is one of the extraordinary phenomena in non-Hermitian (NH) systems. However, the application of this property in both symmetric and asymmetric entangled state transfers, within systems experiencing multiple types of dissipation, remains to be fully explored. In this work, we demonstrate efficient symmetric and asymmetric Bell-state transfers, by modulating system parameters within a Jaynes-Cummings model and considering atomic spontaneous emission and cavity decay. The effective suppression of nonadiabatic transitions facilitates a symmetric exchange of Bell states regardless of the encircling direction. Additionally, we present a counterintuitive finding, suggests that the presence of an EP may not be indispensable for implementation of asymmetric state transfers in NH systems. We further achieve perfect asymmetric Bell-state transfers even in the absence of an EP, while dynamically orbiting around an approximate EP. Our work presents an approach to effectively and reliably manipulate entangled states with both symmetric and asymmetric characteristics, through the dissipation engineering in NH systems.</description>

      <title>State-Constrained Optimal Control for Coherence Preservation in Multi-Level Open Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the optimal control of quantum coherence in multi-level systems, modeled by the Lindblad master equation, which captures both unitary evolution and environmental dissipation. We develop an energy minimization framework to control the evolution of a qutrit (three-level) quantum system while preserving coherence between states. The control problem is formulated using Pontryagin's Minimum Principle in the form of Gamkrelidze, incorporating state constraints to ensure coherence remains within desired bounds. Our approach accounts for Markovian decoherence, demonstrating that the Lindblad operator is non-unital, which reflects the irreversible decay processes inherent in the system. The results provide insights into effectively maintaining quantum coherence in the presence of dissipation.</description>

      <title>Compatibility of Quantum Measurements and the Emergence of Classical Objectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of measurements in quantum mechanics exposes many of the ways in which the quantum world is different. For example, one of the hallmarks of quantum mechanics is that observables may be incompatible, implying among other things that it is not always possible to find joint probability distributions which fully capture the joint statistics of multiple measurements. Instead, one must employ more general tools such as the Kirkwood-Dirac quasiprobability (KDQ) distribution, which may exhibit negative or non-real values heralding non-classicality. In this Letter, we consider the KDQ distributions describing arbitrary collections of measurements on disjoint components of some generic multipartite system. We show that the system dynamics ensures that these distributions are classical if and only if the Hamiltonian supports Quantum Darwinism. Thus, we demonstrate a fundamental relationship between these two notions of classicality and their emergence in the quantum world.</description>

      <title>Bloch Oscillation and Landau-Zener Tunneling of a Periodically Kicked Dirac Particle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of a relativistic spin-1/2 particle governed by a one-dimensional time-periodic kicking Dirac equation. We observe distinct oscillatory behavior in the momentum space and quantum tunneling in the vicinity of zero momentum, which are found to be equivalent to the celebrated Bloch oscillations and Landau-Zener tunneling in solid state periodic energy bands. Using the Floquet formalism, we derive an effective Hamiltonian that can accurately predict both the oscillation period and amplitude. The tunneling probability has also been determined analytically. Our analysis extends to the influence of various parameters on the dynamical behavior, might shedding light on how relativistic effects and spin degrees of freedom impact transport properties and localization phenomena in the quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Efficient quantum algorithm for weighted partial sums and numerical integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a quantum algorithm for efficiently computing partial sums and specific weighted partial sums of quantum state amplitudes. Computation of partial sums has important applications, including numerical integration, cumulative probability distributions, and probabilistic modeling. The proposed quantum algorithm uses a custom unitary construction to achieve the desired partial sums with gate complexity and circuit depth of \(O(\log_2 M)\), where \(M\) represents the number of terms in the partial sum. For cases where \(M\) is a power of two, the unitary construction is straightforward; however, for arbitrary \(M\), we develop an efficient quantum algorithm to create the required unitary matrix. Computational examples for evaluation certain partial sums and numerical integration based on our proposed algorithm are provided. We also extend the algorithm to evaluate partial sums of even or odd components and more complex weighted sums over specified intervals.</description>

      <title>Schr\"odingerization based Quantum Circuits for Maxwell's Equation with time-dependent source terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Schr\"odingerisation method combined with the autonomozation technique in \cite{cjL23} converts general non-autonomous linear differential equations with non-unitary dynamics into systems of autonomous Schr\"odinger-type equations, via the so-called warped phase transformation that maps the equation into two higher dimension. Despite the success of Schr\"odingerisation techniques, they typically require the black box of the sparse Hamiltonian simulation, suitable for continuous-variable based analog quantum simulation. For qubit-based general quantum computing one needs to design the quantum circuits for practical implementation.
  This paper explicitly constructs a quantum circuit for Maxwell's equations with perfect electric conductor (PEC) boundary conditions and time-dependent source terms, based on Schr\"odingerization and autonomozation, with corresponding computational complexity analysis. Through initial value smoothing and high-order approximation to the delta function, the increase in qubits from the extra dimensions only requires minor rise in computational complexity, almost $\log\log {1/\varepsilon}$ where $\varepsilon$ is the desired precision. Our analysis demonstrates that quantum algorithms constructed using Schr\"odingerisation exhibit polynomial acceleration in computational complexity compared to the classical Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) format.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Measurement-Device-Independent Quantum Key Distribution (MDI-QKD), key rates are significantly reduced due to dispersion in asymmetric channels. This work addresses this issue by utilizing intensity and phase modulators for dispersion compensation, thus avoiding the additional losses associated with dispersion-compensating fibers (DCFs). This approach enhances key rates and enables longer communication distances.</description>

      <title>Simulation of Entanglement-Enabled Connectivity in QLANs using SeQUeNCe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Local Area Networks (QLANs) represent a promising building block for larger scale quantum networks with the ambitious goal -- in a long time horizon -- of realizing a Quantum Internet. Surprisingly, the physical topology of a QLAN can be enriched by a set of artificial links, enabled by shared multipartite entangled states among the nodes of the network. This novel concept of artificial topology revolutionizes the possibilities of connectivity within the local network, enabling an on-demand manipulation of the artificial network topology. In this paper, we discuss the implementation of the QLAN model in SeQUeNCe, a discrete-event simulator of quantum networks. Specifically, we provide an analysis of how network nodes interact, with an emphasis on the interplay between quantum operations and classical signaling within the network. Remarkably, through the modeling of a measurement protocol and a correction protocol, our QLAN model implementation enables the simulation of the manipulation process of a shared entangled quantum state, and the subsequent engineering of the entanglement-based connectivity. Our simulations demonstrate how to obtain different virtual topologies with different manipulations of the shared resources and with all the possible measurement outcomes, with an arbitrary number of nodes within the network.</description>

      <title>Non-classicality induces recombination in high-harmonic generation with circularly polarized fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-harmonic generation (HHG) is a nonlinear process in which a strong driving field interacts with a material, resulting in the frequency up-conversion of the driver into its high-order harmonics. This process is highly sensitive to the field's polarization: circular polarization, for instance, inhibits HHG. In this work, we demonstrate that the use of non-classical structured light enables HHG in this otherwise prohibitive configuration for classical drivers. In particular, we consider circularly polarized light with non-classical fluctuations, introduced via squeezing along one polarization direction, and show that the spectral properties of the emitted harmonics vary depending on the type of squeezing applied. Additionally, we examine the electron dynamics during HHG, revealing that non-classical fluctuations act as an effective force that guides the electron trajectories toward recombination. This approach opens new pathways for integrating quantum optics in HHG, providing novel means of controlling the light-matter interaction dynamics.</description>

      <title>More nonlocality with less incompatibility in higher dimensions: Bell vs prepare-measure scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Connecting incompatibility in measurements with the violation of local realism is one of the fundamental avenues of research. For two qubits, any incompatible pair of projective measurements can violate Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality for some states, and there is a monotonic relationship between the level of measurement incompatibility (projective) and the violation. However, in the case of two qutrits, we exhibit that the violation of the Collins-Gisin-Linden-Massar-Popescu (CGLMP) inequality responds non-monotonically with the amount of incompatibility; we term this more nonlocality with less incompatibility. Furthermore, unlike in the CHSH case, the maximally violating state in higher dimensions depends on the amount of measurement incompatibility. We illustrate that similar patterns can also be observed in an experimentally viable interferometric measuring technique. In such a measurement scenario, we provide an explicit example of incompatible (not jointly measurable) measurements that do not violate the CGLMP inequality for any shared quantum state. We extend our study of incompatibility in the prepare and measure scenario, focusing on quantum random access codes (QRACs). Surprisingly, we show that the monotonicity of average success probability with measurement incompatibility does not hold for higher dimensions, as opposed to two dimensions, even though the maximum probability of QRAC behaves monotonically with incompatibility.</description>

      <title>A Millimeter-Wave Superconducting Qubit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Manipulating the electromagnetic spectrum at the single-photon level is fundamental for quantum experiments. In the visible and infrared range, this can be accomplished with atomic quantum emitters, and with superconducting qubits such control is extended to the microwave range (below 10 GHz). Meanwhile, the region between these two energy ranges presents an unexplored opportunity for innovation. We bridge this gap by scaling up a superconducting qubit to the millimeter-wave range (near 100 GHz). Working in this energy range greatly reduces sensitivity to thermal noise compared to microwave devices, enabling operation at significantly higher temperatures, up to 1 K. This has many advantages by removing the dependence on rare $^3$He for refrigeration, simplifying cryogenic systems, and providing orders of magnitude higher cooling power, lending the flexibility needed for novel quantum sensing and hybrid experiments. Using low-loss niobium trilayer junctions, we realize a qubit at 72 GHz cooled to 0.87 K using only $^4$He. We perform Rabi oscillations to establish control over the qubit state, and measure relaxation and dephasing times of 15.8 and 17.4 ns respectively. This demonstration of a millimeter-wave quantum emitter offers exciting prospects for enhanced sensitivity thresholds in high-frequency photon detection, provides new options for quantum transduction and for scaling up and speeding up quantum computing, enables integration of quantum systems where $^3$He refrigeration units are impractical, and importantly paves the way for quantum experiments exploring a novel energy range.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Quantum Emitter Characterization with Latent Neural Ordinary Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep neural network models can be used to learn complex dynamics from data and reconstruct sparse or noisy signals, thereby accelerating and augmenting experimental measurements. Evaluating the quantum optical properties of solid-state single-photon emitters is a time-consuming task that typically requires interferometric photon correlation experiments, such as Photon correlation Fourier spectroscopy (PCFS) which measures time-resolved single emitter lineshapes. Here, we demonstrate a latent neural ordinary differential equation model that can forecast a complete and noise-free PCFS experiment from a small subset of noisy correlation functions. By encoding measured photon correlations into an initial value problem, the NODE can be propagated to an arbitrary number of interferometer delay times. We demonstrate this with 10 noisy photon correlation functions that are used to extrapolate an entire de-noised interferograms of up to 200 stage positions, enabling up to a 20-fold speedup in experimental acquisition time from $\sim$3 hours to 10 minutes. Our work presents a new approach to greatly accelerate the experimental characterization of novel quantum emitter materials using deep learning.</description>

      <title>Validation tests of Gaussian boson samplers with photon-number resolving detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An important challenge with the current generation of noisy, large-scale quantum computers is the question of validation. Does the hardware generate correct answers? If not, what are the errors? This issue is often combined with questions of computational advantage, but it is a fundamentally distinct issue. In current experiments, complete validation of the output statistics is generally not possible because it is exponentially hard to do so. Here, we apply phase-space simulation methods to partially verify recent experiments on Gaussian boson sampling (GBS) implementing photon-number resolving (PNR) detectors. The positive-P phase-space distribution is employed, as it uses probabilistic sampling to reduce complexity. It is $10^{18}$ times faster than direct classical simulation for experiments on $288$ modes where quantum computational advantage is claimed. When combined with binning and marginalization to improve statistics, multiple validation tests are efficiently computable, of which some tests can be carried out on experimental data. We show that the data as a whole shows discrepancies with theoretical predictions for perfect squeezing. However, a small modification of the GBS parameters greatly improves agreement. Hence, we suggest that such validation tests could form the basis of feedback methods to improve GBS quantum computer experiments.</description>

      <title>Receiver-device-independent quantum secure direct communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum secure direct communication (QSDC) enables the message sender to directly send secure messages to the receiver through the quantum channel without keys. Device-independent (DI) and measurement-device-independent (MDI) QSDC protocols can enhance QSDC's practical security in theory. DI QSDC requires extremely high global detection efficiency and has quite low secure communication distance. DI and MDI QSDC both require high-quality entanglement. Current entanglement sources prepare entangled photon pairs with low efficiency, largely reducing their practical communication efficiency. In the paper, we propose a single-photon-based receiver-device-independent (RDI) QSDC protocol. It only relies on the trusted single-photon source, which is nearly on-demand under current technology, and treats all the receiving devices in both communication parties as ``black-boxes''. The parties ensure the message security only from the observed statistics. We develop a numerical method to simulate its performance in practical noisy communication situation. RDI QSDC provides the same security level as MDI QSDC. Compared with DI and MDI QSDC, RDI QSDC has some advantages. First, it uses the single-photon source and single-photon measurement, which makes it obtain the practical communication efficiency about 3415 times of that in DI QSDC and easy to implement. The whole protocol is feasible with current technology. Second, it has higher photon loss robustness and noise tolerance than DI QSDC, which enables it to have a secure communication distance about 26 times of that in DI QSDC. Based on above features, the RDI QSDC protocol makes it possible to achieve highly-secure and high-efficient QSDC in the near future.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum evolution is crucial for the understanding of complex quantum systems. However, current implementations of time evolution on quantum photonic platforms face challenges of limited light source efficiency due to propagation loss and merely single-layer complexity. In this work, we present a loop quantum photonic chip (Loop-QPC) designed to efficiently simulate quantum dynamics over multiple time steps in a single chip. Our approach employs a recirculating loop structure to reuse computational resources and eliminate the need for multiple quantum tomography steps or chip reconfigurations. We experimentally demonstrate the dynamics of the spin-boson model on a low-loss Silicon Nitride (SiN) integrated photonic chip. The Loop-QPC achieves a three-step unitary evolution closely matching the theoretical predictions. These results establish the Loop-QPC as a promising method for efficient and scalable quantum simulation, advancing the development of quantum simulation on programmable photonic circuits.</description>

      <title>Linear-optical protocols for mitigating and suppressing noise in bosonic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum-information processing and computation with bosonic qubits are corruptible by noise channels. Using interferometers and photon-subtraction gadgets (PSGs) accompanied by linear amplification and attenuation, we establish linear-optical methods to mitigate and suppress bosonic noise channels. We first show that by employing amplifying and attenuating PSGs respectively at the input and output of either a thermal or random-displacement channel, probabilistic error cancellation (PEC) can be carried out to mitigate errors in expectation-value estimation. We also derive optimal physical estimators that are properly constrained to improve the sampling accuracy of PEC. Next, we prove that a purely-dephasing channel is coherently suppressible using a multimode Mach--Zehnder interferometer and conditional vacuum measurements (VMZ). In the limit of infinitely-many ancillas, with nonvanishing success rates, VMZ using either Hadamard or two-design interferometers turns any dephasing channel into a phase-space-rotated linear-attenuation channel that can subsequently be inverted with (rotated) linear amplification without Kerr nonlinearity. Moreover, for weak central-Gaussian dephasing, the suppression fidelity increases monotonically with the number of ancillas and most optimally with Hadamard interferometers. We demonstrate the performance of these linear-optical mitigation and suppression schemes on common noise channels (and their compositions) and popular bosonic codes. While the theoretical formalism pertains to idling noise channels, we also provide numerical evidence supporting mitigation and suppression capabilities with respect to noise from universal gate operations.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Classification of Arbitrary Three-Qubit States via Artificial Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We design and successfully implement artificial neural networks (ANNs) to detect and classify entanglement for three-qubit systems using limited state features. The overall design principle is a feed forward neural network (FFNN), with the output layer consisting of a single neuron for the detection of genuine multipartite entanglement (GME) and six neurons for the classification problem corresponding to six entanglement classes under stochastic local operations and classical communication (SLOCC). The models are trained and validated on a simulated dataset of randomly generated states. We achieve high accuracy, around 98%, for detecting GME as well as for SLOCC classification. Remarkably, we find that feeding only 7 diagonal elements of the density matrix into the ANN results in an accuracy greater than 94% for both the tasks, showcasing the strength of the method in reducing the required input data while maintaining efficient performance. Reducing the feature set makes it easier to apply ANN models for entanglement classification, particularly in resource-constrained environments, without sacrificing accuracy. The performance of the ANN models was further evaluated by introducing white noise into the data set, and the results indicate that the models are robust and are able to well tolerate noise.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Evaluation of the Caesium Fountain Primary Frequency Standard NIM6</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new caesium (Cs) fountain clock NIM6 has been developed at the National Institute of Metrology (NIM) in China, for which a comprehensive uncertainty evaluation is presented. A three-dimensional magneto-optical trap (3D MOT) loading optical molasses is employed to obtain more cold atoms rapidly and efficiently with a tunable, uniform density distribution. A heat pipe surrounding the flight tube maintains a consistent and stable temperature within the interrogation region. Additionally, a Ramsey cavity with four azimuthally distribution feeds is utilized to mitigate distributed cavity phase shifts. The Cs fountain clock NIM6 achieves a short-term stability of 1.0x10-13 {\tau}-1/2 at high atomic density, and a typical overall fractional type-B uncertainty is estimated to be 2.3x10-16. Comparisons of frequency between the Cs fountain NIM6 and other Cs fountain Primary Frequency Standards (PFSs) through Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) have demonstrated an agreement within the stated uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Exact Quantum Algorithm for Unit Commitment Optimization based on Partially Connected Quantum Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum hybrid algorithm has become a very promising and speedily method today for solving the larger-scale optimization in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era. The unit commitment (UC) problem is a fundamental problem in the power system which aims to satisfy a balance load with minimal cost. In this paper, we focus on the implement of the UC-solving by exact quantum algorithms based on the quantum neural network (QNN). This method is tested with up to 10-unit system with the balance load constraint. In order to improve the computing precision and reduce the network complexity, we suggest the knowledge-based partially connected quantum neural network (PCQNN). The results show that the exact solutions can be obtained by the improved algorithm and the depth of the quantum circuit can be reduced simultaneously.</description>

      <title>Simulation of Quantum Transduction Strategies for Quantum Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Quantum Internet would likely be composed of diverse qubit technologies that interact through a heterogeneous quantum network. Thus, quantum transduction has been identified as a key enabler of the Quantum Internet. To better study heterogeneous quantum networks, the integration of a quantum transducer component into quantum networks simulators has become crucial. In this paper, we extend SeQUeNCe, a discrete-event simulator of quantum networks, with a quantum transduction component. Moreover, we explore two protocols for transmitting quantum information between superconducting nodes via optical channels, with a focus on the impact of quantum transduction on the transmission process. The performance of these protocols is analyzed and compared through simulations conducted using SeQUeNCe. Our preliminary results align with theoretical predictions, offering simulation-based validation of the protocols.</description>

      <title>Generalizing Bell nonlocality without global causal assumptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bell scenarios are multipartite scenarios that exclude any communication between parties. This constraint leads to a strict hierarchy of correlation sets in such scenarios, namely, classical, quantum, and nonsignaling. However, without any constraints on communication between the parties, they can realize arbitrary correlations by exchanging only classical systems. Here we consider a multipartite scenario where the parties can engage in at most a single round of communication, i.e., each party is allowed to receive a system once, implement any local intervention on it, and send out the resulting system once. While no global assumption about causal relations between parties is assumed in this scenario, we do make a causal assumption local to each party, i.e., the input received by it causally precedes the output it sends out. We then introduce antinomicity, a notion of nonclassicality for correlations in such scenarios, and prove the existence of a strict hierarchy of correlation sets classified by their antinomicity. Antinomicity serves as a generalization of Bell nonlocality: when all the parties discard their output systems (i.e., in a nonsignaling scenario), it is mathematically equivalent to Bell nonlocality. Like Bell nonlocality, it can be understood as an instance of fine-tuning, one that is necessary in any classical model of cyclic causation that avoids time-travel antinomies but allows antinomic correlations. Furthermore, antinomicity resolves a long-standing puzzle, i.e., the failure of causal inequality violations as device-independent witnesses of nonclassicality. Antinomicity implies causal inequality violations, but not conversely.</description>

      <title>Quantum Coherence: A Fundamental Resource for Establishing Genuine Multipartite Correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the profound equivalence between measures of genuine multipartite entanglement(GME) and their corresponding coherence measures. Initially we construct two distinct classes of measures for genuine multipartite entanglement utilizing real symmetric concave functions and the convex roof technique. We then demonstrate that all coherence measures for any qudit states, defined through the convex roof approach, are identical to our two classes of GME measures of the states combined with an incoherent ancilla under a unitary incoherent operation. This relationship implies that genuine multipartite entanglement can be generated from the coherence inherent in an initial state through the unitary incoherent operations. Furthermore, we explore the interplay between coherence and other forms of genuine quantum correlations, specifically genuine multipartite steering and genuine multipartite nonlocality. In the instance of special three-qubit X-states (only nonzero elements of X-state are diagonal or antidiagonal when written in an orthonormal basis), we find that genuine multipartite steering and nonlocality are present if and only if the coherence exists in the corresponding qubit states.</description>

      <title>Universal solution to the Schrieffer-Wolff Transformation Generator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Schrieffer-Wolff transformation (SWT) is an important perturbative method in quantum mechanics used to simplify Hamiltonians by decoupling low- and high-energy subspaces. Existing methods for implementing the SWT often lack general applicability to arbitrary perturbative systems or fail to provide a closed-form solution for the SWT generator. In this article, we present a systematic and unified framework for the SWT that addresses these shortcomings. Specifically, we derive a closed-form solution for the SWT generator that is universally applicable to any system that satisfies the conditions required to be perturbatively treated. Furthermore, we extend this solution to time-dependent systems with periodic perturbations, covering all frequency regimes. The effectiveness of this approach is then demonstrated by applying it to analyze the dispersive shift of an anharmonic resonator coupled to a two-level system with time-dependent coupling.</description>

      <title>Joint Communication and Sensing over the Lossy Bosonic Quantum Channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of joint communication and sensing for data transmission systems using optimal quantum instruments in order to transmit data and, at the same time, estimate environmental parameters. In particular we consider the specific but at the same time generic case of a noiseless bosonic classical-quantum channel where part of the transmitted light is reflected back to the transmitter. While sending messages to the receiver, the transmitter tries at the same time to estimate the reflectivity of the channel. Extending earlier results on similar but finite-dimensional systems, we are able to characterize optimal tradeoffs between communication and detection rates. We also compare quantum performance to analogous classical models, quantifying the quantum advantage.</description>

      <title>On the physics of nested Markov models: a generalized probabilistic theory perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Determining potential probability distributions with a given causal graph is vital for causality studies. To bypass the difficulty in characterizing latent variables in a Bayesian network, the nested Markov model provides an elegant algebraic approach by listing exactly all the equality constraints on the observed variables. However, this algebraically motivated causal model comprises distributions outside Bayesian networks, and its physical interpretation remains vague. In this work, we inspect the nested Markov model through the lens of generalized probabilistic theory, an axiomatic framework to describe general physical theories. We prove that all the equality constraints defining the nested Markov model hold valid theory-independently. Yet, we show this model generally contains distributions not implementable even within such relaxed physical theories subjected to merely the relativity principles and mild probabilistic rules. To interpret the origin of such a gap, we establish a new causal model that defines valid distributions as projected from a high-dimensional Bell-type causal structure. The new model unveils inequality constraints induced by relativity principles, or equivalently high-dimensional conditional independences, which are absent in the nested Markov model. Nevertheless, we also notice that the restrictions on states and measurements introduced by the generalized probabilistic theory framework can pose additional inequality constraints beyond the new causal model. As a by-product, we discover a new causal structure exhibiting strict gaps between the distribution sets of a Bayesian network, generalized probabilistic theories, and the nested Markov model. We anticipate our results will enlighten further explorations on the unification of algebraic and physical perspectives of causality.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Quantum Information from Unequal-Time QFT Correlation Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper continues on the program of developing a relativistic quantum information theory in terms of unequal-time correlation functions in quantum field theory (QFT)[arXiv:2208.03696]. Here, we focus on the definition of quantum resources from the irreducibly quantum behavior contained in the correlation functions of a QFT. We explain how set-ups with $N$ particle detectors probe the information in the high order field correlation functions. Our main object is the associated hierarchy of probability densities of $N$-detector events. We show that classical probabilistic hierarchies are subject to two conditions: Kolmogorov additivity and measurement independence. QFT violates those conditions, and the degree of violation enables us to define novel quantum resources. We give specific examples in set-ups where the main observables are the times of particle detection events. The new resources capture instances of irreducibly quantum behavior differ from the quantum behavior encapsulated in Bell inequalities. An interesting byproduct of our analysis is a relativistic state reduction rule for particles detected through scattering.</description>

      <title>Encoding of Probability Distributions for Quantum Monte Carlo Using Tensor Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The application of Tensor Networks (TN) in quantum computing has shown promise, particularly for data loading. However, the assumption that data is readily available often renders the integration of TN techniques into Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) inefficient, as complete probability distributions would have to be calculated classically. In this paper the tensor-train cross approximation (TT-cross) algorithm is evaluated as a means to address the probability loading problem. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method on financial distributions, showcasing the TT-cross approach's scalability and accuracy. Our results indicate that the TT-cross method significantly improves circuit depth scalability compared to traditional methods, offering a more efficient pathway for implementing QMC on near-term quantum hardware. The approach also shows high accuracy and scalability in handling high-dimensional financial data, making it a promising solution for quantum finance applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kirkwood-Dirac distribution, serving as an informationally complete representation of a quantum state, has recently garnered { increasing} attention. We investigate the Kirkwood-Dirac classicality with respect to mutually unbiased bases. For prime dimensional Hilbert spaces, we demonstrate that quantum states which exhibit Kirkwood-Dirac classicality for two distinct sets of mutually unbiased bases $A$, $B$ and $A$, $B'$ must necessarily be incoherent with respect to $A$. We subsequently introduce a coherence monotone based on Kirkwood-Dirac nonclassicality with respect to mutually unbiased bases. Additionally, we establish that this coherence monotone can be expressed through weak values, suggesting that quantum coherence can be utilized to detect anomalous weak values.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Arrays of optically trapped neutral atoms are a promising architecture for the realization of quantum computers. In order to run increasingly complex algorithms, it is advantageous to demonstrate high-fidelity and flexible gates between long-lived and highly coherent qubit states. In this work, we demonstrate a universal high-fidelity gate-set with individually controlled and parallel application of single-qubit gates and two-qubit gates operating on the ground-state nuclear spin qubit in arrays of tweezer-trapped $^{171}$Yb atoms. We utilize the long lifetime, flexible control, and high physical fidelity of our system to characterize native gates using single and two-qubit Clifford and symmetric subspace randomized benchmarking circuits with more than 200 CZ gates applied to one or two pairs of atoms. We measure our two-qubit entangling gate fidelity to be 99.72(3)% (99.40(3)%) with (without) post-selection. In addition, we introduce a simple and optimized method for calibration of multi-parameter quantum gates. These results represent important milestones towards executing complex and general quantum computation with neutral atoms.</description>

      <title>Stabilizer disentangling of conformal field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how entanglement can be reduced through simple operations is crucial for both classical and quantum algorithms. We investigate the entanglement properties of lattice models hosting conformal field theories cooled via local Clifford operations, a procedure we refer to as stabilizer disentangling. We uncover two distinct regimes: a constant gain regime, where disentangling is volume-independent, and a log-gain regime, where disentanglement increases with volume, characterized by a reduced effective central charge. In both cases, disentangling efficiency correlates with the target state magic, with larger magic leading to more effective cooling. The dichotomy between the two cases stems from mutual stabilizer Renyi entropy, which influences the entanglement cooling process. We provide an analytical understanding of such effect in the context of cluster Ising models, that feature disentangling global Clifford operations. Our findings indicate that matrix product states possess subclasses based on the relationship between entanglement and magic, and clarifying the potential of new classes of variational states embedding Clifford dynamics within matrix product states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the phenomenon of correlated emission lasing in a coherently driven single quantum dot coupled to a bimodal photonic crystal cavity, utilizing a master equation to describe the system dynamics. To account for exciton-phonon interactions, we incorporate a non-perturbative approach through a polaron transformed master equation. By analyzing fluctuations in the Hermitian operators associated with relative and average phase, we derive a Fokker-Planck equation to assess phase drift and diffusion coefficients, demonstrating that correlated emission suppresses quantum noise in the presence of exciton-phonon interaction at low temperature. Additionally, we calculate the single and two-photon excess emission rates (difference between emission and absorption rates) into the cavity modes and explore the generation of continuous-variable entanglement between these modes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Among the challenges of efficiently managing a factory, inventory management is essential for minimizing operational costs and delivery times. In this paper, we focus on optimizing item allocation in warehouses that use gravity flow racks, which are designed for First In, First Out (FIFO) logistics but present challenges due to the need for frequent item reinsertions during picking operations. We introduce a novel strategy formulated as a QUBO problem, suitable for classical, quantum, and hybrid hardware implementations. By leveraging advances in Adiabatic Quantum Computing and Quantum Annealing, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our strategy through simulations and real-world scenarios. The results highlight the potential of quantum-hybrid approaches to significantly enhance operational efficiency in warehouse management.</description>

      <title>Spikes in Poissonian quantum trajectories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the dynamics of a continuously monitored qubit in the limit of strong measurement rate where the quantum trajectory is described by a stochastic master equation with Poisson noise. Such limits are expected to give rise to quantum jumps between the pointer states associated with the non-demolition measurement. A surprising discovery in earlier work [Tilloy et al., Phys. Rev. A 92, 052111 (2015)] on quantum trajectories with Brownian noise was the phenomena of spikes observed in between the quantum jumps. Here, we show that spikes are observed also for Poisson noise. We consider three cases where the non-demolition is broken by adding, to the basic strong measurement dynamics, either unitary evolution or thermal noise or additional measurements. We present a complete analysis of the spike and jump statistics for all three cases using the fact that the dynamics effectively corresponds to that of stochastic resetting. We provide numerical results to support our analytic results.</description>

      <title>Reuse-Aware Compilation for Zoned Quantum Architectures Based on Neutral Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing architectures based on neutral atoms offer large scales and high-fidelity operations. They can be heterogeneous, with different zones for storage, entangling operations, and readout. Zoned architectures improve computation fidelity by shielding idling qubits in storage from side-effect noise, unlike monolithic architectures where all operations occur in a single zone. However, supporting these flexible architectures with efficient compilation remains challenging. In this paper, we propose ZAC, a scalable compiler for zoned architectures. ZAC minimizes data movement overhead between zones with qubit reuse, i.e., keeping them in the entanglement zone if an immediate entangling operation is pending. Other innovations include novel data placement and instruction scheduling strategies in ZAC, a flexible specification of zoned architectures, and an intermediate representation for zoned architectures, ZAIR. Our evaluation shows that zoned architectures equipped with ZAC achieve a 22x improvement in fidelity compared to monolithic architectures. Moreover, ZAC is shown to have a 10% fidelity gap on average compared to the ideal solution. This significant performance enhancement enables more efficient and reliable quantum circuit execution, enabling advancements in quantum algorithms and applications.

      <title>On the hardness of cloning and connections to representation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The states accepted by a quantum circuit are known as the witnesses for the quantum circuit's satisfiability. The assumption BQP does not equal QMA implies that no efficient algorithm exists for constructing a witness for a quantum circuit from the circuit's classical description. However, a similar complexity-theoretic lower bound on the computational hardness of cloning a witness is not known. In this note, we derive a conjecture about cloning algorithms for maximally entangled states over hidden subspaces which would imply that no efficient algorithm exists for cloning witnesses (assuming BQP does not contain NP). The conjecture and result follow from connections between quantum computation and representation theory; specifically, the relationship between quantum state complexity and the complexity of computing Kronecker coefficients.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11822v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transitioning from quantum computation on physical qubits to quantum computation on encoded, logical qubits can improve the error rate of operations, and will be essential for realizing valuable quantum computational advantages. Using a neutral atom quantum processor with 256 qubits, each an individual Ytterbium atom, we demonstrate the entanglement of 24 logical qubits using the distance-two [[4,2,2]] code, simultaneously detecting errors and correcting for lost qubits. We also implement the Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm with up to 28 logical qubits encoded in the [[4,1,2]] code, showing better-than-physical error rates. We demonstrate fault-tolerant quantum computation in our approach, guided by the proposal of Gottesman (2016), by performing repeated loss correction for both structured and random circuits encoded in the [[4,2,2]] code. Finally, since distance-two codes can correct qubit loss, but not other errors, we show repeated loss and error correction using the distance-three [[9,1,3]] Bacon-Shor code. These results begin to clear a path for achieving scientific quantum advantage with a programmable neutral atom quantum processor.</description>

      <title>Architectural Patterns for Designing Quantum Artificial Intelligence Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10487v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Utilising quantum computing technology to enhance artificial intelligence systems is expected to improve training and inference times, increase robustness against noise and adversarial attacks, and reduce the number of parameters without compromising accuracy. However, moving beyond proof-of-concept or simulations to develop practical applications of these systems while ensuring high software quality faces significant challenges due to the limitations of quantum hardware and the underdeveloped knowledge base in software engineering for such systems. In this work, we have conducted a systematic mapping study to identify the challenges and solutions associated with the software architecture of quantum-enhanced artificial intelligence systems. Our review uncovered several architectural patterns that describe how quantum components can be integrated into inference engines, as well as middleware patterns that facilitate communication between classical and quantum components. These insights have been compiled into a catalog of architectural patterns. Each pattern realises a trade-off between efficiency, scalability, trainability, simplicity, portability and deployability, and other software quality attributes.</description>

      <title>How quantum computing can enhance biomarker discovery for multi-factorial diseases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biomarkers play a central role in medicine's gradual progress towards proactive, personalized precision diagnostics and interventions. However, finding biomarkers that provide very early indicators of a change in health status, particularly for multi-factorial diseases, has been challenging. Discovery of such biomarkers stands to benefit significantly from advanced information processing and means to detect complex correlations, which quantum computing offers. In this perspective paper, quantum algorithms, particularly in machine learning, are mapped to key applications in biomarker discovery. The opportunities and challenges associated with the algorithms and applications are discussed. The analysis is structured according to different data types - multi-dimensional, time series, and erroneous data - and covers key data modalities in healthcare - electronic health records (EHRs), omics, and medical images. An outlook is provided concerning open research challenges.</description>

      <title>Cryptographic tests of the python's lunch conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the AdS/CFT correspondence, subregions of the CFT allow for the recovery of subregions of the bulk. The python's lunch (PL) conjecture asserts that in some settings this reconstruction has a large complexity of $\text{poly}(1/G_N)e^{\Delta A_{\text{PL}}/8G_N}$, where $\Delta A_{\text{PL}}$ is an area difference of bulk extremal surfaces. Using tools from cryptography, we argue that the PL conjecture has implications for correlation in the boundary CFT. We find that the mutual information between appropriate CFT subregions is lower bounded linearly by $\Delta A_{\text{PL}}$. Recalling that the mutual information is also computed by bulk extremal surfaces, this gives an easily checked geometrical consequence of the PL conjecture. We consider explicit python's lunch geometries and study when this prediction holds. In an example constructed in vacuum AdS$_{2+1}$, we find there is a tension between the expected behaviour of correlation and a naive statement of the PL conjecture; we discuss how this tension may be resolved through refinements of the conjecture. We study further examples in AdS$_{2+1}$ including the defect geometry, BTZ black hole, and a geometry with a static end-of-the-world (ETW) brane, and find agreement with expected behaviour assuming the PL conjecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show how pilot-wave theory points to new physics, beyond quantum mechanics, in three distinct ways. First, generalised cosmological initial conditions, departing from the Born rule, can lead to observable anomalies in the cosmic microwave background and in relic cosmological particles. Second, a breakdown of the Born rule in the deep quantum-gravity regime, with gravitational corrections that render the Born rule semiclassically unstable, can create anomalies in Hawking radiation from evaporating black holes. Third, a regularised equation of motion that remains finite at nodes of the wave function generates corrections to the Born rule at short distances, while a natural time-dependent generalisation implies an instability of quantum equilibrium at short times, effects which may be observable in high-energy collisions.</description>

      <title>Qurts: Automatic Quantum Uncomputation by Affine Types with Lifetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Uncomputation is a feature in quantum programming that allows the programmer to discard a value without losing quantum information, and that allows the compiler to reuse resources. Whereas quantum information has to be treated linearly by the type system, automatic uncomputation enables the programmer to treat it affinely to some extent. Automatic uncomputation requires a substructural type system between linear and affine, a subtlety that has only been captured by existing languages in an ad hoc way. We extend the Rust type system to the quantum setting to give a uniform framework for automatic uncomputation called Qurts (pronounced quartz). Specifically, we parameterise types by lifetimes, permitting them to be affine during their lifetime, while being restricted to linear use outside their lifetime. We also provide two operational semantics: one based on classical simulation, and one that does not depend on any specific uncomputation strategy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a two-matrix toy model with a BFSS-like interaction term using the collective field formalism. The main technical simplification is obtained by gauge-fixing first, and integrating out the off-diagonal elements, before changing to the collective field variable. We show that the resulting (2+1)-dimensional collective field action has novel features with respect to non-locality, and that we need to add a mass term to get a time-local potential. As is expected, one recovers the single matrix quantum mechanical collective field Hamiltonian in the proper limit.</description>

      <title>Connection between gravity and quantum mechanics: an algebraic approach to cosmological issues</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents an algebraic framework to explore the fundamental relationship between gravity and quantum mechanics, with particular emphasis on the role of primordial black holes (PBHs) in cosmology. Through the concept of self-gravitating condensed light, specifically in the form of a photon Bose-Einstein condensate, this work examines the quantum attributes of PBHs and their implications for early universe dynamics, baryogenesis, and the formation of large-scale structures. The model also investigates quantized characteristics of black holes, such as mass, entropy, and temperature, suggesting that quantum processes are fundamental to black hole mechanics. By addressing issues like the cosmological constant problem and the information loss paradox, this work provides insights into Planck-scale physics and proposes that PBHs may serve as a bridge between quantum theory and general relativity. This study ultimately posits that understanding black hole physics is essential to resolving major cosmological and astrophysical paradoxes for the ultimate unification of quantum mechanics with gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vortex information of scalar pair production in circularly polarized field is investigated in the multiphoton regime. We find that vortex orientation is related to the intrinsic orbital angular momentum of created particles associating with the helicity of absorbed photons, while the magnitude of the orbital angular momentum, i.e., the topology charge is determined by the number of absorbed photons. Moreover, the properties of particle creation and vortices formation can be understood by analyzing the pair production process in quasiparticle representation. This study provides new insights into the angular momentum transfer from field to particle in the scalar pair production process. It is expected that there are similar findings about vortex features for different spin alignment in electron-positron pair production in strong fields via the topology charge as a new freedom.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have demonstrated, for the first time to our knowledge, self-injection locking of a distributed feedback (DFB) diode laser to a multimode 4H-silicon carbide (4H-SiC) microring resonator, and observed resonant opto-mechanical oscillation in the cavity modes. While the fundamental transverse-electric mode family of the silicon carbide microring was optically pumped, Stokes light was generated in the adjacent fundamental transverse-magnetic resonant mode. The threshold of the process did not exceed 5~mW of light entering the cavity characterized with a loaded optical quality factor of $\smash{2\times10^6}$. These results mark a significant milestone in unlocking the potential of 4H-SiC through turnkey soliton microcomb generation and empowering future advancements in areas such as cavity optomechanics using this versatile and quantum-friendly material platform.</description>

Abstract: Numerous challenges persist in High Energy Physics (HEP), the addressing of which requires advancements in detection technology, computational methods, data analysis frameworks, and phenomenological designs. We provide a concise yet comprehensive overview of recent progress across these areas, in line with advances in quantum technology. We will discuss the potential of quantum devices in detecting subtle effects indicative of new physics beyond the Standard Model, the transformative role of quantum algorithms and large-scale quantum computers in studying real-time non-perturbative dynamics in the early universe and at colliders, as well as in analyzing complex HEP data. Additionally, we emphasize the importance of integrating quantum properties into HEP experiments to test quantum mechanics at unprecedented high-energy scales and search for hints of new physics. Looking ahead, the continued integration of resources to fully harness these evolving technologies will enhance our efforts to deepen our understanding of the fundamental laws of nature.</description>

      <title>Stochastic quantization and diffusion models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is a pedagogical review of the possible connection between the stochastic quantization in physics and the diffusion models in machine learning. For machine-learning applications, the denoising diffusion model has been established as a successful technique, which is formulated in terms of the stochastic differential equation (SDE). In this review, we focus on an SDE approach used in the score-based generative modeling. Interestingly, the evolution of the probability distribution is equivalently described by a particular class of SDEs, and in a particular limit, the stochastic noises can be eliminated. Then, we turn to a similar mathematical formulation in quantum physics, that is, the stochastic quantization. We make a brief overview on the stochastic quantization using a simple toy model of the one-dimensional integration. The analogy between the diffusion model and the stochastic quantization is clearly seen in this concrete example. Finally, we discuss how the sign problem arises in the toy model with complex parameters. The origin of the difficulty is understood based on the Lefschetz thimble analysis. We point out that the SDE is not invariant under the variable change which induces a kernel and a special choice of the kernel guided by the Lefschetz thimble analysis can reduce the sign problem.</description>

Abstract: We present an overview of the method of Neural Quantum States applied to the many-body problem of atomic nuclei. Through the lens of group representation theory, we focus on the problem of constructing neural-network ans\"atze that respect physical symmetries. We explicitly prove that determinants, which are among the most common methods to build antisymmetric neural-network wave functions, can be understood as the result of a group convolution. We also identify the reason why this construction is so efficient in practice compared to other group convolutional operations. We conclude that group representation theory is a promising avenue to incorporate explicitly symmetries in Neural Quantum States.</description>

Abstract: We present a formulation of coherent states as of consistent quantum description of classical configurations in the BRST-invariant quantization of electrodynamics. The quantization with proper gauge-fixing is performed on the vacuum of the theory, whereas other backgrounds are obtained as BRST-invariant coherent states. One of the key insights is the possibility of constructing the coherent states of pure-gauge configurations. This provides a coherent state understanding of topologically non-trivial configurations in gauge theories, and makes number of features, such as the suppression of transitions between topologically-distinct sectors, very transparent at full quantum level. As an example, we construct the Nielsen-Olesen string as a BRST-invariant coherent state. The Abelian pure-gauge configurations can also be viewed as useful analogs for a set of space-times related by coordinate reparameterizations in General Relativity.</description>

      <title>Strong nanophotonic quantum squeezing exceeding 3.5 dB in a foundry-compatible Kerr microresonator</title>

Abstract: Squeezed light, with its quantum noise reduction capabilities, has emerged as a powerful resource in quantum information processing and precision metrology. To reach noise reduction levels such that a quantum advantage is achieved, off-chip squeezers are typically used. The development of on-chip squeezed light sources, particularly in nanophotonic platforms, has been challenging. We report 3.7 $\pm$ 0.2 dB of directly detected nanophotonic quantum squeezing using foundry-fabricated silicon nitride (Si$_3$N$_4$) microrings with an inferred squeezing level of 10.7 dB on-chip. The squeezing level is robust across multiple devices and pump detunings, and is consistent with the overcoupling degree without noticeable degradation from excess classical noise. We also offer insights to mitigate thermally-induced excess noise, that typically degrades squeezing, by using small-radius rings with a larger free spectral range (450 GHz) and consequently lower parametric oscillation thresholds. Our results demonstrate that Si$_3$N$_4$ is a viable platform for strong quantum noise reduction in a CMOS-compatible, scalable architecture.</description>

      <title>Suppressing Si Valley Excitation and Valley-Induced Spin Dephasing for Long-Distance Shuttling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a scalable protocol for suppressing errors during electron spin shuttling in silicon quantum dots. The approach maps the valley Hamiltonian to a Landau-Zener problem to model the nonadiabatic dynamics in regions of small valley splitting. An optimization refines the shuttling velocity profile over a single small segment of the shuttling path. The protocol reliably returns the valley state to the ground state at the end of the shuttle, disentangling the spin and valley degrees of freedom, after which a single virtual $z$-rotation on the spin compensates its evolution during the shuttle. The time cost and complexity of the error suppression is minimal and independent of the distance over which the spin is shuttled, and the maximum velocities imposed by valley physics are found to be orders of magnitude larger than current experimentally achievable shuttling speeds. This protocol offers a chip-scale solution for high-fidelity quantum transport in silicon spin-based quantum computing devices.</description>

      <title>Quantum chaos and macroscopic realism as no-signaling in time</title>

      <description>arXiv:1912.07097v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Macroscopic realism is a set of assumptions about how we experience the world at a classical level. While the Leggett-Garg inequalities are temporal correlations that are violated by quantum systems not obeying such macrorealism, the no-signaling in time condition is also a necessary condition. This compares measurement outcomes with and without prior measurements. As dynamics and correlations play a central role in these measures, this paper explores the effects of regular versus chaotic dynamics on the violations of macroscopic realism. We observe a close connection between a 3 point out-of-time-order correlator and the conditional probabilities of measurement, and we find unmistakable imprints of chaos on the violations of macrorealism. We provide qualitative semiclassical reasoning for the numerical results involving a kicked top, and for two important initial states that behave very differently.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2111.05554v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in strong single-photon optomechanical coupling also demand a deeper understanding of environmental interactions in this regime. The inadequacy of the standard Lindblad master equation necessitates the use of the Dressed-State Master Equation (DSME), which accounts for the correct eigenstates. This work investigates the impact of squeezed vacuum and thermal reservoirs on the decoherence of cavity photon Fock states in the strong coupling regime. We demonstrate that decoherence can be effectively controlled by tuning reservoir parameters, with the control mediated through a cavity dephasing term that becomes significant at high temperatures. The findings presented provide critical insights into reservoir engineering for precise control of quantum decoherence, advancing the understanding of strongly coupled optomechanical systems in engineered environments.</description>

Abstract: We derive a simple sufficient criterion for the locality of correlations obtained from given measurements on a Gaussian quantum state. The criterion is based on the construction of a local-hidden-variable model which works by passing part of the inherent Gaussian noise of the state onto the measurements. We illustrate our result in the setting of displaced photodetection on a two-mode squeezed state. Here, our criterion exhibits the existence of a local-hidden-variable model for a range of parameters where the state is still entangled.</description>

Abstract: Engines are systems and devices that convert one form of energy into another, typically into a more useful form that can perform work. In the classical setup, physical, chemical, and biological engines largely involve the conversion of heat into work. This energy conversion is at the core of thermodynamic laws and principles and is codified in textbook material. In the quantum regime, however, the principles of energy conversion become ambiguous, since quantum phenomena come into play. As with classical thermodynamics, fundamental principles can be explored through engines and refrigerators, but, in the quantum case, these devices are miniaturized and their operations involve uniquely quantum effects. Our work provides a broad overview of this active field of quantum engines and refrigerators, reviewing the latest theoretical proposals and experimental realizations. We cover myriad aspects of these devices, starting with the basic concepts of quantum analogs to the classical thermodynamic cycle and continuing with different quantum features of energy conversion that span many branches of quantum mechanics. These features include quantum fluctuations that become dominant in the microscale, non-thermal resources that fuel the engines, and the possibility of scaling up the working medium's size, to account for collective phenomena in many-body heat engines. Furthermore, we review studies of quantum engines operating in the strong system-bath coupling regime and those that include non-Markovian phenomena. Recent advances in thermoelectric devices and quantum information perspectives, including quantum measurement and feedback in quantum engines, are also presented.</description>

Abstract: Reversible circuits have been studied extensively and intensively, and have plenty of applications in various areas, such as digital signal processing, cryptography, and especially quantum computing. In 2003, the lower bound $\Omega(2^n n/\log n)$ for the synthesis of $n$-wire reversible circuits was proved. Whether this lower bound has a matching upper bound was listed as one of the future challenging open problems in the survey (M. Saeedi and I. L Markov, ACM Computing Surveys, 45(2):1-34, 2013). In this paper we propose an algorithm to implement an arbitrary $n$-wire reversible circuit with no more than $O(2^n n/\log n)$ elementary gates, and thus close the open problem.</description>

      <title>Multi-self-loop Lackadaisical Quantum Walk with Partial Phase Inversion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.01121v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The lackadaisical quantum walk, a quantum analog of the lazy random walk, is obtained by adding a weighted self-loop transition to each state. Impacts of the self-loop weight $l$ on the final success probability in finding a solution make it a key parameter for the search process. The number of self-loops can also be critical for search tasks. This article proposes the quantum search algorithm Multi-self-loop Lackadaisical Quantum Walk with Partial Phase Inversion, which can be defined as a lackadaisical quantum walk with multiple self-loops, where the target state phase is partially inverted. In the proposed algorithm, each vertex has $m$ self-loops, with weights $l' = l/m$, where $l$ is a real parameter. The phase inversion is based on Grover's algorithm and acts partially, modifying the phase of a given quantity $s &lt; m$ of self-loops. On a hypercube structure, we analyzed the situation where $1 \leqslant m \leqslant 30$. We also propose two new weight values based on two ideal weights $l$ used in the literature. We investigated the effects of partial phase inversion in the search for $1$ to $12$ marked vertices. As a result, this proposal improved the maximum success probabilities to values close to $1$ in $O (\sqrt{(n+m)\cdot N})$, where $n$ is the hypercube degree. This article contributes with a new perspective on the use of quantum interferences in constructing new quantum search algorithms.</description>

      <title>Grover Speedup from Many Forms of the Zeno Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.11146v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has previously been established that adiabatic quantum computation, operating based on a continuous Zeno effect due to dynamical phases between eigenstates, is able to realise an optimal Grover-like quantum speedup. In other words, is able to solve an unstructured search problem with the same $\sqrt{N}$ scaling as Grover's original algorithm. A natural question is whether other manifestations of the Zeno effect can also support an optimal speedup in a physically realistic model (through direct analogue application rather than indirectly by supporting a universal gateset). In this paper we show that they can support such a speedup, whether due to measurement, decoherence, or even decay of the excited state into a computationally useless state. Our results also suggest a wide variety of methods to realise speedup which do not rely on Zeno behaviour. We group these algorithms into three families to facilitate a structured understanding of how speedups can be obtained: one based on phase kicks, containing adiabatic computation and continuous-time quantum walks; one based on dephasing and measurement; and finally one based on destruction of the amplitude within the excited state, for which we are not aware of any previous results. These results suggest that there may be exciting opportunities for new paradigms of analog quantum computing based on these effects.</description>

      <title>Search for Multiple Adjacent Marked Vertices on the Hypercube by a Quantum Walk with Partial Phase Inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.19614v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the application of the Multi-self-loop Lackadaisical Quantum Walk on the hypercube that uses partial phase inversion to search for multiple adjacent marked vertices. We evaluate the influence of the relative position of non-adjacent marked vertices. The use of self-loops and the composition of their weights are an essential part of the construction process of new quantum search algorithms based on lackadaisical quantum walks, however, other aspects have been considered, such as, for example, the type of marked vertices. Part of the energy of a quantum system is retained in states adjacent to the target state. This behavior causes the probability amplitudes of these states to be amplified to values equivalent to those of the target state, reducing their chances of being observed. Here we show experimentally that with the use of partial phase inversion, it is possible to amplify their probability amplitudes to values close to 1 even in scenarios with adjacent marked vertices. We also show that the relative position of the non-adjacent marked vertices did not significantly influence the results. The lackadaisical quantum walk generalization to only a single self-loop and the ideal composition of a weight value was sufficient to obtain advances to quantum search algorithms based on quantum walks. However, the results show that many other aspects need to be taken into account for the construction of new quantum algorithms. It was possible to add gains in the maximum probabilities of success compared to other results found in the literature. In one of the most significant cases, the probability of success increased from $p \approx 0.38$ to $p &gt; 0.99$. Therefore, the use of partial phase inversion brings new contributions to the development of new quantum search algorithms based on quantum walks and the use of multiple self-loops.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.03741v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Variational quantum circuits (VQCs) hold promise for quantum machine learning on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. While tensor-train networks (TTNs) can enhance VQC representation and generalization, the resulting hybrid model, TTN-VQC, faces optimization challenges due to the Polyak-Lojasiewicz (PL) condition. To mitigate this challenge, we introduce Pre+TTN-VQC, a pre-trained TTN model combined with a VQC. Our theoretical analysis, grounded in two-stage empirical risk minimization, provides an upper bound on the transfer learning risk. It demonstrates the approach's advantages in overcoming the optimization challenge while maintaining TTN-VQC's generalization capability. We validate our findings through experiments on quantum dot and handwritten digit classification using simulated and actual NISQ environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.12122v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum incompatibility, referred as the phenomenon that some quantum measurements cannot be
  performed simultaneously, is necessary for various quantum information processing tasks, such as
  nonlocality and steering. When these applications come to high-dimensional multimeasurement scenarios,
  it is crucial and challenging to witness the incompatibility of measurements with complex structures. To
  address this problem, we propose a modified quantum state discrimination protocol that decomposes
  complex compatibility structures into pairwise ones and employs noise robustness to bound incompatibility
  structures. We then derive arithmetic bounds for arbitrary measurements and analytical bounds for mutually
  unbiased bases, and capture some quantum incompatibility structures where measurements are partly
  compatible and partly incompatible. Finally, we experimentally demonstrate our results and connect them
  with quantum steering, quantum simulability and quantum communications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.13126v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In order to characterize and benchmark computational hardware, software, and algorithms, it is essential to have many problem instances on-hand. This is no less true for quantum computation, where a large collection of real-world problem instances would allow for benchmarking studies that in turn help to improve both algorithms and hardware designs. To this end, here we present a large dataset of qubit-based quantum Hamiltonians. The dataset, called HamLib (for Hamiltonian Library), is freely available online and contains problem sizes ranging from 2 to 1000 qubits. HamLib includes problem instances of the Heisenberg model, Fermi-Hubbard model, Bose-Hubbard model, molecular electronic structure, molecular vibrational structure, MaxCut, Max-$k$-SAT, Max-$k$-Cut, QMaxCut, and the traveling salesperson problem. The goals of this effort are (a) to save researchers time by eliminating the need to prepare problem instances and map them to qubit representations, (b) to allow for more thorough tests of new algorithms and hardware, and (c) to allow for reproducibility and standardization across research studies.</description>

      <title>Characterization of coherent errors in gate layers with robustness to Pauli noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.08741v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Characterization of quantum devices generates insights into their sources of disturbances. State-of-the-art characterization protocols often focus on incoherent noise and eliminate coherent errors when using Pauli or Clifford twirling techniques. This approach biases the structure of the effective noise and adds a circuit and sampling overhead. We motivate the extension of an incoherent local Pauli noise model to coherent errors and present a practical characterization protocol for an arbitrary gate layer. Notably, the coherent noise estimation is robust to Pauli noise. We demonstrate our protocol on a superconducting hardware platform and identify the leading coherent errors. To verify the characterized noise structure, we mitigate its coherent and incoherent components using a gate-level coherent noise mitigation scheme in conjunction with probabilistic error cancellation. The proposed characterization procedure opens up possibilities for device calibration, hardware development, and improvement of error mitigation and correction techniques.</description>

Abstract: Dephasing is a main noise mechanism that afflicts quantum information, it reduces visibility, and destroys coherence and entanglement. Therefore, it must be reduced, mitigated, and if possible corrected, to allow for demonstration of quantum advantage in any application of quantum technology, from computing to sensing and communications. Here we discuss a hardware scheme of error filtration to mitigate the effects of dephasing in optical quantum metrology. The scheme uses only passive linear optics and ancillary vacuum modes, without need of single-photon sources or entanglement. It exploits constructive and destructive interference to partially cancel the detrimental effects of statistically independent sources of dephasing. We apply this scheme to preserve coherent states and to phase-stabilize stellar interferometry, showing that a significant improvement can be obtained by using only a few ancillary modes.</description>

Abstract: Recent advances in quantum computers are demonstrating the ability to solve problems at a scale beyond brute force classical simulation. As such, a widespread interest in quantum algorithms has developed in many areas, with optimization being one of the most pronounced domains. Across computer science and physics, there are a number of different approaches for major classes of optimization problems, such as combinatorial optimization, convex optimization, non-convex optimization, and stochastic extensions. This work draws on multiple approaches to study quantum optimization. Provably exact versus heuristic settings are first explained using computational complexity theory - highlighting where quantum advantage is possible in each context. Then, the core building blocks for quantum optimization algorithms are outlined to subsequently define prominent problem classes and identify key open questions that, if answered, will advance the field. The effects of scaling relevant problems on noisy quantum devices are also outlined in detail, alongside meaningful benchmarking problems. We underscore the importance of benchmarking by proposing clear metrics to conduct appropriate comparisons with classical optimization techniques. Lastly, we highlight two domains - finance and sustainability - as rich sources of optimization problems that could be used to benchmark, and eventually validate, the potential real-world impact of quantum optimization.</description>

      <title>Spin-bounded correlations: rotation boxes within and beyond quantum theory</title>

Abstract: How can detector click probabilities respond to spatial rotations around a fixed axis, in any possible physical theory? Here, we give a thorough mathematical analysis of this question in terms of "rotation boxes", which are analogous to the well-known notion of non-local boxes. We prove that quantum theory admits the most general rotational correlations for spins 0, 1/2, and 1, but we describe a metrological game where beyond-quantum resources of spin 3/2 outperform all quantum resources of the same spin. We prove a multitude of fundamental results about these correlations, including an exact convex characterization of the spin-1 correlations, a Tsirelson-type inequality for spins 3/2 and higher, and a proof that the general spin-J correlations provide an efficient outer SDP approximation to the quantum set. Furthermore, we review and consolidate earlier results that hint at a wealth of applications of this formalism: a theory-agnostic semi-device-independent randomness generator, an exact characterization of the quantum (2,2,2)-Bell correlations in terms of local symmetries, and the derivation of multipartite Bell witnesses. Our results illuminate the foundational question of how space constrains the structure of quantum theory, they build a bridge between semi-device-independent quantum information and spacetime physics, and they demonstrate interesting relations to topics such as entanglement witnesses, spectrahedra, and orbitopes.</description>

      <title>Reducing measurement costs by recycling the Hessian in adaptive variational quantum algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05172v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Adaptive protocols enable the construction of more efficient state preparation circuits in variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) by utilizing data obtained from the quantum processor during the execution of the algorithm. This idea originated with ADAPT-VQE, an algorithm that iteratively grows the state preparation circuit operator by operator, with each new operator accompanied by a new variational parameter, and where all parameters acquired thus far are optimized in each iteration. In ADAPT-VQE and other adaptive VQAs that followed it, it has been shown that initializing parameters to their optimal values from the previous iteration speeds up convergence and avoids shallow local traps in the parameter landscape. However, no other data from the optimization performed at one iteration is carried over to the next. In this work, we propose an improved quasi-Newton optimization protocol specifically tailored to adaptive VQAs. The distinctive feature in our proposal is that approximate second derivatives of the cost function are recycled across iterations in addition to parameter values. We implement a quasi-Newton optimizer where an approximation to the inverse Hessian matrix is continuously built and grown across the iterations of an adaptive VQA. The resulting algorithm has the flavor of a continuous optimization where the dimension of the search space is augmented when the gradient norm falls below a given threshold. We show that this inter-optimization exchange of second-order information leads the Hessian in the state of the optimizer to better approximate the exact Hessian. As a result, our method achieves a superlinear convergence rate even in situations where the typical quasi-Newton optimizer converges only linearly. Our protocol decreases the measurement costs in implementing adaptive VQAs on quantum hardware as well as the runtime of their classical simulation.</description>

Abstract: Quantum thermal machines are powerful platforms for investigating how quantum effects impact the energy flow between different systems. Here, we investigate a two-stroke cycle in which spin-squeezing effects are intrinsically switched on during the entire operation time. By using Kitagawa and Ueda's parameter and the l1-norm to compute the degree of spin squeezing and the quantum coherence, we first show that the greater the spin squeezing effect, the greater the amount of coherence in the energy basis. Then, we investigate the engine performance given the amount of spin squeezing into the system. Our results show that even assuming an always-on spin squeezing, which is directly associated with the amount of entropy production in the cycle, it is possible to find a better set of efficiency and extracted power for the engine provided a high level of control over the relevant parameters, i.e., the operation time and the squeezing intensity.</description>

      <title>A Complete Graphical Language for Linear Optical Circuits with Finite-Photon-Number Sources and Detectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17693v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Linear optical circuits can be used to manipulate the quantum states of photons as they pass through components including beam splitters and phase shifters. Those photonic states possess a particularly high level of expressiveness, as they reside within the bosonic Fock space, an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space. However, in the domain of linear optical quantum computation, these basic components may not be sufficient to efficiently perform all computations of interest, such as universal quantum computation. To address this limitation it is common to add auxiliary sources and detectors, which enable projections onto auxiliary photonic states and thus increase the versatility of the processes. In this paper, we introduce the $\textbf{LO}_{fi}$-calculus, a graphical language to reason on the infinite-dimensional bosonic Fock space with circuits composed of four core elements of linear optics: the phase shifter, the beam splitter, and auxiliary sources and detectors with bounded photon number. We present an equational theory that we prove to be complete: two $\textbf{LO}_{fi}$-circuits represent the same quantum process if and only if one can be transformed into the other with the rules of the $\textbf{LO}_{fi}$-calculus. We give a unique and compact universal form for such circuits.</description>

      <title>Entanglement cost of discriminating quantum states under locality constraints</title>

Abstract: The unique features of entanglement and non-locality in quantum systems, where there are pairs of bipartite states perfectly distinguishable by general entangled measurements yet indistinguishable by local operations and classical communication, hold significant importance in quantum entanglement theory, distributed quantum information processing, and quantum data hiding. This paper delves into the entanglement cost for discriminating two bipartite quantum states, employing positive operator-valued measures (POVMs) with positive partial transpose (PPT) to achieve optimal success probability through general entangled measurements. First, we introduce an efficiently computable quantity called the spectral PPT-distance of a POVM to quantify the localness of a general measurement. We show that it can be a lower bound for the entanglement cost of optimal discrimination by PPT POVMs. Second, we establish an upper bound on the entanglement cost of optimal discrimination by PPT POVMs for any pair of states. Leveraging this result, we show that a pure state can be optimally discriminated against any other state with the assistance of a single Bell state. This study advances our understanding of the pivotal role played by entanglement in quantum state discrimination, serving as a crucial element in unlocking quantum data hiding against locally constrained measurements.</description>

      <title>Scalable Multispecies Ion Transport in a Grid-Based Surface-Electrode Trap</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00756v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum processors based on linear arrays of trapped ions have achieved exceptional performance, but scaling to large qubit numbers requires realizing two-dimensional ion arrays as envisioned in the quantum charge-coupled device (QCCD) architecture. Here we present a scalable method for the control of ion crystals in a grid-based surface-electrode Paul trap and characterize it in the context of transport operations that sort and reorder multispecies crystals. By combining cowiring of control electrodes at translationally symmetric locations in each grid site with the sitewise ability to exchange the voltages applied to two special electrodes gated by a binary input, site dependent operations can be achieved using only a fixed number of analog voltage signals and a single digital input per site. In two separate experimental systems containing nominally identical grid traps, one using $^{171}\mathrm{Yb}^{+}$-$^{138}\mathrm{Ba}^{+}$ crystals and the other $^{137}\mathrm{Ba}^{+}$-$^{88}\mathrm{Sr}^{+}$, we demonstrate this method by characterizing the conditional intrasite crystal reorder and the conditional exchange of ions between adjacent sites on the grid. Averaged across a multisite region of interest, we measure subquanta motional excitation in the axial in-phase and out-of-phase modes of the crystals following these operations at exchange rates of 2.5 kHz. In this initial demonstration, the logic controlling the voltage exchange occurs in software, but the applied signals mimic a proposed hardware implementation using crossover switches. These techniques can be further extended to implement other conditional operations in the QCCD architecture such as gates, initialization and measurement.</description>

Abstract: Grover's algorithm, orginally conceived as a means of searching an unordered database, can also be used to extract solutions from the result sets generated by quantum computations. The Grover algorithm exploits the concept of an oracle function, which abstracts the process of matching a search item (returning 1 for a match and 0 otherwise), where searching for 1 target item in a search space of size $N$ scales as $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{N})$ oracle queries. In this article, we explore the idea of associating a separate oracle with each bit of the matching condition, obtaining multiple partial oracle functions which can be tested independently. Exploring this idea leads to a multi-stage hybrid search algorithm, whose performance can fall within a wide range, anywhere between $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{N})$ (same as Grover) or $\mathcal{O}(\log(N))$. The algorithm is validated against the simplest kind of search scenario, where the incoming index bits are scrambled using a permutation operation.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of logical qubits and repeated error correction with better-than-physical error rates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02280v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The promise of quantum computers hinges on the ability to scale to large system sizes, e.g., to run quantum computations consisting of more than 100 million operations fault-tolerantly. This in turn requires suppressing errors to levels inversely proportional to the size of the computation. As a step towards this ambitious goal, we present experiments on a trapped-ion QCCD processor where, through the use of fault-tolerant encoding and error correction, we are able to suppress logical error rates to levels below the physical error rates. In particular, we entangled logical qubits encoded in the [[7,1,3]] code with error rates 9.8 times to 500 times lower than at the physical level, and entangled logical qubits encoded in a [[12,2,4]] code based on Knill's C4/C6 scheme with error rates 4.7 times to 800 times lower than at the physical level, depending on the judicious use of post-selection. Moreover, we demonstrate repeated error correction with the [[12,2,4]] code, with logical error rates below physical circuit baselines corresponding to repeated CNOTs, and show evidence that the error rate per error correction cycle, which consists of over 100 physical CNOTs, approaches the error rate of two physical CNOTs. These results signify a transition from noisy intermediate scale quantum computing to reliable quantum computing, and demonstrate advanced capabilities toward large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07509v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically propose a multiparameter cascaded quantum interferometer in which a two-input and two-output setup is obtained by concatenating 50:50 beam splitters with $n$ independent and adjustable time delays. A general method for deriving the coincidence probability of such an interferometer is given based on the linear transformation of the matrix of beam splitters. As examples, we analyze the interference characteristics of one-, two- and three-parameter cascaded quantum interferometers with different frequency correlations and input states. Some typical interferograms of such interferometers are provided to reveal richer and more complicated two-photon interference phenomena. This work offers a general theoretical framework for designing versatile quantum interferometers and provides a convenient method for deriving the coincidence probabilities involved. In principle, arbitrary two-input and two-output experimental setups can be designed with the framework. Potential applications can be found in the complete spectral characterization of two-photon states, multiparameter estimation, and quantum metrology.</description>

      <title>Quantum Coherence and Distinguishability: A Resource-Theoretic Perspective on Wave-Particle Duality</title>

Abstract: Wave-particle duality, the cornerstone of quantum mechanics, illustrates essential trade-offs between two complementary aspects of quantum systems. Captured by Bohr's complementarity principle, the wave-particle duality relation indicates that perfect path discrimination in a multipath interferometer obliterates interference patterns and vice versa. In this work, from the perspective of coherence resource manipulation, we uncover a novel duality relation between quantum coherence and distinguishability in ensembles of mutually orthogonal pure states. We demonstrate the sum of `co-bits', coherence preserved after discrimination, and classical bits, distinguishability extracted through perfect discrimination is bounded. One cannot simultaneously extract all classical information and preserve coherence. Such duality relation exposes an inherent trade-off between quantum coherence and classical distinguishability resources. Our findings offer a fresh perspective and advance our understanding of the intrinsic complementary relationship between quantum and classical resources.</description>

Abstract: Symmetry in mixed quantum states can manifest in two distinct forms: strong symmetry, where each individual pure state in the quantum ensemble is symmetric with the same charge, and weak symmetry, which applies only to the entire ensemble. This paper explores a novel type of spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) where a strong symmetry is broken to a weak one. While the SSB of a weak symmetry is measured by the long-ranged two-point correlation function, the strong-to-weak SSB (SW-SSB) is measured by the fidelity correlator. We prove that SW-SSB is a universal property of mixed-state quantum phases, in the sense that the phenomenon of SW-SSB is robust against symmetric low-depth local quantum channels. We also show that the symmetry breaking is "spontaneous" in the sense that the effect of a local symmetry-breaking measurement cannot be recovered locally. We argue that a thermal state at a nonzero temperature in the canonical ensemble (with fixed symmetry charge) should have spontaneously broken strong symmetry. Additionally, we study non-thermal scenarios where decoherence induces SW-SSB, leading to phase transitions described by classical statistical models with bond randomness. In particular, the SW-SSB transition of a decohered Ising model can be viewed as the "ungauged" version of the celebrated toric code decodability transition. We confirm that, in the decohered Ising model, the SW-SSB transition defined by the fidelity correlator is the only physical transition in terms of channel recoverability. We also comment on other (inequivalent) definitions of SW-SSB, through correlation functions with higher Renyi indices.</description>

      <title>Symmetric Clifford twirling for cost-optimal quantum error mitigation in early FTQC regime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07720v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Twirling noise affecting quantum gates is essential in understanding and controlling errors, but applicable operations to noise are usually restricted by symmetries inherent in quantum gates. In this Letter, we propose symmetric Clifford twirling, a Clifford twirling utilizing only symmetric Clifford operators that commute with certain Pauli subgroups. We fully characterize how each Pauli noise is converted through the twirling and show that certain Pauli noise can be scrambled to a noise exponentially close to the global white noise. We further provide numerical demonstrations for highly structured circuits, such as Trotterized Hamiltonian simulation circuits, that noise effect on typical observables can be described by the global white noise, and also that even a single use of CNOT gate for twirling can significantly accelerate the scrambling. These findings enable us to mitigate errors in non-Clifford operations with minimal sampling overhead in the early stages of fault-tolerant quantum computing.</description>

      <title>A Recursive Lower Bound on the Energy Improvement of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10125v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) uses a quantum computer to implement a variational method with $2p$ layers of alternating unitary operators, optimized by a classical computer to minimize a cost function. While rigorous performance guarantees exist for the QAOA at small depths $p$, the behavior at large depths remains less clear, though simulations suggest exponentially fast convergence for certain problems. In this work, we gain insights into the deep QAOA using an analytic expansion of the cost function around transition states. Transition states are constructed recursively: from a local minima of the QAOA with $p$ layers we obtain transition states of the QAOA with $p+1$ layers, which are stationary points characterized by a unique direction of negative curvature. We construct an analytic estimate of the negative curvature and the corresponding direction in parameter space at each transition state. Expansion of the QAOA cost function along the negative direction to the quartic order gives a lower bound of the QAOA cost function improvement. We provide physical intuition behind the analytic expressions for the local curvature and quartic expansion coefficient. Our numerical study confirms the accuracy of our approximations, and reveals that the obtained bound and the true value of the QAOA cost function gain have a characteristic exponential decrease with the number of layers $p$, with the bound decreasing more rapidly. Our study establishes an analytical method for recursively studying the QAOA applicable in the regime of high circuit depth.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-Inspired Quantum Noise Mitigation in Parameterized Quantum Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00843v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Parameterized Quantum Circuits (PQCs) have been acknowledged as a leading strategy to utilize near-term quantum advantages in multiple problems, including machine learning and combinatorial optimization. When applied to specific tasks, the parameters in the quantum circuits are trained to minimize the target function. Although there have been comprehensive studies to improve the performance of the PQCs on practical tasks, the errors caused by the quantum noise downgrade the performance when running on real quantum computers. In particular, when the quantum state is transformed through multiple quantum circuit layers, the effect of the quantum noise happens cumulatively and becomes closer to the maximally mixed state or complete noise. This paper studies the relationship between the quantum noise and the diffusion model. Then, we propose a novel diffusion-inspired learning approach to mitigate the quantum noise in the PQCs and reduce the error for specific tasks. Through our experiments, we illustrate the efficiency of the learning strategy and achieve state-of-the-art performance on classification tasks in the quantum noise scenarios.</description>

      <title>Harnessing spontaneous emission of correlated photon pairs from ladder-type giant atoms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12414v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The realization of correlated multi-photon processes usually depends on the interaction between nonlinear media and atoms. However, the nonlinearity of optical materials is generally weak, making it still very challenging to achieve correlated multi-photon dynamics at the few-photon level. Meanwhile, giant atoms, with their capability for multi-point coupling, which is a novel paradigm in quantum optics, mostly focus on the single photon field. In this work, using the method described in Phys. Rev. Res. 6. 013279 (2024), we reveal that the ladder-type three-level giant atom spontaneously emits strongly correlated photon pairs with high efficiency by designing and optimizing the target function. In addition, by encoding local phases into the optimal coupling sequence, directional two-photon correlated transfer can be achieved. This method does not require a nonlinear waveguide and can be realized in the conventional environment. We show that the photon pairs emitted in both the bidirectional and the chiral case exhibit strong correlation properties in both time and space. Such correlated photon pairs have great potential applications for quantum information processing. For example, numerical results show that our proposal can realize the two-photon mediated cascaded quantum system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16644v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate potential scattering and tunneling dynamics of a particle wavepacket evolving according to the relativistic Schr\"odinger equation (also known as the Salpeter equation). The tunneling properties of the Salpeter equation differ from those of the standard relativistic wave equations (such as the Klein-Gordon or Dirac equations). In particular, the tunneling solutions must be found by working in momentum space, given that the equation in configuration space contains a pseudo-differential operator. The resulting integral equations are derived and solved numerically for wavepackets scattering on model potential barriers. The solutions are characterized by the absence of Klein tunneling and an effect of the potential on the fraction of the transmitted wavepacket that propagates outside the light cone, a feature that has in the past been well-studied only for free propagation.</description>

      <title>Symmetries and singular behaviors with Bohmian trajectories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08096v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum mechanics is able to predict challenging behaviors even in the simplest physical scenarios. These behaviors are possible because of the important dynamical role that phase plays in the evolution of quantum systems, and are very similar, on the other hand, to effects observable in analogous optical systems. This work focuses on how Bohmian mechanics proves to be a rather convenient theoretical framework to analyze phase-based phenomena, since the phase constitutes the central element in this hydrodynamical formulation of quantum mechanics. More specifically, it allows us to understand how spatial phase variations give rise to velocity fields that eventually rule the dynamical behavior of quantum systems, and that, when integrated in time locally (i.e., taking into account specific positions), they provide us with a neat local (point by point) description of the system evolution in the configuration space. Indeed, it will also be seen that this idea transcends the quantum realm and can be profitably used to describe the behavior of optical analogs with rather singular behaviors. With this purpose, two interesting phenomena that take place in free space are considered, namely, the self-acceleration and shape-invariance of Airy beams, and spontaneous self-focusing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08905v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we re-examine the Goldstein-Ka\c{c} velocity switching model from two points of view. On the one hand, we prove that the forward and backward Chapman-Kolmogorov equations of the stochastic process are Lorentz covariant when the trajectories are parameterized by their proper time. On the other hand, to recast the model as a quantum random evolution, we consider restating the Goldstein-Ka\c{c} model as a Hamiltonian system, which can then be quantized using the standard correspondence rules. It turns out that the density for the random quantum evolution satisfies a Chapman-Kolmogorov equation similar to that of the classical case, and therefore, it is also Lorentz covariant. We compute the average quantum variance. To finish, we verify that the quantum model is also consistent with special relativity and that transitions outside the light cone, that is, transitions between states with disjoint supports in space-time, cannot occur.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11782v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Closed quantum systems follow a unitary time evolution that can be simulated on quantum computers. By incorporating non-unitary effects via, e.g., measurements on ancilla qubits, these algorithms can be extended to open-system dynamics, such as Markovian processes described by the Lindblad master equation. In this paper, we analyze the convergence criteria and speed of a Markovian, purely dissipative quantum random walk on an unstructured classical search space. Notably, we show that certain jump operators make the quantum process replicate a classical one, while others yield differences between open quantum (OQRW) and classical random walks. We also clarify a previously observed quadratic speedup, demonstrating that OQRWs are no more efficient than classical search. Finally, we analyze a dissipative discrete-time ground-state preparation algorithm with a lower implementation cost. This allows us to interpolate between the dissipative and the unitary domain and thereby illustrate the important role of coherence for the quadratic speedup.</description>

Abstract: Quantum metrology and quantum sensing aim to use quantum properties to enhance measurement precision beyond what could be classically achieved. Here, we demonstrate how the analysis of the phase space structure of the classical limit of Kerr parametric oscillators can be used for determining control parameters values that lead to the squeezing of the uncertainty in position and the amplification of the quantum Fisher information. We also explore how quantum sensing can benefit from excited-state quantum phase transitions, even in the absence of a conventional quantum phase transition. The system that we consider models exciton-polariton condensates and superconducting circuits, making our study relevant for potential experimental applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19575v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficiently simulating quantum circuits on classical computers is a fundamental challenge in quantum computing. This paper presents a novel theoretical approach that achieves exponential speedups (polynomial runtime) over existing simulators for a wide class of quantum circuits. The technique leverages advanced group theory and symmetry considerations to map quantum circuits to equivalent forms amenable to efficient classical simulation. Several fundamental theorems are proven that establish the mathematical foundations of this approach, including a generalized Gottesman-Knill theorem. The potential of this method is demonstrated through theoretical analysis and preliminary benchmarks. This work contributes to the understanding of the boundary between classical and quantum computation, provides new tools for quantum circuit analysis and optimization, and opens up avenues for further research at the intersection of group theory and quantum computation. The findings may have implications for quantum algorithm design, error correction, and the development of more efficient quantum simulators.</description>

Abstract: Quantum phase transitions reveal deep insights into the behavior of many-body quantum systems, but identifying these transitions without well-defined order parameters remains a significant challenge. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to constructing phase diagrams using the vector field of the reduced fidelity susceptibility (RFS). This method maps quantum phases and formulates an optimization problem to discover observables corresponding to order parameters. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by applying it to well-established models, including the Axial Next Nearest Neighbour Interaction (ANNNI) model, a cluster state model, and a chain of Rydberg atoms. By analyzing observable decompositions into eigen-projectors and finite-size scaling, our method successfully identifies order parameters and characterizes quantum phase transitions with high precision. Our results provide a powerful tool for exploring quantum phases in systems where conventional order parameters are not readily available.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Noise of Driven Controlled Field Using the Central Spin Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01375v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the coherence dynamics of a central spin coupled to a spin chain with a time-dependent noisy magnetic field, focusing on how noise influences the system's decoherence. Our results show that decoherency due to the nonequilibrium critical dynamics of the environment is amplified in the presence of uncorrelated and correlated Gaussian noise. We demonstrate that decoherence factor consistently signals the critical points, and exhibits exponential scaling with the system size, the square of noise intensity, and the noise correlation time at the critical points. We find that strong coupling between the qubit and the environment allows partial revivals of coherence, which diminish with increasing noise intensity or decreasing noise correlation time. In contrast, weak coupling leads to monotonic enhanced decoherence. The numerical results illustrate that, the revivals decay and scale exponentially with noise intensity. Moreover, the revivals increase and indicate linear or power law scaling with noise correlation time depends on how the correlated noise is fast or slow. Additionally, we explore the non-Markovianity of the dynamics, finding that it decays in the presence of noise but increases as the noise correlation time grows. Our findings have potential applications in the noise spectroscopy of external signals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02010v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces the Hamiltonian-Adaptive Ternary Tree (HATT) framework to compile optimized Fermion-to-qubit mapping for specific Fermionic Hamiltonians. In the simulation of Fermionic quantum systems, efficient Fermion-to-qubit mapping plays a critical role in transforming the Fermionic system into a qubit system. HATT utilizes ternary tree mapping and a bottom-up construction procedure to generate Hamiltonian aware Fermion-to-qubit mapping to reduce the Pauli weight of the qubit Hamiltonian, resulting in lower quantum simulation circuit overhead. Additionally, our optimizations retain the important vacuum state preservation property in our Fermion-to-qubit mapping and reduce the complexity of our algorithm from $O(N^4)$ to $O(N^3)$. Evaluations and simulations of various Fermionic systems demonstrate $5\sim20\%$ reduction in Pauli weight, gate count, and circuit depth, alongside excellent scalability to larger systems. Experiments on the Ionq quantum computer also show the advantages of our approach in noise resistance in quantum simulations.</description>

      <title>Super-bunching light with giant high-order correlations and extreme multi-photon events</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05419v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-classical light sources emitting bundles of N-photons with strong correlation represent versatile resources of interdisciplinary importance with applications ranging from fundamental tests of quantum mechanics to quantum information processing. Yet, high-order correlations, gN(0),quantifying photon correlation, are still limited to hundreds. Here, we report the generation of a super-bunching light source in photonic crystal fiber with g2(0) reaching 5.86*104 and g5(0) up to 2.72*108, through measuring its photon number probability distributions. under giant g2(0) values, the super-bunching light source presents upturned-tail photon distributions and ubiquitous extreme multi-photon events, where 31 photons from a single light pulse at a mean of 1.99*10-4 photons per pulse have been determined. The probability of this extreme event has been enhanced by 10139 folds compared to a coherent laser with Poissonian distribution. By varying the power of the pumping laser, both photon number distributions and corresponding high-order correlations of this light source can be substantially tailored from Poissonian to super-bunching distributions. These phenomena are attributed to the synchronized nonlinear interactions in photonic crystal fibers pumping by bright squeezed light, and the theoretical simulations agree well with the experimental results. Our research showcases the ability to achieve non-classical light sources with giant high-order correlations and extreme multi-photon events, paving the way for high-order correlation imaging, extreme nonlinear optical effects, quantum information processing, and exploring light-matter interactions with multi-photon physics.</description>

      <title>X-arability of mixed quantum states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18948v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The problem of determining when entanglement is present in a quantum system is one of the most active areas of research in quantum physics. Depending on the setting at hand, different notions of entanglement (or lack thereof) become relevant. Examples include separability (of bosons, fermions, and distinguishable particles), Schmidt number, biseparability, entanglement depth, and bond dimension. In this work, we propose and study a unified notion of separability, which we call X-arability, that captures a wide range of applications including these. For a subset (more specifically, an algebraic variety) of pure states X, we say that a mixed quantum state is X-arable if it lies in the convex hull of X. We develop unified tools and provable guarantees for X-arability, which already give new results for the standard separability problem. Our results include:
  -- An X-tensions hierarchy of semidefinite programs for X-arability (generalizing the symmetric extensions hierarchy for separability), and a new de Finetti theorem for fermionic separability.
  -- A hierarchy of eigencomputations for optimizing a Hermitian operator over X, with applications to X-tanglement witnesses and polynomial optimization.
  -- A hierarchy of linear systems for the X-tangled subspace problem, with improved polynomial time guarantees even for the standard entangled subspace problem, in both the generic and worst case settings.</description>

Abstract: I carry out numerical scattering calculations against a family of finite-length one-dimensional point-like arrangements of atoms, $\chi(x)$, related to the distribution of prime numbers by a shift operation making the atomic density approximately constant. I show how the Riemann Zeta Function (RZF) naturally parameterizes the analytic structure of the scattering amplitude and give numerical results.</description>

      <title>Operator algebra and algorithmic construction of boundaries and defects in (2+1)D topological Pauli stabilizer codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11942v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a computational algorithm for constructing all boundaries and defects of topological generalized Pauli stabilizer codes in two spatial dimensions. Utilizing the operator algebra formalism, we establish a one-to-one correspondence between the topological data-such as anyon types, fusion rules, topological spins, and braiding statistics-of (2+1)D bulk stabilizer codes and (1+1)D boundary anomalous subsystem codes. To make the operator algebra computationally accessible, we adapt Laurent polynomials and convert the tasks into matrix operations, e.g., the Hermite normal form for obtaining boundary anyons and the Smith normal form for determining fusion rules. This approach enables computers to automatically generate all possible gapped boundaries and defects for topological Pauli stabilizer codes through boundary anyon condensation and topological order completion. This streamlines the analysis of surface codes and associated logical operations for fault-tolerant quantum computation. Our algorithm applies to $Z_d$ qudits, including both prime and nonprime $d$, thus enabling the exploration of topological quantum codes beyond toric codes. We have applied the algorithm and explicitly demonstrated the lattice constructions of 2 boundaries and 6 defects in the $Z_2$ toric code, 3 boundaries and 22 defects in the $Z_4$ toric code, 1 boundary and 2 defects in the double semion code, 1 boundary and 22 defects in the six-semion code, 6 boundaries and 270 defects in the color code, and 6 defects in the anomalous three-fermion code. In addition, we investigate the boundaries of two specific bivariate bicycle codes within a family of low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. We demonstrate that their topological orders are equivalent to 8 and 10 copies of $Z_2$ toric codes, with anyons restricted to move by 12 and 1023 lattice sites in the square lattice, respectively.</description>

      <title>Many-body enhancement of energy storage in a waveguide-QED quantum battery</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14555v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum batteries have demonstrated remarkable charging properties, showing that a quantum advantage is possible in the realm of quantum thermodynamics. However, finding an effective strategy to store energy for long periods remains crucial in these systems. Here, we investigate different configurations of a waveguide-QED system acting as a quantum battery and show that, in this context, collective effects can slow down the self-discharging time of the battery, thus improving the storage time. Specifically, when the artificial atoms of the array are arranged randomly, the energy and ergotropy of the optical system are shown to decay at a subexponential rate over long periods, in contrast to the energy decay of a single atom in a waveguide. In the case of atoms arranged in an ordered lattice, collective effects slow down dissipative discharging only for a specific lattice spacing. Thus, in both configurations, collective effects can be used to boost the energy-protection properties of optical systems.</description>

      <title>Cooperative non-reciprocal emission and quantum sensing of symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14850v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-reciprocal propagation of energy and information is fundamental to a wide range of quantum technology applications. In this work, we explore the quantum many-body dynamics of a qubit ensemble coupled to a shared bath that mediates coherent and dissipative inter-qubit interactions with both symmetric and anti-symmetric components. We find that the interplay between anti-symmetric (symmetric) coherent and symmetric (anti-symmetric) dissipative interactions results in non-reciprocal couplings, which, in turn, generate a spatially asymmetric emission pattern. We demonstrate that this pattern arises from non-reciprocal interactions coupling different quantum many-body states within a specific excitation manifold. Focusing on solid-state baths, we show that their lack of time-reversal and inversion symmetry is a key ingredient for generating non-reciprocal dynamics in the qubit ensemble. With the plethora of quantum materials that exhibit this symmetry breaking at equilibrium, our approach paves the way for realizing cooperative non-reciprocal transport in qubit ensembles without requiring time-modulated external drives or complex engineering. Using an ensemble of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers coupled to a generic non-centrosymmetric ferromagnetic bath as a concrete example, we demonstrate that our predictions can be tested in near-future experiments. As the spatial asymmetry in the relaxation dynamics of the qubit ensemble is a direct probe of symmetry breaking in the solid-state bath, our work also opens the door to developing model-agnostic quantum sensing schemes capable of detecting bath properties invisible to current state-of-the-art protocols, which operate solid-state defects as single-qubit sensors.</description>

      <title>Simulating and investigating various dynamic aspects of $\rm{H}_2\rm{O}$-related hydrogen bond model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15121v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A simple $\rm{H}_2\rm{O}$-related hydrogen bond model, modified from the Jaynes-Cummings model, is proposed and its various dynamic aspects are investigated theoretically. In this model, the formation and breaking processes of hydrogen bond are accompanied by the creation and annihilation of the thermal phonon of the medium. A number of simplifying assumptions about the dynamics of the molecules involved are used. Rotating wave approximation is applied under consideration of the strong-coupling condition. Dissipative dynamics under the Markovian approximation is obtained through solving the quantum master equation - Lindbladian. The probabilities of reaction channels involving hydrogen bond depending on the parameters of the external environment, are obtained. Differences between unitary and dissipative evolutions are discussed. Consideration is given to the effect of all kinds of potential interactions and dissipations on evolution. Consideration is also given to the reverse processes (inflows) of dissipations. The results show that the magnitude changes of the interactions and dissipations have a slight effect on the formation of hydrogen bond, but the variation of the inflows significantly affects the formation of hydrogen bond. According to the findings, the dynamics of $\rm{H}_2\rm{O}$-related hydrogen bond model can be controlled by selectively choosing system parameters. The results will be used as a basis to extend the research to more complex chemical and biological models in the future.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Entanglement in Nanomechanical Resonators through Quantum Squeezing and Parametric Amplification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15345v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a scheme that optimizes entanglement in nanomechanical resonators through quantum state transfer of squeezed fields assisted by radiation pressure. The system is driven by red-detuned laser fields, which enable simultaneous cooling of the mechanical resonators while facilitating the transfer of quantum states in a weak coupling, sideband-resolved regime. The mechanical entanglement is quantified using logarithmic negativity within the bipartite Gaussian states of the two mechanical modes. Our results show that the degree of mechanical entanglement is strongly influenced by several key parameters, including the parametric phase and nonlinear gain of the non-degenerate OPA, the squeezing strength of the injected squeezed vacuum reservoir, optomechanical cooperativity (controlled by laser drive power), and the mechanical bath temperature (phonon thermal excitation). Additionally, our results indicate that careful tuning of these parameters can enhance entanglement robustness, suggesting that this optomechanical scheme holds promise for applications in quantum sensing and information processing.</description>

      <title>The Learning Stabilizers with Noise problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18953v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Random classical codes have good error correcting properties, and yet they are notoriously hard to decode in practice. Despite many decades of extensive study, the fastest known algorithms still run in exponential time. The Learning Parity with Noise (LPN) problem, which can be seen as the task of decoding a random linear code in the presence of noise, has thus emerged as a prominent hardness assumption with numerous applications in both cryptography and learning theory.
  Is there a natural quantum analog of the LPN problem? In this work, we introduce the Learning Stabilizers with Noise (LSN) problem, the task of decoding a random stabilizer code in the presence of local depolarizing noise. We give both polynomial-time and exponential-time quantum algorithms for solving LSN in various depolarizing noise regimes, ranging from extremely low noise, to low constant noise rates, and even higher noise rates up to a threshold. Next, we provide concrete evidence that LSN is hard. First, we show that LSN includes LPN as a special case, which suggests that it is at least as hard as its classical counterpart. Second, we prove a worst-case to average-case reduction for variants of LSN. We then ask: what is the computational complexity of solving LSN? Because the task features quantum inputs, its complexity cannot be characterized by traditional complexity classes. Instead, we show that the LSN problem lies in a recently introduced (distributional and oracle) unitary synthesis class. Finally, we identify several applications of our LSN assumption, ranging from the construction of quantum bit commitment schemes to the computational limitations of learning from quantum data.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we develop a panoramic schematic of a quantum thermoelectric circuit theory in the steady state regime. We establish the foundations of the said premise by defining the analogs of Kirchhoff's laws for heat currents and temperature gradients. We further show that our approach encompasses various circuits like thermal diode, transistor, and Wheatstone bridge. Additionally, we have been able to develop a model of a quantum thermal step transformer. We also construct a novel model of a thermal adder circuit, paving the way to develop thermal integrated circuits. This sheds new light on the present architecture of quantum device engineering.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05950v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum probes, such as single- and two-qubit probes, can accurately measure the temperature of a bosonic bath. The current investigation assesses the precision of temperature estimate using quantum Fisher information and the accompanying quantum signal-to-noise ratio. Employing an ancilla as a mediator between the probe and the bath improves thermometric sensitivity by transmitting temperature information into the probe qubit's coherences. In addition, we analyze two interacting qubits that were initially entangled or separated as quantum probes for various environmental configurations. Our findings show that increased precision is gained when the probe approaches its steady state, which is determined by the coupling between the two qubits. Furthermore, we can obtain high efficiency temperature estimation for any low temperature by changing the interaction between the two qubits.</description>

      <title>Error-mitigated initialization of surface codes with non-Pauli stabilizers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06407v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum error correction represents a significant milestone in large-scale quantum computing, with the surface code being a prominent strategy due to its high error threshold and experimental feasibility. However, it is challenging to implement non-Clifford logical gates in a fault-tolerant way with low overhead, through the conventional magic state distillation technique. Here, we enhance the performance of the conventional surface code by incorporating non-Pauli stabilizers and introduce two innovative initialization protocols. Our approach enhances the fidelity of the initialization of non-Clifford logical state by avoiding unprotected operations before the encoding process. This improved fidelity of the initialization of non-Clifford logical states reduces the necessary number of logical qubits for precise state distillation, ultimately decreasing the overall resource overhead. Furthermore, we demonstrate the ability to entangle logical qubits in non-Pauli and Pauli bases via the lattice surgery technique. This integration enables the use of Pauli-based surface codes for computation while non-Pauli codes are employed for auxiliary qubit initialization, thus compatible with the conventional wisdom of logical Clifford operation based on the Pauli-based surface code.</description>

Abstract: Linear spectra of molecular polaritons formed by $N$ molecules coupled to a microcavity photon mode are usually well described by classical linear optics, raising the question of where the expected nonlinear effects in these strongly coupled systems are. In this work, we derive a general expression for the polaritonic linear spectra that reveal previously overlooked finite-size quantum corrections due to vacuum-mediated molecular Raman processes. Using a $1/N$ expansion, we demonstrate that these nonlinearities are suppressed in typical low-Q cavities due to an emergent timescale separation in polariton dynamics yet manifest in high-Q single-mode cavities where the photon loss is comparable to the single-molecule light-matter coupling strength.</description>

      <title>A hierarchy of eigencomputations for polynomial optimization on the sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17827v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a convergent hierarchy of lower bounds on the minimum value of a real form over the unit sphere. The main practical advantage of our hierarchy over the real sum-of-squares (RSOS) hierarchy is that the lower bound at each level of our hierarchy is obtained by a minimum eigenvalue computation, as opposed to the full semidefinite program (SDP) required at each level of RSOS. In practice, this allows us to compute bounds on much larger forms than are computationally feasible for RSOS. Our hierarchy outperforms previous alternatives to RSOS, both asymptotically and in numerical experiments. We obtain our hierarchy by proving a reduction from real optimization on the sphere to Hermitian optimization on the sphere, and invoking the Hermitian sum-of-squares (HSOS) hierarchy. This opens the door to using other Hermitian optimization techniques for real optimization, and gives a path towards developing spectral hierarchies for more general constrained real optimization problems. To this end, we use our techniques to develop a hierarchy of eigencomputations for computing the real tensor spectral norm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.04631v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum information transfer is fundamental for scalable quantum computing in any potential platform and architecture. Hole spin qubits, owing to their intrinsic spin-orbit interaction (SOI), promise fast quantum operations which are fundamental for the implementation of quantum gates. Yet, the influence of SOI in quantum transfer protocols remains an open question. Here, we investigate flying spin qubits mediated by SOI, using shortcuts to adiabaticity protocols, i.e., the long-range transfer of spin qubits and the quantum distribution of entangled pairs in semiconductor quantum dot arrays. We show that electric field manipulation allows dynamical control of the SOI, enabling simultaneously the implementation of quantum gates during the transfer, with the potential to significantly accelerate quantum algorithms. By harnessing the ability to perform quantum gates in parallel with the transfer, we implement dynamical decoupling schemes to focus and preserve the spin state, leading to higher transfer fidelity.</description>

Abstract: We study the effect of ferromagnetic metals (FM) on the circularly polarized modes of an electromagnetic cavity and show that broken time-reversal symmetry leads to a dichroic response of the cavity modes. With one spin-split band, the Zeeman coupling between the FM electrons and cavity modes leads to an anticrossing for mode frequencies comparable to the spin splitting. However, this is only the case for one of the circularly polarized modes, while the other is unaffected by the FM, allowing for the determination of the spin-splitting of the FM using polarization-dependent transmission experiments. Moreover, we show that for two spin-split bands, also the lifetimes of the cavity modes display a polarization-dependent response. The change in photon lifetimes can be understood as a suppression due to level attraction with a continuum of Stoner modes with the same wavevector. The reduced lifetime of modes of only one polarization could potentially be used to engineer and control circularly polarized cavities.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Strongly-Interacting Regime of Effective Multi-Body Interactions in a Trapped Ultracold Atom System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16254v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A two-body interaction or force between quantum particles is ubiquitous in nature, and the microscopic description in terms of the bare two-body interaction is the basis for quantitatively describing interacting few- and many-body systems. Alternatively, the effective description in terms of an effective two-body interaction successfully captures the essence of the systems. However, for several important observations, the explanation in terms of an effective two-body interaction is not satisfactory, and the effective three-body interaction has played an essential role in understanding the systems. In this study, we investigate a few-body system comprising of ultracold bosons tightly confined in a deep optical lattice site, which is effectively described as zero-dimensional bosons. By combining an occupancy-resolving high-resolution laser spectroscopy with an inter-orbital Feshbach resonance controlling the bare two-body interaction over a wide range, we experimentally reveal the behaviors of few-atom systems in a strongly-interacting regime. Our results, for which perturbative calculations do not provide proper explanations, serve as a valuable and precise benchmark for theoretical approaches to strongly interacting few-body systems. As one important illustration, we obtain a clear signature of an effective four-body interaction, evidenced by the binding energies of four and more atoms. This work is an important first step for our deeper understanding of an important relation to a strongly-interacting mesoscopic Bose polaron problem.</description>

      <title>Probing de Sitter Space Using CFT States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14237v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we construct CFT states describing a putative holographic dual to local excitations in the three-dimensional de Sitter space (dS), called the bulk local states. We find that the conjugation operation in dS$_3/$CFT$_2$ is notably different from that in AdS$_3/$CFT$_2$. This requires us to combine two bulk local states constructed out of different primary states in a CPT-invariant way. This analysis explains why Green's functions in the dS Euclidean vacuum cannot simply be obtained from the Wick rotation of those in AdS. We also argue that this characteristic feature explains the emergence of a time coordinate from the dual Euclidean CFT. We show that the information metric for the quantum estimation of bulk coordinate values replicates the de Sitter space metric.</description>

      <title>Surface criticality in the mixed-field Ising model with sign-inverted next-nearest-neighbor interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06070v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rydberg atoms in an optical tweezer array have been used as a quantum simulator of the spin-$1/2$ antiferromagnetic Ising model with longitudinal and transverse fields. We suggest how to implement the next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) interaction whose sign is opposite to that of the nearest neighbor one in the Rydberg atom systems. We show that this can be achieved by weakly coupling one Rydberg state with another Rydberg state. We further study the surface criticality associated with the first-order quantum phase transition between the antiferromagnetic and paramagnetic phases, which emerges due to the sign-inverted NNN interaction. From the microscopic model, we derive a Ginzburg-Landau (GL) equation, which describes static and dynamic properties of the antiferromagnetic order parameter near the transition. Using both analytical GL theory and numerical method based on a mean-field theory, we calculate the order parameter in the proximity of a boundary of the system in order to show that the healing length of the order parameter logarithmically diverges, signaling the surface criticality.</description>

      <title>Crystal-field effects in the formation of Wigner-molecule supercrystals in moir\'e TMD superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02527v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For moir\'e bilayer TMD superlattices, full-configuration-interaction (FCI) calculations are presented that take into account both the intra-moir\'e-quantum-dot (MQD) charge-carrier Coulombic interactions, as well as the crystal-field effect from the surrounding moir\'e pockets (inter-moir\'e-QD interactions). The effective computational embedding strategy introduced here allows for an FCI methodogy that enables the complete interpretation of the counterintuitive experimental observations reported recently in the context of moir\'e TMD superlattices at integer fillings $\nu=2$ and 4. Two novel states of matter are reported: (i) a genuinely quantum-mechanical supercrystal of $sliding$ Wigner molecules (WMs) for unstrained moir\'e TMD materials (when the crystal field is commensurate with the trilobal symmetry of the confining potential in each embedded MQD) and (ii) a supercrystal of $pinned$ Wigner molecules when the crystal field is incommensurate with the trilobal symmetry or straining of the whole material is involved. The case of $\nu=3$ is an exception, in that even the unstrained case is associated with a supercrystal of pinned WMs, which is due to the congruence of intrinsic (that of the WM) and external (that of the confining potential of the MQD) $C_3$ point-group symmetries. Furthermore, it is shown that the unrestricted Hartree-Fock approach fails to describe the supercrystal of sliding WMs in the unstrained case, providing a qualitative agreement only in the case of a supercrystal of pinned WMs</description>

      <title>Eventually entanglement breaking divisible quantum dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16583v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is shown that a large class of quantum dynamical maps on complex matrix algebras governed by time-local Master Equations tend to become entanglement breaking in the course of time. Such situation seems to be generic for quantum evolution and in particular, completely positive dynamical semigroups with a unique faithful stationary state enjoy this property. Inspired by this observation, we propose a new concept of eventually entanglement breaking divisible (eEB-divisible) dynamics. A dynamical map is eEB-divisible if any propagator becomes entanglement breaking in finite time. It turns out that eEB-divisibility is quite general and holds for a large class of quantum evolutions.</description>

      <title>Tripartite measurement uncertainty in Schwarzschild space-time</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07789v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The effect of Hawking radiation on tripartite measurement uncertainty in a Schwarzschild black hole background is analyzed in this study. Two scenarios are examined. In the first, quantum memory particles approach a Schwarzschild black hole and are positioned near the event horizon, while the particle being measured remains in the asymptotically flat region. In the second scenario, the measured particle moves toward the black hole, and the quantum memories stay in the asymptotically flat region. This study considers two initial quantum states, namely GHZ and W states. Our findings reveal that in both cases, measurement uncertainty increases steadily with rising Hawking temperature. When comparing the GHZ and W states, the GHZ state initially exhibits lower measurement uncertainty at low Hawking temperatures than the W state, indicating greater resilience to Hawking radiation. Additionally, when the quantum memories remain in the asymptotically flat region while the measured particle falls toward the black hole, the uncertainties for GHZ and W states do not align at high temperatures. The GHZ state consistently demonstrates lower measurement uncertainty, showcasing its superior robustness against Hawking radiation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08369v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a simplified quantum Petri net (QPN) model and uses this model to generalize classical SISO, SIMO, MISO, MIMO and priority buffers to their quantum counterparts. It provides a primitive storage element, namely a quantum S-R flip-flop design using quantum CNOT and SWAP gates that can be replicated to obtain a quantum register for any given number of qubits. The aforementioned quantum buffers are then obtained using the simplified QPN model and quantum registers. $\!\!$The quantum S-R flip-flop and quantum buffer designs have been tested using OpenQASM and Qiskit on IBM quantum computers and simulators and the results validate the presented quantum S-R flip-flop and buffer designs.</description>

      <title>Two-component repulsive atomic Fermi gases in a thin spherical shell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15108v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present possible ground-state structures of two-component atomic Fermi gases with repulsive interactions in a thin spherical shell geometry by implementing a self-consistent Hartree-Fock approximation. The system exhibits a miscible-immiscible transition from a homogeneous mixture to two-chunk phase separation as the interaction strength crosses a critical value. While the critical value is relatively insensitive to population imbalance for equal-mass mixtures, it decreases with the mass ratio when mass-imbalance is present. The interaction may be tuned by the two-body scattering length or the radius of the sphere, thereby allowing the system to cross the transition by varying different parameters. When the atoms on the sphere are rotating, three-chunk sandwich structures emerge in mass-imbalanced mixtures as a consequence of maximal angular momentum along the rotation axis. Some indications of geometric effects and possible experimental implications are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Exact WKB in all sectors I: Potentials with degenerate saddles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09511v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the exact-WKB (EWKB) method through the analysis of Airy and Weber types, with an emphasis on the exact quantization of locally harmonic potentials in multiple sectors. The core innovation of our work lies in introducing a novel complexification approach to the energy parameter $u$, distinct from the common complexification of the (semi-classical) expansion parameter used in Borel summability. This new technique allows for continuous analytical continuation across different sectors of a potential while maintaining the exact quantization condition, even before median summation. By redefining the $A$-cycle above the potential barrier top, we ensure the quantization condition remains real and, by use of the Stokes automorphism and the median resummation, show that the resurgence structure is preserved across transitions between sectors. Furthermore, we discuss the Weber-type exact-WKB method, offering exact estimates for quantum actions around all types of saddle points, generalizing previous results. Through the analysis of these quantum actions, we reveal the presence of $S$-duality, facilitating the exchange between perturbative and non-perturbative behaviors, and we conjecture the mapping of the P-NP relations between dual theories. Our study encompasses periodic and symmetric double-well potentials, demonstrating that the exact-WKB method captures intricate structures in quantum systems in all sectors, including multi-instanton contributions and the resurgence of quantum actions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21850v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: If a neutrino or antineutrino produced in the decay of an unstable particle is not entangled to its accompanying particles, its mass is necessarily correlated with its momentum. In this note, I illustrate this entanglement would destroy the quantum coherence between the neutrino's mass eigenstates in both the momentum and position representations, which was overlooked by other authors in previous investigations of entanglement and coherence associated with neutrino oscillations.</description>

      <title>Trapped-ion laser cooling in structured light fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08844v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Laser cooling is fundamental to quantum computation and metrology with trapped ions, and can occupy a majority of runtime in current systems. A key limitation to cooling arises from unwanted carrier excitation, which in typically used running wave (RW) fields invariably accompanies the sideband transitions effecting cooling. We consider laser cooling in structured light profiles enabling selective sideband excitation with nulled carrier drive; motivated by integrated photonic approaches' passive phase and amplitude stability, we propose simple configurations realizable with waveguide addressing using either standing wave (SW) or first-order Hermite-Gauss (HG) modes. We quantify performance of Doppler cooling from beyond the Lamb-Dicke regime (LDR), and ground-state (GS) cooling using electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) leveraging these field profiles. Carrier-free EIT offers significant benefits simultaneously in cooling rate, motional frequency bandwidth, and final phonon number. Carrier-free Doppler cooling's advantage is significantly compromised beyond the LDR but continues to hold, indicating such configurations are applicable for highly excited ions. Our simulations focus on level structure relevant to $^{40}$Ca$^+$, though the carrier-free configurations can be generally applied to other species. We also quantify performance limitations due to polarization and modal impurities relevant to experimental implementation. Our results indicate potential for simple structured light profiles to alleviate bottlenecks in laser cooling, and for scalable photonic devices to improve basic operation quality in trapped-ion systems.</description>
