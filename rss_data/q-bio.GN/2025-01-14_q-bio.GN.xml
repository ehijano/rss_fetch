      <title>A Pan-cancer Classification Model using Multi-view Feature Selection Method and Ensemble Classifier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06805</link>

Abstract: Accurately identifying cancer samples is crucial for precise diagnosis and effective patient treatment. Traditional methods falter with high-dimensional and high feature-to-sample count ratios, which are critical for classifying cancer samples. This study aims to develop a novel feature selection framework specifically for transcriptome data and propose two ensemble classifiers. For feature selection, we partition the transcriptome dataset vertically based on feature types. Then apply the Boruta feature selection process on each of the partitions, combine the results, and apply Boruta again on the combined result. We repeat the process with different parameters of Boruta and prepare the final feature set. Finally, we constructed two ensemble ML models based on LR, SVM and XGBoost classifiers with max voting and averaging probability approach. We used 10-fold cross-validation to ensure robust and reliable classification performance. With 97.11\% accuracy and 0.9996 AUC value, our approach performs better compared to existing state-of-the-art methods to classify 33 types of cancers. A set of 12 types of cancer is traditionally challenging to differentiate between each other due to their similarity in tissue of origin. Our method accurately identifies over 90\% of samples from these 12 types of cancers, which outperforms all known methods presented in existing literature. The gene set enrichment analysis reveals that our framework's selected features have enriched the pathways highly related to cancers. This study develops a feature selection framework to select features highly related to cancer development and leads to identifying different types of cancer samples with higher accuracy.</description>

      <title>A Misclassification Network-Based Method for Comparative Genomic Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07051</link>

Abstract: Classifying genome sequences based on metadata has been an active area of research in comparative genomics for decades with many important applications across the life sciences. Established methods for classifying genomes can be broadly grouped into sequence alignment-based and alignment-free models. Conventional alignment-based models rely on genome similarity measures calculated based on local sequence alignments or consistent ordering among sequences. However, such methods are computationally expensive when dealing with large ensembles of even moderately sized genomes. In contrast, alignment-free (AF) approaches measure genome similarity based on summary statistics in an unsupervised setting and are efficient enough to analyze large datasets. However, both alignment-based and AF methods typically assume fixed scoring rubrics that lack the flexibility to assign varying importance to different parts of the sequences based on prior knowledge. In this study, we integrate AI and network science approaches to develop a comparative genomic analysis framework that addresses these limitations. Our approach, termed the Genome Misclassification Network Analysis (GMNA), simultaneously leverages misclassified instances, a learned scoring rubric, and label information to classify genomes based on associated metadata and better understand potential drivers of misclassification. We evaluate the utility of the GMNA using Naive Bayes and convolutional neural network models, supplemented by additional experiments with transformer-based models, to construct SARS-CoV-2 sampling location classifiers using over 500,000 viral genome sequences and study the resulting network of misclassifications. We demonstrate the global health potential of the GMNA by leveraging the SARS-CoV-2 genome misclassification networks to investigate the role human mobility played in structuring geographic clustering of SARS-CoV-2.</description>

      <title>Origin of $\alpha$-satellite repeat arrays from mitochondrial molecular fossils -- sequential insertion, expansion, and evolution in the nuclear genome</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02284</link>

Abstract: Alpha satellite DNA is large tandem arrays of 150-400 bp units, and its origin remains an evolutionary mystery. In this research, we identified 1,545 alpha-satellite-like (SatL) repeat units in the nuclear genome of jewel wasp Nasonia vitripennis. Among them, thirty-nine copies of SatL were organized in two palindromic arrays in mitochondria, resulting in a 50% increase in the genome size. Strikingly, genomic neighborhood analyses of 1,516 nuclear SatL repeats revealed that they are located in NuMT (nuclear mitochondrial DNA) regions, and SatL phylogeny matched perfectly with mitochondrial genes and NuMT pseudogenes. These results support that SatL arrays originated from ten independent mitochondria insertion events into the nuclear genome within the last 500,000 years, after divergence from its sister species N. giraulti. Dramatic repeat GC-percent elevation (from 33.9% to 50.4%) is a hallmark of rapid SatL sequence evolution in mitochondria due to GC-biased gene conversion facilitated by the palindromic sequence pairing of the two mitochondrial SatL arrays. The nuclear SatL repeat arrays underwent substantial copy number expansion, from 12-15 (SatL1) to over 400 copies (SatL4). The oldest SatL4B array consists of four types of repeat units derived from deletions in the AT-rich region of ancestral repeats, and complex high-order structures have evolved through duplications. We also discovered similar repeat insertions into the nuclear genome of Muscidifurax, suggesting this mechanism can be common in insects. This is the first report of the mitochondrial origin of nuclear satellite sequences, and our findings shed new light on the origin and evolution of satellite DNA.</description>
