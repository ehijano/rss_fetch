      <title>Towards efficient Effective One Body models for generic, non-planar orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complete waveform models able to account for arbitrary non-planar orbits represent a holy grail in current gravitational-wave astronomy. Here, we take a step towards this direction and present a simple yet efficient prescription to obtain the evolution of the spin vectors and of the orbital angular momentum along non-circularized orbits, that can be applied to any eccentric aligned-spins waveform model. The scheme employed is motivated by insights gained from the post-Newtonian (PN) regime. We investigate the phenomenology of the Euler angles characterizing the time-dependent rotation that connects the co-precessing frame to the inertial one, gauging the importance of non-circular terms in the evolution of the spins of a precessing binary. We demonstrate that such terms are largely negligible, irrespectively of the details of the orbit. Such insights are confirmed by studying the radiation-frame of a few eccentric, precessing numerical relativity (NR) simulations. Our investigations confirm that the usual "twisting" technique employed for quasi-spherical systems can be safely applied to non-circularized binaries. By then augmenting a state-of-the-art Effective-One-Body (EOB) model for non-circular planar orbits with the prescription discussed, we obtain an inspiral-merger-ringdown (IMR) model for eccentric, precessing binary black holes (BBHs). We validate the model in the quasi-spherical limit via mismatches and present one phasing comparison against a precessing, eccentric simulation from the RIT catalog.</description>

      <title>Accretion disks properties around regular black hole solutions obtained from non-linear electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a family of spherically symmetric, static, charged regular black hole solutions derived within the framework of Einstein-nonlinear electrodynamics. Our study focuses on examining the characteristics of accretion disks in the spacetimes described by the Dymnikova and Fan-Wang solutions. We explore circular geodesics of test particles and calculate various properties, including the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit, radiant energy, temperature, and conversion efficiency of accretion mass into radiation. We employ the Novikov-Thorne-Page thin accretion disk model as a background. By comparing our findings with those obtained in the Schwarzschild black hole case, we reveal significant modifications in the overall spectral properties. Specifically, we observe an increase in the energy emitted from the disk surface, resulting in higher temperatures for the accretion disks under certain values of the free parameters. Consequently, we note an enhanced efficiency of mass conversion into radiation compared to the Schwarzschild spacetime.</description>

      <title>A possible origin of the $\alpha$-vacuum as the initial state of the Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the cosmological observables using the Euclidean path integral approach. Specifically, we study both the no-boundary compact instantons scenario and the Euclidean wormholes scenario that can induce the creation of two universes from nothing. It is known that perturbations associated with the no-boundary scenario can only be consistent with the Bunch-Davies vacuum. Here we demonstrate that the Euclidean wormholes can allow for a de Sitter invariant vacuum, the so-called $\alpha$-vacuum state, where the Bunch-Davies vacuum is a special case. This therefore provides the $\alpha$-vacuum a geometrical origin. As an aside, we discuss a subtle phase issue when considering the power spectrum related to $\alpha$-vacuum in the closed universe framework.</description>

      <title>3+1 non-linear evolution of Ricci-coupled scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scalar-Gauss-Bonnet (sGB) gravity with an additional coupling between the scalar field and the Ricci scalar exhibits very interesting properties related to black hole stability, evasion of binary pulsar constraints, and general relativity as a late-time cosmology attractor. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that a spherically symmetric collapse is well-posed for a wide range of parameters. In the present paper we examine further the well-posedness through $3+1$ evolution of static and rotating black holes. We show that the evolution is indeed hyperbolic if the weak coupling condition is not severely violated. The loss of hyperbolicity is caused by the gravitational sector of the physical modes, thus it is not an artifact of the gauge choice. We further seek to compare the Ricci-coupled sGB theory against the standard sGB gravity with additional terms in the Gauss-Bonnet coupling. We find strong similarities in terms of well-posedness, but we also point out important differences in the stationary solutions. As a byproduct, we show strong indications that stationary near-extremal scalarized black holes exist within the Ricci-coupled sGB theory, where the scalar field is sourced by the spacetime curvature rather than the black hole spin.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the reheating phase after Higgs inflation in the hybrid metric-Palatini approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the post-inflationary era called reheating stage. For this purpose, we consider a model in which the inflaton is non-minimally coupled to the curvature within the hybrid metric-Palatini approach. Furthermore, to investigate the consistency of our results with the observational data, we relate reheating parameters to those of inflation model. By taking into consideration the Higgs potential $V(\phi)=\lambda/4 \phi^4$; we derive the necessary quantities needed to obtain the reheating duration and the reheating temperature. Moreover, we plot reheating e-folds and temperature as a function of the spectral index, respectively. We consider three cases depending on the coupling constant $\xi$. In addition, we use some specific values of the effective equation of state $\omega$, which is presumed to remain relatively constant within the range of $-\frac{1}{3} \leq \omega &lt; \frac{1}{3}$. We find that for $\xi=10^{-4.1}$ our results are in agreement with the recent Planck data as the reheating instant is corresponding to the central value of the spectral index and to a maximum temperature required by the scale of baryogenesis models.</description>

      <title>Constraining dark energy equations of state in $F(R,T)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine the acceleration of the Universe's expansion in $F(R,T)$ gravity, where $R$ denotes the Ricci scalar and $T$ the trace of energy-momentum tensor. Indeed, the unknown nature of the source controlling this acceleration in general relativity leads scientists to investigate its properties by means of some alternative theories to general relativity. Our study is restricted to the particular case where $F(R,T)=R+2\kappa^2 \lambda T$ , with $\lambda$ being a constant. We use a Bayesian analysis of current observational datasets, including the type Ia supernovae constitution compilation and $H(z)$ measurements, to constrain free parameters of the model. To parametrize dark energy, we consider two well known equations of state. We find the best fit values for each model by running a Markov chain Monte Carlo technic. The best fit parameters are used to compare both models to $\Lambda$CDM by means of the Akaike information criterion and the Bayesian information criterion. We show that the Universe underwent recently a transition from a deceleration to an acceleration for both models. Furthermore, the data shows a phantom nature of the equation of state for both models.</description>

      <title>Orbits around a black bounce spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, the trajectories of particles around a black bounce spacetime are considered, with the Simpson-Visser model serving as an example. Trajectories for massless and massive particles are obtained through the study of null and time-like geodesics. As the Simpson-Visser solution is derived via the Einstein equations for a source involving nonlinear electrodynamics and a scalar field, photon trajectories are investigated by considering an effective metric in which photons follow null geodesics. The stability of circular orbits is analyzed by examining the behavior of maxima and minima of the effective potential associated with geodesics. It is also studied what type of geodesic photons follow when the usual metric is considered instead of the effective one. The main focus of this work is to obtain corrections to the trajectories of photons when considering that the solution arises from nonlinear electrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Observational signature of Lorentz violation in Kalb-Ramond field model and Bumblebee model: A comprehensive comparative study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article is devoted to the comparative study of the effects of the Lorentz symmetry violation (LV) arising in Kalb-Ramond (KR) and Bumblebee (BM) field models. We study optical appearance with accretion, Quasinormal modes, ringdown waveforms, Hawking radiation, and weak gravitational lensing. The horizon radius, photon radius, and the critical impact parameter for KR BHs decrease with the LV parameter $\a$. In contrast, they remain independent of the BM parameter $\b$ and have values the same as those for \s BH. We find that a KR BH is brighter than a \s or BM BH for static and infalling accretion. The BM BH, on the other hand, is brighter than a \s BH when the accretion is static but becomes darker for an infalling accretion. Our investigation into quasinormal modes (QNMs) and ringdown waveforms provides deeper insight into the difference in observational imprints of LV parameters. It reveals that GWs emitted by KR BHs have larger frequencies and decay faster than those emitted by \s or BM BHs for scalar and electromagnetic perturbations. We then study the greybody factor (GF) and power emitted for both BHs. The Hawking temperature is higher for a KR BM and lower for a BM BH than a \s BH. It also reveals that the transmission probability decreases with $\a$ and $\b$. A comparison of GFs for KR and BM BHs reveals that the transmission probability is higher for BM BH. We also study the effect of LV on the power emitted in the form of Hawking radiation. Power received by an asymptotic observer is larger for a KR BH. We obtain higher-order corrections in the deflection angle and graphically illustrate the impact of $\a$ and $\b$. We observe that a light ray gets deflected most from its path when passing by a \s BH, and the deflection is least when it passes by a KR BH. Our study conclusively shows that we can differentiate between KR and BM BHs based on astrophysical observations.</description>

      <title>Simulations of gravitational collapse in null coordinates: II. Critical collapse of an axisymmetric scalar field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first numerical simulations in null coordinates of the collapse of nonspherical regular initial data to a black hole. We restrict to twist-free axisymmetry, and re-investigate the critical collapse of a non-spherical massless scalar field. We find that the Choptuik solution governing scalar field critical collapse in spherical symmetry persists when fine-tuning moderately non-spherical initial data to the threshold of black hole formation. The non-sphericity evolves as an almost-linear perturbation until the end of the self-similar phase, and becomes dominant only in the final collapse to a black hole. We compare with numerical results of Choptuik et al, Baumgarte, and Marouda et al, and conclude that they have been able to evolve somewhat more non-spherical solutions. Future work with larger deviations from spherical symmetry, and in particular vacuum collapse, will require a different choice of radial coordinate that allows the null generators to reconverge locally.</description>

      <title>Effects of gravitational waves on electromagnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We focus on the interaction of a plane gravitational wave with electromagnetic fields and we describe this interaction in the proper detector frame where, thanks to the introduction of Fermi coordinates, it is possible to refer to directly measurable quantities. The presence of a gravitational field can be addressed in terms of an effective electromagnetic medium and, within this framework, we show that the coupling of pre-existing electromagnetic fields with the gravitational field of the wave gives rise to new effective currents. To assess the impact of these effects, we solve Maxwell's equations for some standard configurations of the electric and magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Faraday and spin-Hall effects of light: Local description</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A gravitational field can cause a rotation of the polarisation plane of light. This phenomenon is known as the gravitational Faraday effect. It arises due to different spin-orbit interaction of left- and right-handed circularly polarised components of light. Such an interaction also causes transverse displacement in the light trajectory, in opposite directions for each component. This phenomenon is known as the gravitational spin-Hall effect of light. We study these effects in a local inertial frame in arbitrary vacuum space-time and show that they are observer dependent and arise due to interaction of light polarisation with a local gravitomagnetic field measured by observer. Thus, to address the effects to a gravitational field alone, one has to consider zero angular momentum observers.</description>

      <title>Warp Drives and Martel-Poisson charts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the construction of the Alcubierre-Natario class of warp drives to an infinite class of spacetimes with similar properties. This is achieved by utilising the Martel-Poisson charts which closely resemble the Weak Painleve-Gullstrand form for various background metrics (Mink, AdS, dS). The highlight of this construction is the non-flat intrinsic metric which in three-dimensional spacetimes introduces conical singularities at the origin and in higher dimensions generates a non-zero Ricci scalar for the spatial hypersurfaces away from the origin. We analyse the expansion/contraction of space and negative energy densities associated with this class of warp drives and find interesting deviations due to the global imprints of the conical defects. Several generalizations are also discussed.</description>

      <title>SPHINCS_BSSN: Numerical Relativity with Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this book chapter we describe the {\em Lagrangian} numerical relativity code \sphi. This code evolves spacetimes in full General Relativity by integrating the BSSN equations on structured meshes with a simple dynamical mesh refinement strategy. The fluid is evolved by means of freely moving Lagrangian particles, that are evolved using a modern Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) formulation. To robustly and accurately capture shocks, our code uses artificial dissipation terms, but, similar to Finite Volume schemes, we apply a slope-limited reconstruction within the dissipative terms and we use in addition time-dependent dissipation parameters, so that dissipation is only applied where needed. The technically most complicated, but absolutely crucial part of the methodology, is the coupling between the particles and the mesh. For the mapping of the energy-momentum tensor $T_{\mu\nu}$ from the particles to the mesh, we use a sophisticated combination of "Local Regression Estimate" (LRE) method and a "multi-dimensional optimal order detection" (MOOD) approach which we describe in some detail. The mapping of the metric quantities from the grid to the particles is achieved by a quintic Hermite interpolation. Apart from giving an introduction to our numerical methods, we demonstrate the accurate working of our code by presenting a set of representative relativistic hydrodynamics tests. We begin with a relativistic shock tube test, then compare the frequencies of a fully relativistic neutron star with reference values from the literature and, finally, we present full-blown merger simulations of irrotational binary systems, one case where a central remnant survives and another where a black hole forms, and of a binary where only one of the stars is rapidly spinning.</description>

      <title>Kinetic Model for Dark Energy -- Dark Matter Interaction: Scenario for the Hubble Tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze a model for Dark Energy - Dark Matter interaction, based on a decaying process of the former constituents into the latter ones. The dynamical equations are constructed following a kinetic formulation, which separates the interacting fluctuations from equilibrium distribution of the both the species. The emerging dynamical picture consists of coupled equations, which are specialized in the case of a Dark Energy equation of state parameter: we deal with a modified Lambda Cold Dark Matter model, which is investigated versus a possible interpretation of the Hubble tension. We compare our model with data corresponding to 6 points of the expansion rate from Type Ia Supernovae. We show that, the proposed model suitably fits data according to a value of the Hubble constant compatible with the SHOES Collaboration measurement. The tension is solved because, essentially for redshift greater than one, the correction to the Lambda Cold Dark Matter model vanishes and its presence does not affect the Planck measurements.</description>

      <title>Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes surrounded by perfect fluid dark matter: testing the viability of weak gravity conjecture and weak cosmic censorship conjecture simultaneously</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A possible violation of the weak gravity conjecture (WGC) by cosmic censorship is one of the major challenges in the field of general relativity. However, in this paper, we explore the possibility of reconciling the WGC and the WCCC by considering Reissner-Nordstr\"om (R-N) black holes embedded in perfect fluid dark matter (PFDM) in asymptotically flat spacetimes. These two conjectures are seemingly unrelated, but a recent proposal suggested that they are connected surprisingly. In particular, We argue a promising class of valid counterexamples to the WCCC in the four-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell theory, considering a charged black hole when WGC is present. We demonstrate that by imposing certain constraints on the parameters of the metric, the WGC and the WCCC can be compatible. Furthermore, we investigate the properties of the charged black hole in the presence of PFDM for $Q &gt; M$ and present some intriguing figures to test the validity of the WGC and the WCCC simultaneously. When PFDM is absent ($\gamma=0$), the RN black hole either has two event horizons if $Q^2/M^2\leq 1$ or none if $Q^2/M^2&gt; 1$. The second scenario results in a naked singularity, which contradicts the WCCC. But when PFDM is present ($\gamma\neq 0$), the RN black hole has event horizons with regard to Q and M. This implies that the singularity is always covered, and the WGC and the WCCC are fulfilled. Furthermore, we demonstrate that there is a critical value of $\gamma$, called $\gamma_{ext}$, that makes the RN black hole extremal when $\gamma=\gamma_{ext}$. In this situation, the black hole has an event horizon, and the WGC and the WCCC are still fulfilled. We infer that PFDM can make the WGC and the WCCC compatible with the RN black hole and that the WGC and the WCCC agree with each other when PFDM is present.</description>

Abstract: Area metrics and area metric backgrounds provide a unified framework for quantum gravity. They encode physical degrees of freedom beyond those of a metric. These non-metric degrees of freedom must be suppressed by a potential at sufficiently high energy scales to ensure that in the infrared regime classical gravity is recovered. On this basis, we first study necessary and sufficient algebraic conditions for an area metric to be induced by a metric. Second, we consider candidate potentials for the area metric and point out a possible connection between the reduction of area metric geometry to metric geometry on the one hand, and the smallness of the cosmological constant on the other. Finally, we consider modifications of the Nambu-Goto action for a string, from a metric background to an area metric background. We demonstrate that area metric perturbations introduce an interaction corresponding to a singular vertex operator in the classically equivalent Polyakov action. The implications of these types of vertex operators for the quantum theory remain to be understood.</description>

      <title>Inertial Torsion Noise in Matter-Wave Interferometers for Gravity Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Matter-wave interferometry is susceptible to non-inertial noise sources, which can induce dephasing and a resulting loss of interferometric visibility. Here, we focus on inertial torsion noise (ITN), which arises from the rotational motion of the experimental apparatus suspended by a thin wire and subject to random external torques. We provide analytical expressions for the ITN noise starting from Langevin equations describing the experimental box in a thermal environment which can then be used together with the transfer function to obtain the dephasing factor. We verify the theoretical modelling and the validity of the approximations using Monte Carlo simulations obtaining good agreement between theory and numerics. As an application we estimate the size of the effects for the next-generation of interferometery experiments with femtogram particles, which could be used as the building block for entanglement-based tests of the quantum nature of gravity. We find that the ambient gas is a weak source of ITN, posing mild restrictions on the ambient pressure and temperature, and conclude with a discussion about the general ITN constrains by assuming a Langevin equation parameterized by three phenomenological parameters.</description>

      <title>Cross-Temporal Spectrogram Autoencoder (CTSAE): Unsupervised Dimensionality Reduction for Clustering Gravitational Wave Glitches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advancement of The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) has significantly enhanced the feasibility and reliability of gravitational wave detection. However, LIGO's high sensitivity makes it susceptible to transient noises known as glitches, which necessitate effective differentiation from real gravitational wave signals. Traditional approaches predominantly employ fully supervised or semi-supervised algorithms for the task of glitch classification and clustering. In the future task of identifying and classifying glitches across main and auxiliary channels, it is impractical to build a dataset with manually labeled ground-truth. In addition, the patterns of glitches can vary with time, generating new glitches without manual labels. In response to this challenge, we introduce the Cross-Temporal Spectrogram Autoencoder (CTSAE), a pioneering unsupervised method for the dimensionality reduction and clustering of gravitational wave glitches. CTSAE integrates a novel four-branch autoencoder with a hybrid of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Vision Transformers (ViT). To further extract features across multi-branches, we introduce a novel multi-branch fusion method using the CLS (Class) token. Our model, trained and evaluated on the GravitySpy O3 dataset on the main channel, demonstrates superior performance in clustering tasks when compared to state-of-the-art semi-supervised learning methods. To the best of our knowledge, CTSAE represents the first unsupervised approach tailored specifically for clustering LIGO data, marking a significant step forward in the field of gravitational wave research.

      <title>Casimir energy on the sphere and 6D CFT trace anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We elucidate the dependence of the Casimir energy on the trace anomaly coefficients for a six-dimensional CFT on $R\times S^5$. This extends the universal dependence on the central charge in 2D and the relation by Cappelli and Coste in 4D, unveiling the role of the trivial total derivatives in the anomaly that renders the Casimir energy scheme dependent. We obtain
  $$E_o=-\frac{15}{8}\,a_6 -\frac{5}{12}\,\left(g_5+\frac{1}{4}\,g_7+\frac{1}{2}\,g_8-10\, g_9+g_{10}\right),$$
with $a_6$ being the type A central charge and the $g$'s, the coefficients of five out of six terms that form a basis for trivial total derivatives. The derivation is based on the Polyakov formulas (conformal primitive) resulting from the integration of the trace anomaly.
  Alternatively, on a 6D conformally flat background the above basis is redundant and one can simplify further to get, in terms of the Schouten scalar $J$ and the Schouten tensor $V$, Branson's basis for trivial total derivatives $\nabla^2\nabla^2 J$, $\nabla^2J^2$ and $\nabla^2|V|^2+2\nabla\cdot(V\cdot\nabla\,J)$ with coefficients $\gamma_1, \gamma_2$ and $\gamma_3$, respectively, \begin{equation} \nonumber
  E_o=-\frac{15}{8}a_6-\frac{1}{24}\left(\gamma_1-\gamma_2 -\frac{1}{8}\gamma_3\right)~. \end{equation}</description>

Abstract: We study self-gravitating solutions of 3-dimensional massive gravity coupled to Yang-Mills-Chern-Simons gauge theory. Among these, there is a family of asymptotically Warped-Anti de Sitter black holes that come to generalize previous solutions found in the literature and studied in the context of WAdS$_3$/CFT$_2$. We also present self-gravitating solutions to the 3-dimensional Einstein-Yang-Mills theory, as well as other self-gravitating solutions in the presence of higher-curvature terms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine local physics in the presence of global variables: variables associated with the whole of the spacelike surfaces of a foliation. These could be the (pseudo-)constants of nature and their conjugate times, but our statements are more general. Interactions between the local and the global (for example, dependence of the local action on global times dual to constants) degrades full space-time diffeomorphism invariance down to spatial diffeomorphism invariance, and so an extra degree of freedom appears. When these presumably primordial global interactions switch off, the local action recovers full invariance and so the usual two gravitons, but a legacy matter component is left over, bearing the extra degree of freedom. Under the assumption that the preferred foliation is geodesic, this component behaves like dark matter, except that 3 of its 4 local degrees of freedom are frozen, forcing its rest frame to coincide with the preferred foliation. The non-frozen degree of freedom (the number density of the effective fluid) is the survivor of the extra "graviton" present in the initial theory, and keeps memory of all the past global interactions that took place in a given location in the preferred foliation. Such "painted-on" dark matter is best distinguished from the conventional one in situations where the preferred frame would be preposterous if all 4 degrees of freedom of dark matter were available. We provide one example: an outflowing halo of legacy matter with exact escape speed at each point and a very specific profile, surrounding a condensed structure made of normal matter.</description>

      <title>Abnormal threshold behaviors of photo-pion production off the proton in the GZK region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The confirmation of the existence of GZK cut-off was tortuous, leading to activities to explore new physics, such as the cosmic-ray new components, unidentified cosmic-ray origins, unknown propagation mechanism, and the modification of fundamental physics concepts like the tiny Lorentz invariance violation (LV). The confirmation of the GZK cut-off provides an opportunity to constrain the LV effect. We use a phenomenological framework to restudy the GZK mechanism under the Planck scale deformation of the proton and pion dispersion relations. Restudying the photon induced pion production of the proton $\mathrm{p}+\gamma\to\mathrm{p}+\pi^0$, we predict abnormal threshold behaviors of this reaction under different LV modifications. Therefore, we can study the LV effects not only from the conventional GZK cut-off, but also from potentially threshold anomalies of the pion production process. We divide the LV parameter space into three regions, and analyze the constraints from current observations in each region. The current observations have set strict constraints on a certain LV region. However, for others LV regions, further experimental observations and theoretical researches are still needed, and we also find survival space for some theoretical explorations that permit specific LV effects.</description>

      <title>Weak Cosmic Censorship and Weak Gravity Conjectures in CFT Thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the intriguing interplay between fundamental theoretical physics concepts within the context of charged black holes. Specifically, we focus on the consistency of the weak gravity conjecture (WGC) and weak cosmic censorship conjecture (WCCC) in the thermodynamics of conformal field theory (CFT), and restricted phase space (RPS) for AdS Reissner-Nordstr$\"o$m black holes with a perfect fluid dark matter (RN-PFDM). The WGC ensures that gravity remains the weakest force in the system. Meanwhile, the WCCC addresses the cosmic censorship problem by preventing the violation of fundamental physical laws near the black hole singularity. First, we analyze the RN black hole's free energy in both spaces, revealing a distinctive swallowtail pattern indicative of a first-order phase transition when certain free parameter conditions are met. We explore the WGC across different phase spaces, emphasizing the need for certain conditions in EPST, RPST, and CFT. We demonstrate that PFDM $( \gamma )$ and the radius of AdS ($l$) have a vital role in proving the satisfaction of the WGC. Also, these values have a linear relation with the range compatibility of WGC. The range of compatibility for WGC in RPST and EPST is the same while for CFT, this range is larger than EPST, and RPST. It means somehow the WGC and CFT are more consistent. The WCCC was examined at the critical juncture, confirming its validity with $( f(M_c, Q_c, r_c) = 0 )$. We conclude that the WGC is supported at the critical point of black holes, and the WCCC is also maintained, demonstrating the robustness of these conjectures within the critical ranges of black hole parameters.</description>

      <title>Frozen stars: Black hole mimickers sourced by a string fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The frozen star is a non-singular, ultracompact object that, to an external observer, looks exactly like a Schwarzschild black hole, but with a different interior geometry and matter composition. The frozen star needs to be sourced by an extremely anisotropic fluid, for which the sum of the radial pressure and energy density is either vanishing or perturbatively small. Here, we show that this matter can be identified with the string fluid resulting from the decay of an unstable $D$-brane or a brane-antibrane system at the end of open-string tachyon condensation. The string fluid corresponds to flux tubes emanating from the center and ending at the Schwarzschild radius of the star. The effective Lagrangian for this fluid can be recast into a Born-Infeld form. When the fluid Lagrangian is coupled to that of Einstein's Gravity, the static, spherically symmetric solutions of the equations of motion are shown to be the same as those describing the frozen star model. Frozen stars can therefore be viewed as gravitationally back-reacted BIons. The Born-Infeld Lagrangian provides a complete set of equations that describe the dynamics of the frozen star in a generic state, which is not necessarily static nor spherically symmetric. Additionally, this description provides a new physical perspective on the structure of the frozen star in terms of the corresponding electric fields and charges. The electric field is sourced by a point-like charge at the center of the star, while its outer layer is equal and oppositely charged. The electric force between the charges is offset because the mass of the star is fixed.</description>

Abstract: In this work we study the inversion temperature associated with the Joule-Thomson expansion from the thermodynamics of AdS-Reissner-N\"ordstrom black holes. We include quantum corrections in a cosmological fluid that can describe phantom dark matter or quintessence, both in a Kiselev scenario. The description of such physical systems involves numerical solutions and the results are presented as temperature-pressure plots for various values of the parameters of our model. We find non-zero minimum inversion temperatures as well as non-zero minimum pressures depending on the values of those parameters. Completing our study, we also find isenthalpic curves associated with black hole fixed mass processes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.06469v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the propagating degrees of freedom of $f(Q)$-gravity in a $4$-dimensional space-time under the imposition of the coincident gauge by performing the Dirac-Bergmann analysis. In this work, we start with a top-down reconstruction of the metric-affine gauge theory of gravity based only on the concept of a vector bundle. Then, the so-called geometrical trinity of gravity is introduced and the role of the coincident GR is clarified. After that, we reveal relationships between the boundary terms in the variational principle and the symplectic structure of the theory in order to confirm the validity of the analysis for our studied theories. Then, as examples, we revisit the analysis of GR and its $f(\lc{R})$-extensions. Finally, after reviewing the Dirac-Bergmann analysis of the coincident GR and that of $f(T)$-gravity, we perform the analysis of coincident $f(Q)$-gravity. Under the imposition of appropriate spatial boundary conditions, we find that, as a generic case, the theory has five primary, three secondary, and two tertiary constraint densities and all these constraint densities are classified into second-class constraint density; the number six is the propagating degrees of freedom of the theory and there are no longer any remaining gauge degrees of freedom. We also discuss the condition of providing seven pDoF as a generic case. The violation of diffeomorphism invariance of coincident $f(Q)$-gravity make it possible to emerge such several sectors.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the merger structure of black hole binaries in generic planar orbits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.07228v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The precise modeling of binary black hole coalescences in generic planar orbits is a crucial step to disentangle dynamical and isolated binary formation channels through gravitational-wave observations. The merger regime of such coalescences exhibits a significantly higher complexity compared to the quasicircular case, and cannot be readily described through standard parameterizations in terms of eccentricity and anomaly. In the spirit of the Effective One Body formalism, we build on the study of the test-mass limit, and introduce a new modelling strategy to describe the general-relativistic dynamics of two-body systems in generic orbits. This is achieved through gauge-invariant combinations of the binary energy and angular momentum, such as a dynamical "impact parameter" at merger. These variables reveal simple "quasi-universal" structures of the pivotal merger parameters, allowing to build an accurate analytical representation of generic (bounded and dynamically-bounded) orbital configurations. We demonstrate the validity of these analytical relations using 311 numerical simulations of bounded noncircular binaries with progenitors from the RIT and SXS catalogs, together with a custom dataset of dynamical captures generated using the Einstein Toolkit, and test-mass data in bound orbits. Our modeling strategy lays the foundations of accurate and complete waveform models for systems in arbitrary orbits, bolstering observational explorations of dynamical formation scenarios and the discovery of new classes of gravitational wave sources.</description>

Abstract: This study investigates possibility of placing bounds on the parameters, arising from the non-commutative Snyder space-time model and Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) approach, by utilizing seismic data. We investigate the dependence of constraints on the type of realization used for the quantum phase space. Results indicate improved bounds compared to prior studies, with the model parameter $\beta_0$ constrained to be less than $5.2\times 10^{44}$ for certain choice of realizations. This approach demonstrates the potential for using Earth's empirical data to refine constraints on GUP parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.07439v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the next-to-leading order corrections in the mass multipole expansion, i.e. the mass octupole and current quadrupole, to gravitational wave production by close hyperbolic encounters of compact objects. We find that the signal is again, as in the simple quadrupole case, a burst event with the majority of the released energy occurring during the closest approach. In particular, we investigate the relative contribution to the power, both in the time and frequency domains, and total energy emitted by each order in the mass multipole expansion in gravitational waves. To do so, we include in the quadrupole term its first order post-Newtonian correction, giving this a contribution to the power of the same order as that of the mass octupole and the current quadrupole. We find specific configurations of systems where these corrections could be important and should be taken into account when analysing burst events.</description>

      <title>Black Hole Solutions with Constant Ricci Scalar in a Model of Finsler Gravity</title>

Abstract: Ricci scalar being zero is equivalent to the vacuum field equation in Finsler space-time. The Schwarzschild metric can be concluded from the field equation's solution if the space-time conserves spherical symmetry. This research aims to investigate Finslerian Schwarzschild-de Sitter space-time. Recent studies based on Finslerian space-time geometric models are becoming more prevalent because the local anisotropic structure of space-time influences the gravitational field and gives rise to modified cosmological relations. We suggest a gravitational field equation with a non-zero cosmological constant in Finslerian geometry and apprehend that the presented Finslerian gravitational field equation corresponds to the non-zero Ricci scalar. In Finsler geometry, the peer of spherical symmetry is the Finslerian sphere. Assuming space-time to conserve the "Finslerian sphere" symmetry, the counterpart of the Riemannian sphere (Finslerian sphere) must have a constant flag curvature ($\lambda$). It is demonstrated that the Finslerian covariant derivative of the geometric part of the gravitational field equation is preserved under a condition using the Chern connection. According to the string theory, string clouds can be defined as a pool of strings made due to symmetry breaking in the universe's early stages. We find that for $\lambda\neq1$, this solution resembles a black hole surrounded by a cloud of strings. Furthermore, we investigate null and time-like geodesics for $\lambda=1$. In this regard, the photon geodesics are obtained that are the closest paths to the photon sphere of the first photons visible at the black hole shadow limit. Also, circular orbit conditions are obtained for the effective potential.</description>

      <title>Slow-rolling scalar dynamics and as solution for the Hubble tension</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.04822v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a theoretical framework to interpret the Hubble tension by means of a slow-rolling dynamics of a self-interacting scalar field. In particular, we split the Friedmann equation in order to construct a system for the three unknowns, corresponding to the Hubble parameter $H$, the scalar field $\phi$ and its self-interaction potential $V$, as functions of the redshift. In the resulting picture, the vacuum energy density is provided by a constant term in the potential $V(\phi)$, while the corresponding small kinetic term is responsible for reproducing the apparent variation of the Hubble constant $H_0$ with the redshift. The emerging solution depends on two free parameters, one of which is fixed to account for the discrepancy between the values of $H_0$ as measured by the Super Nova Ia sample ($H_0=73.6\pm1.1$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ (Brout et al., 2022)) and the Planck satellite data ($H_0=67.4\pm0.5$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ (Aghanim et al., 2020)), respectively. The other parameter is instead determined by a fitting procedure of the apparent Hubble constant variation across the data corresponding to a 40 bin analysis of the Super Nova Pantheon sample, in each of which $H_0$ has been independently determined. The fundamental result of the present analysis is the emerging Hubble parameter as function of the redshift, which correctly takes the Super Nova Ia prediction at $z=0$ and naturally approaches the profile predicted by a flat $\Lambda$CDM model corresponding to the cosmological parameters detected by Planck. It is remarkable that this achievement is reached without reducing the Super Nova Ia data to a single point for determining $H(z=0)$, but accounting for the distribution over their redshift interval of observation, via the binned analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08089v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We observe that the energy and the enthalpy densities can be smeared by two fudge factors that are constrained by the contracted Bianchi identities. Depending on the analytic properties of the smearing functions the underlying cosmological solutions belong to two physically different classes, namely the bounces of the scale factor and the curvature bounces. While the curvature bounces are naturally compatible with a stage of accelerated expansion, the bounces of the scale factor demand an early phase of accelerated contraction even if a short inflationary stage may arise prior to the decelerated regime. Despite the regularity of the underlying solutions, gradient instabilities and singularities do occasionally appear in the evolution of curvature inhomogeneities. After deducing the specific criteria behind these occurrences, the background-independent conclusions are corroborated by a series of concrete examples associated with different forms of the smearing functions. The evolution of the curvature inhomogeneities restricts the ranges of the solutions that turn out to be unsuitable even for a limited description of the pre-inflationary initial data. The same observation holds in the case of the gauge-invariant evolution of the matter density contrast. It is however not excluded that a class of scenarios (mainly associated with the curvature bounces) could indeed avoid the potential instabilities. All in all the present analysis explore a general approach whose results are relevant in all the contexts where bouncing solutions are invoked either as complementary or as alternative to the conventional inflationary scenarios.</description>

      <title>Optimized Search for a Binary Black Hole Merger Population in LIGO-Virgo O3 Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10439v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Maximizing the number of detections in matched filter searches for compact binary coalescence (CBC) gravitational wave (GW) signals requires a model of the source population distribution. In previous searches using the PyCBC framework, sensitivity to the population of binary black hole (BBH) mergers was improved by restricting the range of filter template mass ratios and use of a simple one-dimensional population model. However, this approach does not make use of our full knowledge of the population and cannot be extended to a full parameter space search. Here, we introduce a new ranking method, based on kernel density estimation (KDE) with adaptive bandwidth, to accurately model the probability distributions of binary source parameters over a template bank, both for signals and for noise events. We demonstrate this ranking method by conducting a search over LIGO-Virgo O3 data for BBH with unrestricted mass ratio, using a signal model derived from previous significant detected events. We achieve over 10% increase in sensitive volume for a simple power-law simulated signal population, compared to the previous BBH search. Correspondingly, with the new ranking, 8 additional candidate events above an inverse false alarm rate (IFAR) threshold 0.5 yr are identified.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13118v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new set of four-geometries exhibiting asymptotically flat galactic rotation curves. These are found as explicit solutions to 5D vacuum Hilbert-Palatini theory, where the fifth dimen sion has vanishing proper length. In the emergent 4D dynamics, governed by the condition that the Ricci scalar must vanish (upto a cosmological constant), these correspond to anisotropic effective pressure. The enhancement in the deflection angle of a light ray penetrating the halo is obtained, which could provide a realistic testing ground for the model as a purely geometric alternative to `dark matter'. For very large halo radii, the leading nonbaryonic contribution to the bending angle is predicted to be $3\pi v^2/2c^2$ (v being the asymptotic rotational velocity), a constant that is different from the result for an isothermal CDM halo.</description>

      <title>Visualizing the Number of Existing and Future Gravitational-Wave Detections from Merging Double Compact Objects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.17628v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How many gravitational-wave observations from double compact object mergers have we seen to date? This seemingly simple question surprisingly yields a somewhat ambiguous answer that depends on the chosen data-analysis pipeline, detection threshold and other underlying assumptions. To illustrate this we provide visualizations of the number of existing detections from double compact object mergers by the end of the third observing run (O3) based on recent results from the literature. Additionally, we visualize the expected number of observations from future-generation detectors, highlighting the possibility of up to millions of detections per year by the time next-generation ground-based detectors like Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope come online. We present a publicly available code that highlights the exponential growth in gravitational-wave observations in the coming decades and the exciting prospects of gravitational-wave (astro)physics.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic symmetries of gravity in the gauge PDE approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.09637v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a framework to study local gauge theories on manifolds with boundaries and asymptotic symmetries, which is based on representing them as so-called gauge PDEs. These objects extend the conventional BV-AKSZ sigma-models to the case of not necessarily topological and diffeomorphism invariant systems and are known to behave well with respect to restrictions to submanifolds and boundaries. We introduce the notion of gauge PDE with boundaries, which takes into account generic boundary conditions, and apply the framework to asymptotically flat gravity. In so doing we start with a suitable representation of gravity as a gauge PDE with boundaries which implements the Penrose's description of asymptotically simple spacetimes. We then derive the minimal model of the gauge PDE induced on the boundary and observe that it provides the Cartan (frame-like) description of a (curved) conformal Carollian structure on the boundary. Furthermore, imposing a suitable version of the familiar boundary conditions in the induced boundary gauge PDE immediately leads to the conventional BMS algebra of asymptotic symmetries. Finally, we briefly sketch the construction in the case of asymptotically (A)dS gravity.</description>

      <title>About gravitational radiation of semi local strings with non compact internal modes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.05279v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The present work studies the gravitational radiation of a non abelian vortex with a non compact internal moduli describing its excitations. This situation may be realised by semi-local supersymmetric vortices \cite{novedad1}-\cite{reviewshifman}, although supersymmetry is not necessary for this to happen. In the situation considered along this work, the internal space has infinite volume, and a largely energetic perturbation propagates along the object, even though the vortex line may not be moving. A specific configuration is presented, in which the internal space is the resolved conifold with its Ricci flat metric. The curious feature about it is that it corresponds to a static vortex, that is, the perturbation is only due to the internal modes. Even being static, the emission of gravitational radiation is in the present case of considerable order. This suggest that the presence of slowly moving objects that can emit a large amount of gravitational radiation is a hint of non abelianity.</description>

      <title>Inverse Gertsenshtein effect as a probe of high-frequency gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17636v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We apply the inverse Gertsenshtein effect, i.e., the graviton-photon conversion in the presence of a magnetic field, to constrain high-frequency gravitational waves (HFGWs). Using existing astrophysical measurements, we compute upper limits on the GW energy densities $\Omega_{\rm GW}$ at 16 different frequency bands. Given the observed magnetisation of galaxy clusters with field strength $B\sim\mu{\rm G}$ correlated on $\mathcal{O}(10)\,{\rm kpc}$ scales, we estimate HFGW constraints in the $\mathcal{O}(10^2)\,{\rm GHz}$ regime to be $\Omega_{\rm GW}\lesssim10^{16}$ with the temperature measurements of the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT). Similarly, we conservatively obtain $\Omega_{\rm GW}\lesssim10^{13} (10^{11})$ in the $\mathcal{O}(10^2)\,{\rm MHz}$ ($\mathcal{O}(10)\,{\rm GHz}$) regime by assuming uniform magnetic field with strength $B\sim0.1\,{\rm nG}$ and saturating the excess signal over the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) reported by radio telescopes such as the Experiment to Detect the Global EoR Signature (EDGES), LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR), and Murchison Widefield Array (MWA), and the balloon-borne second generation Absolute Radiometer for Cosmology, Astrophysics, and Diffuse Emission (ARCADE2) with graviton-induced photons. The upcoming Square Kilometer Array (SKA) can tighten these constraints by roughly 10 orders of magnitude, which will be a step closer to reaching the critical value of $\Omega_{\rm GW} = 1$ or the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) bound of $\Omega_{\rm GW}\simeq1.2\times10^{-6}$. We point to future improvement of the SKA forecast and estimate that proposed CMB measurement at the level of $\mathcal{O}(10^{0-2})\,{\rm nK}$, such as Primordial Inflation Explorer (PIXIE) and Voyage 2050, are needed to viably detect stochastic backgrounds of HFGWs.</description>

      <title>Double-graviton production from Standard Model plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08766v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The thermal plasma filling the early universe generated a stochastic gravitational wave background that peaks in the microwave frequency range today. If the graviton production rate is expressed as a series in a fine-structure constant, $\alpha$, and the temperature over the Planck mass, $T^2_{ } / m_{\rm pl}^2$, then the lowest-order contributions come from single ($\sim \alpha T^2_{ }/m_{\rm pl}^2$) and double ($\sim T^4_{ }/m_{\rm pl}^4$) graviton production via $2\to 2$ scatterings. We show that in the Standard Model, single-graviton production dominates if the maximal temperature is smaller than $4\times 10^{18}_{ }$ GeV. This justifies previous calculations which relied solely on single-graviton production. We mention Beyond the Standard Model scenarios in which the single and double-graviton contributions could be of comparable magnitudes. Finally, we elaborate on what these results imply for the range of applicability of General Relativity as an effective theory.</description>

      <title>Observation of Gravitational Waves from the Coalescence of a $2.5-4.5~M_\odot$ Compact Object and a Neutron Star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04248v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the observation of a coalescing compact binary with component masses $2.5-4.5~M_\odot$ and $1.2-2.0~M_\odot$ (all measurements quoted at the 90% credible level). The gravitational-wave signal GW230529_181500 was observed during the fourth observing run of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA detector network on 2023 May 29 by the LIGO Livingston Observatory. The primary component of the source has a mass less than $5~M_\odot$ at 99% credibility. We cannot definitively determine from gravitational-wave data alone whether either component of the source is a neutron star or a black hole. However, given existing estimates of the maximum neutron star mass, we find the most probable interpretation of the source to be the coalescence of a neutron star with a black hole that has a mass between the most massive neutron stars and the least massive black holes observed in the Galaxy. We estimate a merger rate density of $55^{+127}_{-47}~\text{Gpc}^{-3}\,\text{yr}^{-1}$ for compact binary coalescences with properties similar to the source of GW230529_181500; assuming that the source is a neutron star-black hole merger, GW230529_181500-like sources constitute about 60% of the total merger rate inferred for neutron star-black hole coalescences. The discovery of this system implies an increase in the expected rate of neutron star-black hole mergers with electromagnetic counterparts and provides further evidence for compact objects existing within the purported lower mass gap.</description>

      <title>Generalized Entanglement Capacity of de Sitter Space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13684v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Near horizons, quantum fields of low spin exhibit densities of states that behave asymptotically like 1+1 dimensional conformal field theories. In effective field theory, imposing some short-distance cutoff, one can compute thermodynamic quantities associated with the horizon, and the leading cutoff sensitivity of the heat capacity is found to equal to the leading cutoff sensitivity of the entropy. One can also compute contributions to the thermodynamic quantities from the gravitational path integral. For the cosmological horizon of the static patch of de Sitter space, a natural conjecture for the relevant heat capacity is shown to equal the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. These observations allow us to extend the well-known notion of the generalized entropy to a generalized heat capacity for the static patch of dS. The finiteness of the entropy and the nonvanishing of the generalized heat capacity suggests it is useful to think about dS as a state in a finite dimensional quantum gravity model that is not maximally uncertain.</description>
