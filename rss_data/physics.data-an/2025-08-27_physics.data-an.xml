      <title>Numerical study of high-dimensional covariance estimation and localization for data assimilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Covariance localization is a critical component of ensemble-based data assimilation (DA) and many current localization schemes simply dampen correlations as a function of distance. Increases in computational resources, broadening scope of application for DA, and advances in general statistical methodology raise the question as to whether alternative localization methods may improve ensemble DA relative to current schemes. We carefully explore this issue by comparing distance based localization with alternative covariance localization techniques, partially those taken from the statistical literature. The comparison is done on test problems that we designed to challenge distance-based localization, including joint state-parameter estimation in a modified Lorenz '96 model and state estimation in a two-layer quasi-geostrophic model. Across all sets of experiments, we find that while localization of any kind (with rare exceptions) can lead to significant reductions in error, traditional, distance-based localization generally leads to the largest error reduction. More general localization schemes can sometimes lead to greater error reduction, though the impacts may only be marginal and may require more tuning and/or prior information.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical organization of bursty trains in event sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Temporal sequences of discrete events that describe natural and social processes are often driven by non-Poisson dynamics. In addition to a heavy-tailed interevent time distribution, which primarily captures the deviation from a Poisson process, a heavy tail in the distribution of bursty train sizes is frequently observed, which implies the presence of higher-order temporal correlations that extend beyond interevent times. Here, we study empirical event sequences from different domains to show that the bursty trains in these processes are hierarchically structured across different timescales, and that such hierarchical organization gives rise to the higher-order temporal correlations. We propose a dynamic algorithm that generates event sequences with hierarchical structures with arbitrary precision. The algorithm successfully reproduces the features of real-world phenomena, implying the presence of memory mechanisms embedded in system dynamics across multiple timescales.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Maximum Likelihood Estimation for Time-Resolved NMR Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14902v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Metabolic monitoring and reaction rate estimation using hyperpolarized NMR technology requires accurate quantitative analysis of multidimensional data scenarios. Currently, this analysis is often performed in a two-stage procedure, which is prone to errors in uncertainty propagation and estimation. We propose an approach derived from a Bayesian hierarchical model that intrinsically propagates uncertainties and operates on the full data to maximize the precision at minimal uncertainty. In an analytic treatment, we reduce the estimation procedure to a least-squares optimization problem which can be understood as an extension of the Variable Projection (VarPro) approach for data scenarios with two predictors. We investigate the method's efficacy in two experiments with hyperpolarized metabolites recorded with conventional high-field NMR devices and a micronscale NMR setup using Nitrogen-Vacancy centers in diamond for detection, respectively. In both examples, the new approach improves estimates compared to Fourier methods and proves operational advantages over a two-stage procedure employing VarPro. While the approach presented is motivated by NMR analysis, it is straightforwardly applicable to further estimation scenarios with similar data structure, such as time-resolved photospectroscopy.</description>
