      <title>Exploring Radio Emissions from Confirmed Exoplanets Using SKA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Currently, our understanding of magnetic fields in exoplanets remains limited compared to those within our solar system. Planets with magnetic fields emit radio signals primarily due to the Electron Cyclotron Maser Instability mechanism. In this study, we explore the feasibility of detecting radio emissions from exoplanets using the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) radio telescope. Utilizing data from the NASA Exoplanet Archive, we compile information on confirmed exoplanets and estimate their radio emissions using the RBL model. Our analysis reveals that three exoplanets- Qatar-4 b, TOI-1278 b, and WASP-173 A b- exhibit detectable radio signals suitable for observation with the SKA telescope.</description>

      <title>APPLE: An Evolution Code for Modeling Giant Planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce APPLE, a novel planetary evolution code designed specifically for the study of giant exoplanet and Jovian planet evolution in the era of Galileo, Juno, and Cassini. With APPLE, state-of-the-art equations of state for hydrogen, helium, ice, and rock are integrated with advanced features to treat ice/rock cores and metals in the gaseous envelope; models for helium rain and hydrogen/helium immiscibility; detailed atmosphere boundary tables that also provide self-consistent albedos and spectra; and options to address envelope metal gradients and stably-stratified regions. Our hope is that these purpose-built features of APPLE will help catalyze the development of the next generation of giant exoplanet and Jovian planet evolutionary models.</description>

      <title>The Solar System: structural overview, origins and evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the origin and long-term evolution of the Solar System is a fundamental goal of planetary science and astrophysics. This chapter describes our current understanding of the key processes that shaped our planetary system, informed by empirical data such as meteorite measurements, observations of planet-forming disks around other stars, and exoplanets, and nourished by theoretical modeling and laboratory experiments. The processes at play range in size from microns to gas giants, and mostly took place within the gaseous planet-forming disk through the growth of mountain-sized planetesimals and Moon- to Mars-sized planetary embryos. A fundamental shift in our understanding came when it was realized (thanks to advances in exoplanet science) that the giant planets' orbits likely underwent large radial shifts during their early evolution, through gas- or planetesimal-driven migration and dynamical instability. The characteristics of the rocky planets (including Earth) were forged during this early dynamic phase. Our Solar System is currently middle-aged, and we can use astrophysical tools to forecast its demise in the distant future.</description>

      <title>On the impact of the vertical structure of Martian water ice clouds on nadir atmospheric retrievals from simultaneous EMM/EXI and TGO/ACS-MIR observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieving the optical depth of the Martian clouds ($\tau_\mathrm{cld}$) is a powerful way to monitor their spatial and temporal evolution. However, such retrievals from nadir imagery rely on several assumptions, including the vertical structure of the clouds in the atmosphere. Here we compare the results of cloud optical depth retrievals from the Emirates eXploration Imager (EXI) onboard the Emirates Mars Mission (EMM) "Hope" orbiter performed using an empirical cloud profile (typically used in similar studies) and using derived cloud profiles obtained from near-simultaneous Solar Occultation observations from the Middle-Infrared channel of the Atmospheric Chemistry Suite (ACS) instrument onboard the ESA Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO). We show that the latitudinal dependence of the cloud vertical profiles can have a strong impact on the nadir retrievals; neglecting it can lead to a significant underestimation of $\tau_\mathrm{cld}$ in the polar regions (up to 25 %). We also discuss the impact of a vertically-dependent particle size profile, as previous studies have shown the presence of very small water ice particles at the top of the clouds. From this analysis, we provide recommendations for the improvement of water ice cloud parameterization in radiative transfer algorithms in nadir atmospheric retrievals.</description>

      <title>A Unified Treatment of Kepler Occurrence to Trace Planet Evolution II: The Radius Cliff Formed by Atmospheric Escape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kepler mission enabled us to look at the intrinsic population of exoplanets within our galaxy. In period-radius space, the distribution of the intrinsic population of planets contains structure that can trace planet formation and evolution history. The most distinctive feature in period-radius space is the radius cliff, a steep drop-off in occurrence between $2.5-4$R$_\oplus$ across all period ranges, separating the sub-Neptune population from the rarer Neptunes orbiting within 1 au. Following our earlier work to measure the occurrence rate of the Kepler population, we characterize the shape of the radius cliff as a function of orbital period ($10-300$ days) as well as insolation flux (9500S$_\oplus$ -- 10S$_\oplus$). The shape of the cliff flattens at longer orbital periods, tracking the rising population of Neptune-sized planets. In insolation, however, the radius cliff is both less dramatic and the slope is more uniform. The difference in this feature between period- and insolation-space can be linked to the effect of EUV/X-ray versus bolometric flux in the planet's evolution. Models of atmospheric mass loss processes that predict the location and shape of the radius valley also predict the radius cliff. We compare our measured occurrence rate distribution to population synthesis models of photoevaporation and core-powered mass-loss in order to constrain formation and evolution pathways. We find that the models do not statistically agree with our occurrence distributions of the radius cliff in period- or insolation-space. Atmospheric mass loss that shapes the radius valley cannot fully explain the shape of the radius cliff.</description>

      <title>The Sensitivity of NEO Surveyor to Low-Perihelion Asteroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Asteroids with low orbital perihelion distances experience extreme heating from the Sun that can modify their surfaces and trigger non-typical activity mechanisms. These objects are generally difficult to observe from ground-based telescopes due to their frequent proximity to the Sun. The Near Earth Object Surveyor mission, however, will regularly survey down to Solar elongations of 45 degrees and is well-suited for the detection and characterization of low-perihelion asteroids. Here, we use the survey simulation software tools developed for mission verification to explore the expected sensitivity of NEO Surveyor to these objects. We find that NEO Surveyor is expected to be &gt;90% complete for near-Sun objects larger than D~300 m. Additionally, if the asteroid (3200) Phaethon underwent a disruption event in the past to form the Geminid meteor stream, Surveyor will be &gt;90% complete to any fragments larger than D~200 m. For probable disruption models, NEO Surveyor would be expected to detect dozens of objects on Phaethon-like orbits, compared to a predicted background population of only a handful of asteroids, setting strong constraints on the likelihood of this scenario.</description>

      <title>First Mapping the Canopy Height of Primeval Forests in the Tallest Tree Area of Asia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have developed the world's first canopy height map of the distribution area of world-level giant trees. This mapping is crucial for discovering more individual and community world-level giant trees, and for analyzing and quantifying the effectiveness of biodiversity conservation measures in the Yarlung Tsangpo Grand Canyon (YTGC) National Nature Reserve. We proposed a method to map the canopy height of the primeval forest within the world-level giant tree distribution area by using a spaceborne LiDAR fusion satellite imagery (Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI), ICESat-2, and Sentinel-2) driven deep learning modeling. And we customized a pyramid receptive fields depth separable CNN (PRFXception). PRFXception, a CNN architecture specifically customized for mapping primeval forest canopy height to infer the canopy height at the footprint level of GEDI and ICESat-2 from Sentinel-2 optical imagery with a 10-meter spatial resolution. We conducted a field survey of 227 permanent plots using a stratified sampling method and measured several giant trees using UAV-LS. The predicted canopy height was compared with ICESat-2 and GEDI validation data (RMSE =7.56 m, MAE=6.07 m, ME=-0.98 m, R^2=0.58 m), UAV-LS point clouds (RMSE =5.75 m, MAE =3.72 m, ME = 0.82 m, R^2= 0.65 m), and ground survey data (RMSE = 6.75 m, MAE = 5.56 m, ME= 2.14 m, R^2=0.60 m). We mapped the potential distribution map of world-level giant trees and discovered two previously undetected giant tree communities with an 89% probability of having trees 80-100 m tall, potentially taller than Asia's tallest tree. This paper provides scientific evidence confirming southeastern Tibet--northwestern Yunnan as the fourth global distribution center of world-level giant trees initiatives and promoting the inclusion of the YTGC giant tree distribution area within the scope of China's national park conservation.</description>

      <title>Impacting the dayside Martian ionosphere from above and below: Effects of the impact of CIRs and ICMEs close to aphelion (April 2021) and during dust storms (June-July 2022) seen with MAVEN ROSE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use 62 electron density profiles collected by the Radio Occultation Science Experiment (ROSE), on MAVEN, when Mars was hit by CIRs and ICMEs close to aphelion (April 2021) and during two dust storms (June-July 2022) to examine the response of the Martian ionosphere to solar events and to solar events hitting during dust storms. We do so through three proxies - variation in total electron content between 80 and 300 km altitude, peak density, and peak altitude - of the aforementioned 62 ROSE electron density profiles, relative to a characterisation of the ionosphere through solar minimum leading to solar maximum, specific to local time sector and season, presented in Segale et al., (COMPANION). We observe an increased Total Electron Content (TEC) between 80 and 300 km altitude up to 2.5 x 10(15) m(-2) in April 2021 and up to 5 x 10(15) m(-2) in June-July 2022 compared to the baseline photochemically produced ionosphere. This increase in TEC corresponds mainly to increases in the solar energetic particles flux (detected by MAVEN SEP) and electron fluxes (detected by MAVEN SWEA). In addition to solar events, in June-July 2022, an A storm and a B storm were occurring and merging on the surface of Mars. We observe a raise in peak altitude in general lower than expected during dust storms, possibly due to high values of solar wind dynamic pressure (derived from MAVEN SWIA). From 31 ROSE profiles collected in this time period that showed both the M2 and M1 layer, we observe that, on average, M1 and M2 peak altitudes raise the same amount, suggesting that the thermosphere might loft as a unit during dust storms. During this time period, several proton aurora events of variable brightness were detected with MAVEN IUVS underlining the complex and multifaceted impact of dust activity and extreme solar activity on the Martian ionosphere.</description>

      <title>Atmospheric entry and fragmentation of small asteroid 2024 BX1: Bolide trajectory, orbit, dynamics, light curve, and spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00634v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Asteroid 2024 BX1 was the eighth asteroid that was discovered shortly before colliding with the Earth. The associated bolide was recorded by dedicated instruments of the European Fireball Network and the AllSky7 network on 2024 January 21 at 0:32:38-44 UT. We report a comprehensive analysis of this instrumentally observed meteorite fall, which occurred as predicted west of Berlin, Germany. The atmospheric trajectory was quite steep, with an average slope to the Earth's surface of 75.6 deg. The entry speed was 15.20 km/s. The heliocentric orbit calculated from the bolide data agrees very well with the asteroid data. However, the bolide was fainter than expected for a reportedly meter-sized asteroid. The absolute magnitude reached -14.4, and the entry mass was estimated to be 140 kg. The recorded bolide spectrum was low in iron, based on which, the meteorite was expected to be rich in enstatite. The recovered meteorites, called Ribbeck, were classified as aubrites. The high albedo of enstatite (E-type) asteroids can explain the size discrepancy. The asteroid was likely smaller than 0.5 meter and should rather be called a meteoroid. During the atmospheric entry, the meteoroid severely fragmented into much smaller pieces already at a height of 55 km under an aerodynamic pressure of 0.12 MPa. The primary fragments then broke up again, most frequently at heights 39-29 km (0.9-2.2 MPa). Numerous small meteorites and up to four stones larger than 100g were expected to land. Within a few days of publication of the location of the strewn field, dozens of meteorites were found in the area we had predicted.</description>

      <title>Does the Earth's rotation speed really tend to accelerate for a long time?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06343v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently published studies suggested that the difference between Universal and Coordinated Time UT1-UTC could reach a large positive value in a few years, making it necessary to introduce a negative leap second into the UTC scale for the first time in its history. Based on the latest UT1 series provided by the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service (IERS) and its prediction, it was shown that the tendency to acceleration of the Earth's rotation observed over past four years most likely will return to the deceleration, which is the usual behavior of the Earth rotational dynamics during past decades.</description>

      <title>Variability in SSTc2d J163134.1-240100, a brown dwarf with quasi-spherical mass loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.14087v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report on a search for variability in the young brown dwarf SST1624 (~M7 spectral type, M~0.05Msol), previously found to feature an expanding gaseous shell and to undergo quasi-spherical mass loss. We find no variability on timescales of 1-6hours. Specifically, on these timescales, we rule out the presence of a period with amplitude &gt;1%. A photometric period in that range would have been evidence for either pulsation powered by Deuterium burning or rotation near breakup. However, we see a 3% decrease in the K-band magnitude between two consecutive observing nights (a 10sigma result). There is also clear evidence for variations in the WISE lightcurves at 3.6 and 4.5 microns on timescales of days, with a tentative period of about 6d (with a plausible range between 3 and 7d). The best explanation for the variations over days is rotational modulation due to spots. These results disfavour centrifugal winds driven by fast rotation as mechanism for the mass loss, which, in turn, makes the alternative scenario -- a thermal pulse due to Deuterium burning -- more plausible.</description>
