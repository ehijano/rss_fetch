      <title>Typhoon Tracks Regulated by Feedbacks of Fine-Scale Clouds to Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate tropical cyclone (TC) track prediction is crucial for mitigating the catastrophic impacts of TCs on human life and the environment. Despite decades of research on tropical cyclone (TC) track prediction, large errors known as track forecast busts (TFBs) occur frequently, and their causes remain poorly understood. Here, we examine a few dozens of TCs using a unique TC downscaling strategy that can quantitatively assess the sensitivity of TC track on the strength of feedbacks of fine-scale clouds to environment. We show that as TFBs have a weaker environmental steering that favors scattering cumulonimbus clouds, capturing asymmetric distribution of planetary vorticity advection induced by such fine-scale clouds corrects TFBs by 60 percent. Our clear identification of such important TC track predictability source promises continuous improvement of TC track prediction as finer-scale TC clouds and their interactions with environment are better resolved as model larger-scale behaviors have improved.</description>

      <title>EnScale: Temporally-consistent multivariate generative downscaling via proper scoring rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The practical use of future climate projections from global circulation models (GCMs) is often limited by their coarse spatial resolution, requiring downscaling to generate high-resolution data. Regional climate models (RCMs) provide this refinement, but are computationally expensive. To address this issue, machine learning models can learn the downscaling function, mapping coarse GCM outputs to high-resolution fields. Among these, generative approaches aim to capture the full conditional distribution of RCM data given coarse-scale GCM data, which is characterized by large variability and thus challenging to model accurately. We introduce EnScale, a generative machine learning framework that emulates the full GCM-to-RCM map by training on multiple pairs of GCM and corresponding RCM data. It first adjusts large-scale mismatches between GCM and coarsened RCM data, followed by a super-resolution step to generate high-resolution fields. Both steps employ generative models optimized with the energy score, a proper scoring rule. Compared to state-of-the-art ML downscaling approaches, our setup reduces computational cost by about one order of magnitude. EnScale jointly emulates multiple variables -- temperature, precipitation, solar radiation, and wind -- spatially consistent over an area in Central Europe. In addition, we propose a variant EnScale-t that enables temporally consistent downscaling. We establish a comprehensive evaluation framework across various categories including calibration, spatial structure, extremes, and multivariate dependencies. Comparison with diverse benchmarks demonstrates EnScale's strong performance and computational efficiency. EnScale offers a promising approach for accurate and temporally consistent RCM emulation.</description>

      <title>DPSformer: A long-tail-aware model for improving heavy rainfall prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate and timely forecasting of heavy rainfall remains a critical challenge for modern society. Precipitation exhibits a highly imbalanced distribution: most observations record no or light rain, while heavy rainfall events are rare. Such an imbalanced distribution obstructs deep learning models from effectively predicting heavy rainfall events. To address this challenge, we treat rainfall forecasting explicitly as a long-tailed learning problem, identifying the insufficient representation of heavy rainfall events as the primary barrier to forecasting accuracy. Therefore, we introduce DPSformer, a long-tail-aware model that enriches representation of heavy rainfall events through a high-resolution branch. For heavy rainfall events $ \geq $ 50 mm/6 h, DPSformer lifts the Critical Success Index (CSI) of a baseline Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) model from 0.012 to 0.067. For the top 1% coverage of heavy rainfall events, its Fraction Skill Score (FSS) exceeds 0.45, surpassing existing methods. Our work establishes an effective long-tailed paradigm for heavy rainfall prediction, offering a practical tool to enhance early warning systems and mitigate the societal impacts of extreme weather events.</description>

      <title>STCast: Adaptive Boundary Alignment for Global and Regional Weather Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To gain finer regional forecasts, many works have explored the regional integration from the global atmosphere, e.g., by solving boundary equations in physics-based methods or cropping regions from global forecasts in data-driven methods. However, the effectiveness of these methods is often constrained by static and imprecise regional boundaries, resulting in poor generalization ability. To address this issue, we propose Spatial-Temporal Weather Forecasting (STCast), a novel AI-driven framework for adaptive regional boundary optimization and dynamic monthly forecast allocation. Specifically, our approach employs a Spatial-Aligned Attention (SAA) mechanism, which aligns global and regional spatial distributions to initialize boundaries and adaptively refines them based on attention-derived alignment patterns. Furthermore, we design a Temporal Mixture-of-Experts (TMoE) module, where atmospheric variables from distinct months are dynamically routed to specialized experts using a discrete Gaussian distribution, enhancing the model's ability to capture temporal patterns. Beyond global and regional forecasting, we evaluate our STCast on extreme event prediction and ensemble forecasting. Experimental results demonstrate consistent superiority over state-of-the-art methods across all four tasks.</description>

      <title>How Effective Are Time-Series Models for Rainfall Nowcasting? A Comprehensive Benchmark for Rainfall Nowcasting Incorporating PWV Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rainfall nowcasting, which aims to predict precipitation within the next 0 to 3 hours, is critical for disaster mitigation and real-time response planning. However, most time series forecasting benchmarks in meteorology are evaluated on variables with strong periodicity, such as temperature and humidity, which fail to reflect model capabilities in more complex and practically meteorology scenarios like rainfall nowcasting. To address this gap, we propose RainfallBench, a benchmark designed for rainfall nowcasting, a highly challenging and practically relevant task characterized by zero inflation, temporal decay, and non-stationarity, focused on predicting precipitation within the next 0 to 3 hours. The dataset is derived from five years of meteorological observations, recorded at 15-minute intervals across six essential variables, and collected from more than 12,000 GNSS stations globally. In particular, it incorporates precipitable water vapor (PWV), a crucial indicator of rainfall that is absent in other datasets. We further design specialized evaluation strategies to assess model performance on key meteorological challenges, such as multi-scale prediction and extreme rainfall events, and evaluate over 20 state-of-the-art models across six major architectures on RainfallBench. Additionally, to address the zero-inflation and temporal decay issues overlooked by existing models, we introduce Bi-Focus Precipitation Forecaster (BFPF), a plug-and-play module that incorporates domain-specific priors to enhance rainfall time series forecasting. Statistical analysis and ablation studies validate the comprehensiveness of our dataset as well as the superiority of our methodology.

      <title>A Weather Foundation Model for the Power Grid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Weather foundation models (WFMs) have recently set new benchmarks in global forecast skill, yet their concrete value for the weather-sensitive infrastructure that powers modern society remains largely unexplored. In this study, we fine-tune Silurian AI's 1.5B-parameter WFM, Generative Forecasting Transformer (GFT), on a rich archive of Hydro-Qu\'ebec asset observations--including transmission-line weather stations, wind-farm met-mast streams, and icing sensors--to deliver hyper-local, asset-level forecasts for five grid-critical variables: surface temperature, precipitation, hub-height wind speed, wind-turbine icing risk, and rime-ice accretion on overhead conductors. Across 6-72 h lead times, the tailored model surpasses state-of-the-art NWP benchmarks, trimming temperature mean absolute error (MAE) by 15%, total-precipitation MAE by 35%, and lowering wind speed MAE by 15%. Most importantly, it attains an average precision score of 0.72 for day-ahead rime-ice detection, a capability absent from existing operational systems, which affords several hours of actionable warning for potentially catastrophic outage events. These results show that WFMs, when post-trained with small amounts of high-fidelity, can serve as a practical foundation for next-generation grid-resilience intelligence.</description>

      <title>GLONET: Mercator's end-to-end neural Global Ocean forecasting system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05454v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate ocean forecasting is crucial in different areas ranging from science to decision making. Recent advancements in data-driven models have shown significant promise, particularly in weather forecasting community, but yet no data-driven approaches have matched the accuracy and the scalability of traditional global ocean forecasting systems that rely on physics-driven numerical models and can be very computationally expensive, depending on their spatial resolution or complexity. Here, we introduce GLONET, a global ocean neural network-based forecasting system, developed by Mercator Ocean International. GLONET is trained on the global Mercator Ocean physical reanalysis GLORYS12 to integrate physics-based principles through neural operators and networks, which dynamically capture local-global interactions within a unified, scalable framework, ensuring high small-scale accuracy and efficient dynamics. GLONET's performance is assessed and benchmarked against two other forecasting systems: the global Mercator Ocean analysis and forecasting 1/12 high-resolution physical system GLO12 and a recent neural-based system also trained from GLORYS12. A series of comprehensive validation metrics is proposed, specifically tailored for neural network-based ocean forecasting systems, which extend beyond traditional point-wise error assessments that can introduce bias towards neural networks optimized primarily to minimize such metrics. The preliminary evaluation of GLONET shows promising results, for temperature, sea surface height, salinity and ocean currents. GLONET's experimental daily forecast are accessible through the European Digital Twin Ocean platform EDITO.</description>
