      <title>Magnetic Fields Observed along the E-W Outflow of IRAS 16293-2422</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic fields likely play an important role in the formation of young protostars. Multiscale and multiwavelength dust polarization observations can reveal the inferred magnetic field from scales of the cloud to core to protostar. We present continuum polarization observations of the young protostellar triple system IRAS 16293-2422 at 89 $\mu$m using HAWC+ on SOFIA. The inferred magnetic field is very uniform with an average field angle of 89$^\circ\pm$23$^\circ$ (E of N), which is different from the $\sim$170$^\circ$ field morphology seen at 850 $\mu$m at larger scales (&gt; 2000 au) with JCMT POL-2 and at 1.3 mm on smaller scales (&lt; 300 au) with ALMA. The HAWC+ magnetic field direction is aligned with the known E-W outflow. This alignment difference suggests that the shorter wavelength HAWC+ data is tracing the magnetic field associated with warmer dust likely from the outflow cavity, whereas the longer wavelength data are tracing the bulk magnetic field from cooler dust. Also, we show in this source the dust emission peak is strongly affected by the observing wavelength. The dust continuum peaks closer to source B (northern source) at shorter wavelengths and progressively moves toward the southern A source with increasing wavelength (from 22 $\mu$m to 850 $\mu$m).</description>

      <title>Stellar Characterization and a Chromospheric Activity Analysis of a K2 Sample of Planet-Hosting Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective temperatures, surface gravities, and iron abundances were derived for 109 stars observed by the K2 mission using equivalent width measurements of Fe I and Fe II lines. Calculations were carried out in LTE using Kurucz model atmospheres. Stellar masses and radii were derived by combining the stellar parameters with Gaia DR3 parallaxes, V-magnitudes, and isochrones. The derived stellar and planetary radii have median internal precision of 1.8%, and 2.3%, respectively. The radius gap near $\rm R_{planet}\sim 1.9 R_\oplus$ was detected in this K2 sample. Chromospheric activity was measured from the Ca II H and K lines using the Values of $\log R^\prime_{\rm HK}$ were investigated as a function of stellar rotational period (P$_{rot}$) and we found that chromospheric activity decreases with increasing P$_{rot}$, although there is a large scatter in $\log R^\prime_{\rm HK}$ ($\sim$0.5) for a given P$_{rot}$. Activity levels in this sample reveal a paucity of F &amp; G dwarfs with intermediate activity levels (Vaughan-Preston gap). The effect that stellar activity might have on the derivation of stellar parameters was investigated by including magnetically-sensitive Fe I lines in the analysis and we find no significant differences between parameters with and without magnetically-sensitive lines, although the more active stars ($\log R^\prime _{\rm HK}&gt;-5.0$) exhibit a larger scatter in the differences in $T_{\rm eff}$ and [Fe/H].</description>

      <title>Lithium, rotation and metallicity in the open cluster M35</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lithium (Li) abundance is an age indicator for G, K, and M stellar types, as its abundance decreases over time for these spectral types. However, despite the observational efforts made over the past few decades, the role of rotation, activity, and metallicity in the depletion of Li is still unclear. We have investigated how Li depletion is affected by rotation and metallicity in G and K members of the roughly Pleiades-aged open cluster M35. To do so, we have collected a sample of 165 candidate members observed with the WIYN/Hydra spectrograph. In addition, we have taken advantage of three previous spectroscopic studies of Li in M35. As a result, we have collected a final sample of 396 stars which we have classified as members and non-members of the cluster. We have measured iron abundances, Li equivalent widths, and Li abundances for the 110 M35 members added to the existing sample by this study. Finally, rotation periods for cluster members have been obtained from the literature or derived from Zwicky Transient Facility light curves. As a result, we have confirmed that fast G and K rotators are Li-rich in comparison with slow rotators of similar effective temperature. Furthermore, while we derived subsolar metallicity for M35 from our spectra, the distribution of Li in this cluster is similar to those observed for the Pleiades and M34, which have solar metallicity and slightly different ages. In addition, we have shown that an empirical relationship proposed to remove the contribution of the Fe I line at 670.75 nm to the blended feature at 670.78 nm overestimates the contribution of this iron line for M35 members. We conclude that a 0.2-0.3 dex difference in metallicity makes little difference in the Li distributions of open clusters with ages between 100 and 250 Myr.</description>

      <title>Fully Kinetic Simulations of Proton-Beam-Driven Instabilities from Parker Solar Probe Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The expanding solar wind plasma ubiquitously exhibits anisotropic non-thermal particle velocity distributions. Typically, proton Velocity Distribution Functions (VDFs) show the presence of a core and a field-aligned beam. Novel observations made by Parker Solar Probe (PSP) in the innermost heliosphere have revealed new complex features in the proton VDFs, namely anisotropic beams that sometimes experience perpendicular diffusion. This phenomenon gives rise to VDFs that resemble a "hammerhead". In this study, we use a 2.5D fully kinetic simulation to investigate the stability of proton VDFs with anisotropic beams observed by PSP. Our setup consists of a core and an anisotropic beam populations that drift with respect to each other. This configuration triggers a proton-beam instability from which nearly parallel fast magnetosonic modes develop. Our results demonstrate that before this instability reaches saturation, the waves resonantly interact with the beam protons, causing significant perpendicular heating at the expense of the parallel temperature. Furthermore, the proton perpendicular heating induces a hammerhead-like shape in the resulting VDF. Our results suggest that this mechanism probably contribute to producing the observed hammerhead distributions.</description>

      <title>Cloud Dissipation and Disk Wind in the Late Phase of Star Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a long-term simulation of star and disk formation using three-dimensional non-ideal magnetohydrodynamics. The simulation starts from a prestellar cloud and proceeds through the long-term evolution of the circumstellar disk until $\sim 1.5\times10^5$ yr after protostar formation. The disk has size $\lesssim 50$ au and little substructure in the main accretion phase because of the action of magnetic braking and the magnetically-driven outflow to remove angular momentum. The main accretion phase ends when the outflow breaks out of the cloud, causing the envelope mass to decrease rapidly. The outflow subsequently weakens as the mass accretion rate also weakens. While the envelope-to-disk accretion continues, the disk grows gradually and develops transient spiral structures due to gravitational instability. When the envelope-to-disk accretion ends, the disk becomes stable and reaches a size $\gtrsim 300$ au. In addition, about 30% of the initial cloud mass has been ejected by the outflow. A significant finding of this work is that after the envelope dissipates, a revitalization of the wind occurs, and there is mass ejection from the disk surface that lasts until the end of the simulation. This mass ejection (or disk wind) is generated since the magnetic pressure significantly dominates both the ram pressure and thermal pressure above and below the disk at this stage. Using the angular momentum flux and mass loss rate estimated from the disk wind, the disk dissipation timescale is estimated to be $\sim10^6$ yr.</description>

      <title>Rotation and Abundances of the Benchmark Brown Dwarf HD 33632 Ab from Keck/KPIC High-resolution Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the projected rotational velocity and molecular abundances for HD 33632 Ab obtained via Keck Planet Imager and Characterizer high-resolution spectroscopy. HD 33632 Ab is a nearby benchmark brown dwarf companion at a separation of $\sim$20 au that straddles the L/T transition. Using a forward-modeling framework with self-consistent substellar atmospheric and retrieval models for HD 33632 Ab, we derive a projected rotational velocity of 53 $\pm$ 3 km/s and water plus carbon monoxide mass fractions of log CO = $-$2.3 $\pm$ 0.3 and log H$_2$O = $-$2.7 $\pm$ 0.2. The inferred carbon-to-oxygen ratio (C/O = 0.58 $\pm$ 0.14), molecular abundances, and metallicity ([C/H] = 0.0 $\pm$ 0.2 dex) of HD 33632 Ab are consistent with its host star. Although detectable methane opacities are expected in L/T transition objects, we did not recover methane in our KPIC spectra, partly due to the high $v\sin{i}$ and to disequilibrium chemistry at the pressures we are sensitive to. We parameterize the spin as the ratio of rotation over break-up velocity, and compare HD 33632 Ab to a compilation of &gt;200 very low-mass objects (M$\lesssim$0.1 M$_{\odot}$) that have spin measurements in the literature. There appears to be no clear trend for the isolated field low-mass objects versus mass, but a tentative trend is identified for low-mass companions and directly imaged exoplanets, similar to previous findings. A larger sample of close-in gas giant exoplanets and brown dwarfs will critically examine our understanding of their formation and evolution through rotation and chemical abundance measurements.</description>

      <title>The evolution of stellar X-ray activity and angular momentum as seen by eROSITA, TESS, and Gaia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have assembled a sample of $\sim$8200 stars with spectral types F5V-M5V, all having directly measured X-ray luminosities from eROSITA and rotation periods from TESS, and having empirically estimated ages via their membership in stellar clusters and groups identified in Gaia astrometry (ages 3-500 Myr). This is the largest such study sample yet assembled for the purpose of empirically constraining the evolution of rotationally driven stellar X-ray activity. We observe rotation-age-activity correlations that are qualitatively as expected: stars of a given spectral type spin down with age and they become less X-ray active as they do so. We provide simple functional representations of these empirical relationships that predict X-ray luminosity from basic observables to within 0.3 dex. Interestingly, we find that the rotation-activity relationship is far simpler and more monotonic in form when expressed in terms of stellar angular momentum instead of rotation period. We discuss how this finding may relate to the long-established idea that rotation-activity relationships are mediated by stellar structure (e.g., convective turnover time, surface area). Finally, we provide an empirical relation that predicts stellar angular momentum from basic observables, and without requiring a direct measurement of stellar rotation, to within 0.5 dex.</description>

      <title>Modeling Realistic Heating Profiles of Transition Region Hot Loops on the Sun: Evidence for Impulsive Heating and Non-equilibrium Ionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study examines the heating profile of hot solar transition region loops, particularly focusing on transient brightenings observed in IRIS 1400{\AA} slit-jaw images. The findings challenge the adequacy of simplistic, singular heating mechanisms, revealing that the heating is temporally impulsive and requires a spatially complex profile with multiple heating scales. A forward modeling code is utilized to generate synthetic IRIS emission spectra of these loops based on HYDRAD output, confirming that emitting ions are out of equilibrium. The modeling further indicates that density-dependent dielectronic recombination rates must be included to reproduce the observed line ratios. Collectively, this evidence substantiates that the loops are subject to impulsive heating and that the components of the transiently brightened plasma are driven far from thermal equilibrium. Heating events such as these are ubiquitous in the transition region and the analysis described above provides a robust observational diagnostic tool for characterizing the plasma.</description>

      <title>The Role of Sunspots Magnetic Configuration in the Formation of Umbral Fine-Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use spectro-polarimetric data recorded by Hinode to analyze the magnetic field configuration of a part of a sunspot (AR 10923) where a bundle of penumbral filaments are intruding into its umbra. We want to explore the role of the sunspot magnetic configuration in the formation and kinematics of the fine-structures, such as umbral dots and light bridges, inside the sunspot umbra. Both direct inferences from polarization Stokes profiles and the inversion results using the SIR code indicate an aligned magnetic field configuration in the umbra where moving umbral dots are easily formed at the leading edges of the rapidly intruding penumbral filaments. We suggest that the magnetic field topology is rearranged leading to the observed aligned magnetic field lines via magnetic reconnection process by which a part of the magnetic energy is converted into thermal and kinetic energy. This new configuration causes the umbral fine-structures to form easily and more frequently.</description>

      <title>Using autoencoders and deep transfer learning to determine the stellar parameters of 286 CARMENES M dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning (DL) techniques are a promising approach among the set of methods used in the ever-challenging determination of stellar parameters in M dwarfs. In this context, transfer learning could play an important role in mitigating uncertainties in the results due to the synthetic gap (i.e. difference in feature distributions between observed and synthetic data). We propose a feature-based deep transfer learning (DTL) approach based on autoencoders to determine stellar parameters from high-resolution spectra. Using this methodology, we provide new estimations for the effective temperature, surface gravity, metallicity, and projected rotational velocity for 286 M dwarfs observed by the CARMENES survey. Using autoencoder architectures, we projected synthetic PHOENIX-ACES spectra and observed CARMENES spectra onto a new feature space of lower dimensionality in which the differences between the two domains are reduced. We used this low-dimensional new feature space as input for a convolutional neural network to obtain the stellar parameter determinations. We performed an extensive analysis of our estimated stellar parameters, ranging from 3050 to 4300 K, 4.7 to 5.1 dex, and -0.53 to 0.25 dex for Teff, logg, and [Fe/H], respectively. Our results are broadly consistent with those of recent studies using CARMENES data, with a systematic deviation in our Teff scale towards hotter values for estimations above 3750 K. Furthermore, our methodology mitigates the deviations in metallicity found in previous DL techniques due to the synthetic gap. We consolidated a DTL-based methodology to determine stellar parameters in M dwarfs from synthetic spectra, with no need for high-quality measurements involved in the knowledge transfer. These results suggest the great potential of DTL to mitigate the differences in feature distributions between the observations and the PHOENIX-ACES spectra.</description>

      <title>Studying geometry of the ultraluminous X-ray pulsar Swift J0243.6+6124 using X-ray and optical polarimetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discovery of pulsations from a number of ultra-luminous X-ray (ULX) sources proved that accretion onto neutron stars can produce luminosities exceeding the Eddington limit by a couple of orders of magnitude. The conditions necessary to achieve such high luminosities as well as the exact geometry of the accretion flow in the neutron star vicinity are, however, a matter of debate. The pulse phase-resolved polarization measurements that became possible with the launch of the IXPE can be used to determine the pulsar geometry and its orientation relative to the orbital plane. They provide an avenue to test different theoretical models of ULX pulsars. In this paper we present the results of three IXPE observations of the first Galactic ULX pulsar Swift J0243.6+6124 during its 2023 outburst. We find strong variations of the polarization characteristics with the pulsar phase. The average polarization degree increases from about 5% to 15% as the flux dropped by a factor of three in the course of the outburst. The polarization angle (PA) as function of the pulsar phase shows two peaks in the first two observations, but changes to a characteristic sawtooth pattern in the remaining data set. This is not consistent with a simple rotating vector model. Assuming the existence of an additional constant polarized component, we were able to fit the three observations with a common rotating vector model and obtain constraints on the pulsar geometry. In particular, we find the pulsar angular momentum inclination with respect to the line-of-sight of 15-40 deg, the magnetic obliquity of 60-80 deg, and the pulsar spin position angle of -50 deg, which differs from the constant component PA of about 10 deg. Combining these X-ray measurements with the optical PA, we find evidence for a 30 deg misalignment between the pulsar spin and the binary orbital axis.</description>

      <title>Orbital motion of primordial black holes crossing Solar-type stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) are hypothetical objects that could have originated from density fluctuations in a very early phase of our Universe. Recent observations restrict the masses that such PBHs could have, if they are to constitute all of dark matter today: $10^{17} \, {\rm g} \leq m \leq 10^{23} \, {\rm g}$. With such low masses, general relativity predicts that the corresponding radii for the PBHs would be atomic or subatomic in size. When captured by a star, such a tiny PBH could exhibit an orbit completely or partially inside the body of the star, without significantly changing its mass for quite a long time. Here we examine the possible trajectories of a PBH that is captured by a Sun-like star. When in motion in the interior of the star, the amount of stellar mass that effectively interacts with the PBH will be a function of its distance to the center of the star. As a consequence, a strong effect on the shape of the orbits emerges, leading to PBH trajectories that could be open or closed, and exhibiting a rich variety of patterns.</description>

      <title>On the width of a collisionless shock and the index of the cosmic rays it accelerates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite being studied for many years, the structure of collisionless shocks is still not fully determined. Such shocks are known to be accelerators of cosmic rays, which, in turn, modify the shock structure. The shock width $\lambda$ is known to be connected to the cosmic rays (CRs) spectral index, $a$. Here, we use an instability analysis to derive the shock width in the presence of CRs. We obtain an analytical expression connecting the shock width to the CRs index and to the fraction of upstream particles that are accelerated. We find that when this fraction becomes larger than $\sim$~30\%, a new instability becomes dominant. The shock undergoes a transition where its width increases by a factor $\sim 8- 10$, and the CRs acceleration effectively ends. Our analysis is valid for strong, non-relativistic and unmagnetized shocks. We discuss the implication of these results to the expected range of CRs spectra and flux observed, and on the structure of non-relativistic collisionless shocks.</description>

      <title>Planet formation regulated by galactic-scale interstellar turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Planets form from protoplanetary discs of dust and gas that surround stars younger than a few million years. The properties of these discs dictate how planets grow, determining the nature, architecture and composition of the observed exoplanet population. The nature of (turbulent) angular momentum transport through the disc in particular is critical for planet growth and migration. While the dominant physical processes in disc evolution remain unknown, theoretical studies widely assume an isolated star-disc system. Here we challenge this conventional assumption by showing that, far from being isolated systems, discs in typical star forming environments are constantly replenished by capturing new material from the interstellar medium (ISM). We show that this in-fall alone explains observed disc masses, outer radii and stellar accretion rates as a function of time and stellar mass. ISM capture is also capable of driving disc turbulence corresponding to viscosity in the range $\alpha_\mathrm{SS} \sim 10^{-5}{-}10^{-1}$, as observationally inferred. We find that $20{-}70$~percent of discs are composed of material captured in the most recent half of their life-time, implying their properties are not direct probes of internal disc physics. Our results suggest that planet formation is driven by the turbulent cascade of energy from galactic-scales down to the protoplanetary disc and that recent evidence of in-fall from the ISM onto mature protoplanetary discs are part of an important, general process. This represents a far-reaching shift in our understanding of every stage of planet formation, from dust aggregation to the migration of giant planets through the disc.</description>

      <title>Chemical inventory of the envelope of the Class I protostar L1551 IRS 5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Episodic accretion in protostars leads to luminosity outbursts that end up heating their surroundings. This rise in temperature pushes the snow lines back, enabling the desorption of chemical species from dust grain surfaces, which may significantly alter the chemical history of the accreting envelope. However, a limited number of extensive chemical surveys of eruptive young stars have been performed thus far. In the present study, we carry out a large spectral survey of the binary Class I protostar L1551 IRS 5, known to be a FUor-like object, in the 3mm and 2mm bands with the IRAM-30m telescope. As a result, we detected more than 400 molecular lines. The source displays a great chemical richness with the detection of 75 species, including isotopologues. Among these species, there are 13 hydrocarbons, 25 N-bearing species, 30 O-bearing species, 15 S-bearing species, 12 deuterated molecules, and a total of 10 complex organic molecules (l-C4H2, CH3CCH, CH2DCCH, CH3CHO, CH3CN, CH3OCH3, CH3OCHO, CH3OH, CH2DOH, and HC5N). With the help of local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) and non-LTE models, we determined the column densities of most molecules as well as excitation and kinetic temperatures. While most of those molecules trace the cold envelope (. 20 K), the OCS and CH3OH emission arise from the warm (&gt; 100 K) innermost (&lt; 2'' ) regions. We compared the chemical inventory of L1551 IRS 5 and its column density ratios, including isotopic ratios, with other protostellar sources. A broad chemical diversity is seen among Class I objects. More observations with both single-dish telescopes and interferometers are needed to characterize the diversity in a larger sample of protostars, while more astrochemical models would help explain this diversity, in addition to the impact of luminosity outbursts on the chemistry of protostellar envelopes.</description>

      <title>Evidence of grain alignment by magnetically enhanced radiative torques from multi-wavelength dust polarization modeling of HL Tau</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00220v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) has revolutionized the field of dust polarization in protoplanetary disks across multiple wavelengths. Previous observations and empirical modeling suggested multiple mechanisms of dust polarization toward HL Tau, including grain alignment and dust scattering. However, a detailed modeling of dust polarization based on grain alignment physics is not yet available. Here, using our updated POLARIS code, we perform numerical modeling of dust polarization arising from both grain alignment by Magnetically Enhanced Radiative Torque (MRAT) mechanism and self-scattering to reproduce the HL Tau polarization observed at three wavelengths 0.87, 1.3, and 3.1$\,$mm. Our modeling results show that the observed multi-wavelength polarization could be reproduced only when large grains contain embedded iron inclusions and those with slow internal relaxation must have wrong internal alignment (i.e., the grain's major axis parallel to its angular momentum). The abundance of iron embedded inside grains in the form of clusters is constrained to be $\gtrsim 16$%, and the number of iron atoms per cluster is $N_{\rm cl} \sim 9\times10^2$. Maximum grain sizes probed at wavelengths $\lambda$ = 0.87, 1.3, and 3.1$\,$mm are constrained at $\sim$ 60, 80, and 90$\,\mu$m, respectively.</description>

      <title>A Survey for Radio Emission from White Dwarfs in the VLA Sky Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11015v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Radio emission has been detected from tens of white dwarfs, in particular in accreting systems. Additionally, radio emission has been predicted as a possible outcome of a planetary system around a white dwarf. We searched for 3 GHz radio continuum emission in 846,000 candidate white dwarfs previously identified in Gaia using the Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS) Epoch 1 Quick Look Catalogue. We identified 13 candidate white dwarfs with a counterpart in VLASS within 2". Five of those were found not to be white dwarfs in follow-up or archival spectroscopy, whereas seven others were found to be chance alignments with a background source in higher-resolution optical or radio images. The remaining source, WDJ204259.71+152108.06, is found to be a white dwarf and M-dwarf binary with an orbital period of 4.1 days and long-term stochastic optical variability, as well as luminous radio and X-ray emission. For this binary, we find no direct evidence of a background contaminant, and a chance alignment probability of only ~2 per cent. However, other evidence points to the possibility of an unfortunate chance alignment with a background radio and X-ray emitting quasar, including an unusually poor Gaia DR3 astrometric solution for this source. With at most one possible radio emitting white dwarf found, we conclude that strong (&gt; 1-3 mJy) radio emission from white dwarfs in the 3 GHz band is virtually nonexistent outside of interacting binaries.</description>

      <title>Gaia's binary star renaissance</title>

Abstract: Stellar multiplicity is among the oldest and richest problems in astrophysics. Binary stars are a cornerstone of stellar mass and radius measurements that underpin modern stellar evolutionary models. Binaries are the progenitors of many of the most interesting and exotic astrophysical phenomena, ranging from type Ia supernovae to gamma ray bursts, hypervelocity stars, and most detectable stellar black holes. They are also ubiquitous, accounting for about half of all stars in the Universe. In the era of gravitational waves, wide-field surveys, and open-source stellar models, binaries are coming back stronger than a nineties trend. Much of the progress in the last decade has been enabled by the Gaia mission, which provides high-precision astrometry for more than a billion stars in the Milky Way. The Gaia data probe a wider range of binary separations and mass ratios than most previous surveys, enabling both an improved binary population census and discovery of rare objects. I summarize recent results in the study of binary stars brought about by Gaia, focusing in particular on developments related to wide ($a \gtrsim 100$ au) binaries, evidence of binarity from astrometric noise and proper motion anomaly, astrometric and radial velocity orbits from Gaia DR3, and binaries containing non-accreting compact objects. Limitations of the Gaia data, the importance of ground-based follow-up, and anticipated improvements with Gaia DR4 are also discussed.</description>

      <title>GRASS II: Simulations of Potential Granulation Noise Mitigation Methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07945v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an updated version of GRASS (the GRanulation And Spectrum Simulator, Palumbo et al. 2022) which now uses an expanded library of 22 solar lines to empirically model time-resolved spectral variations arising from solar granulation. We show that our synthesis model accurately reproduces disk-integrated solar line profiles and bisectors, and we quantify the intrinsic granulation-driven radial-velocity (RV) variability for each of the 22 lines studied. We show that summary statistics of bisector shape (e.g., bisector inverse slope) are strongly correlated with the measured anomalous, variability-driven RV at high pixel signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and spectral resolution. Further, the strength of the correlations vary both line by line and with the summary statistic used. These correlations disappear for individual lines at the typical spectral resolutions and SNRs achieved by current EPRV spectrographs; so we use simulations from GRASS to demonstrate that they can, in principle, be recovered by selectively binning lines that are similarly affected by granulation. In the best-case scenario (high SNR and large number of binned lines), we find that a $\lesssim$30$\%$ reduction in the granulation-induced root mean square (RMS) RV can be achieved, but that the achievable reduction in variability is most strongly limited by the spectral resolution of the observing instrument. Based on our simulations, we predict that existing ultra-high-resolution spectrographs, namely ESPRESSO and PEPSI, should be able to resolve convective variability in other, bright stars.</description>

      <title>Extremely metal-poor stars in the Fornax and Carina dwarf spheroidal galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07676v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present our analysis of VLT/UVES and X-shooter observations of six very metal-poor stars, including four stars at [Fe/H]$\approx$$-3$ in the Fornax and Carina dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies. To date, this metallicity range in these two galaxies has not yet been investigated fully, or at all in some cases. The chemical abundances of 25 elements are presented, based on 1D and local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) model atmospheres. We discuss the different elemental groups, and find that $\alpha$- and iron-peak elements in these two systems are generally in good agreement with the Milky Way halo at the same metallicity. Our analysis reveals that none of the six stars we studied exhibits carbon enhancement, which is noteworthy given the prevalence of carbon-enhanced metal-poor stars without s-process enhancement (CEMP-no) in the Galaxy at similarly low metallicities. Our compilation of literature data shows that the fraction of CEMP-no stars in dSph galaxies is significantly lower than in the Milky Way, and than in ultra-faint dwarf galaxies. Furthermore, we report the discovery of the lowest metallicity, [Fe/H]=$-2.92$, r-process rich (r-I) star in a dSph galaxy. This star, fnx_06_019, has $\rm[Eu/Fe]=+0.8$, and also shows enhancement of La, Nd, and Dy, $\rm[X/Fe]&gt;+0.5$. Our new data in Carina and Fornax help populate the extremely low metallicity range in dSph galaxies, and add to the evidence of a low fraction of CEMP-no stars in these systems.</description>

Abstract: Continuous gravitational waves (CGWs) from various astrophysical sources are one of the many future probes of upcoming Gravitational Wave (GW) search missions. Neutron stars (NSs) with deformity are one of the leading sources of CGW emissions. In this work, for the first time, a novel attempt to estimate the dark matter (DM) capture rate is performed using CGW as the probe to the local NS population. Competitive bounds on DM capture from the local NS population are reported when compared with DM direct search experiments and other astrophysical observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02930v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform numerical magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of the gravitational collapse and fragmentation of a cylindrical molecular cloud with the help of the FLASH code. The cloud collapses rapidly along its radius without any signs of fragmentation in the simulations without magnetic field. The radial collapse of the cloud is stopped by the magnetic pressure gradient in the simulations with parallel magnetic field. Cores with high density form at the cloud ends during further evolution. The core densities are $n \approx 1.7 \cdot 10^{8}$ and $2 \cdot 10^{7}$ cm$^{-3}$ in the cases with initial magnetic field strengths $B = 1.9 \cdot 10^{-4}$ and $6 \cdot 10^{-4}$ G, respectively. The cores move toward the cloud center with supersonic speeds $|v_{z}|=3.6$ and $5.3$ km$\cdot$s$^{-1}$. The sizes of the cores along the filaments radius and filament main axis are $d_{r} = 0.0075$ pc and $d_{z} = 0.025$ pc, $d_{r} = 0.03$ pc and $d_{z} = 0.025$ pc, respectively. The masses of the cores increase during the filament evolution and lie in range of $\approx 10-20\,M_\odot$. According to our results, the cores observed at the edges of molecular filaments can be a result of the filament evolution with parallel magnetic field.</description>
