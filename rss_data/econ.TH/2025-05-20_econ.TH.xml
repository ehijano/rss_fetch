      <title>Reputational cheap talk versus prior information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I study a setting where a sender communicates her information about a hidden state with a receiver who wants to match his action with that state. The sender strives to appear informed at the receiver's expense. I characterize the receiver's tradeoff between relying on the sender or on prior information about the state when picking his action in all informative equilibria. I show that the receiver relies only on prior information, irrespective of how informed the sender may be, if and only if prior information is neither sufficiently noisy nor sufficiently informative. My results highlight a complementarity that informative prior information facilitates high-quality communication under reputation concern.</description>

      <title>On the existence of stable contract systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1962, Gale and Shapley \cite{GS} introduced the concept of stable marriages and proved their existence. Since then, the statement of the stability problem has been highly generalized. And a lot of proofs has emerged for the existence in these more general statements. It's time to review them and identify the similarities and differences. First, we will briefly discuss the classical case, because the existence proofs in the general case grew out of it. Or rather, from the idea of "deferred acceptance". When the best of the proposed contracts is temporarily retained until a better offer is received.</description>

      <title>Lexicographic Preferences over Random Availability Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide an axiomatic characterization of lexicographic preferences over the set of all random availability functions using two assumptions. The first assumption is strong monotonicity, which in our framework is equivalent to the strong dominance property in microeconomics. The second assumption is independence of worse alternatives and we show that a weaker version of the same suffices for our purpose.</description>

      <title>An Attentional Model of Time Discounting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When decision makers evaluate a sequence of rewards, they may pay more attention to larger rewards and, given attention is limited, less attention to smaller rewards. They may also become less attentive to each reward when attention is spread over a longer period of time. Such reductions in attention could lead to greater discounting of the rewards' values. This paper introduces a novel theory of time discounting based on these assumptions. The resulting discount factors in the theory follow a distribution similar to the multinomial logit function. We characterize such discount factors using two approaches: one based on information maximizing exploration and the other based on the optimal discounting framework. The theory can explain a wide range of anomalies, including the hidden-zero effect, S-shaped value function, and intertemporal correlation aversion. Also, it specifies new mediators for some well-known psychological effects, such as the common difference effect, risk aversion over time lotteries, and the present bias.</description>

      <title>Endogenous clustering and analogy-based expectation equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Normal-form two-player games are categorized by players into K analogy classes so as to minimize the prediction error about the behavior of the opponent. This results in Clustered Analogy-Based Expectation Equilibria in which strategies are analogy-based expectation equilibria given the analogy partitions and analogy partitions minimize the prediction errors given the strategies. We distinguish between environments with self-repelling analogy partitions in which some mixing over partitions is required and environments with self-attractive partitions in which several analogy partitions can arise, thereby suggesting new channels of belief heterogeneity and equilibrium multiplicity. Various economic applications are discussed.</description>

      <title>Exploring Correlation Patterns in the Ethereum Validator Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There have been several studies into measuring the level of decentralization in Ethereum through applying various indices to indicate the relative dominance of entities in different domains in the ecosystem. However, these indices do not capture any correlation between those different entities, that could potentially make them the subject of external coercion, or covert collusion. We propose an index that measures the relative dominance of entities based on the application of correlation factors. We posit that this approach produces a more nuanced and accurate index of decentralization.</description>

      <title>Geometric Formalization of First-Order Stochastic Dominance in $N$ Dimensions: A Tractable Path to Multi-Dimensional Economic Decision Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces and formally verifies a novel geometric framework for first-order stochastic dominance (FSD) in $N$ dimensions using the Lean 4 theorem prover. Traditional analytical approaches to multi-dimensional stochastic dominance rely heavily on complex measure theory and multivariate calculus, creating significant barriers to formalization in proof assistants. Our geometric approach characterizes $N$-dimensional FSD through direct comparison of survival probabilities in upper-right orthants, bypassing the need for complex integration theory. We formalize key definitions and prove the equivalence between traditional FSD requirements and our geometric characterization. This approach achieves a more tractable and intuitive path to formal verification while maintaining mathematical rigor. We demonstrate how this framework directly enables formal analysis of multi-dimensional economic problems in portfolio selection, risk management, and welfare analysis. The work establishes a foundation for further development of verified decision-making tools in economics and finance, particularly for high-stakes domains requiring rigorous guarantees.</description>

      <title>Identifying the Distribution of Welfare from Discrete Choice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.02645v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Empirical welfare analyses often impose stringent parametric assumptions on individuals' preferences and neglect unobserved preference heterogeneity. We develop a framework to conduct individual and social welfare analysis for discrete choice that does not suffer from these drawbacks. We first adapt the class of individual welfare measures introduced by Fleurbaey (2009) to settings where individual choice is discrete. Allowing for unrestricted, unobserved preference heterogeneity, these measures become random variables. We then demonstrate that their distribution can be derived from choice probabilities, which can be estimated nonparametrically from cross-sectional data. Additionally, we derive nonparametric results for the joint distribution of welfare and welfare differences, and for social welfare. The former is an important tool in determining whether the winners of a price change belong disproportionately to those groups who were initially well-off.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19831v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Deferred Acceptance (DA) mechanism can generate inefficient placements. Although Pareto-dominant mechanisms exist, it remains unclear which and how many students could improve. We characterize the set of unimprovable students and show that it includes those unassigned or matched with their least preferred schools. Nevertheless, by proving that DA's envy digraph contains a unique giant strongly connected component, we establish that almost all students are improvable, and furthermore, they can benefit simultaneously via disjoint trading cycles. Our findings reveal the pervasiveness of DA's inefficiency and the remarkable effectiveness of Pareto-dominant mechanisms in addressing it, regardless of the specific mechanism chosen.</description>

      <title>Commitment and Randomization in Communication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17503v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When does Sender, in a Sender-Receiver game, strictly value commitment? In a setting with finitely many actions and states, we establish that, generically, commitment has no value if and only if a partitional experiment is optimal. Moreover, if Sender's preferred cheap-talk equilibrium necessarily involves randomization, then Sender values commitment. Our results imply that if a school values commitment to a grading policy, then the school necessarily prefers to grade unfairly. We also ask: for what share of preference profiles does commitment have no value? For any state space, if there are $\left|A\right|$ actions, the share is at least $\frac{1}{\left|A\right|^{\left|A\right|}}$. As the number of states grows large, the share converges precisely to $\frac{1}{\left|A\right|^{\left|A\right|}}$.</description>

      <title>Locational Energy Storage Bid Bounds for Facilitating Social Welfare Convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18598v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel method to generate bid bounds that can serve as offer caps for energy storage in electricity markets to help reduce system costs and regulate potential market power exercises. We derive the bid bounds based on a tractable multi-period economic dispatch chance-constrained formulation that systematically incorporates the uncertainty and risk preference of the system operator. The key analytical results verify that the bounds effectively cap storage bids across all uncertainty scenarios with a guaranteed confidence level. We show that bid bounds decrease as the state of charge increases but rise with greater netload uncertainty and risk preference. We test the effectiveness of the proposed pricing mechanism based on the 8-bus ISO-NE test system, including agent-based storage bidding models. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed bid bounds effectively align storage bids with the social welfare objective and outperform existing deterministic bid bounds. Under 30% renewable capacity and 20% storage capacity, the bid bounds contribute to an average reduction of 0.17\% in system cost, while increasing storage profit by an average of 10.16% across various system uncertainty scenarios and bidding strategies. These benefits scale up with increased storage economic withholding and storage capacity.</description>

      <title>(Im)possibility of Collective Intelligence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.02786v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern applications of AI involve training and deploying machine learning models across heterogeneous and potentially massive environments. Emerging diversity of data not only brings about new possibilities to advance AI systems, but also restricts the extent to which information can be shared across environments due to pressing concerns such as privacy, security, and equity. Based on a novel characterization of learning algorithms as choice correspondences on a hypothesis space, this work provides a minimum requirement in terms of intuitive and reasonable axioms under which the only rational learning algorithm in heterogeneous environments is an empirical risk minimization (ERM) that unilaterally learns from a single environment without information sharing across environments. Our (im)possibility result underscores the fundamental trade-off that any algorithms will face in order to achieve Collective Intelligence (CI), i.e., the ability to learn across heterogeneous environments. Ultimately, collective learning in heterogeneous environments are inherently hard because, in critical areas of machine learning such as out-of-distribution generalization, federated/collaborative learning, algorithmic fairness, and multi-modal learning, it can be infeasible to make meaningful comparisons of model predictive performance across environments.</description>

      <title>Distorted optimal transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.11238v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Classic optimal transport theory is formulated through minimizing the expected transport cost between two given distributions. We propose the framework of distorted optimal transport by minimizing a distorted expected cost, which is the cost under a non-linear expectation. This new formulation is motivated by concrete problems in decision theory, robust optimization, and risk management, and it has many distinct features compared to the classic theory. We choose simple cost functions and study different distortion functions and their implications on the optimal transport plan. We show that on the real line, the comonotonic coupling is optimal for the distorted optimal transport problem when the distortion function is convex and the cost function is submodular and monotone. Some forms of duality and uniqueness results are provided. For inverse-S-shaped distortion functions and linear cost, we obtain the unique form of optimal coupling for all marginal distributions, which turns out to have an interesting ``first comonotonic, then counter-monotonic" dependence structure; for S-shaped distortion functions a similar structure is obtained. Our results highlight several challenges and features in distorted optimal transport, offering a new mathematical bridge between the fields of probability, decision theory, and risk management.</description>
