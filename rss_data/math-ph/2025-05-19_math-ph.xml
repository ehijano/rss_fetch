      <title>On soliton asymptotics for 2D Maxwell-Lorentz equations with rotating particle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider 2D Maxwell-Lorentz equations with extended charged rotating particle. The system admits solitons which are solutions corresponding to a particle moving with a constant velocity and rotating with a constant angular velocity. Our main result is asymptotic stability of the solitons.</description>

      <title>Self-similar renormalization for nonlinear problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new method, called the method of self-similar approximants, and its recent developments are described. The method is based on the ideas of renormalization group theory and optimal control theory. It allows for the effective extrapolation of asymptotic series in powers of small variables to the finite and even to infinite variables. The approach is proved to be regular. It is illustrated by several examples demonstrating good agreement with numerical calculations. The method is shown to provide accurate approximate solutions to complex nonlinear problems. In some cases, the method allows for the reconstruction of exact solutions on the basis of rather short perturbative series.</description>

      <title>Spectral moments of complex and symplectic non-Hermitian random matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study non-Hermitian random matrices belonging to the symmetry classes of the complex and symplectic Ginibre ensemble, and present a unifying and systematic framework for analysing mixed spectral moments involving both holomorphic and anti-holomorphic parts. For weight functions that induce a recurrence relation of the associated planar orthogonal polynomials, we derive explicit formulas for the spectral moments in terms of their orthogonal norms. This includes exactly solvable models such as the elliptic Ginibre ensemble and non-Hermitian Wishart matrices. In particular, we show that the holomorphic spectral moments of complex non-Hermitian random matrices coincide with those of their Hermitian limit up to a multiplicative constant, determined by the non-Hermiticity parameter. Moreover, we show that the spectral moments of the symplectic non-Hermitian ensemble admit a decomposition into two parts: one corresponding to the complex ensemble and the other constituting an explicit correction term. This structure closely parallels that found in the Hermitian setting, which naturally arises as the Hermitian limit of our results. Within this general framework, we perform a large-$N$ asymptotic analysis of the spectral moments for the elliptic Ginibre and non-Hermitian Wishart ensemble, revealing the mixed moments of the elliptic and non-Hermitian Marchenko--Pastur laws. Furthermore, for the elliptic Ginibre ensemble, we employ a recently developed differential operator method for the associated correlation kernel, to derive an alternative explicit formula for the spectral moments and obtain their genus-type large-$N$ expansion.</description>

      <title>Existence of Friedrich-Wintgen Bound States in the Continuum: Cavity with a Thin Waveguide Opening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bound states in the continuum (BICs) are localized states embedded within a continuum of propagating waves. Perturbations that disrupt BICs typically induce ultra-strong resonances, a phenomenon enabling diverse applications in photonics. This work investigates the existence of BICs in two-dimensional electromagnetic cavities coupled to thin waveguides for H-polarized waves. Our focus is on Friedrich-Wintgen BICs (FW-BICs), which arise from destructive interference between two resonant modes and were identified numerically in rectangular cavities with waveguide openings by Lyapina et al. [J. Fluid Mech., 780 (2015), pp. 370--387]. Here, we rigorously establish the existence of FW-BICs in a broader class of cavity geometries by introducing perturbations to the refractive index under regularity constraints. We show that BICs correspond to intersections of two curves derived implicitly from the governing equations constructed via the mode-matching method. Crucially, we prove that such intersections are guaranteed for sufficiently small waveguide widths, provided that two eigenvalues of the cavity cross and the associated eigenfunctions exhibit non-vanishing coupling to the radiation channel at the cavity-waveguide interface. Furthermore, our approach remains applicable for studying the emergence of FW-BICs under parameter-dependent boundary perturbations to the cavity.</description>

      <title>Spectral Decomposition of Euler-Mellin Integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the spectral decomposition of singularities of integrals and their integrands. Our results apply to any integral of Euler-Mellin type, and thus especially to every scalar Feynman integral. Specifically we provide for both the integrand and integral respectively; two explicit constructions of the characteristic variety and characteristic cycle of the constructible function and $D$-module they are associated with. From this we also obtain the singular locus or Landau singularities of the integral. En route we give a simple procedure to compute the local Euler obstruction function of a variety, and using this, to compute the Euler characteristic of the complex link of a Whitney stratum.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic analysis for a class of planar orthogonal polynomials on the unit disc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We carry out the asymptotic analysis as $n \to \infty$ of a class of orthogonal polynomials $p_{n}(z)$ of degree $n$, defined with respect to the planar measure \begin{equation*} d\mu(z) = (1-|z|^{2})^{\alpha-1}|z-x|^{\gamma}\mathbf{1}_{|z| &lt; 1}d^{2}z, \end{equation*} where $d^{2}z$ is the two dimensional area measure, $\alpha$ is a parameter that can grow with $n$, while $\gamma&gt;-2$ and $x&gt;0$ are fixed. This measure arises naturally in the study of characteristic polynomials of non-Hermitian ensembles and generalises the example of a Gaussian weight that was recently studied by several authors. We obtain asymptotics in all regions of the complex plane and via an appropriate differential identity, we obtain the asymptotic expansion of the partition function. The main approach is to convert the planar orthogonality to one defined on suitable contours in the complex plane. Then the asymptotic analysis is performed using the Deift-Zhou steepest descent method for the associated Riemann-Hilbert problem.</description>

      <title>Spin-weighted spherical harmonics as total angular momentum eigenstates for massless particles and their role in obstructing spin-orbital decompositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that for massless particles of helicity $h$, the angular momentum eigenstates are given in an appropriate coordinate system by the spin-weighted spherical harmonics ${_{-h}Y_{jm}}$ of spin-weight $-h$. In particular, these are simultaneous eigenstates of the Hamiltonian, helicity, $J^2$, and $J_z$. The appearance of the spin-weighted spherical harmonics as opposed to the ordinary spherical harmonics reflects the nontrivial topological structure of massless particles with nonzero helicity. The resultant angular momentum multiplet structure is quite different than that of massive particles, with $|h|$ acting as a lower bound on $J^2$ and at most one multiplet for each angular momentum $j$. This illustrates the obstruction to a spin-orbital decomposition of the angular momentum for massless particles, as such a sparse multiplet structure does not result from any reasonable spin-orbital splitting.</description>

      <title>The Flea on the Magnetic Elephant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a two-dimensional magnetic Laplacian with two radially symmetric magnetic wells. Its spectral properties are determined by the tunneling between them. If the tunneling is weak and the wells are mirror symmetric, the two lowest eigenfunctions are localized in both wells being distributed roughly equally. In this note we show that an exponentially small symmetry violation can in this situation have a dramatic effect, making each of the eigenfunctions localized dominantly in one well only. This is reminiscent of the `flea on the elephant' effect for Schr\"odinger operators; our result shows that it has a purely magnetic counterpart.</description>

      <title>On the superintegrability of the Gaussian $\beta$ ensemble and its $(q,t)$ generalisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present context, superintegrability is a property of certain probability density functions coming from matrix models, which relates to the average over a distinguished basis of symmetric functions, typically the Jack or Macdonald polynomials. It states that the average can be computed according a certain combination of those same polynomials, now specialised by specific substitutions when expressed in terms of the power sum basis. For a particular $(q,t)$ generalisation of the Gaussian $\beta$ ensemble from random matrix theory, known independently from the consideration of certain integrable gauge theories, we use results developed in a theory of multivariable Al-Salam and Carlitz polynomials based on Macdonald polynomials to prove the superintegrability identity. This then is used to deduce a duality formula for these same averages, which in turn allows for a derivation of a functional equation for the spectral moments.</description>

      <title>On the mean-field limit of Vlasov-Poisson-Fokker-Planck equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The derivation of effective descriptions for interacting many-body systems is an important branch of applied mathematics. We prove a propagation of chaos result for a system of $N$ particles subject to Newtonian time evolution with or without additional white noise influencing the velocities of the particles. We assume that the particles interact according to a regularized Coulomb-interaction with a regularization parameter that vanishes in the $N\to\infty$ limit. The respective effective description is the so called Vlasov-Poisson-Fokker-Planck (VPFP), respectively the Vlasov-Poisson (VP) equation in the case of no or sub-dominant white noise. To obtain our result we combine the relative entropy method from \cite{jabinWang2016} with the control on the difference between the trajectories of the true and the effective description provided in \cite{HLP20} for the VPFP case respectively in \cite{LP} for the VP case. This allows us to prove strong convergence of the marginals, i.e. convergence in $L^1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the dynamics of systems of lattice bosons with infinitely many degrees of freedom. We show that their dynamics defines a group of automorphisms on a $C^*$--algebra introduced by Buchholz, which extends the resolvent algebra of local field operators. For states that admit uniform bounds on moments of the local particle number, we derive propagation bounds of Lieb--Robinson type. Using these bounds, we show that the dynamics of local observables gives rise to a strongly continuous unitary group in the GNS representation. Moreover, accumulation points of finite-volume Gibbs states satisfy the KMS condition with respect to this group. This, in particular, proves the existence of KMS states.</description>

      <title>Multiple-Order Tensor Field Theory: Enumeration of unitary invariant observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Tensor Field Theory (TFT), observables are defined through tensor field contractions that produce unitary invariants for complex-valued tensor fields. Traditionally, these observables are constructed using tensor fields of a fixed order $d$. Here, we propose an extended theoretical framework for TFT that incorporates tensor fields of varying orders $d'$, satisfying $d' \leq d$. We then establish a comprehensive group-theoretic formalism that enables the systematic enumeration of these complex TFT observables. This approach encompasses existing counting methods and therefore recovers known results in specific limiting cases. Additionally, we provide computational tools to facilitate the enumeration of these invariants, unveiling novel integer sequences that have not been documented elsewhere.</description>

      <title>Principal 3-Bundles with Adjusted Connections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the notion of adjusted connection for principal 3-bundles. We first derive the explicit form of an adjustment datum for 3-term $L_\infty$-algebras, which allows us to give a local description of such adjusted connections and their infinitesimal symmetries. We then introduce the notion of an adjusted 2-crossed module of Lie groups and provide the explicit global description of principal 3-bundles with adjusted connections in terms of differential cocycles. These connections appear in a number of context within high-energy physics, and we list local examples arising in gauged supergravity and a global example arising in various contexts in string/M-theory. Our primary motivation, however, stems from U-duality, and we define a notion of categorified torus that forms an adjusted 2-crossed module, which we hope to be useful in lifting T-duality to M-theory.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Geometric Invariants in the Asymptotically Hyperboloidal Setting: Energy and Linear Momentum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12927v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the evolution of geometric invariants, as defined by Michel \cite{Michel}, in the context of asymptotically hyperboloidal initial data sets. Our focus lies on the charges of energy and linear momentum, and we study their behavior under the Einstein evolution equations. We construct foliations describing the evolution of asymptotically hyperboloidal initial data sets using hyperboloidal time function. We define E-P chargeability as a property of the initial data set, and we show that it is preserved under the evolution for our choice of time function. This ensures that the charges are well-defined along the evolution, which is crucial for our approach. Along such foliations, we recover the same energy-loss and linear momentum-loss formulae as those derived by Bondi, Sachs, and Metzner \cite{Bondi-vanderBurg-Metzner} while operating under weaker asymptotic assumptions. Our approach is distinct from previous work as we do not utilize conformal compactifications and work directly at the level of the initial data set.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a topos of quantum sets and embed into it the classical topos of sets. We show that the internal logic of the topos of sets, when interpreted in the topos of quantum sets, provides the Birkhoff-von Neumann quantum propositional calculus of idempotents in a canonical internal commutative algebra of the topos of quantum sets. We extend this construction by allowing the quantum counterpart of Boolean algebras of classical truth values which we introduce and study in detail. We realize expected values of observables in quantum states in our topos of quantum sets as a tautological morphism from the canonical internal commutative algebra to a canonical internal object of affine functions on quantum states. We show also that in our topos of quantum sets one can speak about quantum quivers in the sense of Day-Street and Chikhladze. Finally, we provide a categorical derivation of the Leavitt path algebra of such a quantum quiver and relate it to the category of stable representations of the quiver. It is based on a categorification of the Cuntz-Pimsner algebra in the context of functor adjunctions replacing the customary use of Hilbert modules.</description>

      <title>Identifying convex obstacles from backscattering far field data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recovery of anomalies from backscattering far field data is a long-standing open problem in inverse scattering theory. We make a first step in this direction by establishing the unique identifiability of convex impenetrable obstacles from backscattering far field measurements. Specifically, we prove that both the boundary and the boundary conditions of the convex obstacle are uniquely determined by the far field pattern measured in backscattering directions for all frequencies. The key tool is Majda's asymptotic estimate of the far field patterns in the high-frequency regime. Furthermore, we introduce a fast and stable numerical algorithm for reconstructing the boundary and computing the boundary condition. A key feature of the algorithm is that the boundary condition can be computed even if the boundary is not known, and vice versa. Numerical experiments demonstrate the validity and robustness of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>An Integration--Annihilator method for analytical solutions of Partial Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel method to derive particular solutions for partial differential equations of the form $(\operatorname{A} + \operatorname{B})^k Q(x) = q(x)$, with $\operatorname{A}$ and $\operatorname{B}$ being linear differential operators with constant coefficients, $k$ an integer, and $Q$ and $q$ sufficiently smooth functions. The approach requires that a function $W$ and an integer $\lambda$ can be found with the following two conditions: $q$ can be integrated with respect to $\operatorname{A}$ such that $\operatorname{A}^{\lambda + k} W(x) = q(x)$, and $\operatorname{B}^{\lambda + 1}$ annihilates $W$ such that $\operatorname{B}^{\lambda + 1} W(x) = 0$.
  Applications include the Poisson equation $\Delta Q(x) = q(x)$, the inhomogeneous polyharmonic equation $\Delta^k Q(x) = q(x)$, the Helmholtz equation $(\Delta + \nu) Q(x) = q(x)$ and the wave equation $\Box Q(x) = q(x)$. We show how solving the Poisson equation allows to derive the Helmholtz decomposition that splits a sufficiently smooth vector field into a gradient field and a divergence-free rotation field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study isentropic fluid flows of gases of the Forchheimer-type in heterogeneous porous media. The governing equation is a doubly nonlinear parabolic equation with coefficients depending on the spatial variables. Its solutions are subject to a nonlinear Robin boundary condition. We establish the estimates of the solutions for short time in terms of the initial and boundary data. For the proof, the multi-weight versions of the Sobolev inequality, parabolic Sobolev inequality and trace theorem are derived. They are then used to implement the Moser iteration for suitable weighted norms.</description>

      <title>Delocalization of random band matrices at the edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider $N\times N$ Hermitian random band matrices $H=(H_{xy})$, whose entries are centered complex Gaussian random variables. The indices $x,y$ range over the $d$-dimensional discrete torus $(\mathbb Z/L\mathbb Z)^d$ with $d\in \{1,2\}$ and $N=L^d$. The variance profile $S_{xy}=\mathbb E|h_{xy}|^2$ exhibits a banded structure: $S_{xy}=0$ if the distance $|x-y|$ exceeds a band width parameter $W\le L$. Let $W=L^\alpha$ for some exponent $0&lt;\alpha\le 1$. We show that as $\alpha$ increases from $\mathbf 1_{d=1}/2$ to $1-d/6$, the range of energies corresponding to delocalized eigenvectors gradually expands from the bulk toward the entire spectrum. More precisely, we prove that eigenvectors associated with energies $E$ satisfying $2 - |E| \gg N^{-c_{d,\alpha}}$ are delocalized, where the exponent $c_{d,\alpha}$ is given by $c_{d,\alpha} = 2\alpha - 1$ in dimension 1 and $c_{d,\alpha} = \alpha$ in dimension 2. Furthermore, when $\alpha &gt; 1-d/6$, all eigenvectors of $H$ become delocalized. In this regime, we also establish quantum unique ergodicity for all eigenvectors, along with a rigidity estimate for eigenvalues. Our findings extend previous results -- established in the bulk regime for one-dimensional (1D) (arXiv:2501.01718) and two-dimensional (2D) (arXiv:2503.07606) random band matrices -- to the entire spectrum, particularly near the spectral edges. They also complement the results of arXiv:0906.4047 and arXiv:2401.00492, which concern the edge eigenvalue statistics for 1D and 2D random band matrices.</description>

      <title>Integrability and exact large deviations of the weakly-asymmetric exclusion process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The weakly asymmetric exclusion process (WASEP) in one dimension is a paradigmatic system of interacting particles described by the macroscopic fluctuation theory (MFT) in the presence of driving. We consider an initial condition with densities $\rho_1,\rho_2$ on either side of the origin, so that for $\rho_1=\rho_2$ the gas is stationary. Starting from the microscopic description, we obtain exact formulae for the cumulant generating functions, and large deviation rate functions of the time-integrated current and the position of a tracer. As the asymmetry/driving is increased, these describe the crossover between the symmetric exclusion process (SSEP) and the weak noise regime of the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation: we recover the two limits and describe the crossover from the WASEP cubic tail to the $5/2$ and $3/2$ KPZ tail exponents. Finally, we show that the MFT of the WASEP is classically integrable, by exhibiting the explicit Lax pairs, which are obtained through a novel mapping between the MFT of the WASEP and a complex extension of the classical anisotropic Landau-Lifshitz spin chain. This shows integrability of all MFTs of asymmetric models with quadratic mobility as well as their dual versions.</description>

      <title>Neural Thermodynamics I: Entropic Forces in Deep and Universal Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rapid discovery of emergent phenomena in deep learning and large language models, explaining and understanding their cause has become an urgent need. Here, we propose a rigorous entropic-force theory for understanding the learning dynamics of neural networks trained with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and its variants. Building on the theory of parameter symmetries and an entropic loss landscape, we show that representation learning is crucially governed by emergent entropic forces arising from stochasticity and discrete-time updates. These forces systematically break continuous parameter symmetries and preserve discrete ones, leading to a series of gradient balance phenomena that resemble the equipartition property of thermal systems. These phenomena, in turn, (a) explain the universal alignment of neural representations between AI models and lead to a proof of the Platonic Representation Hypothesis, and (b) reconcile the seemingly contradictory observations of sharpness- and flatness-seeking behavior of deep learning optimization. Our theory and experiments demonstrate that a combination of entropic forces and symmetry breaking is key to understanding emergent phenomena in deep learning.</description>

      <title>Bursty Switching Dynamics Promotes the Collapse of Network Topologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time-varying connections are crucial in understanding the structures and dynamics of complex networks. In this paper, we propose a continuous-time switching topology model for temporal networks that is driven by bursty behavior and study the effects on network structure and dynamic processes. Each edge can switch between an active and a dormant state, leading to intermittent activation patterns that are characterized by a renewal process. We analyze the stationarity of the network activation scale and emerging degree distributions by means of the Markov chain theory. We show that switching dynamics can promote the collapse of network topologies by reducing heterogeneities and forming isolated components in the underlying network. Our results indicate that switching topologies can significantly influence random walks in different networks and promote cooperation in donation games. Our research thus provides a simple quantitative framework to study network dynamics with temporal and intermittent interactions across social and technological networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we consider the wave equation with a repulsive potential, either on the half line ${\mathbb R}^+$ or the Euclidean space ${\mathbb R}^d$ with $d\geq 3$. We combine the operator theory and the inward/outward energy theory to deduce a modified wave operator for repulsive potentials decaying like $|x|^{-\beta}$ with $\beta&gt;1/3$. In particular the regular wave operator without modification exists if $\beta&gt;1$. This implies that the asymptotic behaviour of finite-energy solutions to the wave equation $u_{tt} - \Delta u + |x|^{-\beta} u =0$ is similar to that of the solutions to the classic wave equation if $\beta \in (1,2)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we reconsider the study of five-dimensional supersymmetric black branes in the context of the M-theory compactification on a special Calabi-Yau manifold called tetra-quadric, being realized as complete intersections of homogenous polynomials in the projective space $ \mathbb{CP}^{1}\times\mathbb{CP}^{1}\times\mathbb{CP}^{1}\times\mathbb{CP}^{1}$. Combining colored graph theory and outer-automorphism group action techniques, we approach the tetra-quadric Calabi-Yau diagram leading to new features. Using a procedure referred to as folding, we show that M-theory black branes on the tetra-quadric Calabi-Yau manifold can be reduced to known compactifications with lower dimensional K\"{a}hler moduli spaces.</description>

      <title>Stark Energy Shifts due to Quantum Gravity in RGUP Algebra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the Stark effect in the hydrogen atom under an external electric field, incorporating relativistic generalized uncertainty principle (RGUP) corrections within Minkowskian spacetime and calculate the upper bound on $\beta$ the RGUP parameter. Employing RGUP algebra and the Stetsko-Tkachuk approximation, we derive modifications to the energy spectrum for degenerate and non-degenerate states. The perturbed Hamiltonian, modified by RGUP, enfold quantum gravitational effects. Our results reveal quantum gravitational corrections to the Stark energy spectrum in the relativistic regime, with energy shifts for non-degenerate ($n=1$) and degenerate ($n \neq 1$) cases showing additional terms proportional to $\beta$. These findings reduce to standard Stark effect results and non-relativistic GUP frameworks in the limits $\beta\rightarrow 0$ and $c \rightarrow \infty $, establishing our model as a generalized framework for analyzing minimal length effects in relativistic quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Persistence of integrable wave dynamics in the Discrete Gross--Pitaevskii equation: the focusing case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Expanding upon our prior findings on the proximity of dynamics between integrable and non-integrable systems within the framework of nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations, we examine this phenomenon for the focusing Discrete Gross-Pitaevskii equation in comparison to the Ablowitz-Ladik lattice. The presence of the harmonic trap necessitates the study of the Ablowitz-Ladik lattice in weighted spaces. We establish estimates for the distance between solutions in the suitable metric, providing a comprehensive description of the potential evolution of this distance for general initial data. These results apply to a broad class of nonlinear Schr\"odinger models, including both discrete and partial differential equations. For the Discrete Gross-Pitaevskii equation, they guarantee the long-term persistence of small-amplitude bright solitons, driven by the analytical solution of the AL lattice, especially in the presence of a weak harmonic trap. Numerical simulations confirm the theoretical predictions about the proximity of dynamics between the systems over long times. They also reveal that the soliton exhibits remarkable robustness, even as the effects of the weak harmonic trap become increasingly significant, leading to the soliton's curved orbit.</description>

      <title>Repeated quantum backflow and overflow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum backflow is a surprising phenomenon in which a quantum particle, moving in one dimension and with a state of rightwards momentum, can exhibit a net probability transfer to the left-hand half-line over a finite time interval. We generalise the setting of quantum backflow to allow for $M$ disjoint time intervals, considering the sum of probability differences for each interval. In classical statistical particle mechanics, the total backflow lies in the interval $[-1,0]$ for all $M$, indicating rightwards probability transfer. By contrast, we show that, in quantum mechanics, the maximum $M$-fold backflow is positive and unbounded from above as $M$ increases, demonstrating that there are states that exhibit repeated periods of backflow.
  Moreover, for $M\ge 2$, we discover a new phenomenon; namely, that there are states whose total backflow is below $-1$, giving a probability transfer to the right-hand half-line beyond that possible in classical statistical particle mechanics. We call this effect "quantum overflow". The maximum extent of the backflow and overflow effects is described by a hierarchy of backflow and overflow functions and constants, where the $M$'th backflow (overflow) constant is the supremum (infimum) of the $M$'th backflow (overflow) function. The $M=1$ backflow constant was first identified by Bracken and Melloy.
  Our results are obtained by formulating the $M$-fold backflow problem in terms of the spectra of suitable bounded operators. Using this formulation, we also study limiting cases of the backflow and overflow functions, including cases in which two disjoint intervals merge. Our analytical results are supported by detailed numerical investigations. Among other things, by applying numerical acceleration methods, we obtain a new estimate of the Bracken-Melloy constant of $0.0384506$ which is slightly lower than the previously accepted value of $0.038452$.</description>

      <title>Singularity of the spectrum of typical minimal smooth area-preserving flows in any genus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider smooth flows preserving a smooth invariant measure, or, equivalently, locally Hamiltonian flows on compact orientable surfaces and show that almost every such locally Hamiltonian flow with only simple saddles has singular spectrum. Furthermore, we prove that almost every pair of such flows is spectrally disjoint. More in general, singularity of the spectrum and pairwise disjointness holds for special flows over a full measure set of interval exchange transformations under a roof with symmetric logarithmic singularities. The spectral result is proved using a criterion for singularity based on tightness of Birkhoff sums with exponential tails decay and the cancellations proved by the last author to prove absence of mixing in this class of flows, by showing that the latter can be combined with rigidity. Disjointness of pairs then follows by producing mixing times (for the second flow), using a new mechanism for shearing based on resonant rigidity times.</description>

Abstract: A graph is called bivalent or trivalent if there exists an eigenvector of the graph Laplacian composed from {-1,1} or {-1,0,1}, respectively. These bivalent and trivalent eigenvectors are important for engineering applications, in particular for vibrating systems. In this article, we determine the structure of bivalent and trivalent graphs in the following planar graph families: trees, unicyclic, bicyclic, and cactus.</description>

      <title>Brackets in multicontact geometry and multisymplectization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce a graded bracket of forms on multicontact manifolds. This bracket satisfies a graded Jacobi identity as well as two different versions of the Leibniz rule, one of them being a weak Leibniz rule, extending the well-known notions in contact geometry. In addition, we develop the multisymplectization of multicontact structures to relate these brackets to the ones present in multisymplectic geometry and obtain the field equations in an abstract context. The Jacobi bracket also permits to study the evolution of observables and study the dissipation phenomena, which we also address. Finally, we apply the results to classical dissipative field theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct the linear Poisson structure on the predual bundle of a Banach Lie algebroid. It is an alternative approach to the already known results on the linear sub-Poisson structure on the dual bundle. We also discuss the existence of queer Banach Lie algebroids. An example of a precotangent bundle is presented.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous diffusion in an harmonic potential: the role of the interpretation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion in heterogeneous energy and diffusivity landscapes is widespread in biological systems. However, solving the Langevin equation in such environments introduces ambiguity due to the interpretation parameter $\alpha$, which depends on the underlying physics and can take values in the range $0&lt;\alpha&lt;1$. The typical interpretations are It\^o ($\alpha=0$), Stratonovich ($\alpha=1/2$), and H\"anggi-Klimontovich ($\alpha=1$). Here, we analyse the motion of a particle in an harmonic potential -- modelled as an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process -- with diffusivity that varies in space. Our focus is on two-phase systems with a discontinuity in environmental properties at $x=0$. We derive the probability density of the particle position for the process, and consider two paradigmatic situations. In the first one, the damping coefficient remains constant, and fluctuation-dissipation relations are not satisfied. In the second one, these relations are enforced, leading to a position-dependent damping coefficient. In both cases, we provide solutions as a function of the interpretation parameter $\alpha$, with particular attention to the It\^o, Stratonovich, and H\"anggi-Klimontovich interpretations, revealing fundamentally different behaviours, in particular with respect to an interface located at the potential minimum.</description>

      <title>The localization transition for the directed polymer in a random environment is smooth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When $d\ge 3$, the directed polymer a in random environment on $\mathbb Z^d$ is known to display a phase transition from a diffusive phase, known as \textit{weak disorder} to a localized phase, referred to as \textit{strong disorder}. This transition is encoded by the behavior of the the free energy of the model, defined by $$\mathfrak f(\beta):=\lim_{N\to \infty} (1/n)\log W^{\beta}_n$$ where $W^{\beta}_n$ is the normalized partition function for the directed polymer of length $n$. More precisely weak disorder corresponds to $\mathfrak f(\beta)=0$ and strong disorder to $\mathfrak f(\beta)&lt;0$. Monotonicity and continuity of $\mathfrak f$ implies that there exists $\beta_c\in [0,\infty]$ such that weak disorder is equivalent to $\beta\in [0,\beta_c]$. Furthermore $\beta_c&gt;0$ if and only if $d\ge 3$. We prove that this transition is infinitely smooth in the sense that $\mathfrak f$ grows slower than any power function at the vicinity of $\beta_c$, that is $$ \lim_{\beta \downarrow \beta_c }\frac{\log |\mathfrak f(\beta)|}{\log (\beta-\beta_c)}=\infty.$$</description>

      <title>A simple criterion for essential self-adjointness of Weyl pseudodifferential operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.07153v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a new criterion for the essential self-adjointness of pseudodifferential operators that does not involve ellipticity-type assumptions. For example, we show that self-adjointness holds in case the symbol is $C^{2d+3}$ with derivatives of order two and higher being uniformly bounded. These results also apply to hermitian operator-valued symbols on infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces, which are important to applications in physics. Our method relies on a phase space differential calculus for quadratic forms on $L^2(\mathbb{R}^d)$, Calder\'on-Vaillancourt type theorems, and a recent self-adjointness result for Toeplitz operators on the Segal-Bargmann space.</description>

      <title>Classical correspondence beyond the Ehrenfest time for open quantum systems with general Lindbladians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.05326v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum and classical systems evolving under the same formal Hamiltonian $H$ may dramatically differ after the Ehrenfest timescale $t_E \sim \log(\hbar^{-1})$, even as $\hbar \to 0$. Coupling the system to a Markovian environment results in a Lindblad equation for the quantum evolution. Its classical counterpart is given by the Fokker-Planck equation on phase space, which describes Hamiltonian flow with friction and diffusive noise. The quantum and classical evolutions may be compared via the Wigner-Weyl representation. Due to decoherence, they are conjectured to match closely for times far beyond the Ehrenfest timescale as $\hbar \to 0$. We prove a version of this correspondence, bounding the error between the quantum and classical evolutions for any sufficiently regular Hamiltonian $H(x,p)$ and Lindblad functions $L_k(x,p)$. The error is small when the strength of the diffusion $D$ associated to the Lindblad functions satisfies $D \gg \hbar^{4/3}$, which allows vanishing noise in the classical limit. Our method uses a time-dependent semiclassical mixture of variably squeezed Gaussian states. The states evolve according to a local harmonic approximation to the Lindblad dynamics. Both the exact quantum trajectory and its classical counterpart can be expressed as perturbations of this semiclassical mixture, with the errors bounded using Duhamel's principle. We present heuristic arguments suggesting the $4/3$ exponent is optimal and defines a boundary in the sense that asymptotically weaker diffusion permits a breakdown of quantum-classical correspondence at the Ehrenfest timescale. In a shorter companion paper, we treat the special case of Hamiltonians that decompose into kinetic and potential energy with linear Lindblad operators, with explicit bounds that can be applied directly to physical systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.19715v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The equations of motion of an isospin-carrying particle in a Yang-Mills and gravitational field were first proposed in 1968 by Kerner, who considered geodesics in a Kaluza-Klein-type framework. Two years later the flat space Kerner equations were completed by considering also the motion of the isospin by Wong, who used a field-theoretical approach. Their groundbreaking work was then followed by a long series of rediscoveries whose history is reviewed. The concept of isospin charge and the physical meaning of its motion are discussed. Conserved quantities are studied for Wu-Yang monopoles and for diatomic molecules by using van Holten's algorithm.</description>

Abstract: We study one- and two-dimensional periodic tight-binding models under the presence of a potential that grows to infinity in one direction, hence preventing the particles to escape in this direction (the soft wall). We prove that a spectral flow appears in these corresponding edge models, as the wall is shifted. We identity this flow as a number of Bloch bands, and provide a lower bound for the number of edge states appearing in such models.</description>

      <title>Overdamped QNM for Schwarzschild black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15924v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the number of quasinormal modes (QNM) for Schwarzschild and Schwarzschild-de Sitter black holes in a disc of radius $ r $ is bounded from below by $ c r^3 $. This shows that the recent upper bound by J\'ez\'equel is sharp. The argument is an application of a spectral asymptotics result for non-self-adjoint operators which provides a finer description of QNM and explains the emergence of a distorted lattice on which they lie. Our presentation gives a general result about exponentially accurate Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization rules for one dimensional problems. The description of QNM allows their accurate evaluation ``deep in the complex" where numerical methods break down due to pseudospectral effects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2004.02751v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the free motion of a massive particle moving in the background of a Finslerian deformation of a plane gravitational wave in Einstein's General Relativity. The deformation is a curved version of a one-parameter family of Relativistic Finsler structures introduced by Bogoslovsky, which are invariant under a certain deformation of Cohen and Glashow's Very Special Relativity group ISIM(2). The partially broken Carroll Symmetry we derive using Baldwin-Jeffery-Rosen coordinates allows us to integrate the geodesics equations. The transverse coordinates of timelike Finsler-geodesics are identical to those of the underlying plane gravitational wave for any value of the Bogoslovsky-Finsler parameter $b$. We then replace the underlying plane gravitational wave by a homogenous pp-wave solution of the Einstein-Maxwell equations. We conclude by extending the theory to the Finsler-Friedmann-Lemaitre model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2105.07374v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The method proposed by Inomata and his collaborators allows us to transform a damped Caldiroli-Kanai oscillator with time-dependent frequency to one with constant frequency and no friction by redefining the time variable, obtained by solving a Ermakov-Milne-Pinney equation. Their mapping ``Eisenhart-Duval'' lifts as a conformal transformation between two appropriate Bargmann spaces. The quantum propagator is calculated also by bringing the quadratic system to free form by another time-dependent Bargmann-conformal transformation which generalizes the one introduced before by Niederer and is related to the mapping proposed by Arnold. Our approach allows us to extend the Maslov phase correction to arbitrary time-dependent frequency. The method is illustrated by the Mathieu profile.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2112.09589v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent interest in the "memory effect" prompted us to revisit the relation of gravitational aves and oscillators. 50 years ago Niederer [1] found that an isotropic harmonic oscillator with a constant frequency can be mapped onto a free particle. Later Takagi [2] has shown that "time-dependent scaling" extends the oscillator versus free particle correspondence to a time-dependent frequency when the scale factor satisfies a Sturm-Liouville equation. More recently Gibbons [3] pointed out that time redefinition is conveniently studied in terms of the Schwarzian derivative. The oscillator versus free particle correspondence "Eisenhart-Duval lifts" to a conformal transformation between Bargmann spaces [4-7]. These methods are extended to spacetimes which are not conformally flat and have a time-dependent profile, and can then be applied to the geodesic motion in a plane gravitational wave.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.13717v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In closed quantum systems, wavepackets can spread exponentially in time due to chaos, forming long-range superpositions in just seconds for ordinary macroscopic systems. A weakly coupled environment is conjectured to decohere the system and restore the quantum-classical correspondence while necessarily introducing diffusive noise -- but at what coupling strength, and under which conditions? For Markovian open systems with Hamiltonians of the form $H = p^2/2m+V(x)$ and Hermitian linear Lindblad operators, we prove the quantum and classical evolutions are close whenever the strength of the environment-induced diffusion satisfies $D \gg (\hbar/s_H)^{4/3} D_H$, where $s_H$ and $D_H$ are characteristic action and diffusion scales that we define precisely using the classical Hamiltonian $H$. The bound applies for all observables and for times exponentially longer than the Ehrenfest timescale, which is when the correspondence can break down in closed systems. The strength of the diffusive noise can vanish in the classical limit to give the appearance of reversible dynamics. The $4/3$ exponent may be optimal, suggested by heuristic arguments and prior numerical evidence. Based on our bound, we give an efficient classical algorithm for simulating quantum Lindblad dynamics, which becomes provably accurate when the strength of environmental coupling exceeds the above threshold.</description>

Abstract: A special conformal transformation which carries a vacuum gravitational wave into another vacuum one is built by using M\"obius-redefined time. It can either transform a globally defined vacuum wave into a vacuum sandwich wave, or carry the gravitational wave into itself. The first type, illustrated by linearly and circularly polarized vacuum plane gravitational waves, permutes the symmetries and the geodesics. Our pp waves with conformal O(2,1) symmetry of the second type, which seem to ahve escaped attention so far, are anisotropic generalizations of the familiar inverse-square profile. An example inspired by molecular physics, for which the particle can escape, or perform periodic motion, or fall into the singularity is studied in detail.</description>

      <title>Schr\"odinger symmetry: a historical review</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.20316v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper reviews the history of the conformal extension of Galilean symmetry, now called Schr\"odinger symmetry. In the physics literature, its discovery is commonly attributed to Jackiw, Niederer and Hagen (1972). However, Schr\"odinger symmetry has a much older ancestry: the associated conserved quantities were known to Jacobi in 1842/43 and its euclidean counterpart was discovered by Sophus Lie in 1881 in his studies of the heat equation. A convenient way to study Schr\"odinger symmetry is provided by a non-relativistic Kaluza-Klein-type "Bargmann" framework, first proposed by Eisenhart (1929), but then forgotten and re-discovered by Duval {\it et al.} only in 1984. Representations of Schr\"odinger symmetry differ by the value $z=2$ of the dynamical exponent from the value $z=1$ found in representations of relativistic conformal invariance. For generic values of $z$, whole families of new algebras exist, which for $z=2/\ell$ include the $\ell$-conformal galilean algebras. We also review the non-relativistic limit of conformal algebras and that this limit leads to the $1$-conformal galilean algebra and not to the Schr\"odinger algebra. The latter can be recovered in the Bargmann framework through reduction. A distinctive feature of Galilean and Schr\"odinger symmetries are the Bargmann super-selection rules, algebraically related to a central extension. An empirical consequence of this was known as "mass conservation" already to Lavoisier. As an illustration of these concepts, some applications to physical ageing in simple model systems are reviewed.</description>

      <title>Precise large deviations through a uniform Tauberian theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04059v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive a large deviation principle for families of random variables in the basin of attraction of spectrally positive stable distributions by proving a uniform version of the Tauberian theorem for Laplace-Stieltjes transforms. The main advantage of this method is that it can be easily applied to cases that are beyond the reach of the techniques currently used in the literature. Notable examples include large deviations for random walks with long-ranged memory kernels, as well as for randomly stopped sums where the random time $N$ is either not concentrated around its expectation or has an infinite mean. The method reveals the role of the characteristic function when Cram\'er's condition is violated and provides a unified approach within regular variation.</description>

      <title>Bethe-ansatz diagonalization of steady state of boundary driven integrable spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09302v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We find that the density operator of non-equilibrium steady state (NESS) of XXZ spin chain with strong ``sink and source" boundary dissipation, can be described in terms of quasiparticles, with renormalized -- dissipatively dressed -- dispersion relation. The spectrum of the NESS is then fully accounted for by Bethe ansatz equations for an associated coherent system. The dissipative dressing generates an extra singularity in the dispersion relation, which strongly modifies the NESS spectrum with respect to the spectrum of the corresponding coherent model. In particular, this leads to a dissipation-assisted entropy reduction, due to the suppression -- in the NESS spectrum -- of plain wave-type Bethe states in favor of Bethe states localized at the boundaries.</description>

      <title>An Immersed Interface Method for Incompressible Flows and Geometries with Sharp Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16466v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The immersed interface method (IIM) for models of fluid flow and fluid-structure interaction imposes jump conditions that capture stress discontinuities generated by forces that are concentrated along immersed boundaries. Most prior work using the IIM for fluid dynamic applications has focused on smooth interfaces, but boundaries with sharp features such as corners and edges can appear in practical analyses, particularly on engineered structures. The present study builds on our work to integrate finite element-type representations of interface geometries with the IIM. Initial realizations of this approach used a continuous Galerkin (CG) finite element discretization for the boundary, but as we show herein, these approaches generate large errors near sharp geometrical features. To overcome this difficulty, this study introduces an IIM approach using discontinuous Galerkin (DG) representation of the jump conditions. Numerical examples explore the impacts of different interface representations on accuracy for both smooth and sharp boundaries, particularly flows interacting with fixed interface configurations. We demonstrate that using a DG approach provides accuracy that is comparable to the CG method for smooth cases. Further, we identify a time step size restriction for the CG representation that is directly related to the sharpness of the geometry. In contrast, time step size restrictions imposed by DG representations are demonstrated to be insensitive to the presence of sharp features.</description>

      <title>Closed real plane curves of hyperelliptic solutions of focusing gauged modified KdV equation of genus three</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18496v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The real and imaginary parts of the focusing modified Korteweg-de Vries (MKdV) equation defined over the complex field $\mathbb{C}$ give rise to the focusing gauged MKdV (FGMKdV) equations. As a generalization of Euler's elastica whose curvature obeys the focusing static MKdV (FSMKdV) equation, we study real plane curves whose curvature obeys the FGMKdV equation since the FSMKdV equation is a special case of the FGMKdV equation. In this paper, we focus on the hyperelliptic curves of genus three. By tuning some moduli parameters and initial conditions, we show closed real plane curves associated with the FGMKdV equation beyond Euler's figure-eight of elastica.</description>

      <title>Bethe/Gauge correspodence: a short review on an aspect of the integrability nature of supersymmetric gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21002v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we provide a short review (written in Chinese) on the Bethe/Gauge correspondence. We first explain the basic idea in an explicit example of the correspondence between XXX spin chains and 2d $\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ gauge theories. The connection between 4d and 2d will then be explored by comparing the instanton and vortex partition functions. We conclude this article by briefly mentioning the similarity in the integrability structure of 4d gauge theories and 2d ones from an algebraic aspect, and a potential relation between two different integrable systems.</description>

      <title>Multiple radial SLE(0) and classical Calogero-Sutherland System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21544v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this second of two articles, we study the multiple radial $\mathrm{SLE}(0)$ systems as the deterministic limits of the random multiple radial $\mathrm{SLE}(\kappa)$ systems. We construct the multiple radial SLE(0) systems from stationary relations by heuristically taking the limit of partition functions as $\kappa \rightarrow 0$. By constructing the field integrals of motion for the Loewner dynamics, we show that the traces of multiple radial SLE(0) systems are the horizontal trajectories of an equivalence class of quadratic differentials. These trajectories have limiting ends at the boundary points $\{z_1,z_2,\ldots,z_n\}$. The stationary relations connect the classification of multiple radial SLE(0) systems to the enumeration of critical points of the master function of trigonometric Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov (KZ) equations. In the deterministic case of $\kappa=0$, we show that the Loewner dynamics with a common parametrization of capacity form a special class of classical Calogero-Sutherland systems, restricted to a submanifold of phase space defined by the Lax matrix.</description>

      <title>Quantum Groups as Global Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24142v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study quantum field theories which have quantum groups as global internal symmetries. We show that in such theories operators are generically non-local, and should be thought as living at the ends of topological lines. We describe the general constraints of the quantum group symmetry, given by Ward identities, that correlation functions of the theory should satisfy. We also show that generators of the symmetry can be represented by topological lines with some novel properties. We then discuss a particular example of $U_q(sl_2)$ symmetric CFT, which we solve using the bootstrap techniques and relying on the symmetry. We finally show strong evidence that for a special value of $q$ a subsector of this theory reproduces the fermionic formulation of the Ising model. This suggests that a quantum group can act on local operators as well, however, it generically transforms them into non-local ones.</description>

      <title>Bethe Ansatz, Quantum Circuits, and the F-basis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02519v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Bethe Ansatz is a method for constructing exact eigenstates of quantum-integrable spin chains. Recently, deterministic quantum algorithms, referred to as "algebraic Bethe circuits", have been developed to prepare Bethe states for the spin-1/2 XXZ model. These circuits represent a unitary formulation of the standard algebraic Bethe Ansatz, expressed using matrix-product states that act on both the spin chain and an auxiliary space. In this work, we systematize these previous results, and show that algebraic Bethe circuits can be derived by a change of basis in the auxiliary space. The new basis, identical to the "F-basis" known from the theory of quantum-integrable models, generates the linear superposition of plane waves that is characteristic of the coordinate Bethe Ansatz. We explain this connection, highlighting that certain properties of the F-basis (namely, the exchange symmetry of the spins) are crucial for the construction of algebraic Bethe circuits. We demonstrate our approach by presenting new quantum circuits for the inhomogeneous spin-1/2 XXZ model.</description>

      <title>Strichartz estimates for the Schr\"odinger equation in high dimensional critical electromagnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02296v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove Strichartz estimates for the Schr\"odinger equation with scaling-critical electromagnetic potentials in dimensions $n\geq3$. The decay assumption on the magnetic potentials is critical, including the case of the Coulomb potential. Our approach introduces novel techniques, notably the construction of Schwartz kernels for the localized Schr\"odinger propagator, which separates the antipodal points of $\mathbb{S}^{n-1}$, in these scaling critical electromagnetic fields. This method enables us to prove the $L^1(\mathbb{R}^n)\to L^\infty(\mathbb{R}^n)$ for the localized Schr\"odinger propagator, as well as global Strichartz estimates. Our results provide a positive answer to the open problem posed in arXiv:0901.4024 arXiv:1611.04805 arXiv:0806.0778, and fill a longstanding gap left by arXiv:arXiv:0705.0546 arXiv:archive/0608699.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02673v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extracting work from a physical system is one of the cornerstones of quantum thermodynamics. The extractable work, as quantified by ergotropy, necessitates a complete description of the quantum system. This is significantly more challenging when the state of the underlying system is unknown, as quantum tomography is extremely inefficient. In this article, we analyze the number of samples of the unknown state required to extract work. With only a single copy of an unknown state, we prove that extracting any work is nearly impossible (in the appropriate asymptotic limit). In contrast, when multiple copies are available, we quantify the sample complexity required to estimate extractable work, establishing a scaling relationship that balances the desired accuracy with success probability. Our work develops a sample-efficient protocol to assess the utility of unknown states as quantum batteries and opens avenues for estimating thermodynamic quantities using near-term quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Constructing equivalences between fusion categories of quantum groups and of vertex operator algebras via quantum gauge groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06229v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explain the structure of proof of our results on a problem that Sergio Doplicher posed in the 90s in the setting of conformal nets, and on a related problem posed by Yi-Zhi Huang in the setting of vertex operator algebras. The latter asks to find a direct construction of an equivalence due to Finkelberg between the quantum group modular fusion category at certain roots of unity and the fusion categories of affine vertex operator algebras at positive integer levels. The former asks for the construction of a quantum gauge group and field algebra for the category of localized endomorphisms of a conformal net, extending Doplicher-Roberts theory of the compact gauge group and field algebra in high dimensional AQFT. We mostly focus on the affine VOA aspects. We solve Huang's problem for all the Lie types for which it is known that the centralizer algebra of the truncated tensor powers of the given generating object V listed by Hans Wenzl in 1998 for the quantum group fusion categories is generated by the representation of braid group associated to the R-matrix and for Huang-Lepowsky ribbon braided tensor structure. In the classical type A, this property becomes the classical Schur-Weyl duality and was used by Doplicher and Roberts to construct SU(d) as a special case of their unique compact gauge group and field algebra in algebraic QFT. Presently, known results in the literature allow to construct the full equivalence for the Lie types A, B, C, D, G_2 and partial equivalence for braiding and associativity morphisms in the Lie types E and F. We also solve a question posed by Frenkel and Zhu in 1992 on the quantum group structure on the Zhu algebra for all Lie types. Our main tool is the construction of a quantum gauge group and a Drinfeld twist method. The structures we find in both contexts extend Doplicher-Roberts symmetric functors which played a central role in their duality theory.</description>

      <title>Generalized toric codes on twisted tori for quantum error correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03827v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Kitaev toric code is widely considered one of the leading candidates for error correction in fault-tolerant quantum computation. However, direct methods to increase its logical dimensions, such as lattice surgery or introducing punctures, often incur prohibitive overheads. In this work, we introduce a ring-theoretic approach for efficiently analyzing topological CSS codes in two dimensions, enabling the exploration of generalized toric codes with larger logical dimensions on twisted tori. Using Gr\"obner bases, we simplify stabilizer syndromes to efficiently identify anyon excitations and their geometric periodicities, even under twisted periodic boundary conditions. Since the properties of the codes are determined by the anyons, this approach allows us to directly compute the logical dimensions without constructing large parity-check matrices. Our approach provides a unified method for finding new quantum error-correcting codes and exhibiting their underlying topological orders via the Laurent polynomial ring. This framework naturally applies to bivariate bicycle codes. For example, we construct optimal weight-6 generalized toric codes on twisted tori with parameters $[[ n, k, d ]]$ for $n \leq 400$, yielding novel codes such as $[[120,8,12]]$, $[[186,10,14]]$, $[[210,10,16]]$, $[[248, 10, 18]]$, $[[254, 14, 16]]$, $[[294, 10, 20]]$, $[[310, 10, \leq 22]]$, and $[[340, 16, 18]]$. Moreover, we present a new realization of the $[[360, 12, \leq 24]]$ quantum code using the $(3,3)$-bivariate bicycle code on a twisted torus defined by the basis vectors $(0,30)$ and $(6,6)$, improving stabilizer locality relative to the previous construction. These results highlight the power of the topological order perspective in advancing the design and theoretical understanding of quantum low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes.</description>

      <title>Planar quantum low-density parity-check codes with open boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08887v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct high-performance planar quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes with open boundaries, demonstrating substantially improved resource efficiency compared to the surface code. We present planar code families with logical dimensions ranging from $k=6$ to $k=13$ (e.g., $[[78, 6, 6]]$, $[[107, 7, 7]]$, $[[173, 8, 9]]$, $[[268, 8, 12]]$, $[[405, 9, 15]]$, $[[348, 10, 13]]$, $[[450, 11, 15]]$, $[[386, 12, 12]]$, $[[362, 13, 11]]$), all using local stabilizers of weight 6 or lower. These codes achieve an efficiency metric ($kd^2/n$) that is an order of magnitude greater than that of the surface code. They can be interpreted as planar bivariate bicycle codes, adapted from the original design based on a torus that is challenging to implement physically. Our construction method, which combines boundary anyon condensation with a novel ``lattice grafting'' optimization, circumvents this difficulty and produces codes featuring only local low-weight stabilizers suitable for 2D planar hardware architectures. Furthermore, we observe fractal logical operators in the form of Sierpinski triangles, with the code distances scaling proportionally to the area of the truncated fractal in finite systems. We anticipate that our codes and construction methods offer a promising pathway toward realizing near-term fault-tolerant quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Boundary value problem of magnetically insulated diode: existence of solutions and complex bifurcation</title>

Abstract: The paper focuses on the stationary self-consistent problem of magnetic insulation for a vacuum diode with space-charge limitation, described by a singularly perturbed Vlasov-Maxwell system of dimension 1.5. The case of insulated diode when the electrons are deflected back towards the cathode at the point $x^{*}$ is considered. First, the initial VM system is reduced to the nonlinear singular limit system of ODEs for the potentials of electric and magnetic fields. The second step deals with the limit system's reduction to the new nonlinear singular ODE equation for effective potential $\theta(x)$. The existence of non-negative solutions is proved for the last equation on the interval $[0, x^{*})$ where $\theta(x)&gt;0$. The most interesting and unexplored case is when $\theta(x)&lt;0$ on the interval $(x^{*}, 1]$ and corresponds to the case of an insulated diode. For the first time, a numerical analysis of complex bifurcation of solutions in insulated diode is considered for $\theta(x)&lt;0$ depending on parameters and boundary conditions. Bifurcation diagrams of the dependence of solution $\theta(x)$ on a free point (free boundary) $x^{*}$ were constructed. Insulated diode spacing is found.</description>

      <title>Plastic deformation as a phase transition: a combinatorial model of plastic flow in copper single crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08689v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Continuum models of plasticity fail to capture the richness of microstructural evolution because the continuum is a homogeneous construction. The present study shows that an alternative way is available at the mesoscale in the form of truly discrete constructions and in the discrete exterior calculus. A pre-existing continuum mean-field model with two parameters is rewritten in the language of the latter to model the properties of a network of plastic slip events in a perfect copper single crystal under uniaxial tension. The behaviour of the system is simulated in a triangular 2D mesh in 3D space employing a Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. Phases of distinct character emerge and both first-order and second-order phase transitions are observed. The phases represent arrangements of the plastic slip network with different combinations of collinear, coplanar, non-collinear and non-coplanar active slip systems. Furthermore, some of these phases can be interpreted as representing crystallographic phenomena like activation of secondary slip systems, strain localisation and fracture or amorphisation. The first-order transitions mostly occur as functions of the applied stress, while the second-order transitions occur exclusively as functions of the mean-field coupling parameter. The former are reminiscent of transitions in other statistical-mechanical models, while the latter find parallels in experimental observations.</description>
