      <title>Methods to Estimate Cryptic Sequence Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complexity is a signature quality of interest in artificial life systems. Alongside other dimensions of assessment, it is common to quantify genome sites that contribute to fitness as a complexity measure. However, limitations to the sensitivity of fitness assays in models with implicit replication criteria involving rich biotic interactions introduce the possibility of difficult-to-detect ``cryptic'' adaptive sites, which contribute small fitness effects below the threshold of individual detectability or involve epistatic redundancies. Here, we propose three knockout-based assay procedures designed to quantify cryptic adaptive sites within digital genomes. We report initial tests of these methods on a simple genome model with explicitly configured site fitness effects. In these limited tests, estimation results reflect ground truth cryptic sequence complexities well. Presented work provides initial steps toward development of new methods and software tools that improve the resolution, rigor, and tractability of complexity analyses across alife systems, particularly those requiring expensive in situ assessments of organism fitness.</description>

      <title>Learning epidemic trajectories through Kernel Operator Learning: from modelling to optimal control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since infectious pathogens start spreading into a susceptible population, mathematical models can provide policy makers with reliable forecasts and scenario analyses, which can be concretely implemented or solely consulted. In these complex epidemiological scenarios, machine learning architectures can play an important role, since they directly reconstruct data-driven models circumventing the specific modelling choices and the parameter calibration, typical of classical compartmental models. In this work, we discuss the efficacy of Kernel Operator Learning (KOL) to reconstruct population dynamics during epidemic outbreaks, where the transmission rate is ruled by an input strategy. In particular, we introduce two surrogate models, named KOL-m and KOL-$\partial$, which reconstruct in two different ways the evolution of the epidemics. Moreover, we evaluate the generalization performances of the two approaches with different kernels, including the Neural Tangent Kernels, and compare them with a classical neural network model learning method. Employing synthetic but semi-realistic data, we show how the two introduced approaches are suitable for realizing fast and robust forecasts and scenario analyses, and how these approaches are competitive for determining optimal intervention strategies with respect to specific performance measures.</description>

      <title>Exchangeable coalescents beyond the Cannings class</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.02154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.02154v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a general framework for the study of the genealogy of neutral discrete-time populations. We remove the standard assumption of exchangeability of offspring distributions appearing in Cannings' models, and replace it by a less restrictive condition of non-heritability of reproductive success. We provide a general criterion for the weak convergence of their genealogies to $\Xi$-coalescents, and apply it to a simple parametrization of our scenario (which, under mild conditions, we also prove to essentially include the general case). We provide examples for such populations, including models with highly-asymmetric offspring distributions and populations undergoing random but recurrent bottlenecks. Finally we study the limit genealogy of a new exponential model which, as previously shown for related models and in spite of its built in (fitness) inheritance mechanism, can be brought into our setting.</description>
