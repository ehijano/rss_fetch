      <title>Mitigating LLM Hallucinations with Knowledge Graphs: A Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-stakes domains like cyber operations need responsible and trustworthy AI methods. While large language models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly popular in these domains, they still suffer from hallucinations. This research paper provides learning outcomes from a case study with LinkQ, an open-source natural language interface that was developed to combat hallucinations by forcing an LLM to query a knowledge graph (KG) for ground-truth data during question-answering (QA). We conduct a quantitative evaluation of LinkQ using a well-known KGQA dataset, showing that the system outperforms GPT-4 but still struggles with certain question categories - suggesting that alternative query construction strategies will need to be investigated in future LLM querying systems. We discuss a qualitative study of LinkQ with two domain experts using a real-world cybersecurity KG, outlining these experts' feedback, suggestions, perceived limitations, and future opportunities for systems like LinkQ.</description>

      <title>Don't Just Translate, Agitate: Using Large Language Models as Devil's Advocates for AI Explanations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This position paper highlights a growing trend in Explainable AI (XAI) research where Large Language Models (LLMs) are used to translate outputs from explainability techniques, like feature-attribution weights, into a natural language explanation. While this approach may improve accessibility or readability for users, recent findings suggest that translating into human-like explanations does not necessarily enhance user understanding and may instead lead to overreliance on AI systems. When LLMs summarize XAI outputs without surfacing model limitations, uncertainties, or inconsistencies, they risk reinforcing the illusion of interpretability rather than fostering meaningful transparency. We argue that - instead of merely translating XAI outputs - LLMs should serve as constructive agitators, or devil's advocates, whose role is to actively interrogate AI explanations by presenting alternative interpretations, potential biases, training data limitations, and cases where the model's reasoning may break down. In this role, LLMs can facilitate users in engaging critically with AI systems and generated explanations, with the potential to reduce overreliance caused by misinterpreted or specious explanations.</description>

      <title>Supporting AI-Augmented Meta-Decision Making with InDecision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From school admissions to hiring and investment decisions, the first step behind many high-stakes decision-making processes is "deciding how to decide." Formulating effective criteria to guide decision-making requires an iterative process of exploration, reflection, and discovery. Yet, this process remains under-supported in practice. In this short paper, we outline an opportunity space for AI-driven tools that augment human meta-decision making. We draw upon prior literature to propose a set of design goals for future AI tools aimed at supporting human meta-decision making. We then illustrate these ideas through InDecision, a mixed-initiative tool designed to support the iterative development of decision criteria. Based on initial findings from designing and piloting InDecision with users, we discuss future directions for AI-augmented meta-decision making.</description>

      <title>PlanGlow: Personalized Study Planning with an Explainable and Controllable LLM-Driven System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Personal development through self-directed learning is essential in today's fast-changing world, but many learners struggle to manage it effectively. While AI tools like large language models (LLMs) have the potential for personalized learning planning, they face issues such as transparency and hallucinated information. To address this, we propose PlanGlow, an LLM-based system that generates personalized, well-structured study plans with clear explanations and controllability through user-centered interactions. Through mixed methods, we surveyed 28 participants and interviewed 10 before development, followed by a within-subject experiment with 24 participants to evaluate PlanGlow's performance, usability, controllability, and explainability against two baseline systems: a GPT-4o-based system and Khan Academy's Khanmigo. Results demonstrate that PlanGlow significantly improves usability, explainability, and controllability. Additionally, two educational experts assessed and confirmed the quality of the generated study plans. These findings highlight PlanGlow's potential to enhance personalized learning and address key challenges in self-directed learning.</description>

      <title>Co-Writing with AI, on Human Terms: Aligning Research with User Demands Across the Writing Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As generative AI tools like ChatGPT become integral to everyday writing, critical questions arise about how to preserve writers' sense of agency and ownership when using these tools. Yet, a systematic understanding of how AI assistance affects different aspects of the writing process - and how this shapes writers' agency - remains underexplored. To address this gap, we conducted a systematic review of 109 HCI papers using the PRISMA approach. From this literature, we identify four overarching design strategies for AI writing support: structured guidance, guided exploration, active co-writing, and critical feedback - mapped across the four key cognitive processes in writing: planning, translating, reviewing, and monitoring. We complement this analysis with interviews of 15 writers across diverse domains. Our findings reveal that writers' desired levels of AI intervention vary across the writing process: content-focused writers (e.g., academics) prioritize ownership during planning, while form-focused writers (e.g., creatives) value control over translating and reviewing. Writers' preferences are also shaped by contextual goals, values, and notions of originality and authorship. By examining when ownership matters, what writers want to own, and how AI interactions shape agency, we surface both alignment and gaps between research and user needs. Our findings offer actionable design guidance for developing human-centered writing tools for co-writing with AI, on human terms.</description>

      <title>MobilePoser: Real-Time Full-Body Pose Estimation and 3D Human Translation from IMUs in Mobile Consumer Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There has been a continued trend towards minimizing instrumentation for full-body motion capture, going from specialized rooms and equipment, to arrays of worn sensors and recently sparse inertial pose capture methods. However, as these techniques migrate towards lower-fidelity IMUs on ubiquitous commodity devices, like phones, watches, and earbuds, challenges arise including compromised online performance, temporal consistency, and loss of global translation due to sensor noise and drift. Addressing these challenges, we introduce MobilePoser, a real-time system for full-body pose and global translation estimation using any available subset of IMUs already present in these consumer devices. MobilePoser employs a multi-stage deep neural network for kinematic pose estimation followed by a physics-based motion optimizer, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy while remaining lightweight. We conclude with a series of demonstrative applications to illustrate the unique potential of MobilePoser across a variety of fields, such as health and wellness, gaming, and indoor navigation to name a few.</description>

      <title>Multimodal LLM Augmented Reasoning for Interpretable Visual Perception Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we advance the study of AI-augmented reasoning in the context of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), psychology and cognitive science, focusing on the critical task of visual perception. Specifically, we investigate the applicability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in this domain. To this end, we leverage established principles and explanations from psychology and cognitive science related to complexity in human visual perception. We use them as guiding principles for the MLLMs to compare and interprete visual content. Our study aims to benchmark MLLMs across various explainability principles relevant to visual perception. Unlike recent approaches that primarily employ advanced deep learning models to predict complexity metrics from visual content, our work does not seek to develop a mere new predictive model. Instead, we propose a novel annotation-free analytical framework to assess utility of MLLMs as cognitive assistants for HCI tasks, using visual perception as a case study. The primary goal is to pave the way for principled study in quantifying and evaluating the interpretability of MLLMs for applications in improving human reasoning capability and uncovering biases in existing perception datasets annotated by humans.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Agency in Virtual Reality to Enable Situated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning is an active process that is deeply tied to physical and social contexts. Yet schools traditionally place learners in a passive role and focus on decontextualizing knowledge. Situating learning in more authentic tasks and contexts typically requires taking it outside the classroom via field trips and apprenticeships, but virtual reality (VR) is a promising tool to bring more authentically situated learning experiences into classrooms. In this position paper, I discuss how one of VR's primary affordances for learning is heightening agenct, and how such heightened agency can facilitate more authenticlaly situated learning by allowing learners legitimate peripheral participation.</description>

      <title>From Regulation to Support: Centering Humans in Technology-Mediated Emotion Intervention in Care Contexts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enhancing emotional well-being has become a significant focus in HCI and CSCW, with technologies increasingly designed to track, visualize, and manage emotions. However, these approaches have faced criticism for potentially suppressing certain emotional experiences. Through a scoping review of 53 empirical studies from ACM proceedings implementing Technology-Mediated Emotion Intervention (TMEI), we critically examine current practices through lenses drawn from HCI critical theories. Our analysis reveals emotion intervention mechanisms that extend beyond traditional emotion regulation paradigms, identifying care-centered goals that prioritize non-judgmental emotional support and preserve users' identities. The findings demonstrate how researchers design technologies for generating artificial care, intervening in power dynamics, and nudging behavioral changes. We contribute the concept of "emotion support" as an alternative approach to "emotion regulation," emphasizing human-centered approaches to emotional well-being. This work advances the understanding of diverse human emotional needs beyond individual and cognitive perspectives, offering design implications that critically reimagine how technologies can honor emotional complexity, preserve human agency, and transform power dynamics in care contexts.</description>

      <title>On Error Classification from Physiological Signals within Airborne Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human error remains a critical concern in aviation safety, contributing to 70-80% of accidents despite technological advancements. While physiological measures show promise for error detection in laboratory settings, their effectiveness in dynamic flight environments remains underexplored. Through live flight trials with nine commercial pilots, we investigated whether established error-detection approaches maintain accuracy during actual flight operations. Participants completed standardized multi-tasking scenarios across conditions ranging from laboratory settings to straight-and-level flight and 2G manoeuvres while we collected synchronized physiological data. Our findings demonstrate that EEG-based classification maintains high accuracy (87.83%) during complex flight manoeuvres, comparable to laboratory performance (89.23%). Eye-tracking showed moderate performance (82.50\%), while ECG performed near chance level (51.50%). Classification accuracy remained stable across flight conditions, with minimal degradation during 2G manoeuvres. These results provide the first evidence that physiological error detection can translate effectively to operational aviation environments.</description>

      <title>Questions: A Taxonomy for Critical Reflection in Machine-Supported Decision-Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decision-makers run the risk of relying too much on machine recommendations. Explainable AI, a common strategy for calibrating reliance, has mixed and even negative effects, such as increasing overreliance. To cognitively engage the decision-maker and to facilitate a deliberate decision-making process, we propose a potential `reflection machine' that supports critical reflection about the pending decision, including the machine recommendation. Reflection has been shown to improve critical thinking and reasoning, and thus decision-making. One way to stimulate reflection is to ask relevant questions. To systematically create questions, we present a question taxonomy inspired by Socratic questions and human-centred explainable AI. This taxonomy can contribute to the design of such a `reflection machine' that asks decision-makers questions. Our work is part of the growing research on human-machine collaborations that goes beyond the paradigm of machine recommendations and explanations, and aims to enable greater human oversight as required by the European AI Act.</description>

      <title>DashChat: Interactive Authoring of Industrial Dashboard Design Prototypes through Conversation with LLM-Powered Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Industrial dashboards, commonly deployed by organizations such as enterprises and governments, are increasingly crucial in data communication and decision-making support across various domains. Designing an industrial dashboard prototype is particularly challenging due to its visual complexity, which can include data visualization, layout configuration, embellishments, and animations. Additionally, in real-world industrial settings, designers often encounter numerous constraints. For instance, when companies negotiate collaborations with clients and determine design plans, they typically need to demo design prototypes and iterate on them based on mock data quickly. Such a task is very common and crucial during the ideation stage, as it not only helps save developmental costs but also avoids data-related issues such as lengthy data handover periods. However, existing authoring tools of dashboards are mostly not tailored to such prototyping needs, and motivated by these gaps, we propose DashChat, an interactive system that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate industrial dashboard design prototypes from natural language. We collaborated closely with designers from the industry and derived the requirements based on their practical experience. First, by analyzing 114 high-quality industrial dashboards, we summarized their common design patterns and inject the identified ones into LLMs as reference. Next, we built a multi-agent pipeline powered by LLMs to understand textual requirements from users and generate practical, aesthetic prototypes. Besides, functionally distinct, parallel-operating agents are created to enable efficient generation. Then, we developed a user-friendly interface that supports text-based interaction for generating and modifying prototypes. Two user studies demonstrated that our system is both effective and efficient in supporting design prototyping.</description>

      <title>Explainable AI in Usable Privacy and Security: Challenges and Opportunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being used for automated evaluations and explaining them. However, concerns about explanation quality, consistency, and hallucinations remain open research challenges, particularly in high-stakes contexts like privacy and security, where user trust and decision-making are at stake. In this paper, we investigate these issues in the context of PRISMe, an interactive privacy policy assessment tool that leverages LLMs to evaluate and explain website privacy policies. Based on a prior user study with 22 participants, we identify key concerns regarding LLM judgment transparency, consistency, and faithfulness, as well as variations in user preferences for explanation detail and engagement. We discuss potential strategies to mitigate these concerns, including structured evaluation criteria, uncertainty estimation, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). We identify a need for adaptive explanation strategies tailored to different user profiles for LLM-as-a-judge. Our goal is to showcase the application area of usable privacy and security to be promising for Human-Centered Explainable AI (HCXAI) to make an impact.</description>

      <title>Customizing Emotional Support: How Do Individuals Construct and Interact With LLM-Powered Chatbots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Personalized support is essential to fulfill individuals' emotional needs and sustain their mental well-being. Large language models (LLMs), with great customization flexibility, hold promises to enable individuals to create their own emotional support agents. In this work, we developed ChatLab, where users could construct LLM-powered chatbots with additional interaction features including voices and avatars. Using a Research through Design approach, we conducted a week-long field study followed by interviews and design activities (N = 22), which uncovered how participants created diverse chatbot personas for emotional reliance, confronting stressors, connecting to intellectual discourse, reflecting mirrored selves, etc. We found that participants actively enriched the personas they constructed, shaping the dynamics between themselves and the chatbot to foster open and honest conversations. They also suggested other customizable features, such as integrating online activities and adjustable memory settings. Based on these findings, we discuss opportunities for enhancing personalized emotional support through emerging AI technologies.</description>

      <title>Neurodiversity in Computing Education Research: A Systematic Literature Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensuring equitable access to computing education for all students-including those with autism, dyslexia, or ADHD-is essential to developing a diverse and inclusive workforce. To understand the state of disability research in computing education, we conducted a systematic literature review of research on neurodiversity in computing education. Our search resulted in 1,943 total papers, which we filtered to 14 papers based on our inclusion criteria. Our mixed-methods approach analyzed research methods, participants, contribution types, and findings. The three main contribution types included empirical contributions based on user studies (57.1%), opinion contributions and position papers (50%), and survey contributions (21.4%). Interviews were the most common methodology (75% of empirical contributions). There were often inconsistencies in how research methods were described (e.g., number of participants and interview and survey materials). Our work shows that research on neurodivergence in computing education is still very preliminary. Most papers provided curricular recommendations that lacked empirical evidence to support those recommendations. Three areas of future work include investigating the impacts of active learning, increasing awareness and knowledge about neurodiverse students' experiences, and engaging neurodivergent students in the design of pedagogical materials and computing education research.</description>

      <title>Should We Tailor the Talk? Understanding the Impact of Conversational Styles on Preference Elicitation in Conversational Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conversational recommender systems (CRSs) provide users with an interactive means to express preferences and receive real-time personalized recommendations. The success of these systems is heavily influenced by the preference elicitation process. While existing research mainly focuses on what questions to ask during preference elicitation, there is a notable gap in understanding what role broader interaction patterns including tone, pacing, and level of proactiveness play in supporting users in completing a given task. This study investigates the impact of different conversational styles on preference elicitation, task performance, and user satisfaction with CRSs. We conducted a controlled experiment in the context of scientific literature recommendation, contrasting two distinct conversational styles, high involvement (fast paced, direct, and proactive with frequent prompts) and high considerateness (polite and accommodating, prioritizing clarity and user comfort) alongside a flexible experimental condition where users could switch between the two. Our results indicate that adapting conversational strategies based on user expertise and allowing flexibility between styles can enhance both user satisfaction and the effectiveness of recommendations in CRSs. Overall, our findings hold important implications for the design of future CRSs.</description>

      <title>Object-Driven Narrative in AR: A Scenario-Metaphor Framework with VLM Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most adaptive AR storytelling systems define environmental semantics using simple object labels and spatial coordinates, limiting narratives to rigid, pre-defined logic. This oversimplification overlooks the contextual significance of object relationships-for example, a wedding ring on a nightstand might suggest marital conflict, yet is treated as just "two objects" in space. To address this, we explored integrating Vision Language Models (VLMs) into AR pipelines. However, several challenges emerged: First, stories generated with simple prompt guidance lacked narrative depth and spatial usage. Second, spatial semantics were underutilized, failing to support meaningful storytelling. Third, pre-generated scripts struggled to align with AR Foundation's object naming and coordinate systems. We propose a scene-driven AR storytelling framework that reimagines environments as active narrative agents, built on three innovations: 1. State-aware object semantics: We decompose object meaning into physical, functional, and metaphorical layers, allowing VLMs to distinguish subtle narrative cues between similar objects. 2. Structured narrative interface: A bidirectional JSON layer maps VLM-generated metaphors to AR anchors, maintaining spatial and semantic coherence. 3. STAM evaluation framework: A three-part experimental design evaluates narrative quality, highlighting both strengths and limitations of VLM-AR integration. Our findings show that the system can generate stories from the environment itself, not just place them on top of it. In user studies, 70% of participants reported seeing real-world objects differently when narratives were grounded in environmental symbolism. By merging VLMs' generative creativity with AR's spatial precision, this framework introduces a novel object-driven storytelling paradigm, transforming passive spaces into active narrative landscapes.</description>

      <title>Has the Creativity of Large-Language Models peaked? An analysis of inter- and intra-LLM variability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Following the widespread adoption of ChatGPT in early 2023, numerous studies reported that large language models (LLMs) can match or even surpass human performance in creative tasks. However, it remains unclear whether LLMs have become more creative over time, and how consistent their creative output is. In this study, we evaluated 14 widely used LLMs -- including GPT-4, Claude, Llama, Grok, Mistral, and DeepSeek -- across two validated creativity assessments: the Divergent Association Task (DAT) and the Alternative Uses Task (AUT). Contrary to expectations, we found no evidence of increased creative performance over the past 18-24 months, with GPT-4 performing worse than in previous studies. For the more widely used AUT, all models performed on average better than the average human, with GPT-4o and o3-mini performing best. However, only 0.28% of LLM-generated responses reached the top 10% of human creativity benchmarks. Beyond inter-model differences, we document substantial intra-model variability: the same LLM, given the same prompt, can produce outputs ranging from below-average to original. This variability has important implications for both creativity research and practical applications. Ignoring such variability risks misjudging the creative potential of LLMs, either inflating or underestimating their capabilities. The choice of prompts affected LLMs differently. Our findings underscore the need for more nuanced evaluation frameworks and highlight the importance of model selection, prompt design, and repeated assessment when using Generative AI (GenAI) tools in creative contexts.</description>

      <title>Meta-Evaluating Local LLMs: Rethinking Performance Metrics for Serious Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The evaluation of open-ended responses in serious games presents a unique challenge, as correctness is often subjective. Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being explored as evaluators in such contexts, yet their accuracy and consistency remain uncertain, particularly for smaller models intended for local execution. This study investigates the reliability of five small-scale LLMs when assessing player responses in \textit{En-join}, a game that simulates decision-making within energy communities. By leveraging traditional binary classification metrics (including accuracy, true positive rate, and true negative rate), we systematically compare these models across different evaluation scenarios. Our results highlight the strengths and limitations of each model, revealing trade-offs between sensitivity, specificity, and overall performance. We demonstrate that while some models excel at identifying correct responses, others struggle with false positives or inconsistent evaluations. The findings highlight the need for context-aware evaluation frameworks and careful model selection when deploying LLMs as evaluators. This work contributes to the broader discourse on the trustworthiness of AI-driven assessment tools, offering insights into how different LLM architectures handle subjective evaluation tasks.</description>

      <title>Towards Conversational AI for Human-Machine Collaborative MLOps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a Large Language Model (LLM) based conversational agent system designed to enhance human-machine collaboration in Machine Learning Operations (MLOps). We introduce the Swarm Agent, an extensible architecture that integrates specialized agents to create and manage ML workflows through natural language interactions. The system leverages a hierarchical, modular design incorporating a KubeFlow Pipelines (KFP) Agent for ML pipeline orchestration, a MinIO Agent for data management, and a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Agent for domain-specific knowledge integration. Through iterative reasoning loops and context-aware processing, the system enables users with varying technical backgrounds to discover, execute, and monitor ML pipelines; manage datasets and artifacts; and access relevant documentation, all via intuitive conversational interfaces. Our approach addresses the accessibility gap in complex MLOps platforms like Kubeflow, making advanced ML tools broadly accessible while maintaining the flexibility to extend to other platforms. The paper describes the architecture, implementation details, and demonstrates how this conversational MLOps assistant reduces complexity and lowers barriers to entry for users across diverse technical skill levels.</description>

      <title>Predicting Driver's Perceived Risk: a Model Based on Semi-Supervised Learning Strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Drivers' perception of risk determines their acceptance, trust, and use of the Automated Driving Systems (ADSs). However, perceived risk is subjective and difficult to evaluate using existing methods. To address this issue, a driver's subjective perceived risk (DSPR) model is proposed, regarding perceived risk as a dynamically triggered mechanism with anisotropy and attenuation. 20 participants are recruited for a driver-in-the-loop experiment to report their real-time subjective risk ratings (SRRs) when experiencing various automatic driving scenarios. A convolutional neural network and bidirectional long short-term memory network with temporal pattern attention (CNN-Bi-LSTM-TPA) is embedded into a semi-supervised learning strategy to predict SRRs, aiming to reduce data noise caused by subjective randomness of participants. The results illustrate that DSPR achieves the highest prediction accuracy of 87.91% in predicting SRRs, compared to three state-of-the-art risk models. The semi-supervised strategy improves accuracy by 20.12%. Besides, CNN-Bi-LSTM-TPA network presents the highest accuracy among four different LSTM structures. This study offers an effective method for assessing driver's perceived risk, providing support for the safety enhancement of ADS and driver's trust improvement.</description>

      <title>Accessibility Recommendations for Designing Better Mobile Application User Interfaces for Seniors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Seniors represent a growing user base for mobile applications; however, many apps fail to adequately address their accessibility challenges and usability preferences. To investigate this issue, we conducted an exploratory focus group study with 16 senior participants, from which we derived an initial set of user personas highlighting key accessibility and personalisation barriers. These personas informed the development of a model-driven engineering toolset, which was used to generate adaptive mobile app prototypes tailored to seniors' needs. We then conducted a second focus group study with 22 seniors to evaluate these prototypes and validate our findings. Based on insights from both studies, we developed a refined set of personas and a series of accessibility and personalisation recommendations grounded in empirical data, prior research, accessibility standards, and developer resources, aimed at supporting software practitioners in designing more inclusive mobile applications.</description>

      <title>Assesing LLMs in Art Contexts: Critique Generation and Theory of Mind Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explored how large language models (LLMs) perform in two areas related to art: writing critiques of artworks and reasoning about mental states (Theory of Mind, or ToM) in art-related situations. For the critique generation part, we built a system that combines Noel Carroll's evaluative framework with a broad selection of art criticism theories. The model was prompted to first write a full-length critique and then shorter, more coherent versions using a step-by-step prompting process. These AI-generated critiques were then compared with those written by human experts in a Turing test-style evaluation. In many cases, human subjects had difficulty telling which was which, and the results suggest that LLMs can produce critiques that are not only plausible in style but also rich in interpretation, as long as they are carefully guided. In the second part, we introduced new simple ToM tasks based on situations involving interpretation, emotion, and moral tension, which can appear in the context of art. These go beyond standard false-belief tests and allow for more complex, socially embedded forms of reasoning. We tested 41 recent LLMs and found that their performance varied across tasks and models. In particular, tasks that involved affective or ambiguous situations tended to reveal clearer differences. Taken together, these results help clarify how LLMs respond to complex interpretative challenges, revealing both their cognitive limitations and potential. While our findings do not directly contradict the so-called Generative AI Paradox--the idea that LLMs can produce expert-like output without genuine understanding--they suggest that, depending on how LLMs are instructed, such as through carefully designed prompts, these models may begin to show behaviors that resemble understanding more closely than we might assume.</description>

      <title>Are AI agents the new machine translation frontier? Challenges and opportunities of single- and multi-agent systems for multilingual digital communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) has introduced AI agents as a disruptive paradigm across various industries, yet their application in machine translation (MT) remains underexplored. This paper describes and analyses the potential of single- and multi-agent systems for MT, reflecting on how they could enhance multilingual digital communication. While single-agent systems are well-suited for simpler translation tasks, multi-agent systems, which involve multiple specialized AI agents collaborating in a structured manner, may offer a promising solution for complex scenarios requiring high accuracy, domain-specific knowledge, and contextual awareness. To demonstrate the feasibility of multi-agent workflows in MT, we are conducting a pilot study in legal MT. The study employs a multi-agent system involving four specialized AI agents for (i) translation, (ii) adequacy review, (iii) fluency review, and (iv) final editing. Our findings suggest that multi-agent systems may have the potential to significantly improve domain-adaptability and contextual awareness, with superior translation quality to traditional MT or single-agent systems. This paper also sets the stage for future research into multi-agent applications in MT, integration into professional translation workflows, and shares a demo of the system analyzed in the paper.</description>

      <title>A Phenomenological Approach to Analyzing User Queries in IT Systems Using Heidegger's Fundamental Ontology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel research analytical IT system grounded in Martin Heidegger's Fundamental Ontology, distinguishing between beings (das Seiende) and Being (das Sein). The system employs two modally distinct, descriptively complete languages: a categorical language of beings for processing user inputs and an existential language of Being for internal analysis. These languages are bridged via a phenomenological reduction module, enabling the system to analyze user queries (including questions, answers, and dialogues among IT specialists), identify recursive and self-referential structures, and provide actionable insights in categorical terms. Unlike contemporary systems limited to categorical analysis, this approach leverages Heidegger's phenomenological existential analysis to uncover deeper ontological patterns in query processing, aiding in resolving logical traps in complex interactions, such as metaphor usage in IT contexts. The path to full realization involves formalizing the language of Being by a research team based on Heidegger's Fundamental Ontology; given the existing completeness of the language of beings, this reduces the system's computability to completeness, paving the way for a universal query analysis tool. The paper presents the system's architecture, operational principles, technical implementation, use cases--including a case based on real IT specialist dialogues--comparative evaluation with existing tools, and its advantages and limitations.</description>

      <title>Early Accessibility: Automating Alt-Text Generation for UI Icons During App Development</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Alt-text is essential for mobile app accessibility, yet UI icons often lack meaningful descriptions, limiting accessibility for screen reader users. Existing approaches either require extensive labeled datasets, struggle with partial UI contexts, or operate post-development, increasing technical debt. We first conduct a formative study to determine when and how developers prefer to generate icon alt-text. We then explore the ALTICON approach for generating alt-text for UI icons during development using two fine-tuned models: a text-only large language model that processes extracted UI metadata and a multi-modal model that jointly analyzes icon images and textual context. To improve accuracy, the method extracts relevant UI information from the DOM tree, retrieves in-icon text via OCR, and applies structured prompts for alt-text generation. Our empirical evaluation with the most closely related deep-learning and vision-language models shows that ALTICON generates alt-text that is of higher quality while not requiring a full-screen input.</description>

      <title>Missing Pieces: How Do Designs that Expose Uncertainty Longitudinally Impact Trust in AI Decision Aids? An In Situ Study of Gig Drivers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06432v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Decision aids based on artificial intelligence (AI) induce a wide range of outcomes when they are deployed in uncertain environments. In this paper, we investigate how users' trust in recommendations from an AI decision aid is impacted over time by designs that expose uncertainty in predicted outcomes. Unlike previous work, we focus on gig driving - a real-world, repeated decision-making context. We report on a longitudinal mixed-methods study ($n=51$) where we measured gig drivers' trust as they interacted with an AI-based schedule recommendation tool. Our results show that participants' trust in the tool was shaped by both their first impressions of its accuracy and their longitudinal interactions with it; and that task-aligned framings of uncertainty improved trust by allowing participants to incorporate uncertainty into their decision-making processes. Additionally, we observed that trust depended on their characteristics as drivers, underscoring the need for more in situ studies of AI decision aids.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08526v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Live action roleplay (larp) has a wide range of applications, and can be relevant in relation to HCI. While there has been research about larp in relation to topics such as embodied interaction, playfulness and futuring published in HCI venues since the early 2000s, there is not yet a compilation of this knowledge. In this paper, we synthesise knowledge about larp and larp-adjacent work within the domain of HCI. We present a practitioner overview from an expert group of larp researchers, the results of a literature review, and highlight particular larp research exemplars which all work together to showcase the diverse set of ways that larp can be utilised in relation to HCI topics and research. This paper identifies the need for further discussions toward establishing best practices for utilising larp in relation to HCI research, as well as advocating for increased engagement with larps outside academia.</description>

      <title>ValueCompass: A Framework for Measuring Contextual Value Alignment Between Human and LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09586v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As AI systems become more advanced, ensuring their alignment with a diverse range of individuals and societal values becomes increasingly critical. But how can we capture fundamental human values and assess the degree to which AI systems align with them? We introduce ValueCompass, a framework of fundamental values, grounded in psychological theory and a systematic review, to identify and evaluate human-AI alignment. We apply ValueCompass to measure the value alignment of humans and large language models (LLMs) across four real-world scenarios: collaborative writing, education, public sectors, and healthcare. Our findings reveal concerning misalignments between humans and LLMs, such as humans frequently endorse values like "National Security" which were largely rejected by LLMs. We also observe that values differ across scenarios, highlighting the need for context-aware AI alignment strategies. This work provides valuable insights into the design space of human-AI alignment, laying the foundations for developing AI systems that responsibly reflect societal values and ethics.</description>

      <title>AI, Jobs, and the Automation Trap: Where Is HCI?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18948v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) continues to reshape the workforce, its current trajectory raises pressing questions about its ultimate purpose. Why does job automation dominate the agenda, even at the expense of human agency and equity? This paper critiques the automation-centric paradigm, arguing that current reward structures, which largely focus on cost reduction, drive the overwhelming emphasis on task replacement in AI patents. Meanwhile, Human-Centered AI (HCAI), which envisions AI as a collaborator augmenting human capabilities and aligning with societal values, remains a fugitive from the mainstream narrative. Despite its promise, HCAI has gone ``missing'', with little evidence of its principles translating into patents or real-world impact. To increase impact, actionable interventions are needed to disrupt existing incentive structures within the HCI community. We call for a shift in priorities to support translational research, foster cross-disciplinary collaboration, and promote metrics that reward tangible and real-world impact.</description>

      <title>Beyond Tools: Understanding How Heavy Users Integrate LLMs into Everyday Tasks and Decision-Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15395v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for both everyday and specialized tasks. While HCI research focuses on domain-specific applications, little is known about how heavy users integrate LLMs into everyday decision-making. Through qualitative interviews with heavy LLM users (n=7) who employ these systems for both intuitive and analytical thinking tasks, our findings show that participants use LLMs for social validation, self-regulation, and interpersonal guidance, seeking to build self-confidence and optimize cognitive resources. These users viewed LLMs either as rational, consistent entities or average human decision-makers. Our findings suggest that heavy LLM users develop nuanced interaction patterns beyond simple delegation, highlighting the need to reconsider how we study LLM integration in decision-making processes.</description>

      <title>Emotion Alignment: Discovering the Gap Between Social Media and Real-World Sentiments in Persian Tweets and Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10662v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In contemporary society, widespread social media usage is evident in people's daily lives. Nevertheless, disparities in emotional expressions between the real world and online platforms can manifest. We comprehensively analyzed Persian community on X to explore this phenomenon. An innovative pipeline was designed to measure the similarity between emotions in the real world compared to social media. Accordingly, recent tweets and images of participants were gathered and analyzed using Transformers-based text and image sentiment analysis modules. Each participant's friends also provided insights into the their real-world emotions. A distance criterion was used to compare real-world feelings with virtual experiences. Our study encompassed N=105 participants, 393 friends who contributed their perspectives, over 8,300 collected tweets, and 2,000 media images. Results indicated a 28.67% similarity between images and real-world emotions, while tweets exhibited a 75.88% alignment with real-world feelings. Additionally, the statistical significance confirmed that the observed disparities in sentiment proportions.</description>

      <title>UI-E2I-Synth: Advancing GUI Grounding with Large-Scale Instruction Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11257v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models are accelerating the development of Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents that utilize human-like vision perception capabilities to enhance productivity on digital devices. Compared to approaches predicated on GUI metadata, which are platform-dependent and vulnerable to implementation variations, vision-based approaches offer broader applicability. In this vision-based paradigm, the GUI instruction grounding, which maps user instruction to the location of corresponding element on the given screenshot, remains a critical challenge, particularly due to limited public training dataset and resource-intensive manual instruction data annotation. In this paper, we delve into unexplored challenges in this task including element-to-screen ratio, unbalanced element type, and implicit instruction. To address these challenges, we introduce a large-scale data synthesis pipeline UI-E2I-Synth for generating varying complex instruction datasets using GPT-4o instead of human annotators. Furthermore, we propose a new GUI instruction grounding benchmark UI-I2E-Bench, which is designed to address the limitations of existing benchmarks by incorporating diverse annotation aspects. Our model, trained on the synthesized data, achieves superior performance in GUI instruction grounding, demonstrating the advancements of proposed data synthesis pipeline. The proposed benchmark, accompanied by extensive analyses, provides practical insights for future research in GUI grounding. We will release corresponding artifacts at https://colmon46.github.io/i2e-bench-leaderboard/ .</description>

      <title>PhishLang: A Real-Time, Fully Client-Side Phishing Detection Framework Using MobileBERT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05667v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce PhishLang, the first fully client-side anti-phishing framework built on a lightweight ensemble framework that utilizes advanced language models to analyze the contextual features of a website's source code and URL. Unlike traditional heuristic or machine learning approaches that rely on static features and struggle to adapt to evolving threats, or deep learning models that are computationally intensive, our approach utilizes MobileBERT, a fast and memory-efficient variant of the BERT architecture, to capture nuanced features indicative of phishing attacks. To further enhance detection accuracy, PhishLang employs a multi-modal ensemble approach, combining both the URL and Source detection models. This architecture ensures robustness by allowing one model to compensate for scenarios where the other may fail, or if both models provide ambiguous inferences. As a result, PhishLang excels at detecting both regular and evasive phishing threats, including zero-day attacks, outperforming popular anti-phishing tools, while operating without relying on external blocklists and safeguarding user privacy by ensuring that browser history remains entirely local and unshared. We release PhishLang as a Chromium browser extension and also open-source the framework to aid the research community.</description>
