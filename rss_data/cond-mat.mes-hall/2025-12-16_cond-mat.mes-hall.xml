      <title>Turbulent Flows in Electron Hydrodynamics: Conductivity and Vorticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we attempt to understand various aspects of turbulent flows in electron hydrodynamics. We analyze a rectangular channel geometry in the presence of an electric field and a Corbino geometry in the presence of a magnetic field. In the former geometry, we analyze the conductivity of the fluid as well as the frequency spectrum of perturbations about the Poiseuille flow. While the normal Poiseuille flow has an associated conductivity which scales as $W^2$, we find a correction which scales as $W^4$ in the case of non-linear flows, where $W$ is the characteristic length of the system. In the Corbino geometry, we analyze the velocity, vorticity and magnetic fields. We find that the vorticity can span across a wide range near the edge of the geometry, a behavior that can be reflected in the velocity and magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Memristive Nanowire Network Models via a Unified Computational Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Randomly self-assembled nanowire networks (NWNs) are dynamical systems in which junctions between two nanowires can be modelled as memristive units viewed as adaptive resistors with memory. Various memristive models have been proposed to capture the complex mechanics of these junctions. Here, we showcase a novel computational framework named Memristive Nanowire Network Simulator (MemNNetSim) to simulate and analyze random memristive NWNs in a unified approach. Implemented using the Python programming language, MemNNetSim allows for the analysis of static and dynamic scenarios of NWNs under arbitrary memristive models. This provides a versatile foundation to build upon in further work, such as reservoir dynamics with NWNs, which has seen increased interest due to the interconnected architecture of NWNs. In this work, we introduce the package, demonstrate its utility in simulating NWNs, and then test advanced scenarios in which it can aid in the exploratory analysis of these systems, particularly in learning how to use NWNs as a physical reservoir in reservoir computing applications.</description>

      <title>Perturbative Input-Output Theory of Floquet Cavity Magnonics and Magnon Energy Shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a perturbative input-output formalism to compute the reflectance and transmittance spectra of cavity magnonics systems subject to a Floquet modulation. The method exploits the strong hierarchy between the magnetic-dipole couplings transverse (drive field) and parallel (modulation field) to the static bias field, which naturally introduces the small parameter $\epsilon = (2Ns)^{-1/2}$ associated with the total spin $Ns$ of the ferromagnet. By organizing the cavity and magnon fields in a systematic expansion in $\epsilon$, we obtain compact analytic expressions for the spectra up to second order. Using these results, we reproduce the characteristic sideband structure observed in recent Floquet cavity electromagnonics experiments. Furthermore, accounting for the Zeeman interaction between the modulation field and the fully polarized ground state - a contribution typically neglected in previous treatments - we predict an additional magnon detuning of approximately $0.8\,\mathrm{GHz}$, independent of both modulation frequency and sample size and determined solely by the spatial volume occupied by the modulation field. This identifies a measurable and previously overlooked shift relevant for the interpretation and design of cavity magnonics experiments.</description>

      <title>Radio-frequency assisted switching in perpendicular magnetic tunnel junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin-transfer torque magnetic random-access memory (STT-MRAM) relies on nanoscale magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) as its fundamental building blocks. Next-generation STT-MRAM requires strategies that simultaneously improve switching energy efficiency and device endurance. Here, we present the first study of perpendicular STT-MRAM writing assisted by radio-frequency (RF) spin torque. We show that applying a small-amplitude RF pulse prior to a direct-current (DC) writing pulse enhances the MTJ switching probability, with the efficiency gain increasing at lower RF frequencies. This RF+DC writing scheme enables shorter DC pulses, thereby improving device endurance. Analytical and numerical modeling qualitatively reproduces the experimental trends, while quantitative discrepancies indicate that realistic MTJ properties beyond idealized models play an important role in RF-assisted switching.</description>

      <title>Scalable Quantum Photonic Platform Based on Site-Controlled Quantum Dots Coupled to Circular Bragg Grating Resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The scalable integration of solid-state quantum emitters into photonic nanostructures remains a central challenge for quantum photonic technologies. Here, we demonstrate a robust and streamlined integration strategy that tackles the long-standing issue of deterministic fabrication on randomly positioned self-assembled quantum dots (QDs), leveraging a buried-stressor-based site-controlled InGaAs QD platform. We show that this deterministic growth approach enables precise spatial alignment with circular Bragg grating (CBG) resonators for enhanced emission, eliminating the need for complex and time-consuming deterministic lithography techniques. We fabricated a $6\times6$ SCQD-CBG array with 100\% device yield, with 35 devices falling within the radial-offset range where the simulated photon-extraction efficiency (PEE) exceeds 20\%, underscoring the spatial precision and scalability of our fabrication concept. A systematically selected subset of five devices with varying radial displacements reveals clear offset-dependent trends in extraction efficiency, spectral linewidth, and photon indistinguishability, thereby establishing quantitative bounds on spatial alignment tolerances. In the best-aligned QD-CBG device, we achieve a PEE of $(47.1\pm3.8)\%$, a linewidth of $(1.41\pm0.22)$ GHz, a radiative decay lifetime of $(0.80\pm0.02)$~ns, a single-photon purity of $(99.58\pm0.18)\%$, and a Hong-Ou-Mandel two-photon interference visibility of $(81\pm5)\%$ under quasi-resonant excitation at saturation power. We confirm our conceptual understanding of the effect of emitter-position dependent charge-noise fluctuations in terms of a quantum-optical model for the (quantum-)emission properties.</description>

      <title>Theory of local orbital magnetization: local Berry curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a microscopic theory for the local (single site) orbital magnetization in tight-binding systems. Each occupied state of energy $\varepsilon_n$ contributes with a local orbital magnetic moment term ${\mathbf{ m}}_n({\mathbf{ r}})$ and a local Berry-curvature term ${\mathbf{ \Omega}}_n({\mathbf{ r}})$. For Bloch electrons (${\mathbf{ k}}$-space), we go beyond the modern theory by revealing the sublattice texture. We identify a topological contribution ${\mathbf{ \Omega}}^{\text{topo}}_{n\mathbf{ k}}({\mathbf{ r}})$ and a geometric contribution ${\mathbf{\Omega}}^{\text{geom}}_{n\mathbf{ k}}({\mathbf{ r}})$ to the sublattice Berry curvature. For systems with open boundaries (${\mathbf{ r}}$-space), we derive an explicit expression of an effective onsite Berry curvature ${\mathbf{ \Omega}}_n({\mathbf{ r}})$. Considering two band models, the $\mathbf{ k}$-space and $\mathbf{ r}$-space onsite magnetizations coincide numerically but differ from the Bianco-Resta approach. They reveal orbital ferromagnetism in topological insulators, and orbital antiferro- and ferrimagnetism in trivial insulators. This theory can be used to investigate orbital magnetic textures and their topological properties in many systems of current interest (Moir\'e, amorphous, quasicrystals, defects, molecules).</description>

      <title>Tuning molecular thermal conductance through endgroup modification and halogen substitution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate tuning of the phononic thermal conductance in single molecules with carbon-chain backbones through modifications of terminal groups and halogen substitution of hydrogen atoms. Our simulations focus on intrinsic molecular properties, and we employ a workflow based on {\it ab initio} molecular dynamics, enabling the training and development of machine-learned interatomic potentials. These potentials are subsequently used in classical nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations to extract thermal conductance coefficients. Replacing terminal methyl groups with amine, sulfur, or halogen substituents leads to pronounced changes in thermal conductance: bromine-terminated chains exhibit the lowest conductance, whereas amine and methyl-terminated chains show the highest. Additionally, single-atom substitution of hydrogen by fluorine or other halogens along the alkane backbone significantly reduces thermal transport. Finally, our simulations of the length dependence of thermal conductance in alkane chains containing 3-12 carbon atoms reveal its saturation beyond eight carbon atoms. Together, our findings show that simple chemical modifications offer a versatile route to controlling phononic heat flow in single molecules.</description>

      <title>Electrically Tuneable Variability in Germanium Hole Spin Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hole spin qubits in planar germanium heterostructures are frontrunners for scalable semiconductor quantum computing. However, their current performance is mostly limited by large dot-to-dot variability that leads to uncontrolled qubit energies and random tilts in the spin quantization axis. Here, we propose a systematic and local method to engineer the spin qubit response by imprinting a controlled anisotropy in the quantum dot confinement, enabling on-demand electric g-tensor control. In particular, we find that both the quantum-dot size and asymmetry allow electrical tuning of the g-tensor and significantly suppress magnitude and angular variability of the spin response for selected magnetic field directions. We confirm this behavior by analyzing single-disorder realizations and statistical ensembles in state-of-the-art strained and unstrained germanium channels, showing that the latter provides an optimal path for $g$-tensor engineering. Our results provide practical design principles for on-demand control of the spin response and mitigating variability, paving the way towards large-scale germanium-based quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Fast wave transport in two-dimensional $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a theoretical investigation of wave dynamics in two-dimensional non-Hermitian $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric lattices, where onsite, as well as inter-site control couplings are employed. Our analysis shows that these couplings can be tuned to achieve a direction-sensitive group velocity enhancement beyond what is possible in the uncontrolled (Hermitian) counterpart, while ensuring that the wave packet evolution remains bounded and dynamically stable. We derive a dedicated relation between the control parameters, providing a systematic condition under which stability is guaranteed. We then study the topological properties of the non-Hermitian system at hand, and use an experimental-ready topoelecric metamaterial platform to demonstrate the non-Hermitian couplings realization, and the resulting wave dynamics. This framework paves the way to designing stable and fast wave transport in planar non-Hermitian media.</description>

      <title>Proximity effects and a topological invariant in a Chern insulator connected to leads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The observed robustly quantized Hall conductance in quantum Hall systems and Chern insulators (CI) have so far been understood in terms of the topology of isolated systems, which are not coupled to leads. It is assumed that the leads act as inert reservoirs that simply supply/absorb electrons to/from the sample. Within a model of a CI coupled to leads with a cylindrical geometry, we show that this is not true. In the proximity of the CI, the edge current leaks into the leads, with the Hall conductance quantized only if this novel proximity effect is taken into account. For a special choice of leads, we identify the conductance with a topological invariant of the system, in terms of the winding number of the phase of the reflection coefficients of the scattering states.</description>

      <title>Magnetic topological textures in nonorientable surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological magnetic textures confined to two-dimensional (2D) non-orientable manifolds exhibit behaviors absent in planar systems. We investigate bimerons on M\"obius surfaces and show that the lack of global orientation alters conservation laws, yielding geometry-dependent topology and dynamics. Micromagnetic simulations reveal that the helical twist and non-orientable geometry reshape the effective topological charge and stabilize chiral configurations imposed by the surface. Under spin-polarized currents, bimerons display unconventional transport: the transverse response is locally reversed or globally suppressed due to charge inversion along the manifold. Moreover, we establish an Aharonov-Bohm effect associated with the magnonic modes of the texture; in particular, the translational Goldstone mode implies that a bimeron on a M\"obius strip should exhibit path-dependent quantum interference. These results identify a geometry-driven regime of magnetization dynamics and provide a route to curvature-engineered spintronic functionalities.</description>

      <title>Observation of a Stripe/nematic Phase of Composite Fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electronic stripe/nematic phases are fascinating strongly-correlated states characterized by spontaneous rotational symmetry breaking. In the quantum Hall regime, such phases typically emerge at half-filled, high-orbital-index ($N\geq2$) Landau levels (LLs) where the short-range Coulomb interaction is softened by the nodes of electron wave functions. In the lowest ($N=0$) LLs, these phases are not expected. Instead, composite fermion (CF) liquids and fractional quantum Hall states, which are well explained in the picture of weakly interacting CF quasiparticles, are favored. Here we report the observation of an unexpected stripe/nematic phase in the \textit{lowest} LL at filling factor $\nu=5/8$ in ultrahigh-quality GaAs two-dimensional \textit{hole} systems, evinced by a pronounced in-plane transport anisotropy. Remarkably, $\nu=5/8$ can be mapped to a half-filled, high-index CF LL ($N_{\text{CF}}=2$), analogous to the $N=2$ hole LL. Our finding signals a novel stripe/nematic phase of CFs, driven by the residual long-range interaction among these emergent quasiparticles. This phase is surprisingly robust, surviving up to $\sim$100 mK. Its absence in electron-type systems suggests that severe LL mixing stemming from the large hole effective mass and non-linear LL fan diagram plays a crucial role in modifying the CF-CF interaction.</description>

      <title>Predicting the Thermal Conductivity Collapse in SWCNT Bundles: The Interplay of Symmetry Breaking and Scattering Revealed by Machine-Learning-Driven Quantum Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We combine machine learning (ML)-based neuroevolution potentials (NEP) with anharmonic lattice dynamics and the Boltzmann transport equation (ALD-BTE) to achieve a quantitative and mode-resolved description of thermal transport in individual (10, 0) zigzag single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and their bundles. Our analysis reveals a dual mechanism behind the drastic suppression of thermal conductivity in bundles: first, the breaking of rotational symmetry in isolated SWCNTs dramatically enhances the scattering rates of symmetry-sensitive phonon modes, such as the twist (TW) mode. Second, the emergence of new inter-tube phonon modes introduces abundant additional scattering channels across the entire frequency spectrum. Crucially, the incorporation of quantum Bose-Einstein (BE) statistics is essential to accurately capture these phenomena, enabling our approach to quantitatively reproduce experimental observations. This work establishes the combination of ML-driven interatomic potentials and ALD-BTE as a predictive framework for nanoscale thermal transport, effectively bridging the gap between theoretical models and experimental measurements.</description>

      <title>Electric fields induced spin and/or valley polarization in Weiss oscillations of monolayer 1{\it T}$^{\prime}$-$\mathrm{MoS}_{2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monolayer 1{\it T}$^{\prime}$-$\mathrm{MoS}_{2}$ exhibits spin- and valley-dependent massive tilted Dirac cones with two velocity correction terms in low-energy effective Hamiltonian. We theoretically investigate the longitudinal diffusive magneto-conductivity of monolayer 1{\it T}$^{\prime}$-$\mathrm{MoS}_{2}$ by using the linear response theory. It is shown that the Weiss oscillations are polarized in spin and valley degrees of freedom, under uniform electric fields and a weak one-dimensional spatially-periodic electrostatic potential modulation. The spin polarization, the valley polarization and the spin-valley polarization can be switched by flipping the external electric fields. The polarization is found not only in the amplitudes but also in the periods of the Weiss oscillations. It is found that the period polarization in Weiss oscillations originates from the polarized effective Fermi energies or the polarized Landau level spacing scales. In Weiss oscillations, polarization in amplitude does not imply the presence of polarization in period, whereas polarization in period is accompanied by polarization in amplitude. The superposition of polarization in amplitude and polarization in period enables the appearance of considerable polarization in Weiss oscillations under relatively weak external electric fields.</description>

Abstract: The dynamics of a cycloidal spin structure driven by an AC magnetic field is theoretically studied in the weak-field limit. A specific model Hamiltonian describing the cycloidal spin structure in a ferromagnetic thin film is constructed, and its dynamics is analyzed using the collective-coordinate approach within the Lagrangian formalism. We demonstrate that the cycloidal spin structure exhibits a unidirectional gliding motion under an AC magnetic field, and an expression for the average velocity is derived as a function of the magnitude, the direction, and the frequency of the AC magnetic field. We compare our theoretical predictions with the results of micromagnetic simulations and identify two resonance frequencies determined by the eigenenergies of the excitation modes. Furthermore, evaluating spin motive forces induced by the dynamics reveals a substantial DC voltage, which may be exploited in energy-harvesting devices utilizing ambient electromagnetic radiation.</description>

      <title>Quantum Hall effect in lightly hydrogenated graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have measured the quantum Hall effect in monolayer graphene samples that were exposed to a cold hydrogen plasma leading to a hydrogenation level of a few percent. Compared to pristine graphene, the Landau level distance significantly decreases in the hydrogenated structures, and its field dependence changes from square root type to linear. From this observation we conclude that the band structure in hydrogenated graphene changes from a linear Dirac-Weyl type dispersion to a quadratic one with an effective electron mass $m_e^* = 0.24~m_e$. This is in good agreement with ab-initio band structure calculations of hydrogen decorated graphene monolayer.</description>

      <title>Probing ground-state degeneracies of a strongly interacting Fermi-Hubbard model with superconducting correlations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Fermi-Hubbard model and its rich phase diagram naturally emerges as a description for a wide range of electronic systems. Recent advances in semiconductor-superconductor hybrid quantum dot arrays have allowed to realize degenerate quantum systems in a controllable way, e.g., allowing to observe robust zero-bias peaks in Kitaev chains, indicative for Majorana bound states. In this work, we connect these two domains. Noting the strong on-site Coulomb repulsion within quantum dots, we study small arrays of spinful hybrid quantum dots implemented in a two-dimensional electron gas. This system constitutes a Fermi-Hubbard model with inter-site superconducting correlations. For two electronic sites, we find robust zero-bias peaks indicative of a strongly degenerate spectrum hosting emergent Majorana Kramers pairs or $\mathbb{Z}_3$-parafermions. Extending to three sites, we find that these spinful systems scale very differently compared to spinless Kitaev chains. When the sweet-spot conditions are satisfied pairwise, we find that the ground state degeneracy of the full three-site system is lifted. This degeneracy can be restored by tuning the superconducting phase difference between the hybrid segments. However, these states are not robust to quantum dot detuning. Our observations are a first step towards studying degeneracies in strongly interacting Fermi-Hubbard systems with superconducting correlations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reproducibility and quantization in quantum spin Hall platforms is a persisting challenge, limiting their use in hybrid realizations of topological superconductivity. We report robust and reproducible quantized transport in a graphene quantum Hall topological insulator, stabilized at low magnetic fields by screening long-range Coulomb interactions with a metallic Bi$_2$Se$_3$ back gate. Beyond quantized resistance plateaus, we demonstrate mode-resolved control via gate-defined chiral-helical junctions that selectively transmit or backscatter a single helical channel, a capability inaccessible in time-reversal symmetric quantum spin Hall systems. Targeted experiments and simulations identify contact-induced doping, effectively creating unintended chiral-helical interfaces, as a generic mechanism for quantization breakdown, which is mitigated by large area contacts that enhance edge-channel equilibration. Our findings establish metal screened graphene as a gate-tunable, interaction-driven helical system with quantized transport, spatially separable helical channels, and compatibility with superconducting proximity for topological devices.</description>

      <title>Chirality Imprinting and Spin-texture Tunability in Conformally Coated 3D Magnetic Nanostructured Metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) magnetic nanostructures offer unprecedented opportunities for engineering emergent spin textures, but controlling their configuration remains a central challenge. Here we show that conformally coated Ni Nanotubes arranged in a woodpile geometry with lattice spacings ranging from 800 to 1200 nm, realised by two-photon lithography and atomic layer deposition, exhibit a geometry-tuneable balance between chiral and axial states. Magnetic force microscopy on the top layer of the 3D woodpile reveals that few-layer systems exhibit a chiral contrast whilst increasing the number of stacked layers drives a transition to an axial configuration with the change in state populations depending strongly on lattice spacing. Micromagnetic simulations demonstrate that chirality is not intrinsic to isolated tubes but is imprinted by spin textures formed in the substrate sheet film, which couple into the 3D network. As the sheet-film influence diminishes with increasing layer number, dipolar interactions dominate and stabilise the axial state. This two-stage mechanism of chirality imprinting followed by increasingly dominant dipolar interactions, provides clear control parameters for tailoring spin-texture populations. Our results establish conformally coated woodpiles as a reconfigurable 3D ferromagnetic metamaterial platform that can be exploited for data storage, magnonics, and neuromorphic computing.</description>

      <title>Theoretical investigation of patterned two-dimensional semiconductors for tailored light--matter interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce theoretical methods for describing the optical response of two-dimensional (2D) materials patterned at the nanoscale into both arrays of ribbons along a planar surface and spherical particles. Fourier-Floquet decompositions of the electromagnetic fields are used in order to obtain the reflectance, transmittance and absorbance of the nanoribbon array. The spherical particles consist of a vacuum or dielectric core, coated by single 2D material layers. A Mie theory, with boundary conditions modified to accommodate a 2D material at the interface, is applied to theoretically examine these spherical particles. As examples of 2D materials, we consider the excitonic response of hexagonal boron nitride in the ultraviolet, and of the transition-metal dichalcogenide WS2 in the visible. The most important steps and equations for implementing the various methods are provided as a means to an easy introduction to the theory of patterned 2D materials. This renders the article a toolset for investigating the patterning of any 2D material with the intention to tune their optical response and/or introduce hybridization schemes with their excitons. The methods are not restricted to exciton polaritons in 2D semiconductors, but can be applied, by simple replacement of the optical conductivity, to 2D materials exhibiting any polaritonic response.</description>

      <title>Transport of Dirac magnons driven by gauge fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a unified quantum field theory for Dirac magnons coupled to emergent gauge fields. At zero temperature, any space- and time-dependent gauge perturbation drives magnons out of equilibrium, generating spin currents and magnon accumulation without conventional thermal or chemical potential gradients. For a honeycomb ferromagnet, we derive closed-form expressions for the induced density and current. In the DC limit, the transverse spin conductivity quantizes to $\sigma^{xy}=\alpha^2\text{sgn}(m)\hbar/4\pi$, a magnonic analog of the quantum Hall effect, where $m$ is the topological magnon mass and $\alpha$ a dimensionless coupling constant. In the AC regime, the conductivity exhibits a sharp resonance when the drive frequency matches the topological gap $\Delta$, signaling interband transitions. Our work establishes gauge fields as a versatile tool for controlling magnon transport and reveals topologically protected quantized responses.</description>

      <title>Gate-Tunable Giant Negative Magnetoresistance in Tellurene Driven by Quantum Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Negative magnetoresistance in conventional two-dimensional electron gases is a well-known phenomenon, but its origin in complex and topological materials, especially those endowed with quantum geometry, remains largely elusive. Here, we report the discovery of a giant negative magnetoresistance, reaching a remarkable $- 90\%$ of the resistance at zero magnetic field, $R_0$, in $n$-type tellurene films. This record-breaking effect persists over a wide magnetic field range (measured up to $35$ T) at cryogenic temperatures and is suppressed when the chemical potential shifts away from the Weyl node in the conduction band, strongly suggesting a quantum geometric origin. We propose two novel mechanisms for this phenomenon: a quantum geometric enhancement of diffusion and a magnetoelectric spin interaction that locks the spin of a Weyl fermion, in cyclotron motion under crossed electric $\boldsymbol{\cal E}$ and magnetic ${\bf B}$ fields, to its guiding-center drift, $(\boldsymbol{\cal E}\times{\bf B})\cdot\sigma$. We show that the time integral of the velocity auto-correlations promoted by the quantum metric between the spin-split conduction bands enhance diffusion, thereby reducing the resistance. This mechanism is experimentally confirmed by its unique magnetoelectric dependence, $\Delta R_{zz}(\boldsymbol{\cal E},{\bf B})/R_0=-\beta_{g}(\boldsymbol{\cal E}\times{\bf B})^2$, with $\beta_{g}$ determined by the quantum metric. Our findings establish a new, quantum geometric and non-Markovian memory effect in magnetotransport, paving the way for controlling electronic transport in complex and topological matter.</description>

      <title>Linear magnetoresistance of two-dimensional massless Dirac fermions in the quantum limit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linear magnetoresistance is a hallmark of 3D Weyl metals in the quantum limit. Recently, a pronounced linear magnetoresistance has also been observed in 2D graphene [Xin et al., Nature 616, 270 (2023)]. However, a comprehensive theoretical understanding remains elusive. By employing the self-consistent Born approximation, we derive the analytical expressions for the magnetoresistivity of 2D massless Dirac fermions in the quantum limit. Notably, our result recovers the minimum conductivity in the clean limit and reveals a linear dependence of resistivity on the magnetic field for Gaussian impurity potentials, in quantitative agreement with experiments. These findings shed light on the magnetoresistance behavior of 2D Dirac fermions under ultra-high magnetic fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent topological tools offer a powerful way to classify how phases of nonlinear bosonic resonators are organized. Yet, they remain incomplete. In particular, self-sustained oscillations in the form of limit cycles act as robust organizing centers in phase space that are not captured by existing fixed-point-based approaches. In this work, we extend the flow topology framework for nonlinear resonators to include limit cycles as fundamental topological elements. Using a graph-based construction, we show how periodic attractors impact the global connectivity of phase-space flows. We illustrate the approach with a minimal nonlinear Van der Pol resonator model, where limit cycles coexist with stationary points. Our results provide a unified topological description of stationary and time-periodic phases in nonlinear bosonic systems, with direct relevance to photonic, superconducting, and optomechanical platforms, and raise new questions on synchronization and the extension of flow topology to the quantum regime.</description>

Abstract: Advancing the chemical synthesis of crystals is important for both fundamental research and practical applications of quantum materials. While established bulk-phase and thin-film growth methods have enabled enormous progress, synthesizing single crystals suitable for quantum electronic discoveries remains challenging for many emerging materials. Here, we introduce van der Waals (vdW) stacks as nanochemical reactors for single-crystal synthesis and demonstrate their broad applicability in growing both elemental and compound crystals at the micrometer scale. By encapsulating atomically thin reactants that are stacked compactly with inert vdW layers such as hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), we achieve nanoconfined synthesis with the resulting crystals remaining encapsulated. As proof of concept, we synthesized isolated single crystals of elemental tellurium and distinct types of Pd-Te compounds. Structural characterization, including atomic-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy, confirms the high crystalline quality of the products. We confirm the intrinsic semiconducting gap of tellurium and observe that non-stoichiometric PdTe1-x with a significantly reduced Te content (x ~ 0.18, a regime not previously achieved) retains uniform crystallinity and exhibits superconductivity below a critical temperature of 3.8 K. This nanochemical synthesis is broadly generalizable, chip-integrable, well-suited to a wide range of processing conditions, and compatible with nanofabrication routines for constructing devices. The concept of vdW nanoreactors offers a powerful and versatile pathway to expand the accessible landscape of quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Magnetic field-bias current interplay in HgTe-based three-terminal Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate HgTe/Nb-based three-terminal Josephson junctions in T-shaped and X-shaped geometries and their critical current contours (CCCs). By decomposing the CCCs into the contributions from individual junctions, we uncover how bias current and magnetic field jointly determine the collective Josephson behavior. A perpendicular magnetic field induces a tunable crossover between SQUID-like and Fraunhofer-like interference patterns, controlled by the applied bias. Moreover, magnetic flux produces pronounced deformations of the CCC, enabling symmetry control in the $(I_1,I_2)$ plane. Remarkably, we identify a regime of strongly enhanced Josephson diode efficiency, reaching values up to $\eta\approx 0.8$ at low bias and magnetic field. The experimental results are quantitatively reproduced by resistively shunted junction (RSJ) simulations, which capture the coupled dynamics of current and flux in these multi-terminal superconducting systems.</description>

      <title>Mid-circuit logic executed in the qubit layer of a quantum processor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.12648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Practical quantum computers need to continuously exchange data between classical and quantum subsystems during a computation. Mid-circuit measurements of a qubits state are transferred to the classical electronics layer, and their outcome can inform feedforward operations that close the loop back to the quantum layer. These operations are crucial for fault-tolerant quantum computers, but the quantum-classical loop must be completed before the qubits decohere, presenting a substantial engineering challenge for full-scale systems comprising millions of qubits. Here we perform the first mid-circuit measurements in a system of silicon spin qubits, and show that feedforward operations can be performed without needing to route information to the classical layer. This in-layer approach leverages a backaction-driven control technique that has previously been considered a source of error. We benchmark our in-layer strategy, together with the standard FPGA-enabled approach, and analyse the performance of both methods using gate set tomography. Our results provide the first step towards moving resource-intensive classical processing into the quantum layer, an advance that could solve key engineering challenges, and drastically reduce the power budget of future quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Developing a valence force field model for wurtzite semiconductors by exploiting similarities with [111]-oriented zinc blende systems: The case of wurtzite boron nitride, III-N materials and (B,In,Ga)N alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Controlling the crystal phase and lattice mismatch of semiconductors offers a powerful route to engineer electronic and optical properties of heterostructures. As a consequence, semiconductors in the wurtzite phase are increasingly sought after, superseding the thermodynamically favored cubic zinc blende phase. Empirical atomistic modeling, required for large scale simulations of heterostructures and their properties, relies heavily on valence force field (VFF) methods to find the equilibrium atomic positions in an alloy. For zinc blende crystals, VFF models are well-established. In the case of wurtzite, such parameters are frequently adopted without rigorous analysis, despite subtle but consequential differences from the zinc blende structure. Such an approach can compromise accuracy in describing material properties, since the structural differences between zinc blende and wurtzite directly influence electronic and optical characteristics. Based on the analytical VFF model by Tanner et al., and using structural similarities between wurtzite and [111]-oriented zinc blende, we construct a wurtzite VFF without introducing additional parameters. Our framework relies on analytic expressions and minimization routines to project zinc blende models onto wurtzite systems. Beyond elastic tensors, we train the model to reproduce bond length asymmetries and band gaps by using output of the VFF model in density functional theory calculations. Applied to wurtzite III-N compounds and BN, the model accurately reproduces targeted observables but also properties it has not been trained on, including the internal parameter u. We further validate the model on highly mismatched alloys such as (B,Ga)N and (B,In,Ga)N, exhibiting good agreement between VFF and density functional theory results when using identical supercells in these calculations.</description>

      <title>Generation of chirality and orbital magnetization by Stone-Wales-type lattice defects in the Kitaev spin liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we extend our study of the effect of certain crystallographic defects on the spin-1/2 Kitaev honeycomb spin liquid (arXiv:2511.19409), focusing on its gapless phase and contrasting with the gapped phase. We identify a Stone-Wales (SW) local defect consisting of a 90$^\circ$ bond rotation that preserves Kitaev bond labels for edge-sharing octahedra and thereby enables exact solvability. These SW-type defects involve odd-sided plaquettes with $\pm \pi/2$ fluxes, but can be created locally. An isolated defect hosts a time-reversal pair of ground-state flux configurations with large net chirality. Certain excitations are also chiral. The chirality manifests in Majorana local Chern marker and in scalar spin chirality, producing electronic orbital magnetization. T-matrix analysis and numerics at finite defect density $n_d$ show that defect chiralities generate a topological gap of $11 n_d$ protecting a Chern number $C=\pm 1$. Emergent ferromagnetic long range Ising interactions $r^{-\gamma}$ with $2&lt;\gamma &lt; 3$ between defect chiralities lead to a finite temperature $T_c$ phase transition into the chiral spin liquid. The $T_c$ is proportional to $n_d$ and diverges when $\gamma\rightarrow 2$. We also consider additional solvable impurity potentials and find that $\gamma$ can be reduced to below $2.3$ and correspondingly enhance $T_c$. Our results offer applications to 2D Dirac cone systems with a finite density of fluctuating Ising magnetic impurities and to identifying spin liquids with lattice defects.</description>

      <title>Multi-Photon Lasing Phenomena in Quantum Dot-Cavity QED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-photon lasing has been realized in systems with strong nonlinear interactions between emitters and cavity modes, where single-photon processes are suppressed. Coherence between the internal states of a quantum emitter, or among multiple emitters, plays a key role. Such continuous nonclassical sources of light can find applications in quantum computation, quantum sensing, quantum metrology, and quantum communication.
  This thesis explores the multi-photon lasing phenomena in various quantum dot-photonic crystal cavity quantum electrodynamic (QED) setups. Exciton-phonon interactions are inevitable in such systems and are incorporated using the polaron-transformed master equation. The Born-Markov approximation is employed to obtain the reduced density matrix rate equation. Using quantum laser theory, we derived the Scully-Lamb laser rate equations and evaluated the single- and multi-photon excess emission rates defined as the difference between emission and absorption rates into the cavity mode without mean-field approximations. We investigated cooperative two-photon lasing, correlated emission lasing, hyperradiant lasing, non-degenerate two-mode two-photon lasing, and continuous variable entanglement in open quantum systems with single or multiple semiconductor quantum dots (two-level, three-level, and four-level) driven coherently/incoherently and coupled to single/ bimodal cavities.</description>

      <title>Three-qubit entangling gates with simultaneous exchange controls in spin qubit systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pairwise exchange couplings have long been the standard mechanism for entangling spin qubits in semiconductor systems. However, implementing quantum circuits based on pairwise exchange gates often requires a lengthy sequence of elementary gate operations. In this work, we present an alternative approach: multi-qubit entangling gate operations that simultaneously drive the exchange couplings between multiple pairs of spin qubits. We explore three spin qubit systems in linear or triangular configurations. We derive analytical expressions for these multi-exchange entangling operations and demonstrate how to use the resulting three-qubit gates to construct quantum circuits capable of generating standard entangled states such as GHZ and W states, and the Toffoli gate, by optimizing control parameters. Our results show that this multi-qubit strategy significantly reduces the number of required operations, offering a pathway to more efficient, shallower, and more coherent circuits for spin-qubit processors.</description>

      <title>Transition from Population to Coherence-dominated Non-diffusive Thermal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deviations from diffusive heat transport in high thermal conductivity crystalline insulators are generally understood within the framework of the phonon Boltzmann Transport Equation. However, for low thermal conductivity materials with large primitive cells or strong anharmonicity, the recently developed Wigner Transport Equation is more appropriate as it includes tunnelling between overlapping phonon bands. In this work, via solutions to the Wigner Transport Equation, we develop a scheme to obtain the dynamics of the phonon populations and coherences as a function of an arbitrary heat source. The approach is applied to predict size effects and dynamical thermal conductivities in CsPbBr3 and La2Zr2O7 using first-principles data as input. We predict significant deviations from the bulk thermal conductivity in these materials at length scales on the order of hundreds of nanometers to a few microns at room temperature, well within the reach of direct observation using current experimental techniques.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.07790v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate rapid adiabatic passage (RAP) based super-resolution microscopy in a two-level quantum dot (QD) system. The system consists of a QD interacting with two structured beams, accompanied by chirping and a time delay. The central concept of this work is inspired by the stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy technique. To understand the physical mechanism behind super-resolved spot formation, we employ a variational master equation for the density matrix, incorporating both radiative and non-radiative decay processes. A suitably chosen spatiotemporal envelope of the structured beams enables the formation of a super-resolved image. Unwanted low-intensity circular rings around the focal spot are suppressed using Bessel-modulated truncated structured Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) and super-Gaussian (SG) beams. We also study the temperature dependence of the imaging scheme. The numerical results confirm that at low pulse areas, exciton-phonon coupling distorts the image, whereas at higher pulse areas, exciton-phonon decoupling preserves the image resolution. Hence, the proposed scheme may open up new possibilities for nanoscale imaging and bioimaging applications using QDs.</description>

Abstract: In the emergent field of quantum technology, the ability to manage heat at the nanoscale and in cryogenic conditions is crucial for enhancing device performance in terms of noise, coherence, and sensitivity. Here, we demonstrate the active cooling and refrigeration of the electron gas in a graphene thermal transistor, by taking advantage of nanoscale superconductive tunnel contacts able to pump or extract heat directly from the electrons in the device. Our prototypes achieved a top cooling of electrons in graphene of about 15 mK at a bath temperature of about 450 mK, demonstrating the viability of the proposed device architecture. Our experimental findings are backed by a detailed thermal model that accurately replicated the observed device behavior. Alternative cooling schemes and perspectives are discussed in light of the reported results. Finally, our graphene thermal transistor could find application in superconducting hybrid quantum technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.24208v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Laughlin state embodies a universal class of fractional quantum Hall effects arising in two-dimensional electron systems subjected to strong perpendicular magnetic fields. Conventionally described by a single-component wavefunction, the Laughlin state features fractionally charged quasiparticles arising from correlations within one electron species. Here, we explore a novel physical situation by introducing inter-species Coulomb coupling between two intra-species Laughlin states in a quantum Hall graphene bilayer structure. Although quasiparticle excitations typically exhibit charge gaps of tens of Kelvin, we observe that this energy scale is significantly lowered through interlayer excitonic pairing between quasiparticles and quasiholes. Identified via transport measurements, these excitons belong to an unprecedented category of charge-neutral anyons, opening a new avenue for investigating exotic quantum statistics and phases of matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09954v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spontaneous symmetry breaking provides a powerful window into the nature of underlying electronic orders. In strongly correlated systems, multiple symmetry-breaking orders can arise simultaneously. and their interplay generates an intricate landscape of quantum phases that has remained a central focus of condensed-matter research. In this work, we report a previously unidentified electronic phase in rhombohedral hexalayer graphene, distinguished by the simultaneous breaking of rotational, time-reversal, and inversion symmetries. Broken rotational symmetry is evidenced through anisotropic transport in angle-resolved measurements, while the onset of both the anomalous Hall effect and the nonlinear Hall effect signals the breaking of time-reversal and inversion symmetries. These combined signatures reveal an emergent order consistent with momentum-space condensation, a theoretically anticipated phenomenon realized here experimentally for the first time. This mechanism establishes a natural framework for understanding a broader class of correlated phases known to emerge from the flat bands of two-dimensional materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18063v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Synthetic gauge fields and non-Hermitian skin effects are pivotal to topological phases and non-Hermitian physics, each recently attracting great interest across diverse research fields. Realizing skin effects typically require nonreciprocal couplings or on-site gain and loss. Here, we theoretically and experimentally report that, under gauge fields, reciprocal dissipative couplings can nontrivially give rise to an unprecedented nonreciprocal skin effect, hosting pseudospin degree of freedom and featuring helical transport, dubbed as the ``helical pseudospin skin effect". Before introducing the gauge fields, this model exhibits localized pseudospin edge modes and extended bulk modes, without skin effects. As the gauge field strength is applied from $0$ to $\pi$, we observe the emergence of two distinct pseudospin skin effects and their topological transitions: the hybrid-order and second-order helical pseudospin skin effects. Our findings not only highlight gauge field enriched non-Hermitian topology, but also brings pseudospin-momentum locking into skin effects.</description>

Abstract: We investigate higher-order topological insulators protected by chiral and anticommuting mirror symmetries. Using models in the BDI class, which include the prototypical topological quadrupole insulator, we show that breaking mirror symmetries that anticommute with the chiral operator leads to edge-selective bulk-boundary correspondence, with gap closings and bound states appearing only along a subset of boundaries of the same orientation and codimension. We define a new edge-sensitive topological invariant that distinguishes this mechanism from previous reports of non-topological edge-selection effects.</description>

Abstract: We study the van der Waals-London force, which is typically associated with fluctuating dipoles in atoms, in a mesoscopic circuit consisting of two inductively coupled superconducting loops. We investigate the ``inductive" van der Waals-London interaction using both semiclassical and quantum electrodynamic (QED) approaches. The semiclassical model predicts a repulsive interaction due to anticorrelated current fluctuations. In contrast, the QED framework, which incorporates virtual photon exchange, reveals a predominantly attractive force. A key contribution comes from a state-independent two-photon exchange, which is absent in the semiclassical description and undetectable by spectroscopy. Our study introduces a new experimental platform for measuring the van der Waals force between individual artificial atoms via controlled mesoscopic circuits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05014v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that an anisotropic and rotated Fermi surface can generate a finite transverse response in electron transport, even in the absence of a magnetic field or Berry curvature. Using a two-dimensional continuum model, we show that broken $k_y \to -k_y$ symmetry inherent to anistropic bandstructures leads to a nonzero transverse conductivity. We construct a lattice model with direction-dependent nearest- and next-nearest-neighbor hoppings that faithfully reproduces the continuum dispersion and allows controlled rotation of the Fermi contour. Employing a multiterminal geometry and the B\"uttiker-probe method, we compute the resulting transverse voltage and establish its direct correspondence with the continuum transverse response. The effect increases with the degree of anisotropy and vanishes at rotation angles where mirror symmetry is restored. Unlike the quantum Hall effect, the transverse response predicted here is not quantized but varies continuously with the band-structure parameters. Our results provide a symmetry-based route to engineer transverse signals in low-symmetry materials without magnetic fields or topological effects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.09245v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a coupled nonlinear cavity-magnon system, consisting of two cavities, a second-order nonlinear element, and a yttrium-iron-garnet (YIG) sphere that supports Kerr magnons, to realize the sought-after highly tunable nonreciprocity. We first derive the critical condition for switching between reciprocity and nonreciprocity in the absence of magnon driving, and then numerically demonstrate that strong magnonic nonreciprocity can be achieved by violating this critical condition. When magnons are driven, we show that strong magnonic nonreciprocity can also be attained even within the critical condition. Compared to previous studies, the introduced nonlinear element not only relaxes the critical condition in both the weak and strong coupling regimes, but also offers an alternative means to tune magnonic nonreciprocity. Our work provides a promising avenue for realizing highly tunable nonreciprocal devices based on Kerr magnons.</description>

Abstract: Quantum simulation is making a significant impact on scientific research. The prevailing tendency of the field is to build quantum simulators that get closer to real-world systems of interest, in particular electronic materials. However, progress in the microscopic design also provides an opportunity for an orthogonal research direction: building quantum many-body systems beyond real-world limitations. This colloquium takes this perspective: Concentrating on synthetic quantum matter in non-standard lattice geometries, such as fractal lattices or quasicrystals, higher-dimensional or curved spaces, it aims at providing a fresh introduction to the field of quantum simulation aligned with recent trends across various quantum simulation platforms, including atomic, photonic, and electronic devices. We also shine light on the novel phenomena which arise from these geometries: Condensed matter physicists may appreciate the variety of different localization properties as well as novel topological phases which are offered by such exotic quantum simulators. But also in the search of quantum models for gravity and cosmology, quantum simulators of curved spaces can provide a useful experimental tool.</description>

      <title>Self-consistent tensor network method for correlated super-moir\'e matter beyond one billion sites</title>

Abstract: Moir\'e and super-moir\'e materials provide exceptional platforms to engineer exotic correlated quantum matter. The vast number of sites required to model moir\'e systems in real space remains a formidable challenge due to the immense computational resources required. Super-moir\'e materials push this requirement to the limit, where millions or even billions of sites need to be considered, a requirement beyond the capabilities of conventional methods for interacting systems. Here, we establish a methodology that allows solving correlated states in systems reaching a billion sites, that exploits tensor-network representations of real-space Hamiltonians and self-consistent real-space mean-field equations. Our method combines a tensor-network kernel polynomial method with quantics tensor cross interpolation algorithm, enabling us to solve exponentially large models, including those whose single particle Hamiltonian is too large to be stored explicitly. We demonstrate our methodology with super-moir\'e systems featuring spatially modulated hoppings, many-body interactions and domain walls, showing that it allows access to self-consistent symmetry broken states and spectral functions of real-space models reaching a billion sites. Our methodology provides a strategy to solve exceptionally large interacting problems, providing a widely applicable strategy to compute correlated super-moir\'e quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Extrinsic contribution to bosonic thermal Hall transport</title>

Abstract: Bosonic excitations like phonons and magnons dominate the low-temperature transport of magnetic insulators. Similar to electronic Hall responses, the thermal Hall effect (THE) of charge neutral bosons has been proposed as a powerful tool for probing topological properties of their wavefunctions. For example, the intrinsic contribution of the THE of a perfectly clean system is directly governed by the distribution of Berry curvature, and many experiments on topological magnon and phonon insulators have been interpreted in this way. However, disorder is inevitably present in any material and its contribution to the THE has remained poorly understood. Here we develop a rigorous kinetic theory of the extrinsic side-jump contribution to the THE of bosons. We show that the extrinsic THE can be of the same order as the intrinsic one but sensitively depends on the type of local imperfection. We study different types of impurities and show that a THE can even arise as a pure impurity-induced effect in a system with a vanishing intrinsic contribution. As a side product, we also generalize existing results for the electronic AHE to general types of impurities beyond the standard assumption of local potential scattering. We discuss the importance of our results for the correct interpretation of THE measurements.</description>

      <title>Perpendicularly magnetized Tb/Co multilayers featuring tilted uniaxial anisotropy: Experiments and modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14849v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rare earth/transition metal (RE/TM) multilayers with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy are key ingredients for the development of spintronic applications. Their compensation temperature depends on the ratio of the thicknesses of rare earth and transition metal, allowing their magnetic properties to be tuned with temperature while maintaining their anisotropy even in nanometer-scale devices. In this work, we performed a thorough structural characterization and systematically investigate the magnetic properties of a whole family of ferrimagnetic [Tb/Co]$_{\times 5}$ multilayers varying the Tb thickness in the range of 0.4 nm - 1.25 nm. A linear dependence of the compensation temperature on the Tb layer thickness was observed. Moreover, a uniaxial anisotropy constant of 330$\pm$30 kJ/m$^3$, which is close to the values reported by other authors, was estimated. Additionally, we proposed a model to gain a better understanding of the angular dependence of the magnetization loops and the linear dependence of the compensation temperature. We present strong evidence demonstrating that the perpendicular anisotropy must be tilted away from the perpendicular axis in order to explain the observed features, particularly the hysteresis in the in-plane loops. Our work advances the understanding of DC magnetic properties in thin RE/TM ferrimagnetic films, which has the potential to impact different fields where these materials are involved.</description>

      <title>Strong coupling of collective optical resonances in dielectric metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09117v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dielectric metasurfaces can achieve strong light-matter interaction based on several types of collective (nonlocal) resonances, such as surface lattice resonances (SLRs) and quasi bound states in the continuum (quasi-BICs). Spectral selectivity, field enhancement, and high and controllable Q-factors make these resonances appealing for technological applications in lasing, sensing, nonlinear optics, and quantum photon sources. An emerging challenge focuses on tailoring light-matter interaction via mode coupling and hybridization between the fundamental resonances of a metasurface. While strong coupling phenomena have been demonstrated between various resonant modes, the interplay between collective resonances of different natures has not been observed to date. Here, we theoretically, numerically, and experimentally demonstrate the onset of coupling and hybridization between symmetry-protected quasi-BICs and SLRs in a dielectric metasurface. We show the emergence of anticrossing (or Rabi splitting) in the strong coupling regime with suppression of reflection, observed under TE-polarised excitation, and the manifestation of an accidental BIC under TM-polarised illumination as a result of energy exchange between the participating collective resonances in the weak coupling regime. The first effect is accompanied by hybridized near fields of the modes. The observed coupling mechanisms can be controlled by modifying the angle of incidence, polarisation, and surrounding environment. This foundational study on the coupling and hybridization of collective resonances offers insights that can be leveraged for the design of metasurfaces with targeted quasi-aBIC and collective hybridized resonances. It could also open new possibilities to control the near fields associated with such resonances, with promising applications in tunable nanophotonics and light manipulation.</description>

      <title>Dipole-quadrupole model and multipole analysis of resonant membrane metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11864v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Membrane-metasurfaces, formed by periodic arrangements of holes in a dielectric layer, are gaining attention for their easier manufacturing via subtractive techniques, unnecessity of substrates, and access to resonant near-fields. Despite their practical relevance, their theoretical description remains elusive. Here, we present a semi-analytical dipole-quadrupole model for the multipole analysis of numerically-obtained reflection and transmission spectra in metasurfaces excited at arbitrary angles. Dipole models are generally sufficient to study traditional metasurfaces made of solid nanostructures. However, the inclusion of electric and magnetic quadrupoles is necessary to study membrane-metasurfaces, which offer an ideal platform to showcase our method. We demonstrate the importance of choosing the optimal position of a symmetric membrane-metasurface's unit cell to ensure the sufficiency of the dipole-quadrupole approximation. We show that our formalism can explain complex phenomena arising from inter-multipole interference, including lattice anapole and generalized Kerker effects, Fano resonances, and quasi-bound states in the continuum. We also present the applicability of the method to membrane-metasurfaces with non-centrosymmetric unit cells (e.g., conical holes and surface voids). By enabling a deeper insight into the coupling mechanisms leading to the formation of local and collective resonances, our method expands the electromagnetics toolbox to study, understand, and design conventional and membrane-metasurfaces.</description>
