      <title>Combination therapy for colorectal cancer with anti-PD-L1 and cancer vaccine: A multiscale mathematical model of tumor-immune interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The tumor-immune system plays a critical role in colorectal cancer progression. Recent preclinical and clinical studies showed that combination therapy with anti-PD-L1 and cancer vaccines improved treatment response. In this study, we developed a multiscale mathematical model of interactions among tumors, immune cells, and cytokines to investigate tumor evolutionary dynamics under different therapeutic strategies. Additionally, we established a computational framework based on approximate Bayesian computation to generate virtual tumor samples and capture inter-individual heterogeneity in treatment response. The results demonstrated that a multiple low-dose regimen significantly reduced advanced tumor burden compared to baseline treatment in anti-PD-L1 therapy. In contrast, the maximum dose therapy yielded superior tumor growth control in cancer vaccine therapy. Furthermore, cytotoxic T cells were identified as a consistent predictive biomarker both before and after treatment initiation. Notably, the cytotoxic T cells-to-regulatory T cells ratio specifically served as a robust pre-treatment predictive biomarker, offering potential clinical utility for patient stratification and therapy personalization.</description>

      <title>Learning virulence-transmission relationships using causal inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The relationship between traits that influence pathogen virulence and transmission is part of the central canon of the evolution and ecology of infectious disease. However, identifying directional and mechanistic relationships among traits remains a key challenge in various subfields of biology, as models often assume static, fixed links between characteristics. Here, we introduce learning evolutionary trait relationships (LETR), a data-driven framework that applies Granger-causality principles to determine which traits drive others and how these relationships change over time. LETR integrates causal discovery with generative mapping and transfer-operator analysis to link short-term predictability with long-term trait distributions. Using a synthetic myxomatosis virus-host data set, we show that LETR reliably recovers known directional influences, such as virulence driving transmission. Applying the framework to global pandemic (SARS-CoV-2) data, we find that past virulence improves future transmission prediction, while the reverse effect is weak. Invariant-density estimates reveal a long-term trend toward low virulence and transmission, with bimodality in virulence suggesting ecological influences or host heterogeneity. In summary, this study provides a blueprint for learning the relationship between how harmful a pathogen is and how well it spreads, which is highly idiosyncratic and context-dependent. This finding undermines simplistic models and encourages the development of new theory for the constraints underlying pathogen evolution. Further, by uniting causal inference with dynamical modeling, the LETR framework offers a general approach for uncovering mechanistic trait linkages in complex biological systems of various kinds.</description>

      <title>Specieslike clusters based on identical ancestor points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce several axioms which may or may not hold for any given subgraph of the directed graph of all organisms (past, present and future) where edges represent biological parenthood, with the simplifying background assumption that life does not go extinct. We argue these axioms are plausible for species: if one were to define species based purely on genealogical relationships, it would be reasonable to define them in such a way as to satisfy these axioms. The main axiom we introduce, which we call the identical ancestor point axiom, states that for any organism in any species, either the species contains at most finitely many descendants of that organism, or else the species contains at most finitely many non-descendants of that organism. We show that this (together with a convexity axiom) reduces the subjectivity of species, in a technical sense. We call connected sets satisfying these two axioms "specieslike clusters." We consider the question of identifying a set of biologically plausible constraints that would guarantee every organism inhabits a maximal specieslike cluster subject to those constraints. We provide one such set consisting of two constraints and show that no proper subset thereof suffices.</description>

      <title>Intermittent precipitation and spatial Allee effects drive irregular vegetation patterns in semiarid ecosystems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vegetation in semi-arid ecosystems frequently organizes into spatially heterogeneous mosaics that regulate ecosystem functioning, productivity, and resilience. These patterns arise from local biological interactions, including facilitation among neighboring plants and competition for limiting resources. Classical theoretical approaches have attributed such organization to scale-dependent feedbacks, predicting regular spatial patterns and abrupt transitions to collapse. However, growing empirical and theoretical evidence reveal that environmental variability and demographic stochasticity can fundamentally reshape spatial organization, driving irregular clusters, dynamic mosaics, and gradual rather than catastrophic vegetation declines. In drylands, rainfall variability is a dominant source of environmental forcing: precipitation typically occurs in short, irregular pulses that transiently enhance survival and recruitment before competitive interactions again dominate. Near persistence thresholds, ecosystem dynamics are therefore governed not only by average climatic conditions but also by the timing and spatial coincidence of favorable events. Under these conditions, positive density dependence and local facilitation can critically determine whether vegetation patches persist, expand, or collapse. Here, we develop an individual-based model that integrates intermittent precipitation with local Allee effects to examine how stochastic rainfall shapes spatial organization and persistence. We show that the interaction between pulsed resource availability and density-dependent survival generates irregular cluster structures and strongly modulates extinction risk, with resilience emerging from local spatial covariance and neighborhood density rather than from total biomass alone. These results highlight the importance of individual-level, stochastic processes in determining ecosystem resilience.</description>

      <title>Optimal Harvesting in Stream Networks: Maximizing Biomass and Yield</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we develop a metapopulation model framework to identify optimal harvesting strategies for a population in a stream network. We consider two distinct optimization objectives: maximization of total biomass and maximization of total yield, under the constraint of a fixed total harvesting effort. We examine in detail the special case of a two-patch network and fully characterize the optimal strategies for each objective. We show that when the population growth rate exceeds a critical threshold, a single harvesting strategy can simultaneously maximize both objectives. For general $n$-patch networks with homogeneous growth rates across patches, we focus on the regime of large growth rates and demonstrate that the optimal harvesting strategy selects patches according to their intraspecific competition rates and an effective net flow metric determined by network connectivity parameters.</description>
