      <title>An Invitation to Obstruction Bundle Gluing Through Morse Flow Lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We adapt "Obstruction Bundle Gluing (OBG)" techniques from Hutchings and Taubes (arxiv: 0701300, 0705.2074) to Morse theory. We consider Morse function-metric pairs with gradient flowlines that have nontrivial yet well-controlled cokernels (i.e., the gradient flowlines are not transversely cut out). We investigate (i) whether these nontransverse gradient flowlines can be glued to other gradient flowlines and (ii) the bifurcation of gradient flowlines after we perturb the metric to be Morse-Smale. For the former, we show that certain three-component broken flowlines with total Fredholm index 2 can be glued to a one-parameter family of flowlines of the given metric if and only if an explicit (essentially combinatorial, and straightforward to verify) criterion is satisfied. For the latter, we provide a similar combinatorial criterion of when certain 2-level broken Morse flowlines of total Fredholm index 1 glue to index 1 gradient flowlines after perturbing the metric. Our primary example is the ``upright torus," which has a flowline between the two index-1 critical points.</description>

      <title>A vanishing property about the 1-filtered cohomology groups of (4n+2)-dimensional closed symplectic manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This note is a follow-up to our previous work arXiv:2505.14496. For any (4n+2)-dimensional closed symplectic manifold, we find that the dimension of the even-degree part of its 1-filtered cohomology is even, similar to the vanishing property of the classical Euler characteristic of an odd-dimensional closed manifold. We prove our result by constructing and then deforming a skew-adjoint operator. This process follows the methods in arXiv:2505.14496 but needs adjustments on signs and the power of the symplectic form.</description>

      <title>From Morse Functions to Lefschetz Fibrations on Cotangent Bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that, for any Morse function on a compact manifold and any adapted gradient satisfying the Morse-Smale condition, there is a homotopically unique complex-valued symplectic Lefschetz fibration on the cotangent bundle whose restriction to the zero-section is the given function, whose imaginary part is the evaluation of covectors on the gradient, and which is equivariant under the actions of the fiberwise antipodal involution and the complex conjugation. Then we study the topology and symplectic geometry of the regular fibers of this fibration, which are well-defined Weinstein manifolds.</description>

      <title>Explicitly Computing with Fukaya Categories of Surfaces with Boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fukaya categories are deep and rich invariants of symplectic manifolds which are notoriously difficult to compute explicitly. In the case of surfaces, however, the situation is simple, combinatorial,and is very well understood (at least by experts). In this expository paper we will give an introduction with many examples to welcome newcomers to the area and hopefully equip them with the tools to independently compute Fukaya categories of surfaces.</description>

      <title>Semitoric Families on Pentagon Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semitoric systems are a special type of 4-dimensional integrable system where one of the functions is the moment map of a Hamiltonian $S^1$-action. These systems were classified by Pelayo and V{\~u} Ng\d{o}c, but there are not many explicit examples. Recently, Le Floch and Palmer introduced semitoric transition families in which a singular point transitions between elliptic-elliptic type and focus-focus type as the parameter varies. In this paper, we construct semitoric transition families on pentagon spaces by interpolating two semitoric systems of toric type. More specifically, we show that there exists a unique singular point that changes from elliptic-elliptic type to focus-focus type and back to elliptic-elliptic type as the parameter varies.</description>

      <title>Autoequivalences of Fukaya categories of surfaces and graded gentle algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the derived Picard groups of partially wrapped Fukaya categories of surfaces in the sense of Haiden-Katzarkov-Kontsevich and the related graded gentle algebras. An important ingredient in characteristic zero is the exponential map from Hochschild cohomology to the derived Picard group introduced in recent work by the author. To prove our results in positive characteristic, we combine deformation theory and formality results for Hochschild complexes. Along the way we show that the surface together with its decorations forms a complete derived invariant of partially wrapped Fukaya categories and we prove analogous results for graded gentle algebras. This removes all previous restrictions from earlier results of this kind.</description>

      <title>Torus bundle Liouville domains are stably Weinstein</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.07615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.07615v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop explicit local operations that may be applied to Liouville domains, with the goal of simplifying the dynamics of the Liouville vector field. These local operations, which are Liouville homotopies, are inspired by the techniques used by Honda and Huang in [HH19] to show that convex hypersurfaces are $C^0$-generic in contact manifolds. As an application, we use our operations to show that certain Liouville-but-not-Weinstein domains constructed by Huang in [Hua20] are stably Weinstein.</description>

      <title>Floer theory for the variation operator of an isolated singularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17453v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The variation operator in singularity theory maps relative homology cycles to compact cycles in the Milnor fiber using the monodromy. We construct its symplectic analogue for an isolated singularity. We define the monodromy Lagrangian Floer cohomology, which provides categorifications of the standard theorems on the variation operator and the Seifert form. The key ingredients are a special class $\Gamma$ in the symplectic cohomology of the inverse of the monodromy and its closed-open images. For isolated plane curve singularities whose A'Campo divide has depth zero, we find an exceptional collection consisting of non-compact Lagrangians in the Milnor fiber corresponding to a distinguished collection of vanishing cycles under the variation operator.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08204v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the existence of a subclass of overtwisted contact structures, called strongly overtwisted, on a 3-manifold that satisfy a complete h-principle without prescribing the contact structures over any subset of the 3-manifold. As a consequence, the homotopy type of the space of overtwisted disk embeddings into a strongly overtwisted contact 3-manifold is determined. A complete h-principle for a subclass of loose Legendrians is also derived from the main result. In general, the method allows us to deduce an h-principle for overtwisted disks that are fixed near the boundary in an arbitrary overtwisted contact 3-manifold.</description>

      <title>Closed Orbits of Dynamically Convex Reeb Flows: Towards the HZ- and Multiplicity Conjectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13093v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the multiplicity problem for prime closed orbits of dynamically convex Reeb flows on the boundary of a star-shaped domain in $\mathbb{R}^{2n}$. The first of our two main results asserts that such a flow has at least $n$ prime closed Reeb orbits, improving the previously known lower bound by a factor of two and settling a long-standing open question. The second main theorem is that when, in addition, the domain is centrally symmetric and the Reeb flow is non-degenerate, the flow has either exactly $n$ or infinitely many prime closed orbits. This is a higher-dimensional contact variant of Franks' celebrated $2$-or-infinity theorem and, viewed from the symplectic dynamics perspective, settles a particular case of the contact Hofer-Zehnder conjecture. The proofs are based on several auxiliary results of independent interest on the structure of the filtered symplectic homology and the properties of closed orbits.</description>

      <title>Koszul dual $\mathcal{A}_{\infty}$ algebras for star-shaped diagrams -- Part 1</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01564v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By slicing the Heegaard diagram for a given $3$-manifold in a particular way, it is possible to construct $\mathcal{A}_{\infty}$-bimodules, the tensor product of which retrieves the Heegaard Floer homology of the original 3-manifold. The first step in this is to construct algebras corresponding to the individual slices. Here, we use the graphical calculus for $\mathcal{A}_{\infty}$-structures introduced by Lipshitz, Ozsv\'ath, and Thurston, to construct Koszul dual weighted $\mathcal{A}_{\infty}$-algebras $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$, and dualizing bimodules for a particular star-shaped class of slice. The duality result is then proved in the sequel.</description>

      <title>On novel Hamiltonian descriptions of some three-dimensional non-conservative systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10729v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present novel Hamiltonian descriptions of some three-dimensional systems including two well-known systems describing the three-wave-interaction problem and some well-known chaotic systems, namely, the Chen, L\"u, and Qi systems. We show that all of these systems can be described in a Hamiltonian framework in which the Poisson matrix $\mathcal{J}$ is supplemented by a resistance matrix $\mathcal{R}$. While such resistive-Hamiltonian systems are manifestly non-conservative, we construct higher-degree Poisson matrices via the Jordan product as $\mathcal{N} = \mathcal{J} \mathcal{R} + \mathcal{R} \mathcal{J}$, thereby leading to new bi-Hamiltonian systems. Finally, we discuss conformal Hamiltonian dynamics on Poisson manifolds and demonstrate that by appropriately choosing the underlying parameters, the reduced three-wave-interaction model as well as the Chen and L\"u systems can be described in this manner where the concomitant non-conservative part of the dynamics is described with the aid of the Euler vector field.</description>

      <title>The $r$-matrix structure on the moduli space of framed Higgs pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11408v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: On the space of matrices with rational (trigonometric/elliptic) entries there is a well-known Lie-Poisson $r$-matrix structure. The known $r$-matrices are defined on the Riemann sphere (rational), the cylinder (trigonometric), or the torus (elliptic). We extend the formalism to the case of a Riemann surface $\mathcal C$ of higher genus $g$: we consider the moduli space of framed vector bundles of rank $n$ and degree $ng$, where the framing consists in a choice of basis of $n$ independent holomorphic sections chosen to trivialize the fiber at a given point $\infty\in \mathcal C$. The co-tangent space is known to be identified with the set of Higgs fields, i.e., one-forms on $\mathcal C$ with values in the endomorphisms of the vector bundle, with an additional simple pole at $\infty$. The natural symplectic structure on the co-tangent bundle of the moduli space induces a Poisson structure on the Higgs fields. The result is then an explicit $r$--matrix that generalizes the known ones. A detailed discussion of the elliptic case with comparison to the literature is also provided.</description>
