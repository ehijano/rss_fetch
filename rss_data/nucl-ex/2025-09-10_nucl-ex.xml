      <title>Proceedngs of Charmonium production in heavy-ion collisions, Quark Matter 2025</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The early production of heavy quarks ($c\bar{c}$ and $b\bar{b}$) makes charmonia an ideal probe to study the evolution of the hot and dense medium produced in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions, known as the quark--gluon plasma (QGP). At LHC energies, the well established suppression of charmonium yield from color screening in the QGP is counterbalanced by the recombination of uncorrelated charm-quark pairs, either throughout the QGP phase or solely at the phase boundary. Systematic measurements of charmonium ground and excited states are important to discriminate between the scenarios forseen by various theoretical models. In addition, studies of non-prompt charmonia, i.e., charmonia originating from the decay of beauty hadrons, give access to study the energy loss of beauty quarks in the QGP. In these proceedings we present recently published Run 2 results by the ALICE Collaboration of prompt and non-prompt J/$\psi$ measured at midrapidity in Pb--Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV. In addition, the first preliminary Run 3 measurement of the $\psi$(2S)-to-J/$\psi$ ratio, measured at forward rapidity in Pb--Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$= 5.36 TeV, is shown. The results are compared to available theoretical model calculations.</description>

      <title>Excitation Spectra of the ${}^{12}{\rm C}(p,d)$ Reaction near the $\eta'$-Meson Emission Threshold Measured in Coincidence with High-Momentum Protons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The missing mass of the ${}^{12}{\rm C}(p,d)$ reaction has been measured near the $\eta'$-meson emission threshold in coincidence with a high-momentum proton to selectively collect $\eta'$-${}^{11}{\rm C}$ mesic nucleus formation events at GSI, Germany. A 2.5 GeV proton excites a carbon nucleus to form an $\eta'$-mesic nucleus emitting a deuteron forward with an energy of $\sim 1.6$ GeV. The deuteron is momentum-analyzed by the Fragment Separator used as a high-resolution spectrometer to deduce the excitation energy of the residual system. The large-acceptance detector WASA surrounding the target identifies high-momentum protons emitted in the decay of the $\eta'$-mesic nucleus. The measured semi-exclusive spectrum exhibits structures below the threshold though the statistical significance is limited. The spectrum is fitted by theoretically calculated spectra varying optical-potential parameters of the $\eta'$-nucleus interaction. The analysis results indicate $\eta'$-mesic nuclei formation for the real potential depth of $\sim -61$ MeV with a local statistical significance of $3.5 \sigma$ and, taking into account the look-elsewhere effect, a global significance of $2.1 \sigma$.</description>

      <title>Energy loss baseline for light hadrons in oxygen-oxygen collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}=5.36\,\text{TeV}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I present predictions for inclusive charged hadron spectra in minimum-bias proton-proton and oxygen-oxygen collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}} = 5.36\,\text{TeV}$, assuming no final-state interactions. Using next-to-leading order perturbative QCD matrix elements, along with state-of-the-art (nuclear) parton distribution and fragmentation functions, I establish a baseline for the nuclear modification factor $R^h_\text{AA}$ in oxygen-oxygen collisions in the absence of quenching. Theoretical uncertainties in this baseline are found to be substantial for transverse momenta below $20\,\text{GeV}$. In the intermediate range $20\,\text{GeV} \lesssim p_T^h \lesssim 70\,\text{GeV}$, these uncertainties are significantly reduced to approximately 5\%. At higher momenta ($p_T^h \gtrsim 70\,\text{GeV}$), however, predictions exhibit a marked spread due to differences between fragmentation functions, reflecting varying assumptions about isospin symmetry. Finally, I show that considering neon-neon collisions in the initial state or neutral pions in the final state does not appreciably change the nuclear modification factor.</description>

      <title>Measurements of azimuthal anisotropies in $^{16}$O+$^{16}$O and $\gamma$+Au collisions from STAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12167v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this proceeding, we present the first measurements of azimuthal anisotropies, $v_2$ and $v_3$, in $^{16}$O+$^{16}$O collisions at 200 GeV as a function of transverse momentum and multiplicity, by using two- and four-particle correlation methods. We compare our measurements with STAR measurements of $v_n$ in \dau and \heau collisions to provide insight into the impact of system symmetry on initial condition for small systems. We also investigate the ratio $v_2\{4\}/v_2\{2\}$ as a function of centrality, which is expected to be sensitive to nucleon-nucleon correlation in the $^{16}$O nucleus.</description>

      <title>High precision measurements of the proton elastic electromagnetic form factors and their ratio at $Q^2$ = 0.50, 2.64, 3.20, and 4.10 GeV$^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05201v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The advent of high-intensity, high-polarization electron beams led to significantly improved measurements of the ratio of the proton's charge to electric form factors, GEp/GMp. However, high-$Q^2$ measurements yielded significant disagreement with extractions based on unpolarized scattering, raising questions about the reliability of the measurements and consistency of the techniques. Jefferson Lab experiment E01-001 was designed to provide a high-precision extraction of GEp/GMp from unpolarized cross section measurements using a modified version of the Rosenbluth technique to allow for a more precise comparison with polarization data.
  Conventional Rosenbluth separations detect the scattered electron which requires comparisons of measurements with very different detected electron energy and rate for electrons at different angles. Our Super-Rosenbluth measurement detected the struck proton, rather than the scattered electron, to extract the cross section. This yielded a fixed momentum for the detected particle and dramatically reduced cross section variation, reducing rate- and momentum-dependent corrections and uncertainties.
  We measure the cross section vs angle with high relative precision, allowing for extremely precise extractions of GEp/GMp at $Q^2$ = 2.64, 3.20, and 4.10 GeV$^2$. Our results are consistent with traditional extractions but with much smaller corrections and systematic uncertainties, comparable to the uncertainties from polarization measurements. Our data confirm the discrepancy between Rosenbluth and polarization extractions of the proton form factor ratio using an improved Rosenbluth extraction that yields smaller and less-correlated uncertainties than typical of previous Rosenbluth extractions. We compare our results to calculations of two-photon exchange effects and find that the observed discrepancy can be relatively well explained by such effects.</description>

      <title>Observation of the charged-particle multiplicity dependence of $\sigma_{\psi(2S)} / \sigma_{\text{J}/\psi}$ in pPb collisions at 8.16 TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02139v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bound states of charm and anticharm quarks, known as charmonia, have a rich spectroscopic structure that can be used to probe the dynamics of hadron production in high-energy hadron collisions. Here, the cross section ratio of excited ($\psi$(2S)) and ground state (J/$\psi$) vector mesons is measured as a function of the charged-particle multiplicity in proton-lead (pPb) collisions at a center-of-mass (CM) energy per nucleon pair of 8.16 TeV. The data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 175 nb$^{-1}$ were collected using the CMS detector. The ratio is measured separately for prompt and nonprompt charmonia in the transverse momentum range 6.5 $\lt$ $p_\text{T}$ $\lt$ 30 GeV and in four rapidity ranges spanning $-$2.865 $\lt$ $y_\text{CM}$ $\lt$ 1.935. For the first time, a statistically significant multiplicity dependence of the prompt cross section ratio is observed in proton-nucleus collisions. There is no clear rapidity dependence in the ratio. The prompt measurements are compared with a theoretical model which includes interactions with nearby particles during the evolution of the system. These results provide additional constraints on hadronization models of heavy quarks in nuclear collisions.</description>

      <title>High-precision Penning trap mass measurements of neutron-rich chlorine isotopes at the N=28 shell closure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18354v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although it is known that the $N=28$ spherical shell closure erodes, the strength of the closure with decreasing proton number $Z&lt;20$ is an open question in nuclear structure. In this region of interest, direct high-precision mass measurements of neutron-rich $^{43-45}$Cl isotopes were performed at the Low Energy Beam and Ion Trap (LEBIT) when coupled to the National Superconducting Cyclotron Lab. The resulting mass excesses (MEs) are ME($^{43}$Cl) = -24114.4(1.7) keV, ME($^{44}$Cl) = -20450.8(10.6) keV, and ME($^{45}$Cl) = -18240.1(3.7) keV, and improve the uncertainty of these masses by up to a factor of ~40 compared to the previous values reported in the 2020 Atomic Mass Evaluation. Comparison to $\textit{ab initio}$ calculations using the Valence-Space In-Medium Similarity Renormalization Group (VS-IMSRG) shows good agreement up to and including the closure.</description>

      <title>Kinematics Calibration and Excitation Energy Reconstruction for Solenoidal Spectrometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04731v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a novel method for reconstructing excitation energy and center-of-mass scattering angle from energy-position data in solenoidal spectrometers, addressing challenges posed by non-linearities at small scattering angles. The approach employs a robust calibration of experimental energy-position data using known excited states, followed by an analytical inverse transformation based on relativistic kinematics and cyclotron motion. Integrated into the HELIOS online analysis routines, this method enables real-time generation of excitation energy spectra and angular distributions during experiments, improving efficiency and accuracy over traditional projection-based methods. The method's effectiveness is demonstrated using the 25Mg(d,p) reaction, highlighting its ability to handle forward-angle data and produce precise kinematic reconstructions.</description>

      <title>Bremsstrahlung photon contributions to parton energy loss at high virtuality ($Q^2$) : a perturbative calculation at $O(\alpha_{s} \alpha_{em})$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02667v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, real photon production scattering kernels from jet-medium interactions in the QCD medium are perturbatively calculated using the higher-twist (HT) formalism. Focus is given towards real photon production from a highly virtual (and highly energetic) quark, taking into account heavy-quark mass scales [Phys. Rev. C 94, 054902 (2016)], fermion-boson conversion processes [Nucl. Phys. A 793, 128 (2007)], as well as coherence effects [Phys. Rev. C 105, 024908 (2022)]. A generalized factorization procedure, such as that used in e-A deep-inelastic scattering, is employed to derive an improved single-scattering medium-induced photon emission kernels that go beyond the traditional in-medium gluon exchange approximation. Diagrams with real-photon emission from the hard quark are classified based on the final-state particles, and include two types of scattering kernels at $O(\alpha_{em}\alpha_{s})$ giving the following final states: (i) real photon and real quark, (ii) real photon and real gluon. The collisional kernels, thus derived, include full phase factors from all non-vanishing diagrams and complete second-order derivative terms in the transverse momentum gradient expansion. Moreover, the calculation includes heavy-quark mass effects, thus exploring heavy-quark energy loss. The in-medium parton distribution functions and the related jet transport coefficients have a hard transverse momentum dependence (of the emitted gluon or photon) present within the phase factor. It is observed that the jet transport coefficients resemble the transverse-momentum-dependent parton distribution functions.</description>

      <title>Half-life of $^{136}$Xe for neutrinoless double-$\beta$ decay calculated with effective axial-vector current coupling unified for two-neurtino and neutrinoless double-$\beta$ decay modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23239v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The upper limit on the mass of the Majorana neutrino, extracted from the limits on the nonobservation of the neutrinoless double-$\beta$ ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay, is hampered by uncertainties in the matrix elements of the transition operators. Recently, we have shown that the values of the effective axial-vector current coupling constants ($g_A^\textrm{eff}$) for the $0\nu\beta\beta$ and the two-neutrino double-$\beta$ decays are close. This striking result was obtained for the first time by including vertex corrections and two-body currents in these matrix elements. In this letter, we calculate the half-life for the $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay ($T_{1/2}^{0\nu}$) of $^{136}$Xe using this closeness and show the convergence of the half-life with respect to the variation of the method to determine $g_A^\textrm{eff}$. The closeness of the $g_A^\textrm{eff}$ of the two decay modes plays a decisive role in predicting $T_{1/2}^{0\nu}$. The appropriate value of $g_A^\textrm{eff}$ depends on the assumptions made for the sectors of the nuclear structure and transition operators of the calculations within the perturbation scheme. The value $g_A^\textrm{eff}\approx 1$ is obtained when the SkM$^\ast$ is used to describe the nuclear structure component, while a smaller value of $g_A^\textrm{eff}$ is obtained by applying a less realistic interaction like the SGII one.</description>

      <title>Studying Two-Photon Exchange in Deep Inelastic Scattering with the HERA Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23092v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-photon exchange (TPE) is one of the leading explanations for discrepancies in measurements of the proton electromagnetic form factors. It has been proposed that TPE could impact not only elastic scattering, but also the cross sections for both inclusive deep inelastic scattering (DIS) and semi-inclusive DIS, thereby affecting the interpretation of DIS structure functions in terms of parton distributions. It is expected that higher-order QED effects such as TPE should manifest as a deviation from unity in the ratio of \epp and \emp DIS cross sections. We use the existing inclusive $e^{\pm}p$ DIS data from HERA and SLAC to constrain higher-order QED effects on inclusive DIS.</description>
