      <title>Core-corona decomposition of compact (neutron) stars compared to NICER data including XTE J1814-338</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A core-corona decomposition of compact (neutron) star models is compared to recent NICER data of masses and radii. It is in particular interesting to capture the outlier XTE~J1814-338. Instead of integrating the TOV equations from the center to surface, we follow here another pathway by accommodating all uncertainties of the equation(s) of state (EoS) at supra-nuclear density or/and an unknown dark matter admixture in a parameterization of the core by its radius $r_x$, the included mass $m_x$ and the pressure $p_x$ at $r_x$. The corona, which may be dubbed also envelope or halo or outer crust, is assumed to be of standard-model matter where the EoS is supposed to be faithfully known.</description>

      <title>The thermodynamic structure and large-scale structure filament in MACS J0717.5+3745</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results of Chandra and XMM-Newton X-ray imaging and spatially-resolved spectroscopy, as well as new MUSTANG2 90~GHz observations of the thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich from MACS J0717.5+3745, an intermediate redshift ($z = 0.5458$) and exceptionally massive ($3.5 \pm 0.6 \times 10^{15}~\rm M_\odot$) Frontier Fields cluster experiencing multiple mergers and hosting an apparent X-ray bright large scale structure filament. Thermodynamical maps are produced from Chandra, XMM-Newton, and ROSAT data using a new method for modelling the astrophysical and instrumental backgrounds. The temperature peak of $24 \pm 4$ keV is also the pressure peak of the cluster and closely correlates spatially with the Sunyaev-Zeldovich peak from the MUSTANG2 data. The cluster center hosts shock fronts to the north and south, for which we report lower limits for the shock Mach numbers of $M = 1.6 \pm 0.4$ and $M = 1.9 \pm 0.3$, respectively. Bayesian X-ray Analysis methods were used to disentangle different projected spectral signatures for the filament structure, with Akaike and Bayes criteria being used to select the most appropriate model to describe the various temperature components. We report an X-ray filament temperature of $2.9_{-0.3}^{+0.5}$ keV and a density $(1.60\pm0.05)\times10^{-4}\,{\rm cm^{-3}}$, corresponding to an overdensity of 150 relative to the critical density of the Universe. We estimate the hot gas mass of the filament to be $\sim4.4\times10^{12}~\rm M_\odot$, while its total projected weak lensing measured mass is $\sim 6.8 \pm 2.7 \times 10^{13}~\rm M_\odot$, indicating a hot baryon fraction of 4-10\%.</description>

      <title>Intranight optical monitoring of the rare quasar J0950+5128, the brightest known candidate for transition from radio-quiet to radio-loud state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a novel pilot project to characterise intra-night optical variability (INOV) of an extremely rare type of quasar, which has recently been caught in the act of transiting from a radio-quiet to radio-loud state, on a decadal time scale. Such rare transitions may signify a recurrence, or conceivably the first switch-on of jet activity in optically luminous quasars. The newly formed jet could well be jittery and unsteady, both in power and direction. The optically brightest among such radio-state transition candidates, the quasar J0950+5128 ($z = 0.2142$), was monitored by us with dense sampling in the R-band, during 2020-21 in 6 sessions, each lasting $&gt;$ 4 hours. This is the first attempt to characterise the INOV properties associated with this recently discovered, extremely rarely observed phenomenon of quasar radio-state transition. The non-detection of INOV in any of the 6 sessions, down to the 1-2% level, amounts to a lack of evidence for a blazar-like optical activity, $\sim$ 2 years after its transition to radio-loud state was found. The only INOV feature detected in J0950+5128 during our observational campaign was a $\sim$ 0.15-mag spike lasting &lt; 6 minutes, seen at 13.97 UT on 18-March-2021. We also report the available optical light curves of this quasar from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) survey, which indicate that it had experienced a phase of INOV activity around the time its transition to the radio-loud state was detected, however that phase did not sustain until the launch of our INOV campaign $\sim$ 2 years later.</description>

      <title>Jet Archaeology and Forecasting: Image Variability and Magnetic Field Configuration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how magnetic field variations around accreting black holes on event horizon scales affect the morphology of magnetically-driven jet on larger scales. By performing radiative transfer calculations on general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics simulations, we find that temporal variation in the magnetic flux on the event horizon and the jet power are imprinted on the variability of jet width up to several hundred gravitational radii. When the magnetic flux around the black hole drops and then rises, the jet initially narrows or becomes truncated, then widens, creating a thin-thick pattern that propagates down the jet. This suggests that extended jet observations can provide a history record of horizon-scale magnetic field dynamics, and conversely, upcoming changes in the jet image can be predicted from direct observation of the magnetized accreting plasma near the black hole. Furthermore, the pattern of jet width variations shows acceleration up to the relativistic regime as it moves away from the black hole, aligning with plasma bulk motion. We also find in time-averaged images that both the bulk plasma motion and magnetic field configuration in the jet-launching region, which are sensitive to black hole spin, shape diverse features through relativistic beaming and aberration. Higher black hole spins result in more poloidal bulk motion and toroidal magnetic fields, leading to more symmetric jet images and linear polarization patterns. These results suggest a new method for testing the magnetically arrested disk model and the Blandford-Znajek process, and for determining the black hole spin through observations bridging horizon and jet-launching scales.</description>

      <title>High-Statistics Measurement of the Cosmic-Ray Electron Spectrum with H.E.S.S</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Owing to their rapid cooling rate and hence loss-limited propagation distance, cosmic-ray electrons and positrons (CRe) at very high energies probe local cosmic-ray accelerators and provide constraints on exotic production mechanisms such as annihilation of dark matter particles. We present a high-statistics measurement of the spectrum of CRe candidate events from 0.3 to 40 TeV with the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.), covering two orders of magnitude in energy and reaching a proton rejection power of better than $10^{4}$. The measured spectrum is well described by a broken power law, with a break around 1 TeV, where the spectral index increases from $\Gamma_1 = 3.25$ $\pm$ 0.02 (stat) $\pm$ 0.2 (sys) to $\Gamma_2 = 4.49$ $\pm$ 0.04 (stat) $\pm$ 0.2 (sys). Apart from the break, the spectrum is featureless. The absence of distinct signatures at multi-TeV energies imposes constraints on the presence of nearby CRe accelerators and the local CRe propagation mechanisms.</description>

      <title>The NANOGrav 12.5-Year Data Set: Probing Interstellar Turbulence and Precision Pulsar Timing with PSR J1903+0327</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Free electrons in the interstellar medium refract and diffract radio waves along multiple paths, resulting in angular and temporal broadening of radio pulses that limits pulsar timing precision. We determine multifrequency, multi-epoch scattering times for the large dispersion measure millisecond pulsar J1903+0327 by developing a three component model for the emitted pulse shape that is convolved with a best fit pulse broadening function (PBF) identified from a family of thin-screen and extended-media PBFs. We show that the scattering time, $\tau$, at a fiducial frequency of 1500 MHz changes by approximately 10% over a 5.5yr span with a characteristic timescale of approximately 100 days. We also constrain the spectral index and inner scale of the wavenumber spectrum of electron density variations along this line of sight. We find that the scaling law for $\tau$ vs. radio frequency is strongly affected by any mismatch between the true and assumed PBF or between the true and assumed intrinsic pulse shape. We show using simulations that refraction is a plausible cause of the epoch dependence of $\tau$, manifesting as changes in the PBF shape and $1/e$ time scale. Finally, we discuss the implications of our scattering results on pulsar timing including time of arrival delays and dispersion measure misestimation.</description>

      <title>The Oscillation in Evolution of Changing-look Blazar OQ 334</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the evolution of a changing-look blazar (CLB) on long timescales and expect to trace the state change of a CLB. Three morphological types, including a flat spectrum radio quasar (FSRQ) state, transition state, and BL Lacertae (BL Lac) state are classified according to the criteria proposed by analyzing the relationship between the equivalent width of the emission line and the $\gamma$-ray photon spectral index $\Gamma_{\gamma}$. The multiwavelength light curves and spectral energy distributions corresponding to different epochs are obtained. The efforts found that $\Gamma_{\gamma}$ satisfy the relationships with $\Gamma_{\gamma} $ $\gtrsim$ 2.2 for the FSRQ state, $2.0 &lt; \Gamma_{\gamma} &lt; 2.2$ for the transition state, and $\Gamma_{\gamma}$ $\lesssim$ 2.0 for the BL Lac state. We apply the criteria to the photon spectrum evolution of CLB OQ 334 during MJD 58678 - 60387. The evolution is subdivided into five FSRQ states, nine transition states, and four BL Lac states. Moreover, we use the model spectra parameters of each state epoch to test the reliability of subdivided morphological types. The result shows that: (1) the accretion rate parameter is consistent with our earlier research; and (2) there is an increasing trend in the epochs of the BL Lac states, even if there is not an obvious decreasing trend in epochs of the FSRQ states. We issue that strong evidence that a CLB is an especial epoch in the evolution of blazars that could be obtained from the oscillation phenomenon in the CLB evolution.</description>

      <title>Quasi-steady evolution of fast neutrino-flavor conversions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In astrophysical environments such as core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) and binary neutron star mergers (BNSMs), neutrinos potentially experience substantial flavor mixing due to the refractive effects of neutrino self-interactions. Determining the survival probability of neutrinos in asymptotic states is paramount to incorporating flavor conversions' effects in the theoretical modeling of CCSN and BNSM. Some phenomenological schemes have shown good performance in approximating asymptotic states of fast neutrino-flavor conversions (FFCs), known as one of the collective neutrino oscillation modes induced by neutrino self-interactions. However, a recent study showed that they would yield qualitatively different asymptotic states of FFC if the neutrino number is forced to evolve. It is not yet fully understood why the canonical phenomenological models fail to predict asymptotic states. In this paper, we perform detailed investigations through numerical simulations and then provide an intuitive explanation with a quasi-homogeneous analysis. Based on the analysis, we propose a new phenomenological model, in which the quasi-steady evolution of FFCs is analytically determined. The model also allows us to express the convolution term of spatial wave number as a concise form, which corresponds to useful information on analyses for the non-linear feedback from small-scale flavor conversions to large-scale ones. Our model yields excellent agreement with numerical simulations, which lends support to our interpretation.</description>

Abstract: The jet may compress an interstellar medium and soft X-ray may be absorbed outside the jet by a compressed interstellar medium and thermal emission heated by a shock is expected inside the jet. I analyze X-ray image of surroundings of the jet of M87 by Chandra. There is an original work for image analysis. In this time, I select data for image by removal of pile up event completely. I confirm a dip in soft X-ray outside the jet between knot E and knot F with 260 ks archival data. I analyze X-ray energy spectra for knot E and knot F with 400 ks archival data by Chandra in order to search for thermal emission. However, X-ray energy spectra for knot E and knot F are well described with synchrtron emission.</description>

      <title>The two alternative explosion mechanisms of core-collapse supernovae: 2024 status report</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In comparing the two alternative explosion mechanisms of core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe), I examine recent three-dimensional (3D) hydrodynamical simulations of CCSNe in the frame of the delayed-neutrino explosion mechanism (neutrino mechanism) and argue that these valuable simulations show that neutrino heating can supply a non-negligible fraction of the explosion energy but not the observed energies, hence cannot be the primary explosion mechanism. In addition to the energy crisis, the neutrino mechanism predicts many failed supernovae that are not observed. The most challenging issue of the neutrino mechanism is that it cannot account for point-symmetric morphologies of CCSN remnants, many of which were identified in 2024. These contradictions with observations imply that the neutrino mechanism cannot be the primary explosion mechanism of CCSNe. The alternative jittering-jets explosion mechanism (JJEM) seems to be the primary explosion mechanism of CCSNe; neutrino heating boosts the energy of the jittering jets. Even if some simulations show explosions of stellar models (but usually with energies below observed), it does not mean that the neutrino mechanism is the explosion mechanism. Jittering jets, which simulations do not include, can explode the core before the neutrino heating process does. Morphological signatures of jets in many CCSN remnants suggest that jittering jets are the primary driving mechanism, as expected by the JJEM.</description>

      <title>Large Gravitational Wave Phase Shifts from Strong 3-body Interactions in Dense Stellar Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The phase evolution of gravitational waves (GWs) can be modulated by the astrophysical environment surrounding the source, which provides a probe for the origin of individual binary black holes (BBHs) using GWs alone. We here study the evolving phase of the GW waveform derived from a large set of simulations of BBH mergers forming in dense stellar clusters through binary-single interactions. We uncover that a well-defined fraction of the assembled eccentric GW sources will have a notable GW phase shift induced by the remaining third object. The magnitude of the GW phase shift often exceeds conservative analytical estimates due to strong 3-body interactions, which occasionally results in GW sources with clearly shifted and perturbed GW waveforms. This opens up promising opportunities for current and future GW detectors, as observing such a phase shift can identify the formation environment of a BBH, as well as help to characterise the local properties of its surrounding environment.</description>

Abstract: Axion-photon oscillation effect provides a possible explanation for the presence of very-high-energy (VHE) $\gamma$-ray signals from distant sources. In this work, we propose a model-dependent method to select possible sources that may give sufficient constraints on the axion parameters. We investigate such effect in the spectra of active galactic nuclei (AGN) B2 2234+28A and 3C 454.3 based on data obtained from Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi-LAT) and MAGIC U.L. We utilize the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method to fit the axion parameters, yielding a result of $g_{a\gamma}=3.05^{+0.51}_{-0.31} \times 10^{-11}$ GeV$^{-1}$ for the axion-photon coupling strength and $m_{a}=5.25^{+2.35}_{-2.65} \times 10^{-8} $ eV for the axion mass. We also perform 95\% confidence level (CL) constraints to set an upper limit for $g_{a\gamma}$.</description>

      <title>Black hole jets on the scale of the Cosmic Web</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jets launched by supermassive black holes transport relativistic leptons, magnetic fields, and atomic nuclei from the centres of galaxies to their outskirts and beyond. These outflows embody the most energetic pathway by which galaxies respond to their Cosmic Web environment. Studying black hole feedback is an astrophysical frontier, providing insights on star formation, galaxy cluster stability, and the origin of cosmic rays, magnetism, and heavy elements throughout the Universe. This feedback's cosmological importance is ultimately bounded by the reach of black hole jets, and could be sweeping if jets travel far at early epochs. Here we present the joint LOFAR-uGMRT-Keck discovery of a black hole jet pair extending over $7$ megaparsecs -- the largest galaxy-made structure ever found. The outflow, seen $7.5$ gigayears into the past, spans two-thirds of a typical cosmic void radius, thus penetrating voids at ${\sim}95\%$ probability. This system demonstrates that jets can avoid destruction by magnetohydrodynamical instabilities over cosmological distances, even at epochs when the Universe was 15 to 7 times denser than it is today. Whereas previous record-breaking outflows were powered by radiatively inefficient active galactic nuclei, this outflow is powered by a radiatively efficient active galactic nucleus, a type common at early epochs. If, as implied, a population of early void-penetrating outflows existed, then black hole jets could have overwritten the fields from primordial magnetogenesis. This outflow shows that energy transport from supermassive black holes operates on scales of the Cosmic Web and raises the possibility that cosmic rays and magnetism in the intergalactic medium have a non-local, cross-void origin.</description>

      <title>Probing cosmic chemical enrichment with next-generation gravitational-wave observatories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By observing binary black hole (BBH) mergers out to the edge of the Universe, next-generation (XG) ground-based gravitational-wave (GW) detectors like Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope will map the BBH merger rate across all of cosmic history. This merger rate traces the formation rate of their progenitor stars convolved with a delay time distribution. Given theoretically-motivated priors on the delay time distribution, we show how XG observations can measure the BBH progenitor formation rate, probing the star formation rate (SFR) up to $z &gt; 15$. However, the progenitor formation rate does not directly give a measurement of the SFR, but rather a combination of the SFR and its metallicity distribution as a function of redshift. Fortunately, the metallicity-dependence of BBH formation likely varies as a function of BBH mass and/or formation channel. We find that if different BBH subpopulations with distinct metallicity biases can be identified, comparing their rates as a function of redshift yields a simultaneous measurement of the SFR and its metallicity distribution. Given optimistic theoretical priors and one year of observation, this may provide a $\sim10\%$ measurement of the SFR at its peak and a 0.2 dex (0.7 dex) measurement of the median metallicity out to $z = 10$ ($z = 15$) at 90\% credibility, although the uncertainties scale with theoretical uncertainties on BBH delay times and formation efficiencies.</description>

      <title>Particle acceleration and multi-messenger radiation from Ultra-Luminous X-ray Sources -- A new class of Galactic PeVatrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Super-Eddington accretion onto stellar-mass compact objects powers fast outflows in Ultra-Luminous X-ray sources (ULXs). Such outflows, which can reach mildly relativistic velocities, are often observed forming bubble structures. Wind bubbles are expected to develop strong wind termination shocks, sites of great interest for diffusive shock acceleration. We develop a model of diffusive shock acceleration in the wind bubbles powered by ULXs. We find that the maximum energy in these objects can easily reach the PeV range, promoting ULX winds as a new class of PeVatrons. We specialize our model in the context of the Galactic source SS 433 and show that high-energy protons in the bubble might explain the highest energy photons (&gt;100 TeV) and their morphology recently observed by LHAASO. We discuss the detectability of such a source in neutrinos and we analyze the possible radio counterpart of ULXs focusing on the case of W50, the nebula surrounding SS 433. We finally discuss the possible contribution of Galactic ULXs to the cosmic-ray flux at the knee concluding that their role might be substantial.</description>

      <title>Effects of Nontrivial Topology on Neutron Star Rotation and its Potential Observational Implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rotational irregularities are one of the prominent observational features that most pulsars exhibit. These glitches, which are sudden increases in spin angular velocity, remains an open problem. In this study, we have investigated the potential role of nontrivial topological defects, specifically in the form of Nambu-goto-type CSs, and its connection to spin irregularities. Such CSs which are one-dimensional topological defects may be formed during various symmetry-breaking and phase transition scenarios and can interact with the neutron stars. In this work, we see that the appearance of such topological defects trapped within the core can lead to the coupling of the string tension with the angular velocity, leading to the abrupt rotational changes observed as pulsar glitches. We have further studied how these coupling may generate detectable gravitational waves as a mixture of continuous and burst signals. The evolution of cusps of CSs trapped within neutron stars and the neutron star's mass quadruple moment change due to rotation could produce distinctive gravitational wave signatures, well within the noise cutoff of advLIGO. Our study highlights a potential connection between topological defects, pulsar glitches, and gravitational wave emissions, offering a possible avenue for observationally testing the presence of CSs and their astrophysical effects.</description>

      <title>The GRBSN webtool: An open-source repository for gamma-ray burst-supernova associations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the GRBSN webtool, a public facing application which hosts the most complete list of GRB-SN associations to date. In contrast to other repositories of supernova or gamma-ray burst data, this tool brings together all of the information required to study a GRB-SN association. GRBSN allows users to view and interact with plots of the data; search and filter the whole database; and download all multi-wavelength data related to a GRB-SN association, including radio, X-ray, optical/NIR photometric and spectroscopic data. The tool is fully open source and is hosted on a public GitHub repository, meaning users can upload their own data, flag missing data and suggest improvements. As the number of confirmed GRB-SN associations increases, the webtool will provide a robust framework in which to catalogue these associations and their associated data. The web application is freely available and publicly accessible at https://grbsn.watchertelescope.ie.</description>

      <title>An analytical model for the magnetic field in the thick shell of (super-) bubbles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bubbles and super-bubbles are ubiquitous in the interstellar medium and influence their local magnetic field. Starting from the assumption that bubbles result from violent explosions that sweep matter away in a thick shell, we derive the analytical equations for the divergence-free magnetic field in the shell. The explosion velocity field is assumed to be radial but not necessarily spherical, making it possible to model various-shaped bubbles. Assuming an explosion center, the magnetic field at the present time is fully determined by the initial uniform magnetic field, the present-time geometry of the bubble shell, and a radial vector field that encodes the explosion-induced displacement of matter, from its original location to its present-time location. We present the main characteristics of our magnetic-field model using a simple displacement model which predicts a constant density of the swept-up matter in the bubble shell and magnetic flux conservation. We further estimate the expected contribution of the shell of the Local Bubble, the super-bubbles in which the Sun resides, to the integrated Faraday rotation measures and synchrotron emission and compare these to full-sky observational data. We find that, while the contribution to the former is minimal, the contribution to the latter is very significant at Galactic latitudes $|b|&gt;45^\circ$. Our results underline the need to take the Local Bubble into account in large-scale Galactic magnetic field studies.</description>

      <title>Charged Binaries in Gravitational Tides</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Next-generation low-frequency interferometers are expected to detect binary systems near supermassive black holes, where tidal effects can alter significantly the motion of the binary. This motivates a broader investigation of how external gravitational fields influence the dynamics of physical systems. In this work, we consider a charged black hole binary system subject to a gravitational tide. We first construct a stationary gravitational tide acting on a dyonic Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole and, focusing on the extreme mass-ratio limit, we analyze the motion of a test particle. By calculating the secular Hamiltonian of the test particle, we obtain the ISCO and light ring tidal shifts in terms of explicit functions of the parameters of the binary. Our results show that tidal corrections are suppressed as the charge of the black hole increases, but they persist in the extremal limit yielding a finite contribution. This work paves the way towards studying tidal effects on other charged systems, such as topological stars.</description>

      <title>Evolution of binaries containing a hot subdwarf and a white dwarf to double white dwarfs, and double detonation supernovae with hypervelocity runaway stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Compact binaries containing hot subdwarfs and white dwarfs have the potential to evolve into a variety of explosive transients. These systems could also explain hypervelocity runaway stars such as US 708. We use the detailed binary evolution code MESA to evolve hot subdwarf and white dwarf stars interacting in binaries. We explore their evolution towards double detonation supernovae, helium novae, or double white dwarfs. Our grid of 3120 models maps from initial conditions such as orbital period and masses of hot subdwarf and white dwarf to these outcomes. The minimum amount of helium required to ignite the helium shell that leads to a double detonation supernova in our grid is $\approx 0.05 \, \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$, likely too large to produce spectra similar to normal type Ia supernovae, but compatible with inferred helium shell masses from some observed peculiar type I supernovae. We also provide the helium shell masses for our double white dwarf systems, with a maximum He shell mass of $\approx 0.18\,\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$. In our double detonation systems, the orbital velocity of the surviving donor star ranges from $\approx 450 \, \mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$ to $\approx 1000 \, \mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$. Among the surviving donors, we also estimate the runaway velocities of proto-white dwarfs, which have higher runaway velocities than hot subdwarf stars of the same mass. Our grid will provide a first-order estimate of the potential outcomes for the observation of binaries containing hot subdwarfs and white dwarfs from future missions like Gaia, LSST, and LISA.</description>

      <title>Radio-AGN activity across the galaxy population: dependence on stellar mass, star-formation rate, and redshift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We characterise the co-evolution of radio-loud AGN and their galaxies by mapping the dependence of radio-loud AGN activity on stellar mass and star-formation rate (SFR) across cosmic time (out to $z \sim 1.5$). Deep LOFAR radio observations are combined with large galaxy samples to study the incidence of radio-loud AGN across the galaxy population; the AGN are further split into low-excitation radio galaxies (LERGs) and high-excitation radio galaxies (HERGs). We find that LERG activity occurs over a wide range of SFRs, whereas HERGs are typically found in galaxies with ongoing star formation. The LERGs are then split based on their SFRs relative to the main sequence, across redshift. Within quiescent galaxies, LERG activity shows a steep stellar mass dependence with the same normalisation across the past $\sim$ 10 Gyr; this indicates that hot gas fuels LERGs in quiescent galaxies across cosmic time. In massive galaxies ($\log_{10}(M/\rm{M_{\odot}}) \gtrsim 11$), the incidence of LERGs is roughly constant across the galaxy population, suggesting that LERGs in massive galaxies may be fuelled by hot gas regardless of the star-formation activity. At lower masses, however, LERG activity is significantly more enhanced (by a factor of up to 10) in star-forming galaxies compared to quiescent galaxies; this suggests that an additional fuelling mechanism, likely associated with cold gas, may fuel the LERGs in galaxies with higher SFRs. We find that HERGs typically accrete above 1 per cent of the Eddington-scaled accretion rate, and the LERGs typically accrete below this level.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we look at the current bounds on the coupling strength of axion-like particles (ALPs) with two photons in the context of the Randall-Sundrum (RS) model. We relate the coupling strength to the compactification radius that governs the size of the extra dimension in the RS warped geometry model and show how the current bounds on the ALP can be used to derive appropriate constraints on the size of the extra fifth dimension in the RS model. We show that the resulting constraints fail to resolve the gauge hierarchy problem for light/ultralight ALPs and require a massive ALP of at least $m_{a} \gtrsim 0.1$ [GeV] to be relevant in the context of the hierarchy problem when the gauge field is in the bulk.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) are potential multimessenger events detectable by current and future gravitational wave (GW) detectors. The GW signals emitted during these events are expected to provide insights into the explosion mechanism and the internal structures of neutron stars. In recent years, several studies have empirically derived the relationship between the frequencies of the GW signals originating from the oscillations of protoneutron stars (PNSs) and the physical parameters of these stars. This study applies the Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) [Proc. R. Soc. A 454, 903 (1998)] to extract the frequencies of these modes to infer the physical properties of the PNSs. The results exhibit comparable accuracy to a short-time Fourier transform-based estimation, highlighting the potential of this approach as a complementary method for extracting physical information from GW signals of CCSNe.</description>

      <title>Bayesian evaluation of hadron-quark phase transition models through neutron star observables in light of nuclear and astrophysics data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the role of hybrid and nucleonic equations of state (EOSs) within neutron star (NS) interiors using Bayesian inference to evaluate their alignment with recent observational data from NICER and LIGO-Virgo (LV) collaborations. We find that smooth hybrid EOSs are slightly favoured in explaining NS mass-radius relations, particularly for pulsars such as PSR J0030+0451 and PSR J0740+6620. However, this preference is not definitive, as gravitational wave (GW) data does not significantly differentiate between our hybrid and nucleonic models. Our analysis also reveals tensions between older NICER data and recent measurements for PSR J0437-4715, highlighting the need for more flexible EOS models. Through two sampling approaches - one fixing the hadronic EOS set and the other without fixing the same, we demonstrate that the hybrid EOS model can incorporate stiffer EOSs, resulting in a better agreement with NICER data but leading to higher tidal deformability, which is less consistent with GW observations. In some recent publications a parameter $d_c$, related to the trace anomaly and its derivative, is used to indicate the presence of deconfined quark matter. We find that our hadronic model, which does not include phase transition to deconfined matter, under the influence of imposed constraints, is able to predict values below 0.2 for $d_c$ at around five times saturation density. The hybrid model goes below this threshold at lower densities under the same conditions.</description>

In a system comprising a Kerr-Newman black hole, an observer, and a light source, the relevant parameters are mass $M$, specific angular momentum $a$, electric charge $Q$, inclination angle $i$, and distance $r_o$. We consider the cases where the observer is at either a finite distance or spatial infinity. Using our method, the dimensionless parameters $(a/M, Q/M, i)$ can be determined by observing the shadow contour of the Kerr-Newman black hole from spatial infinity. We analytically prove that the shadow contour of the Kerr-Newman black hole observed from spatial infinity is unique, where uniqueness is defined as the absence of two congruent shadow contours for distinct sets of dimensionless parameter values. This method is versatile and can be applied to a range of black hole solutions with charge. Additionally, we show analytically that the shadow contour of a Kerr-Newman black hole observed from a finite distance $r_o$ is not unique, meaning that the parameters of a Kerr-Newman black hole at finite distance cannot be determined from shadow observations. This result reveals a new challenge and provides a clear direction for further research on black hole shadows.</description>

      <title>Blandford-Znajek power as a strong-gravity signature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Blandford-Znajek mechanism is an electromagnetic manifestation of the Penrose process that currently constitutes the best theoretical candidate to explain the launching of relativistic jets by black holes. In this talk we offer a modern review about the Blandford-Znajek mechanism and the analytic construction of black hole magnetospheres. Higher order perturbative corrections are crucial in order to produce results that are complementary to numerical simulations when the black hole is in the high-spin regime, and can potentially predict new features about the non-perturbative structure of the Blandford-Znajek theory. Moreover, we show by means of an explicit example that these perturbative corrections depend in a non-degenerate manner on the underlying theory of gravity considered, enabling one to use the BZ power emitted as a strong-gravity signature to test General Relativity against alternative theories of gravity on future horizon-scale observations.</description>

      <title>Shadow analysis of an approximate rotating black hole solution with weakly coupled global monopole charge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the shadow properties of a rotating black hole with a weakly coupled global monopole charge, using a modified Newman-Janis algorithm. This study explores how this charge and rotational effects shape the black hole's shadow, causal structure, and ergoregions, with implications for distinguishing it from Kerr-like solutions. Analysis of null geodesics reveals observable features that may constrain the global monopole charge and weak coupling parameters within nonminimal gravity frameworks. Observational data from M87* and Sgr A* constrain the global monopole charge and coupling constant to $0 \leq \gamma \lesssim 0.036$ and $-0.2 \lesssim \alpha \leq 0$, respectively.</description>

      <title>Investigating Changing-Look Active Galactic Nuclei with Long-term Optical and X-Ray Observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Changing-look active galactic nuclei (CLAGNs) show the appearance and disappearance of broad emission lines in their UV/optical spectra on timescales of months to decades. Here, we investigate how CL transitions depend on several AGN parameters such as accretion rate, obscuration properties and black hole mass. We study a sample of 20 nearby optically-identified CLAGNs from the BAT AGN Spectroscopic Survey (BASS), using quasi-simultaneous optical and X-ray observations taken in the last $\sim 40$ years. We find that for all CLAGNs, the transition is accompanied by a change in Eddington ratio. The CL transitions are not associated with changes in the obscuration properties of the AGN. CLAGNs are found to have a median Eddington ratio lower than the AGNs in the BASS sample in which CL transitions were not detected. The median of the transition Eddington ratio (Eddington ratio at which AGN changes its state) is found to be $\sim 0.01$ for type 1 $\leftrightarrow$ 1.8/1.9/2 transition, which is consistent with the hard $\leftrightarrow$ soft state transition in black hole X-ray binaries. Most CL events are constrained to occur within 3-4 years, which is considerably shorter than the expected viscous timescale in AGN accretion disk. The transitions of the optical CLAGNs studied here are likely associated to state changes in the accretion flow, possibly driven by disk-instability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this contribution, we extend the discussion about the calculation of the bulk viscosity of quark matter in the normal phase due to electroweak processes and its effect on the damping of baryon density oscillations that might occur in the coalescence of two compact stars. Employing the EoSs from the MIT bag model and perturbative quantum chromodynamics (pQCD) up to $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s)$, we analyze our results varying densities in the range of temperatures from 0 to 10 MeV for frequencies around 1 kHz. Our estimates show that bulk viscous effects might play a relevant role during the postmerger stage if the system reaches a deconfined quark matter phase.</description>

      <title>JWST observations constrain the time evolution of fine structure constants and dark energy - electromagnetic coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It was hypothesized in the literature that some physical parameters may be time-evolving and the astrophysical data can serve as a probe. Recently, James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have released its early observations. In this work, we select the JWST spectroscopic observations of the high redshift ($z&gt;7.1$) galaxies with strong [OIII] ($\lambda=4959$ \AA \,and $5007$ \AA \,in the rest frame) emission lines to constraint the evolution of the fine structure constant ($\alpha$). With the spectra from two galaxies at redshifts of $7.19$ and $8.47$, the deviation of $\alpha$ to its fiducial value is found to be as small as $0.44^{+8.4+1.7}_{-8.3-1.7} \times 10^{-4}$ and $-10.0^{+18+1.5}_{-18-1.5} \times 10^{-4}$, respectively (the first error is statistical and the latter is systematic). The combination of our results with the previous data reveals that $\frac{1}{\alpha} \frac{d \alpha}{dt} = 0.30^{+4.5}_{-4.5} \times 10^{-17}~{\rm yr^{-1}}$. Clearly, there is no evidence for a cosmic evolution of $\alpha$. The prospect of further constraining the time evolution of $\alpha$ is also discussed. The scalar field of dark energy is hypothesized to drive the acceleration of the universe's expansion through an interaction with the electromagnetic field. By integrating the observational data of the fine-structure constant variation, $\frac{\Delta\alpha}{\alpha}(z)$, we have established a stringent upper limit on the coupling strength between dark energy and electromagnetism. Our analysis yields $\zeta \leq 3.92 \times 10^{-7}$ at the 95\% confidence level, representing the most stringent bound to date.</description>

      <title>Dark energy effects on realistic neutron stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By considering realistic equations of state (EoSs) to describe the ordinary matter of the stellar crust, in this study, we explore the effect of a dark energy core, made of Chaplygin Dark Fluid (CDF), on neutron stars (NSs). To accomplish this purpose, we solve the stellar structure equations and investigate the impact of the CDF parameters on the several macroscopic properties of NSs such as mass-radius ($M-R$) relation, and tidal deformabilities of a single star and of a binary system, the latter being of great importance when analyzing gravitational-wave signals coming from the merger of such compact objects. We also present an analysis of the radial oscillation modes for the rapid phase transition, with the aim of distinguishing regions consisting of dynamically stable stars from those of unstable ones. Specifically, our outcomes reveal that an increase in the energy density jump (controlled by a parameter $\alpha$) leads to an increase in the radial stability of the NS with a CDF core. Furthermore, our theoretical results are consistent with the observational $M-R$ measurements of millisecond pulsars from NICER data and tidal deformability constraints from the GW170817 event.</description>

      <title>A massive white dwarf or low-mass neutron star discovered by LAMOST</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the discovery of a close binary J0606+2132 (Gaia DR3 3423365496448406272) with $P_{\rm obs}=2.77$ days containing a possible massive white dwarf or a neutron star using the LAMOST spectroscopic data. By a joint fitting of the radial velocity from LAMOST and the light curve from TESS, we derived a circular Keplerian orbit with an inclination of $i=$81.31$^{\circ}$$^{+6.26^{\circ}}_{-7.85^{\circ}}$, which is consistent with that derived from $v{\rm sin}I$. Together with the mass of the visible star, we derived the mass of the invisible object to be 1.34$^{+0.35}_{-0.40} M_{\odot}$. Spectral disentangling with the LAMOST medium-resolution spectra shows no absorption feature from an additional component, suggesting the presence of a compact object. No X-ray or radio pulsed signal is detected from ROSAT and FAST archive observations. J0606+2132 could evolve into either a Type Ia supernova or a neutron star through accretion-induced collapse if it is a white dwarf, or into an intermediate-mass X-ray binary if it is a neutron star.</description>

      <title>Making the invisible visible: Magnetic fields in accretion flows revealed by X-ray polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12815v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large scale, strong magnetic fields are often evoked in black hole accretion flows, for jet launching in the low/hard state and to circumvent the thermal instability in the high/soft state. Here we show how these ideas are strongly challenged by X-ray polarization measurements from IXPE. Quite general arguments show that equipartition large scale fields in the accretion flow should be of order $10^{6-8}$~G. These produce substantial Faraday rotation and/or depolarization. Since IXPE observes polarisation in both spectral states, this sets upper limits to coherent large scale (vertical, radial or azimulthal) magnetic fields in the photosphere of $B\lesssim 5\times10^6$~G. While we stress that Faraday rotation should be calculated for each individual simulation (density, field geometry and emissivity), it seems most likely that there are no equipartition strength large scale ordered fields inside the photosphere of the X-ray emitting gas. Strong poloidal fields can still power a Blandford-Znajek jet in the low/hard state if they thread the black hole horizon rather than the X-ray emitting flow, but this could also be challenged by (lack of) depolarisation from vacuum birefringence. Instead, an alternative solution is that the low/hard state jet is dominated by pairs so can be accelerated by lower fields. Strong toroidal fields could still stabilise the disc in the high/soft state if they are buried beneath the photosphere, though this seems unlikely due to magnetic buoyancy. Fundamentally, polarization data from IXPE means that magnetic fields in black hole accretion flows are no longer invisible and unconstrained.</description>

      <title>Late-time non-thermal emission from mildly relativistic tidal ejecta of compact objects merger</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01338v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mergers of compact objects (binary neutron stars, BNS, or neutron star-black hole, NSBH) with a substantial mass ratio ($q&gt;1.5$) are expected to produce a mildly relativistic ejecta within $\sim20^\circ$ from the equatorial plane. We present a semi-analytic approach to calculate the expected synchrotron emission observed from various viewing angles, along with the corresponding radio maps, that are produced by a collisionless shock driven by such ejecta into the interstellar medium. This method reproduces well (up to $\sim30\%$ deviations) the observed emission produced by 2D numerical calculations of the full relativistic hydrodynamics. We consider a toroidal ejecta with an opening angle of $15^\circ\leq\theta_ \text{open}\leq30^\circ$ and broken power-law mass distribution, $M(&gt;\gamma\beta)\propto(\gamma\beta)^{-s}$ with $s=s_{\rm KN}$ at $\gamma\beta&lt;\gamma_0\beta_0$ and $s=s_{\rm ft}$ at $\gamma\beta&gt;\gamma_0\beta_0$ (where $\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor). The parameter values are chosen to characterize merger calculation results -- a "shallow" mass distribution, $1&lt;s_{\rm KN}&lt;3$, for the bulk of the ejecta (at $\gamma\beta\approx 0.2$), and a steep, $s_{\rm ft}&gt;5$, "fast tail" mass distribution. While the peak flux is dimmer by a factor of $\sim$2-3, and the peak time remains roughly the same (within $20\%$), for various viewing angles compared to isotropic equivalent ejecta ($\theta_\text{open}=90^\circ$) considered in preceding papers, the radio maps are significantly different from the spherical case. The semi-analytic method can provide information on the ejecta geometry and viewing angle from future radio map observations and, consequently, constrain the ejection mechanism. For NSBH mergers with a significant mass ejection ($\sim0.1M_\odot$), this late non-thermal signal can be observed to distances of $\lesssim 200$Mpc for typical parameter values.</description>

      <title>X-ray and gamma-ray study for 2023 nova eruption of V1716 Sco</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19233v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the results of X-ray and gamma-ray analyses of the classical-nova V1716 Sco using data taken by \verb|Swift|, \verb|NICER|, \verb|NuSTAR| and \verb|Fermi|-LAT. We confirm gamma-ray emission at a significant level exceeding 8~$\sigma$ in the one-day bin immediately following the optical eruption. The gamma-ray emission, with a Test Statistic value more than four, persists for approximately 40 days. The X-ray emission being concurrent with the gamma-ray emission is described by the optically thin thermal plasma emission and it is likely dominated by the emission from the gas heated up by the shock. This X-ray component acquires the flux peak at approximately 20 days after the eruption and the observed X-ray emission enters super soft state (SSS) about 45 days after the eruption. The gamma-ray and X-ray emission properties of V1716 Sco are similar to those of other classical novae. Unlike other classical nova, the X-ray emission initially resolved by the \verb|Swift| occurs earlier, during a period when the gamma-ray emission is still at a detectable flux level by \verb|Fermi|-LAT observations. Using the X-ray emission properties observed before the SSS phase, we interpret that the nova produces initial slow and less dense outflow, which is eventually overtaken by the fast and dense outflow that causes the main outburst, and the X-ray emission is powered by the forward shock that propagates in the slow outflow. During the SSS, the \verb|NICER| data reveal a quasi-periodic oscillation with a observed period of $\sim 79$~seconds with a possible temporal variation, and indicates the temporal variation of the emission region on the white dwarf's surface.</description>

      <title>Measuring the Spin of the Galactic Center Supermassive Black Hole with Two Pulsars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00245v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As a key science project of the Square Kilometre Array (SKA), the discovery and timing observations of radio pulsars in the Galactic Center would provide high-precision measurements of the spacetime around the supermassive black hole, Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), and initiate novel tests of general relativity. The spin of Sgr A* could be measured with a relative error of $\lesssim 1\%$ by timing one pulsar with timing precision that is achievable for the SKA. However, the real measurements depend on the discovery of a pulsar in a very compact orbit, $P_b\lesssim0.5\,{\rm yr}$. Here for the first time we propose and investigate the possibility of probing the spin of Sgr A* with two or more pulsars that are in orbits with larger orbital periods, $P_b\sim 2- 5\,{\rm yr}$, which represents a more realistic situation from population estimates. We develop a novel method for directly determining the spin of Sgr A* from the timing observables of two pulsars and it can be readily extended for combining more pulsars. With extensive mock data simulations, we show that combining a second pulsar improves the spin measurement by $2-3$ orders of magnitude in some situations, which is comparable to timing a pulsar in a very tight orbit.</description>

      <title>Optical and Radio Analysis of Systematically Classified Broad-lined Type Ic Supernovae from the Zwicky Transient Facility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14586v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a magnitude-limited sample of 36 Broad-lined Type Ic Supernovae (SNe Ic-BL) from the Zwicky Transient Facility Bright Transient Survey (detected between March 2018 and August 2021), which is the largest systematic study of SNe Ic-BL done in literature thus far. We present the light curves (LCs) for each of the SNe, and analyze the shape of the LCs to derive empirical parameters, along with the explosion epochs for every event. The sample has an average absolute peak magnitude in the r band of $M_r^{max}$ = -18.51 $\pm$ 0.15 mag. Using spectra obtained around peak light, we compute expansion velocities from the Fe II 5169 Angstrom line for each event with high enough signal-to-noise ratio spectra, and find an average value of $v_{ph}$ = 16,100 $\pm$ 1,100 km $s^{-1}$. We also compute bolometric LCs, study the blackbody temperature and radii evolution over time, and derive the explosion properties of the SNe. The explosion properties of the sample have average values of $M_{Ni}$ = $0.37_{-0.06}^{+0.08}$ solar masses, $M_{ej}$ = $2.45_{-0.41}^{+0.47}$ solar masses, and $E_K$= $4.02_{-1.00}^{+1.37} \times 10^{51}$ erg. Thirteen events have radio observations from the Very Large Array, with 8 detections and 5 non-detections. We find that the populations that have radio detections and radio non-detections are indistinct from one another with respect to their optically-inferred explosion properties, and there are no statistically significant correlations present between the events' radio luminosities and optically-inferred explosion properties. This provides evidence that the explosion properties derived from optical data alone cannot give inferences about the radio properties of SNe Ic-BL, and likely their relativistic jet formation mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Impact of chaotic magnetic field on mass-radius relation of rotating neutron stars</title>

Abstract: Observations reveal that magnetic fields on neutron stars (NSs) are in the range of $10^{8-15}$ G. Apart from being celestial bodies, NSs are normally rotating. In this work, we study the impact of a chaotic magnetic field on the mass-radius relation of the rotating NSs. We employ an equation of state of NSs with the nuclei in the crust and hyperons in the core. We use Hartle-Thorne formalism as an approximation of the rotating NSs. For the magnetic field ansatz, we use the one coupled to the energy density. We find that the magnetic field can decrease radius of NS. NSs formed with stronger chaotic magnetic fields exhibit a lower maximum mass compared to those formed with weaker chaotic magnetic fields. In contrast, the increment of the magnetic field can increase the compactness and deformation of rotating NSs.</description>

      <title>A data-driven approach for modeling the temporal and spectral evolution of kilonova systematic uncertainties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21978v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kilonovae, possible electromagnetic counterparts to neutron star mergers, provide important information about high-energy transient phenomena and, in principle, also allow us to obtain information about the source properties responsible for powering the kilonova. Unfortunately, numerous uncertainties exist in kilonova modeling that, at the current stage, hinder accurate predictions. Hence, one has to account for possible systematic modeling uncertainties when interpreting the observed transients. In this work, we provide a data-driven approach to account for time-dependent and frequency-dependent uncertainties in kilonova models. Through a suite of tests, we find that the most reliable recovery of the source parameters and description of the observational data can be obtained through a combination of kilonova models with time- and frequency-dependent systematic uncertainties. We apply our new method to analyze AT2017gfo. While recovering a total ejecta mass consistent with previous studies, our approach gives insights into the temporal and spectral evolution of the systematic uncertainties of this kilonova. We consistently find a systematic error below $1$ mag between $1$ to $5$ days after the merger. Our work addresses the need for early follow-up of kilonovae at earlier times, and improved modeling of the kilonova at later times, to reduce the uncertainties outside of this time window.</description>

      <title>Cosmological foundations revisited with Pantheon+</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.01438v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We reanalyse the Pantheon+ supernova catalogue to compare a cosmology with non-FLRW evolution, the timescape cosmology, with the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. To this end, we analyse the Pantheon+ for a geometric comparison between the two models. We construct a covariance matrix to be as independent of cosmology as possible, including independence from the FLRW geometry and peculiar velocity with respect to FLRW average evolution. This framework goes far beyond most other definitions of model independence. We introduce new statistics to refine Type Ia supernova (SNe Ia) light-curve analysis. In addition to conventional galaxy correlation functions used to define the scale of statistical homogeneity we introduce empirical statistics which enables refined analysis of the distribution biases of SNe Ia light-curve parameters $\beta c$ and $\alpha x_1$. For lower redshifts, the Bayesian analysis highlights important features attributable to the increased number of low-redshift supernovae, the artefacts of model-dependent light-curve fitting and the cosmic structure through which we observe supernovae. This indicates the need for cosmology-independent data reduction to conduct a stronger investigation of the emergence of statistical homogeneity and to compare alternative cosmologies in light of recent challenges to the standard model. Dark energy is generally invoked as a place-holder for new physics. For the first time, we find evidence that the timescape cosmology may provide a better overall fit than $\Lambda$CDM and that its phenomenology may help disentangle other astrophysical puzzles. Our from-first-principles reanalysis of Pantheon+ supports future deeper studies between the interplay of matter and nonlinear spacetime geometry in a data-driven setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06886v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Incorporating first-order QED effects, we explore the shadows of Kerr-Newman black holes with a magnetic charge through the numerical backward ray-tracing method. Our investigation accounts for both the direct influence of the electromagnetic field on light rays and the distortion of the background spacetime metric due to QED corrections. We notice that the area of the shadow increases with the QED effect, mainly due to the fact that the photons move more slowly in the effective medium and become easier to be trapped by the black hole.</description>

      <title>Quantum deformed phantom dynamics in light of the generalized uncertainty principle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09049v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum gravity has been baffling the theoretical physicist for decades now: both for its mathematical obscurity and phenomenological testing. Nevertheless, the new era of precision cosmology presents a promising avenue to test the effects of quantum gravity. In this study, we consider a bottom-up approach. Without resorting to any candidate quantum gravity, we invoke a generalized uncertainty principle (GUP) directly into the cosmological Hamiltonian for a universe sourced by a phantom scalar field with potential to study the early epoch of the evolution. This is followed by a systematic analysis of the dynamics, both qualitatively and quantitatively. Our qualitative analysis shows that the introduction of GUP significantly alters the existence of fixed points for the potential considered in this contribution. In addition, we confirm the existence of an inflationary epoch and analyze the behavior of relevant cosmological parameters with respect to the strength of GUP distortion.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Leptogenesis with sub-GeV Axion Like Particles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07003v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A derivative coupling of an axion like particle (ALP) with a B-L current may lead to the baryon asymmetry of the universe via spontaneous leptogenesis provided a lepton number breaking interaction prevails in thermal equilibrium. Conventionally, such scenario works only for heavy ALPs and high reheating temperature due to the fact that the same lepton number breaking contribution is tied up with neutrino mass generation also. In this work, we propose inert Higgs doublet assisted lepton number violating operator to relieve such tension so as to generate lepton asymmetry (of freeze-in/out type) with a much lower reheating temperature that can accommodate light (sub-GeV) ALPs sensitive to current and future ALP searches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18642v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cosmic-ray antimatter, particularly low-energy antideuterons, serves as a sensitive probe of dark matter annihilating in our Galaxy. We study this smoking-gun signature and explore its complementarity with indirect dark matter searches using cosmic-ray antiprotons. To this end, we develop the neural network emulator $\overline{\text{D}}$arkRayNet, enabling a fast prediction of propagated antideuteron energy spectra for a wide range of annihilation channels and their combinations. We revisit the Monte Carlo simulation of antideuteron coalescence and cosmic-ray propagation, allowing us to explore the uncertainties of both processes. In particular, we take into account uncertainties from the $\Lambda_b$ production rate and consider two distinctly different propagation models. Requiring consistency with cosmic-ray antiproton limits, we find that AMS-02 shows sensitivity to a few windows of dark matter masses only, most prominently below 20 GeV. This region can be probed independently by the upcoming GAPS experiment. The program package $\overline{\text{D}}$arkRayNet is available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave emission in Binary Neutron Star early post-merger within a dark environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05226v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using an effective Lagrangian model inspired by Takami et al. 2015 we qualitatively study the early post-merger of a nearly symmetric binary Neutron Star (BNS) merger event with a non-vanishing ambient fraction of dark matter. For this we first mimic the dynamics of two oscillating Neutron Star (NS) masses in the gravitational potential well as they merge. We parametrize the dynamics and ejecta properties in the coalescence event allowing the formation of a surrounding debris disk that may be containing a non-vanishing dark matter fraction. In order to analyze the possible novel dark contribution, we start from a dark-matter free modellization as a benchmark. Using Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) techniques we approximately recover the gravitational waveforms, restricted to early post-merger time interval from existing simulations in the CoRe database. Later, we explore the impact of an additional dark viscous fluid under a prescribed velocity dependent force in the Lagrangian and obtain the resulting waveforms and some spectral features originating in the first few ms in the BNS post-merger. Finally we discuss our qualitative findings and its range of validity in light of the prospects of detectability in present or future experimental settings.</description>

      <title>X-ray AGN in Bo\"otes: The lack of growth of the most massive black holes since z=4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14297v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Supermassive Black Holes (BHs) are known to efficiently grow through gas accretion, but even sustained and intense mass build-up through this mechanism struggles to explain the assembly of the most massive BHs observed in the local Universe. Using the Chandra Deep-Wide Field Survey (CDFWS) in the Bo\"otes field, we measure BH--galaxy assembly in massive galaxies ($M_\star\gtrsim10^{10}\rm M_\odot$) through the AGN fraction and specific Black Hole accretion rate (sBHAR) distribution as a function of redshift and stellar mass. We determine stellar masses and star formation rates for a parent sample of optically selected galaxies as well as those with X-ray detections indicating the presence of an AGN through Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) fitting. We derive a redshift-dependent mass completeness limit and extract X-ray information for every galaxy as to provide a comprehensive picture of the AGN population in massive galaxies. While X-ray AGN samples are dominated by moderately massive host galaxies of $M_{\star} \geqslant 10^{10}\rm M_{\odot}$, we do not find a strong stellar mass dependence in AGN fraction (to limits in sBHAR), indicating a bias towards massive galaxies in the observed samples. We derive BH-galaxy growth tracks over time, which reveal that while most BH mass has been accumulated since $z=4$ for lower mass BHs, the assembly of the most massive BHs is more complex, with little to no relative mass gain since $z=4$, implying that rapid and intense growth episodes prior to $z=4$ were necessary to form these massive BHs.</description>

      <title>Galactic center G objects as dust-enshrouded stars near the supermassive black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00304v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this contribution, we revisit the model of a dust-enshrouded star orbiting a low-luminosity galactic nucleus (Zaja\v{c}ek et al. 2014, 2016, 2017). Although it is quite challenging for dust to survive in hot X-ray-emitting plasma surrounding supermassive black holes (SMBHs), we now have an observational evidence that compact dusty objects or ``G'' objects can approach the SMBH in the Galactic center (Sgr A*) on the scale of a few 1000 gravitational radii. Since there are about ten G objects in the Galactic center, it is more likely that they are dust-enshrouded stars whose gaseous-dusty envelopes are stable within the corresponding tidal (Hill) radii of the order of a few astronomical units. Such a length-scale is consistent with their infrared broad-band spectral energy distributions. Broad emission lines, in particular Br$\gamma$ recombination line, can be interpreted to arise within the accretion stream from the circumstellar envelopes forming a compact disc that is truncated by the stellar magnetic field. Alternatively, they could also be associated with circumstellar accretion-disc outflows as well as the material within a denser bow shock ahead of the star. In comparison with the line origin in the photoionized envelopes that can generally be tidally stretched, the scenario involving the circumstellar accretion-disc inflow or outflow can ensure that the line luminosity is rather stable, except for the viewing-angle effects. We speculate about the origin of dust-enshrouded stars that could be young stellar objects or binary-merger products.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22403v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While stellar expansion after core-hydrogen exhaustion related to thermal imbalance has been documented for decades, the physical phenomenon of stellar inflation that occurs close to the Eddington limit has only come to the fore in recent years. We aim to elucidate the differences between these physical mechanisms for stellar radius enlargement, especially as additional terms such as `bloated' and `puffed-up' stars have been introduced in the recent massive star literature. We employ single and binary star MESA structure and evolution models for both constant mass, as well as models allowing for the mass to change, due to winds or binary interaction. We find cases that were previously attributed to stellar inflation in fact to be due to stellar expansion. We also highlight that while the opposite effect of expansion is contraction, the removal of an inflated zone should not be referred to as contraction but {\it deflation} as the star is still in thermal balance.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Propagation in Starobinsky Inflationary Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06706v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we linearize the field equations in the $f(R)$ theory using the Starobinsky model, $R+R^2/(6m^2)$, and explore the impact of modifications to the gravitational field equations on the propagation and structure of gravitational waves. An equation for the trace of the perturbation was then derived and decomposed with the aid of an auxiliary field that obeyed the pure wave equation and was sourced by the matter-energy distribution, while also acting as a fictitious source for generating the actual perturbation via the Klein-Gordon equation. The fields were expressed in terms of Green's functions, whose symmetry properties facilitated the solution of the trace equation. This trace value was then substituted into the linearized field equation to determine the perturbation tensor in terms of a modified or effective matter-energy distribution. We subsequently calculated the components of the quadrupole moment tensor as well as the perturbation tensor for a binary star system and compared them to the General Relativity case. The results indicate that the amplitude of the oscillation depends on the orbital parameters, specifically: the angular frequency and radius of the system. This suggests that high-frequency binary systems could be promising candidates for detecting the effects of this modified gravity theory.</description>

      <title>Skyrme-Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov mass models on a 3D mesh: IV. Improved description of the isospin dependence of pairing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08007v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Providing reliable data on the properties of atomic nuclei and infinite nuclear matter to astrophysical applications remains extremely challenging, especially when treating both properties coherently within the same framework. Methods based on energy density functionals (EDFs) enable manageable calculations of nuclear structure throughout the entire nuclear chart and of the properties of infinite nuclear matter across a wide range of densities and asymmetries. To address these challenges, we present BSkG4, the latest Brussels-Skyrme-on-a-Grid model. It is based on an EDF of the extended Skyrme type with terms that are both momentum and density-dependent, and refines the treatment of $^1S_0$ nucleon pairing gaps in asymmetric nuclear matter as inspired by more advanced many-body calculations. The newest model maintains the accuracy of earlier BSkGs for known atomic masses, radii and fission barriers with rms deviations of 0.633 MeV w.r.t. 2457 atomic masses, 0.0246 fm w.r.t. 810 charge radii, and 0.36 MeV w.r.t 45 primary fission barriers of actinides. It also improves some specific pairing-related properties, such as the $^1S_0$ pairing gaps in asymmetric nuclear matter, neutron separation energies, $Q_\beta$ values, and moments of inertia of finite nuclei. This improvement is particularly relevant for describing the $r$-process nucleosynthesis as well as various astrophysical phenomena related to the rotational evolution of neutron stars, their oscillations, and their cooling.</description>
