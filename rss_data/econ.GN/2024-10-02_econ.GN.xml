      <title>Machine Learning and Econometric Approaches to Fiscal Policies: Understanding Industrial Investment Dynamics in Uruguay (1974-2010)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines the impact of fiscal incentives on industrial investment in Uruguay from 1974 to 2010. Using a mixed-method approach that combines econometric models with machine learning techniques, the study investigates both the short-term and long-term effects of fiscal benefits on industrial investment. The results confirm the significant role of fiscal incentives in driving long-term industrial growth, while also highlighting the importance of a stable macroeconomic environment, public investment, and access to credit. Machine learning models provide additional insights into nonlinear interactions between fiscal benefits and other macroeconomic factors, such as exchange rates, emphasizing the need for tailored fiscal policies. The findings have important policy implications, suggesting that fiscal incentives, when combined with broader economic reforms, can effectively promote industrial development in emerging economies.</description>

      <title>Uniform price auctions with pre-announced revenue targets: Evidence from China's SEOs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the performance of auctions in China's seasoned equity offering (SEO) market, both theoretically and empirically. In these auctions, issuers must commit to a pre-announced revenue target and a maximum number of shares available for auction. We use a common value framework to analyze this auction mechanism, detailing its operation, share allocation, and pricing. The theoretical findings suggest that when buyers bid truthfully, the seller's optimal strategy is to set the total share quantity equal to the target revenue divided by the reserve price. We demonstrate that committing to a target revenue results in a higher level of truthful bidding compared to a standard uniform-price auction without any revenue commitment. We empirically test our theoretical findings using data from China's SEO markets. First, we assess the impact of various issuer strategies on firm-level SEO discounts, categorizing scenarios based on share availability and target revenue. We find that the scenario where the reserve price times the share quantity matches the target revenue is the most optimal for sellers. Second, we examine bidding behavior and auction performance, showing that China's SEO uniform price auction performs exceptionally well. Specifically, the actual issue prices are only 0.029 below the truthful case prices, indicating that the revenue raised is still close to what would have been achieved with truthful bids.</description>

      <title>How has the war in Ukraine affected Russian sentiments?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using individual-level data from Gallup World Poll and the Levada Center, we provide an in-depth analysis of how Russia's invasion of Ukraine has affected sentiments in the Russian population. Our results show that after the invasion, a larger share of Russians expressed support for President Putin, optimism about the future, anti-West attitudes, and lower migration aspirations. The 2022 mobilization and the 2023 Wagner rebellion had only short-lived and no effects on sentiments, respectively. Regions with low pre-war support for Putin displayed stronger rally effects, higher casualty rates, and increased incomes, suggesting a recruitment strategy that maximizes political support. Taken together, our results suggest strong public support for the war, except among Russians abroad who became more critical of Putin in line with global views.</description>

      <title>Inflation in Disaggregated Small Open Economies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies inflation in small open economies with production networks. I show that the production network alters the elasticity of the consumer price index (CPI) to changes in sectoral technology, factor prices, and import prices. Sectors can import and export directly but also indirectly through domestic intermediate inputs. Indirect exporting dampens the inflationary pressure from domestic forces, while indirect importing increases the inflation sensitivity to import price changes. Computing these CPI elasticities requires knowledge of the production network structure as these do not coincide with typical sufficient statistics used in the literature, such as sectoral sales-to-GDP ratios, factor shares, or imported consumption shares. Using input-output tables, I provide empirical evidence that adjusting CPI elasticities for indirect exports and imports matters quantitatively for small open economies. I use the model to illustrate the importance of production networks during the recent COVID-19 inflation in Chile and the United Kingdom.</description>

      <title>Age and Cognitive Skills: Use It or Lose It</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cross-sectional age-skill profiles suggest that workers' cognitive skills start declining by their thirties if not earlier. If accurate, such age-driven skill losses pose a major threat to the human capital of societies with rapidly aging populations. We estimate actual age-skill profiles from individual changes in skills at different ages. We use the unique German longitudinal component of the Programme of the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC-L) that retested a large representative sample of adults after 3.5 years. Two main results emerge. First, correcting for measurement error, average skills increase into the forties before decreasing slightly in literacy and more strongly in numeracy. Second, skills decline at older ages only for those with below-average skill usage. White-collar and higher-educated workers with above-average usage show increasing skills even beyond their forties. Women have larger skill losses at older age, particularly in numeracy.</description>

      <title>A Run on Fossil Fuel? Climate Change and Transition Risk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I study the dynamic, general equilibrium implications of climate-change-linked transition risk on macroeconomic outcomes and asset prices. Climate-change-linked expectations of fossil fuel restrictions can produce a ``run on fossil fuels'' with accelerated production and decreasing spot prices, or a ``reverse run'' with restrained production and increased spot prices. The response depends on the expected economic consequences of the anticipated transition shock, and existing climate policies. Fossil fuel firm prices decrease in each case. I use a novel empirical measure of innovations in climate-related transition risk likelihood to show that dynamic empirical responses are consistent with a ``run on fossil fuel.''</description>

      <title>Modeling Migration-Induced Unemployment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.13319v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Immigration is often blamed for increasing unemployment among local workers. However, standard models, such as the neoclassical model and the Diamond-Mortensen-Pissarides matching model, inherently assume that immigrants are absorbed into the labor market without affecting local unemployment. This paper presents a more general model of migration that allows for the possibility that not only the wages but also the unemployment rate of local workers may be affected by the arrival of newcomers. This extension is essential to capture the full range of potential impacts of labor migration on labor markets. The model blends a matching framework with job rationing. In it, the arrival of new workers can raise the unemployment rate among local workers, particularly in a depressed labor market where job opportunities are limited. On the positive side, in-migration helps firms fill vacancies more easily, boosting their profits. The overall impact of in-migration on local welfare varies with labor market conditions: in-migration reduces welfare when the labor market is inefficiently slack, but it enhances welfare when the labor market is inefficiently tight.</description>

      <title>Towards Replication-Robust Data Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.06000v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite widespread adoption of machine learning throughout industry, many firms face a common challenge: relevant datasets are typically distributed amongst market competitors that are reluctant to share information. Recent works propose data markets to provide monetary incentives for collaborative machine learning, where agents share features with each other and are rewarded based on their contribution to improving the predictions others. These contributions are determined by their relative Shapley value, which is computed by treating features as players and their interactions as a characteristic function game. However, in its standard form, this setup further provides an incentive for agents to replicate their data and act under multiple false identities in order to increase their own revenue and diminish that of others, restricting their use in practice. In this work, we develop a replication-robust data market for supervised learning problems. We adopt Pearl's do-calculus from causal reasoning to refine the characteristic function game by differentiating between observational and interventional conditional probabilities. By doing this, we derive Shapley value-based rewards that are robust to this malicious replication by design, whilst preserving desirable market properties.</description>

      <title>Does the Use of Unusual Combinations of Datasets Contribute to Greater Scientific Impact?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05024v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scientific datasets play a crucial role in contemporary data-driven research, as they allow for the progress of science by facilitating the discovery of new patterns and phenomena. This mounting demand for empirical research raises important questions on how strategic data utilization in research projects can stimulate scientific advancement. In this study, we examine the hypothesis inspired by the recombination theory, which suggests that innovative combinations of existing knowledge, including the use of unusual combinations of datasets, can lead to high-impact discoveries. Focusing on social science, we investigate the scientific outcomes of such atypical data combinations in more than 30,000 publications that leverage over 5,000 datasets curated within one of the largest social science databases, ICPSR. This study offers four important insights. First, combining datasets, particularly those infrequently paired, significantly contributes to both scientific and broader impacts (e.g., dissemination to the general public). Second, infrequently paired datasets maintain a strong association with citation even after controlling for the atypicality of dataset topics. In contrast, the atypicality of dataset topics has a much smaller positive impact on citation counts. Third, smaller and less experienced research teams tend to use atypical combinations of datasets in research more frequently than their larger and more experienced counterparts. Lastly, despite the benefits of data combination, papers that amalgamate data remain infrequent. This finding suggests that the unconventional combination of datasets is an under-utilized but powerful strategy correlated with the scientific impact and broader dissemination of scientific discoveries</description>

      <title>Global Stock Market Volatility Forecasting Incorporating Dynamic Graphs and All Trading Days</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15320v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study introduces a global stock market volatility forecasting model that enhances forecasting accuracy and practical utility in real-world financial decision-making by integrating dynamic graph structures and encompassing the union of active trading days of different stock markets. The model employs a spatial-temporal graph neural network (GNN) architecture to capture the volatility spillover effect, where shocks in one market spread to others through the interconnective global economy. By calculating the volatility spillover index to depict the volatility network as graphs, the model effectively mirrors the volatility dynamics for the chosen stock market indices. In the empirical analysis, the proposed model surpasses the benchmark model in all forecasting scenarios and is shown to be sensitive to the underlying volatility interrelationships.</description>
