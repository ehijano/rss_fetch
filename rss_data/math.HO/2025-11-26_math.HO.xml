      <title>Linear Geometry: flats, ranks, regularity, parallelity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linear Geometry describes geometric properties that depend on the fundamental notion of a line. In this paper we survey basic notions and results of Linear Geomery that depend on the flat hulls: flats, exchange, rank, regularity, modularity, and parallelity.</description>

      <title>Taffy, Trees, and Tangles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the relationship between three combinatorial objects -- a taffy pulling machine, the Calkin-Wilf tree of all fractions, and Conway's rational tangles. After introducing these objects, we develop a taffy analogue for Conway's characterization of rational tangles, and we give a direct geometric connection between rational tangles and taffy pulls.</description>

      <title>Euler's work on spherical geometry: An overview with comments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review Euler's work on spherical geometry. After an introduction concerning the general place that trigonometric formulae occupy in geometry, we start by the two memoirs of Euler on spherical trigonometry, in which he establishes the trigonometric formulae using different methods, namely, the calculus of variations in the first memoir, and classical methods of solid geometry in the other. In another memoir, Euler gives several formulae for the area of a spherical triangle in terms of its side lengths (these are ``spherical Heron formulae''). He uses this in the computation of numerical values of the solid angles of the five regular polyhedra, which is his goal in his memoir. We then review memoirs in which Euler systematically starts by establishing a theorem or a construction in Euclidean geometry and then proves an analogue in spherical geometry. We point out relations between Euler's memoirs on spherical trigonometry and works he did in astronomy, on the problem of drawing geographical maps, and in geomagnetism. We also review some other works of Euler involving spheres, including a memoir on the three-dimensional Apollonius problem and others concerning algebraic curves on the sphere. Even though these works are not properly on spherical geometry, they show Euler's interests in various questions related to spheres and we think that they are worth highlighting in such an overview. Beyond spherical geometry, the reader is invited to discover in this article an important facet of the work of the great Leonhard Euler. This article will appear as a chapter in the book ``Spherical geometry in the eighteenth century, I: Euler, Lagrange and Lambert'', Springer, 2026.</description>

      <title>Andr{\'e} and Simone Weil: Mathematics, social activism and Indian culture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is an essay on the relation of Andr{\'e} and Simone Weil with Indian culture and Sanskrit literature, especially the Bhagavad G{\=i}t{\=a}, a Hindu scripture which they knew well, which they quoted extensively, and which guided them in making important life decisions. In addressing this question, we will also talk about the life paths of the two Weils, and more specifically about certain aspects that relate to their deep convictions.</description>

      <title>Arrow graphs and their focal curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07440v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The arrow graph of a function consists of two parallel axes, with arrows from input values to output values. The lines through these arrows envelop a curve which we named the focal curve. This paper studies these focal curves in detail. We show how the focal curve relates to the derivative of the function, and how this also provided a parametrization of the focal curve. This is illustrated through various examples, and can be experienced in linked GeoGebra-applications. Next, we provide an interpretation of focal curves in projective geometry, relating the focal curve to the dual curve of the graph of the function. Finally, we provide some results on the behavior of focal curves under transformations and compositions.</description>
