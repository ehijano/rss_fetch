      <title>Cross-Platform DNA Methylation Classifier for the Eight Molecular Subtypes of Group 3 &amp; 4 Medulloblastoma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medulloblastoma is a malignant pediatric brain cancer, and the discovery of molecular subgroups is enabling personalized treatment strategies. In 2019, a consensus identified eight novel subtypes within Groups 3 and 4, each displaying heterogeneous characteristics. Classifiers are essential for translating these findings into clinical practice by supporting clinical trials, personalized therapy development and application, and patient monitoring. This study presents a DNA methylation-based, cross-platform machine learning classifier capable of distinguishing these subtypes on both HM450 and EPIC methylation array samples. Across two independent test sets, the model achieved weighted F1 = 0.95 and balanced accuracy = 0.957, consistent across platforms. As the first cross-platform solution, it provides backward compatibility while extending applicability to a newer platform, also enhancing accessibility. It also has the potential to become the first publicly available classifier for these subtypes once deployed through a web application, as planned in the future. This work overall takes steps in the direction of advancing precision medicine and improving clinical outcomes for patients within the majority prevalence medulloblastoma subgroups, groups 3 and 4.</description>

      <title>SAE-RNA: A Sparse Autoencoder Model for Interpreting RNA Language Model Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning, particularly with the advancement of Large Language Models, has transformed biomolecular modeling, with protein advances (e.g., ESM) inspiring emerging RNA language models such as RiNALMo. Yet how and what these RNA Language Models internally encode about messenger RNA (mRNA) or non-coding RNA (ncRNA) families remains unclear. We present SAE- RNA, interpretability model that analyzes RiNALMo representations and maps them to known human-level biological features. Our work frames RNA interpretability as concept discovery in pretrained embeddings, without end-to-end retraining, and provides practical tools to probe what RNA LMs may encode about ncRNA families. The model can be extended to close comparisons between RNA groups, and supporting hypothesis generation about previously unrecognized relationships.</description>
