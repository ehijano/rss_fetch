      <title>Signal and Noise Classification in Bio-Signals via unsupervised Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-world biosignal data is frequently corrupted by various types of noise, such as motion artifacts, and baseline wander. Although digital signal processing techniques exist to process such signals; however, heavily degraded signals cannot be recovered. In this study, we aim to classify two things: first, a binary classification of noisy and clean biosignals, and next, to categorize various kinds of noise such as motion artifacts, sensor failure, etc. We implemented K-means clustering, and our results indicate that the algorithm can most reliably group clean segments from noisy ones, particularly strong performance in identifying clean data compared to various categories of noise. This approach enables the selection of only high-quality bio-signal segments and provides accurate results for feature engineering that may enhance the precision of machine learning models trained on biosignals.</description>

      <title>Polarization-Diversity-Based Rotation Sensing Methodology Using COTS UHF RFID Tags</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase-based sensing using ultra-high frequency (UHF) radio-frequency identification (RFID) has, in recent years, yielded numerous additions to the Internet of Things (IoT). This work presents a polarization diversity-based rotation sensing methodology using common-off-the-shelf (COTS) UHF RFID tags identified with a software-defined radio (SDR) UHF RFID reader. The proposed methodology uses the tag-to-reader message after fully coherent demodulation to calculate a difference signal of the backscatter load modulation states. This sequence is then used to compute the rotation speed by evaluating its phase change over time. Experimental results are used to validate the theoretical model and to evaluate the performance and limitations of the proposed system.</description>

      <title>Millimeter-Wave True-Time Delay Array Beamforming with Robustness to Mobility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-reliable and low-latency connectivity is required for real-time and latency-sensitive applications, like wireless augmented and virtual reality streaming. Millimeter-wave (mmW) networks have enabled extremely high data rates through large available bandwidths but struggle to maintain continuous connectivity with mobile users. Achieving the required beamforming gain from large antenna arrays with minimal disruption is particularly challenging with fast-moving users and practical analog mmW array architectures. In this work, we propose frequency-dependent slanted beams from true-time delay (TTD) analog arrays to achieve robust beamforming in wideband, multi-user downlink scenarios. Novel beams with linear angle-frequency relationships for different users and sub-bands provide a trade-off between instantaneous capacity and angular coverage. Compared to alternative analog array beamforming designs, slanted beams provide higher reliability to angle offsets and greater adaptability to varied user movement statistics.</description>

      <title>Metasurfaces Enable Active-Like Passive Radar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Passive radars (PRs) provide a low-cost and energy-efficient approach to object detection by reusing existing wireless transmissions instead of emitting dedicated probing signals. Yet, conventional passive systems require prior knowledge of non-cooperative source waveforms, are vulnerable to strong interference, and rely on Doppler signatures, limiting their ability to detect subtle or slow-moving targets. Here, we introduce a metasurface-enabled PR (MEPR) concept that integrates a space-time-coding programmable metasurface to imprint distinct spatiotemporal tags onto ambient wireless wavefields. This mechanism transforms a PR into an active-like sensing platform without the need for source control, enabling interference suppression, signal enhancement, and accurate target localization and tracking in cluttered environments. A proof-of-concept implementation operating at 5.48 GHz confirms real-time imaging and tracking of unmanned aerial vehicles under interference-rich conditions, with performance comparable to active radar systems. These results establish MEPR as a solid foundation for scalable, adaptive, and energy-efficient next-generation integrated sensing and communication systems.</description>

      <title>1024-Channel 0.8V 23.9-nW/Channel Event-based Compute In-memory Neural Spike Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing data rate has become a major issue confronting next-generation intracortical brain-machine interfaces (iBMIs). The scaling number of recording sites requires complex analog wiring and lead to huge digitization power consumption. Compressive event-based neural frontends have been used in high-density neural implants to support the simultaneous recording of more channels. Event-based frontends (EBF) convert recorded signals into asynchronous digital events via delta modulation and can inherently achieve considerable compression. But EBFs are prone to false events that do not correspond to neural spikes. Spike detection (SPD) is a key process in the iBMI pipeline to detect neural spikes and further reduce the data rate. However, conventional digital SPD suffers from the increasing buffer size and frequent memory access power, and conventional spike emphasizers are not compatible with EBFs. In this work we introduced an event-based spike detection (Ev-SPD) algorithm for scalable compressive EBFs. To implement the algorithm effectively, we proposed a novel low-power 10-T eDRAM-SRAM hybrid random-access memory in-memory computing bitcell for event processing. We fabricated the proposed 1024-channel IMC SPD macro in a 65nm process and tested the macro with both synthetic dataset and Neuropixel recordings. The proposed macro achieved a high spike detection accuracy of 96.06% on a synthetic dataset and 95.08% similarity and 0.05 firing pattern MAE on Neuropixel recordings. Our event-based IMC SPD macro achieved a high per channel spike detection energy efficiency of 23.9 nW per channel and an area efficiency of 375 um^2 per channel. Our work presented a SPD scheme compatible with compressive EBFs for high-density iBMIs, achieving ultra-low power consumption with an IMC architecture while maintaining considerable accuracy.</description>

      <title>Geometry-Aligned Differential Privacy for Location-Safe Federated Radio Map Construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio maps that describe spatial variations in wireless signal strength are widely used to optimize networks and support aerial platforms. Their construction requires location-labeled signal measurements from distributed users, raising fundamental concerns about location privacy. Even when raw data are kept local, the shared model updates can reveal user locations through their spatial structure, while naive noise injection either fails to hide this leakage or degrades model accuracy. This work analyzes how location leakage arises from gradients in a virtual-environment radio map model and proposes a geometry-aligned differential privacy mechanism with heterogeneous noise tailored to both confuse localization and cover gradient spatial patterns. The approach is theoretically supported with a convergence guarantee linking privacy strength to learning accuracy. Numerical experiments show the approach increases attacker localization error from 30 m to over 180 m, with only 0.2 dB increase in radio map construction error compared to a uniform-noise baseline.</description>

      <title>Self-Alignment Resonant Beam Empowers Beamforming without Estimation and Control for 6G IoT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of communication, sensing, and wireless power transfer (WPT) is a cornerstone of 6G intelligent IoT. However, relying on traditional beamforming imposes prohibitive overheads due to complex channel state information (CSI) estimation and active beam scanning, particularly in dynamic environments. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the radio frequency resonant beam system (RF-RBS), a native physical-layer paradigm that circumvents these limitations. By deploying retro-directive antenna arrays (RAA) at transceivers, RF-RBS establishes a self-sustaining cyclic electromagnetic loop. This mechanism inherently enables self-aligning, high-gain beamforming through positive feedback, eliminating the reliance on digital CSI processing. We analyze the system's architecture and its capability to support high-efficiency WPT, robust communication, and millimeter-level passive positioning. Finally, we evaluate the implementation challenges and strategic value of RF-RBS in latency-sensitive 6G scenarios, including unmanned systems and industrial automation.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Fuzzy Logic and Shading-Aware Particle Swarm Optimization for Dynamic Photovoltaic Shading Faults Mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shading faults remain one of the most critical challenges affecting photovoltaic (PV) system efficiency, as they not only reduce power generation but also disturb maximum power point tracking (MPPT). To address this issue, this study introduces a hybrid optimization framework that combines Fuzzy Logic Control (FLC) with a Shading-Aware Particle Swarm Optimization (SA-PSO) method. The proposed scheme is designed to adapt dynamically to both partial shading (20%-80%) and complete shading events, ensuring reliable global maximum power point (GMPP) detection. In this approach, the fuzzy controller provides rapid decision support based on shading patterns, while SA-PSO accelerates the search process and prevents the system from becoming trapped in local minima. A comparative performance assessment with the conventional Perturb and Observe (P\&amp;O) algorithm highlights the advantages of the hybrid model, showing up to an 11.8% improvement in power output and a 62% reduction in tracking time. These results indicate that integrating intelligent control with shading-aware optimization can significantly enhance the resilience and energy yield of PV systems operating under complex real-world conditions.</description>

      <title>Aliasing in Near-Field Array Ambiguity Functions: a Spatial Frequency-Domain Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Next-generation communication and localization systems increasingly rely on extremely large-scale arrays (XL-arrays), which promise unprecedented spatial resolution and new functionalities. These gains arise from their inherent operation in the near field (NF) regime, where the spherical nature of the wavefront can no longer be ignored; consequently, characterizing the ambiguity function--which amounts to the matched beam pattern-- is considerably more challenging. Implementing very wide apertures with half-wavelength element spacing is costly and complex. This motivates thinning the array (removing elements), which introduces intricate aliasing structures, i.e., grating lobes. Whereas prior work has addressed this challenge using approximations tailored to specific array geometries, this paper develops a general framework that reveals the fundamental origins and geometric behavior of grating lobes in near-field ambiguity functions. Using a local spatial-frequency analysis of steering signals, we derive a systematic methodology to model NF grating lobes as aliasing artifacts, quantifying their structure on the AF, and providing design guidelines for XL-arrays that operate within aliasing-safe regions. We further connect our framework to established far-field principles. Finally, we demonstrate the practical value of the approach by deriving closed-form expressions for aliasing-free regions in canonical uniform linear arrays and uniform circular arrays.</description>

      <title>LoS+NLoS Holographic MIMO: Analysis and Application of Wavenumber-Division Multiplexing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Holographic multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) enables electrically large continuous apertures, overcoming the physical scaling limits of conventional MIMO architectures with half-wavelength spacing. Their near-field operating regime requires channel models that jointly capture line-of-sight (LoS) and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) components in a physically consistent manner. Existing studies typically treat these components separately or rely on environment-specific multipath models. In this work, we develop a unified LoS+NLoS channel representation for holographic lines that integrates spatial-sampling-based and expansion-based formulations. Building on this model, we extend the wavenumber-division multiplexing (WDM) framework, originally introduced for purely LoS channels, to the LoS+NLoS scenario. Applying WDM to the NLoS component yields its angular-domain representation, enabling direct characterization through the power spectral factor and power spectral density. We further derive closed-form characterizations for isotropic and non-isotropic scattering, with the former recovering Jakes' isotropic model. Lastly, we evaluate the resulting degrees of freedom and ergodic capacity, showing that incorporating the NLoS component substantially improves the performance relative to the purely LoS case.</description>

      <title>Beyond Diagonal RIS-assisted MIMO Transmission: Beamforming Gain and Capacity Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) have emerged as a transformative technology in wireless communications, offering unprecedented control over signal propagation. This study focuses on passive beyond diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS), which has been proposed to generalize conventional diagonal RIS, in Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) downlink (DL) communication systems. We compare the performance of transmit beamforming (TxBF) and MIMO capacity transmission with waterfilling power allocation in the millimeter wave (mmWave) band, where propagation primarily occurs under line-of-sight (LOS) conditions. In the lack of closed-form expressions for the optimal RIS elements in either case, our approach adopts a gradient-based optimization approach requiring lower complexity than the solution in arXiv:2406.02170. Numerical results reveal that BD-RIS significantly outperforms traditional diagonal RIS in terms of spectral efficiency and coverage</description>

      <title>Contextual Bandits and Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces for Predictive LTM Handover Decisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article addresses the challenge of optimizing handover (HO) in next-generation wireless networks by integrating Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS), predicting received signal power, and utilizing learning-based decision-making. A conventional reactive HO mechanism, such as lower-layer triggered mobility (LTM), is enhanced through linear prediction to anticipate link degradation. Additionally, the use of RIS helps to mitigate signal blockage and extend coverage. An online trained non-linear Contextual Multi-Armed Bandit (CMAB) agent selects target gNBs based on context features, which reduces unnecessary HO and signaling overhead. Extensive simulations evaluate eight combinations of these techniques under realistic mobility and channel conditions. Results show that CMAB and RSRP prediction consistently reduce the number of HO, ping-pong rate and cell preparations, while RIS improves link reliability.</description>

      <title>Applications of Singular Entropy to Signals and Singular Smoothness to Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores signal and image analysis by using the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and its extension, the Generalized Singular Value Decomposition (GSVD). A key strength of SVD lies in its ability to separate information into orthogonal subspaces. While SVD is a well-established tool in ECG analysis, particularly for source separation, this work proposes a refined method for selecting a threshold to distinguish between maternal and fetal components more effectively. In the first part of the paper, the focus is onmedical signal analysis,where the concepts of Energy Gap Variation (EGV) and Singular Energy are introduced to isolate fetal and maternal ECG signals, improving the known ones. Furthermore, the approach is significantly enhanced by the application of GSVD, which provides additional discriminative power for more accurate signal separation. The second part introduces a novel technique called Singular Smoothness, developed for image analysis. This method incorporates Singular Entropy and the Frobenius normto evaluate information density, and is applied to the detection of natural anomalies such asmountain fractures and burned forest regions. Numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.</description>

      <title>RF sensing with dense IoT network graphs: An EM-informed analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio Frequency (RF) sensing is attracting interest in research, standardization, and industry, especially for its potential in Internet of Things (IoT) applications. By leveraging the properties of the ElectroMagnetic (EM) waves used in wireless networks, RF sensing captures environmental information such as the presence and movement of people and objects, enabling passive localization and vision applications. This paper investigates the theoretical bounds on accuracy and resolution for RF sensing systems within dense networks. It employs an EM model to predict the effects of body blockage in various scenarios. To detect human movements, the paper proposes a deep graph neural network, trained on Received Signal Strength (RSS) samples generated from the EM model. These samples are structured as dense graphs, with nodes representing antennas and edges as radio links. Focusing on the problem of identifying the number of human subjects co-present in a monitored area over time, the paper analyzes the theoretical limits on the number of distinguishable subjects, exploring how these limits depend on factors such as the number of radio links, the size of the monitored area and the subjects physical dimensions. These bounds enable the prediction of the system performance during network pre-deployment stages. The paper also presents the results of an indoor case study, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach and confirm the model's predictive potential in the network design stages.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the Deformation Measurement Accuracy Using Low-SNR Radars for Future InSAR Missions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) is a powerful tool for monitoring surface deformation with high precision. However, low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) conditions, common in regions with low backscatter, can degrade phase coherence and compromise displacement accuracy. In this study, we quantify the impact of low-SNR conditions on InSAR-derived displacement using L-band UAVSAR data collected over the San Andreas Fault and Greenland ice sheet. We simulate low-SNR conditions by degrading the Noise-Equivalent Sigma Zero (NESZ) to $-15~\mathrm{dB}$ and assess the resulting effects on interferometric coherence, phase unwrapping, and time series inversion. The displacement accuracy of 4mm in single interferogram can be achieved by taking looks for the signal decorrelation of 0.6 and SNR between -9dB to -10dB. Our findings indicate that even under low-SNR conditions, a velocity precision of $0.5~\mathrm{cm/yr}$ can be achieved in comparison to high-SNR conditions. By applying multilooking with an 8x8 window, we significantly improve coherence and eliminate this bias, demonstrating that low-SNR systems can achieve comparable precision to high-SNR systems at the expense of spatial resolution. These results have important implications for the design of future cost-effective SAR missions, such as Surface Deformation and Change (SDC), and the optimization of InSAR processing techniques in challenging environments.</description>

      <title>Delay-Oriented Distributed Scheduling with TransGNN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Minimizing transmission delay in wireless multi-hop networks is a fundamental yet challenging task due to the complex coupling among interference, queue dynamics, and distributed control. Traditional scheduling algorithms, such as max-weight or queue-length-based policies, primarily aim to optimize throughput but often suffer from high latency, especially in heterogeneous or dynamically changing topologies. Recent learning-based approaches, particularly those employing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), have shown promise in capturing spatial interference structures. However, conventional Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) remain limited by their local aggregation mechanism and their inability to model long-range dependencies within the conflict graph. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a delay-oriented distributed scheduling framework based on Transformer GNN. The proposed model employs an attention-based graph encoder to generate adaptive per-link utility scores that reflect both queue backlog and interference intensity. A Local Greedy Solver (LGS) then utilizes these utilities to construct a feasible independent set of links for transmission, ensuring distributed and conflict-free scheduling.</description>

      <title>A Fast Broadband Beamspace Transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new computationally efficient method for multi-beamforming in the broadband setting. Our "fast beamspace transformation" forms $B$ beams from $M$ sensor outputs using a number of operations per sample that scales linearly (to within logarithmic factors) with $M$ when $B\sim M$. While the narrowband version of this transformation can be performed efficiently with a spatial fast Fourier transform, the broadband setting requires coherent processing of multiple array snapshots simultaneously. Our algorithm works by taking $N$ samples off of each of $M$ sensors and encoding the sensor outputs into a set of coefficients using a special non-uniform spaced Fourier transform. From these coefficients, each beam is formed by solving a small system of equations that has Toeplitz structure. The total runtime complexity is $\mathcal{O}(M\log N+B\log N)$ operations per sample, exhibiting essentially the same scaling as in the narrowband case and vastly outperforming broadband beamformers based on delay and sum whose computations scale as $\mathcal{O}(MB)$. Alongside a careful mathematical formulation and analysis of our fast broadband beamspace transform, we provide a host of numerical experiments demonstrating the algorithm's favorable computational scaling and high accuracy. Finally, we demonstrate how tasks such as interpolating to ``off-grid" angles and nulling an interferer are more computationally efficient when performed directly in beamspace.</description>

      <title>Architecture Design for Rise/Fall Asymmetry Glitch Minimization in Current-Steering DACs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current-steering digital-to-analog converter (DAC) is a prominent architecture that is commonly used in high-speed applications such as optical communications. One of the shortcomings of this architecture is the output glitches that are input dependent and degrade the dynamic performance of the DAC. We investigate DAC glitches that arise from asymmetry in the fall/rise response of DAC switches. We formulate a glitch metric that defines the overall DAC performance, which is then used to find a novel DAC weighting scheme. Numerical simulations show that the proposed architecture can potentially provide a significant performance advantage compared to the segmented structure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The goal of LocaGen is to improve the localization performance of audio signals in the 2-D beam localization problem. LocaGen reduces sampling quantization errors through machine learning models trained on realistic synthetic data generated by a simulation. The system increases the accuracy of both direction-of-arrival (DOA) and precise location estimation of an audio beam from an array of three microphones. We demonstrate LocaGen's efficacy on a low-powered embedded system with an increased localization accuracy with a minimal increase in real-time resource usage. LocaGen was demonstrated to reduce DOA error by approximately 67% even with a microphone array of only 10 kHz in audio processing.</description>

      <title>Expectations in Expectation Propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Expectation Propagation (EP) is a widely used message-passing algorithm that decomposes a global inference problem into multiple local ones. It approximates marginal distributions (beliefs) using intermediate functions (messages). While beliefs must be proper probability distributions that integrate to one, messages may have infinite integral values. In Gaussian-projected EP, such messages take a Gaussian form and appear as if they have "negative" variances. Although allowed within the EP framework, these negative-variance messages can impede algorithmic progress.
  In this paper, we investigate EP in linear models and analyze the relationship between the corresponding beliefs. Based on the analysis, we propose both non-persistent and persistent approaches that prevent the algorithm from being blocked by messages with infinite integral values.
  Furthermore, by examining the relationship between the EP messages in linear models, we develop an additional approach that avoids the occurrence of messages with infinite integral values.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Matched Filtering for Sensing With Communication Signals in Cluttered Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the performance of the adaptive matched filtering (AMF) in cluttered environments, particularly when operating with superimposed signals. Since the instantaneous signal-to-clutter-plus-noise ratio (SCNR) is a random variable dependent on the data payload, using it directly as a design objective poses severe practical challenges, such as prohibitive computational burdens and signaling overhead. To address this, we propose shifting the optimization objective from an instantaneous to a statistical metric, which focuses on maximizing the average SCNR over all possible payloads. Due to its analytical intractability, we leverage tools from random matrix theory (RMT) to derive an asymptotic approximation for the average SCNR, which remains accurate even in moderate-dimensional regimes. A key finding from our theoretical analysis is that, for a fixed modulation basis, the PSK achieves a superior average SCNR compared to QAM and the pure Gaussian constellation. Furthermore, for any given constellation, the OFDM achieves a higher average SCNR than SC and AFDM. Then, we propose two pilot design schemes to enhance system performance: a Data-Payload-Dependent (DPD) scheme and a Data-Payload-Independent (DPI) scheme. The DPD approach maximizes the instantaneous SCNR for each transmission. Conversely, the DPI scheme optimizes the average SCNR, offering a flexible trade-off between sensing performance and implementation complexity. Then, we develop two dedicated optimization algorithms for DPD and DPI schemes. In particular, for the DPD problem, we employ fractional optimization and the KKT conditions to derive a closed-form solution. For the DPI problem, we adopt a manifold optimization approach to handle the inherent rank-one constraint efficiently. Simulation results validate the accuracy of our theoretical analysis and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.</description>

      <title>On Discrete Ambiguity Functions of Random Communication Waveforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper provides a fundamental characterization of the discrete ambiguity functions (AFs) of random communication waveforms under arbitrary orthonormal modulation with random constellation symbols, which serve as a key metric for evaluating the delay-Doppler sensing performance in future ISAC applications. A unified analytical framework is developed for two types of AFs, namely the discrete periodic AF (DP-AF) and the fast-slow time AF (FST-AF), where the latter may be seen as a small-Doppler approximation of the DP-AF. By analyzing the expectation of squared AFs, we derive exact closed-form expressions for both the expected sidelobe level (ESL) and the expected integrated sidelobe level (EISL) under the DP-AF and FST-AF formulations. For the DP-AF, we prove that the normalized EISL is identical for all orthogonal waveforms. To gain structural insights, we introduce a matrix representation based on the finite Weyl-Heisenberg (WH) group, where each delay-Doppler shift corresponds to a WH operator acting on the ISAC signal. This WH-group viewpoint yields sharp geometric constraints on the lowest sidelobes: The minimum ESL can only occur along a one-dimensional cut or over a set of widely dispersed delay-Doppler bins. Consequently, no waveform can attain the minimum ESL over any compact two-dimensional region, leading to a no-optimality (no-go) result under the DP-AF framework. For the FST-AF, the closed-form ESL and EISL expressions reveal a constellation-dependent regime governed by its kurtosis: The OFDM modulation achieves the minimum ESL for sub-Gaussian constellations, whereas the OTFS waveform becomes optimal for super-Gaussian constellations. Finally, four representative waveforms, namely, SC, OFDM, OTFS, and AFDM, are examined under both frameworks, and all theoretical results are verified through numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Improvement and Stabilization of Output Voltages in a Vertical Tidal Turbine Using Intelligent Control Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article investigates on the improvement and stabilization of alternating current (AC) and direct current (DC) output voltages in a Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generator (PMSG) driven by a vertical-axis tidal turbine using advanced control strategies. The research integrates artificial intelligence (AI)-based techniques to enhance voltage stability and efficiency. Initially, the Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) approach based on Tip Speed Ratio (TSR) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) Fuzzy logic controllers is explored. To further optimize the performance, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and a hybrid ANN-PSO methodology are implemented. These strategies aim to refine the reference rotational speed of the turbine while minimizing deviations from optimal power extraction conditions. The simulation results of a tidal turbine operating at a water flow velocity of 1.5 m/s demonstrate that the PSO-based control approach significantly enhances the voltage stability compared to conventional MPPT-TSR and ANN-Fuzzy controllers. The hybrid ANN-PSO technique improves the voltage regulation by dynamically adapting to system variations and providing real-time reference speed adjustments. This research highlights the AI-based hybrid optimization benefit to stabilize the output voltage of tidal energy systems, thereby increasing reliability and efficiency in renewable energy applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13749v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The upcoming 6G mobile communication standard will offer a revolutionary new feature: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) reuses mobile communication signals to realize multi-static radar for various applications including localization. Consequently, applied ISAC propagation research necessitates to evolve from classical monostatic radar cross section (RCS) measurement of static targets on to bistatic radar reflectivity characterization of dynamic objects. Here, we introduce our Bistatic Radar (BIRA) measurement facility for independent spherical positioning of two probes with sub-millimeter accuracy on a diameter of up to 7 m and with almost continuous frequency coverage from 0.7 up to 260 GHz. Currently, BIRA is the only bistatic measurement facility capable of unrestricted ISAC research: In addition to vector network analysis, it employs advanced wideband transceiver technology with an instantaneous bandwidth of up to 4 GHz. These transceivers grant BIRA the unique capability to characterize dynamic targets in both Doppler and range, while also significantly accelerating measurements on static objects. Additionally, the installation is capable of spherical near-field antenna measurements over these wide frequency ranges.</description>

Abstract: Quantum computing is poised to redefine the algorithmic foundations of communication systems. While quantum superposition and entanglement enable quadratic or exponential speedups for specific problems, identifying use cases where these advantages yield engineering benefits is still nontrivial. This article presents the fundamentals of quantum computing in a style familiar to the communications society, outlining the current limits of fault-tolerant quantum computing and clarifying a mathematical harmony between quantum and wireless systems, which makes the topic more enticing to wireless researchers. Based on a systematic review of pioneering and state-of-the-art studies indicating speedup opportunities, we distill common design trends for the research and development of quantum-accelerated communication systems and highlight lessons learned. The key insight is that quantum algorithms, including their gate-level realizations, can benefit from the design intuition applied in communication engineering. This article aims to catalyze interdisciplinary research at the frontier of quantum information processing and future communication systems.</description>

      <title>Affine Frequency Division Multiplexing (AFDM) for 6G: Properties, Features, and Challenges</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21704v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) is an emerging waveform candidate for future sixth generation (6G) systems offering a range of promising features, such as enhanced robustness in heterogeneous and high-mobility environments, as well as inherent suitability for integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) applications. In addition, unlike other candidates such as orthogonal time-frequency space (OTFS) modulation, AFDM provides several unique advantages that strengthen its relevance to practical deployment and standardization in 6G. Notably, as a natural generalization of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), strong backward compatibility with existing conventional systems is guaranteed, while also offering novel possibilities in waveform design, for example to enable physical-layer security through its inherent chirp parametrization. In all, this article provides an overview of AFDM, emphasizing its suitability as a candidate waveform for 6G standardization. First, we provide a concise introduction to the fundamental properties and unique characteristics of AFDM, followed by highlights of its advantageous features, and finally a discussion of its potential and challenges in 6G standardization efforts and representative requirements.</description>

      <title>On the Relation of Characteristic Modes of Different Conducting Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09282v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A formalism is derived to analyze the scattering of a conducting structure based on the characteristic modes of another structure whose surface is a superset of the first structure. This enables the analysis and comparison of different structures using a common basis of characteristic modes. Additionally, it is shown that the scattering matrices and perturbation matrices are no longer diagonal in these cases. Based on this, a modal transformation matrix is defined to describe the mapping between the characteristic fields and the weighting coefficients of the two structures. This matrix enables the conversion of the perturbation matrices in different bases. Finally, three examples are provided along with a discussion of some aspects of the theory. The first two examples aim to validate and illustrate the formalism. The third example shows how the formalism can be applied in the design process of an antenna element that is gradually modified, starting from a base structure.</description>

      <title>6D Movable Metasurface (6DMM) in Downlink NOMA Transmissions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17502v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This letter proposes a novel six-dimensional movable metasurface (6DMM)-assisted downlink non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) system, in which a conventional base station (BS) equipped with fixed antennas serves multiple users with the assistance of a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) with six-dimensional spatial configurability. In contrast to traditional RIS with static surface, the proposed 6DMM architecture allows each element to dynamically adjust its position and orient the whole metasurface in yaw-pitch-roll axes, enabling both in spatial and electromagnetic controls. We formulate a sum-rate maximization problem that jointly optimizes the BS NOMA-based beamforming, phase-shifts, element positions, and rotation angles of metasurface under constraints of NOMA power levels, unit-modulus of phase-shifts, power budget, inter-element separation and boundaries of element position/orientation. Due to non-convexity and high-dimensionality, we employ a probabilistic cross-entropy optimization (CEO) scheme to iteratively refine the solution distribution based on maximizing likelihood and elite solution sampling. Simulation results show that the proposed CEO-based 6DMM-NOMA architecture achieves substantial rate performance gains compared to 6DMM sub-structures, conventional static RIS, and other multiple access mechanisms. It also highlights the effectiveness of CEO providing probabilistic optimization for solving high-dimensional scalable metasurface.</description>

      <title>Design Principles of Zero-Shot Self-Supervised Unknown Emitter Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07026v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The proliferation of wireless devices necessitates more robust and reliable emitter detection and identification for critical tasks such as spectrum management and network security. Existing studies exploring methods for unknown emitters identification, however, are typically hindered by their dependence on labeled or proprietary datasets, unrealistic assumptions (e.g. all samples with identical transmitted messages), or deficiency of systematic evaluations across different architectures and design dimensions. In this work, we present a comprehensive evaluation of unknown emitter detection systems across key aspects of the design space, focusing on data modality, learning approaches, and feature learning modules. We demonstrate that prior self-supervised, zero-shot emitter detection approaches commonly use datasets with identical transmitted messages. To address this limitation, we propose a 2D-Constellation data modality for scenarios with varying messages, achieving up to a 40\% performance improvement in ROC-AUC, NMI, and F1 metrics compared to conventional raw I/Q data. Furthermore, we introduce interpretable Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) to enhance model transparency, and a Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)-based initialization procedure for feature learning modules operating on sparse 2D-Constellation data, which improves the performance of Deep Clustering approaches by up to 40\% across the same metrics comparing to the modules without SVD initialization. We evaluate all data modalities and learning modules across three learning approaches: Deep Clustering, Auto Encoder and Contrastive Learning.</description>

      <title>Development of a Transit-Time Ultrasonic Flow Measurement System for Partially Filled Pipes: Incorporating Flow Profile Correction Factor and Real-Time Clogging Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19310v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Flow measurement in partially filled pipes presents greater complexity compared to fully filled systems, primarily due to the complex velocity distribution within the cross-section, which is a key source of measurement inaccuracy. To address this challenge, an ultrasonic flow meter was designed and developed, capable of simultaneously measuring both flow velocity and fluid level. To improve measurement accuracy, a flow profile correction factor (FPCF) was derived based on the velocity distribution characteristics and applied to the raw flow meter output. A dedicated open-channel flow loop incorporating a 250 mm diameter pipe was constructed to test and calibrate the system under controlled conditions. Flow rates in the loop varied from 2 to 6 liters per second. The accuracy of the flow meter was evaluated using the Flow-Weighted Mean Error (FWME) metric. Experimental results showed that applying the FPCF significantly improved accuracy, reducing the maximum flow measurement error from 8.51% to 2.44%. Furthermore, calibration led to a substantial decrease in FWME from 1.78% to 0.08%, confirming the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. The flow meter was also subjected to clogging scenarios by artificially obstructing the flow. Under these conditions, the device was able to reliably measure the flow and successfully detected the clogging, triggering an alarm to the operator to take necessary action.</description>

      <title>Geometry Aware Meta-Learning Neural Network for Joint Phase and Precoder Optimization in RIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11270v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) aided systems, the joint optimization of the precoder matrix at the base station and the phase shifts of the RIS elements involves significant complexity. In this paper, we propose a complex-valued, geometry aware meta-learning neural network that maximizes the weighted sum rate in a multi-user multiple input single output system. By leveraging the complex circle geometry for phase shifts and spherical geometry for the precoder, the optimization occurs on Riemannian manifolds, leading to faster convergence. We use a complex-valued neural network for phase shifts and an Euler inspired update for the precoder network. Our approach outperforms existing neural network-based algorithms, offering higher weighted sum rates, lower power consumption, and significantly faster convergence. Specifically, it converges faster by nearly 100 epochs, with a 0.7 bps improvement in weighted sum rate and a 1.8 dB power gain when compared with existing work. Further it outperforms the state-of-the-art alternating optimization algorithm by 0.86 bps with a 2.6 dB power gain.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20304v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Digital Signal Processing (DSP) and Digital Image Processing (DIP) with Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) are popular research areas in Computer Vision and related fields. We highlight transformative applications in image enhancement, filtering techniques, and pattern recognition. By integrating frameworks like the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), Z-Transform, and Fourier Transform methods, we enable robust data manipulation and feature extraction essential for AI-driven tasks. Using Python, we implement algorithms that optimize real-time data processing, forming a foundation for scalable, high-performance solutions in computer vision. This work illustrates the potential of ML and DL to advance DSP and DIP methodologies, contributing to artificial intelligence, automated feature extraction, and applications across diverse domains.</description>

      <title>Random-phase Wave Splatting of Translucent Primitives for Computer-generated Holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17480v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Holographic near-eye displays offer ultra-compact form factors for VR/AR systems but rely on advanced computer-generated holography (CGH) algorithms to convert 3D scenes into interference patterns on spatial light modulators (SLMs). Conventional CGH typically generates smooth-phase holograms, limiting view-dependent effects and realistic defocus blur, while severely under-utilizing the SLM space-bandwidth product.
  We propose Random-phase Wave Splatting (RPWS), a unified wave optics rendering framework that converts arbitrary 3D representations based on 2D translucent primitives into random-phase holograms. RPWS is fully compatible with modern 3D representations such as Gaussians and triangles, improves bandwidth utilization which effectively enlarges eyebox size, reconstructs accurate defocus blur and parallax, and leverages time-multiplexed rendering not as a heuristic for speckle suppression, but as a mathematically exact alpha-blending mechanism derived from first principles in statistics. At the core of RPWS are (1) a new wavefront compositing procedure and (2) an alpha-blending scheme for random-phase geometric primitives, ensuring correct color reconstruction and robust occlusion when compositing millions of primitives.
  RPWS departs substantially from the recent primitive-based CGH algorithm, Gaussian Wave Splatting (GWS). Because GWS uses smooth-phase primitives, it struggles to capture view-dependent effects and realistic defocus blur and under-utilizes the SLM space-bandwidth product; moreover, naively extending GWS to random-phase primitives fails to reconstruct accurate colors. In contrast, RPWS is designed from the ground up for arbitrary random-phase translucent primitives, and through simulations and experimental validations we demonstrate state-of-the-art image quality and perceptually faithful 3D holograms for next-generation near-eye displays.</description>
