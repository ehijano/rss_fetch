      <title>A short blanket for cosmology: the CMB lensing anomaly behind the preference for a negative neutrino mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent analyses combining cosmic microwave background (CMB) and baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) challenge particle physics constraints on the total neutrino mass, pointing to values smaller than the lower limit from neutrino oscillation experiments. To examine the impact of different CMB likelihoods from $\mathit{Planck}$, lensing potential measurements from $\mathit{Planck}$ and ACT, and BAO data from DESI, we introduce an effective neutrino mass parameter ($\sum \tilde{m}_{\nu}$) which is allowed to take negative values. We investigate its correlation with two extra parameters capturing the impact of gravitational lensing on the CMB: one controlling the smoothing of the peaks of the temperature and polarization power spectra; one rescaling the lensing potential amplitude. In this configuration, we infer $\sum \tilde{m}_{\nu}=-0.018^{+0.085}_{-0.089}~\text{eV}~(68\% ~\text{C.L.})$, which is fully consistent with the minimal value required by neutrino oscillation experiments. We attribute the apparent preference for negative neutrino masses to an excess of gravitational lensing detected by late-time cosmological probes compared to that inferred from $\mathit{Planck}$ CMB angular power spectra. We discuss implications in light of the DESI BAO measurements and the CMB lensing anomaly.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes from Kinetic Preheating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that violent kinetic preheating following inflation can lead to the formation of black holes in the early Universe. In $\alpha$-attractor models with derivative inflaton couplings, nonlinear amplification of field fluctuations drives large spacetime curvature and gravitational collapse shortly after inflation ends. Using fully general-relativistic lattice simulations, we find that these dynamics produce black holes with masses of order tens of grams at sub-horizon scales, without requiring large primordial curvature perturbations. Although such micro-black holes evaporate rapidly via Hawking radiation, their formation modifies the post-inflationary equation of state and their evaporation can successfully reheat the Universe before Big Bang nucleosynthesis. These results identify kinetic preheating as a new, efficient channel for black-hole production and establish a direct connection between inflationary symmetries and strong-gravity phenomena at reheating.</description>

      <title>Measurement of angular cross-correlation between the cosmological dispersion measure and the thermal Sunyaev--Zeldovich effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dispersion measures (${\rm DMs}$) from fast radio bursts (FRBs) and the thermal Sunyaev--Zeldovich (tSZ) effect probe the free-electron density and pressure, respectively, in the intergalactic medium (IGM) and the intervening galaxies and clusters. Their combination enables disentangling the gas density and temperature. In this work, we present the first detection of an angular cross-correlation between the ${\rm DMs}$ and the Compton $y$ parameter of the tSZ effect. The theoretical expectation is calculated using the halo model $\texttt{HMx}$, calibrated with hydrodynamic simulations. The observational cross-correlation is measured over angular separations of $1^\prime$--$1000^\prime$ using the ${\rm DMs}$ from $133$ localized FRBs and the $y$-maps from the Planck satellite and the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT). We detect a positive correlation with amplitudes of $\mathcal{A}=2.26 \pm 0.56$ ($4.0 \sigma$) for Planck and $\mathcal{A}=1.38 \pm 0.92$ ($1.5 \sigma$) for ACT, where $\mathcal{A}=1$ corresponds to the theoretical prediction of the Planck 2018 $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. Assuming an isothermal gas, the measured amplitude implies an average electron temperature of $\approx 2 \times 10^7 \, {\rm K}$. The correlation is highly sensitive to the matter clustering parameter $\sigma_8$, and its dependence on other cosmological and astrophysical parameters -- such as the ionized fraction, the Hubble constant, and baryon feedback -- differs from that of the ${\rm DM}$ alone. This suggests that future joint analyses of the ${\rm DMs}$ and the tSZ effect could help break degeneracies among these parameters.</description>

      <title>Exploring One-point Statistics in HERA Phase I Data: Effects of Foregrounds and Systematics on Measuring One-Point Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measuring one-point statistics in redshifted 21 cm intensity maps offers an opportunity to explore non-Gaussian features of the early universe. We assess the impact of instrumental effects on measurements made with the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA) by forward modeling observational and simulation data. Using HERA Phase I observations over 94 nights, we examine the second (m2, variance) and third (m3) moments of images. We employ the DAYENU-filtering method for foreground removal and reduce simulated foreground residuals to 10% of the 21 cm signal residuals. In noiseless cosmological simulations, the amplitudes of one-point statistics measurements are significantly reduced by the instrument response and further reduced by wedge-filtering. Analyses with wedge-filtered observational data, along with expected noise simulations, show that systematics alter the probability distribution of the map pixels. Likelihood analysis based on the observational data shows m2 measurements disfavor the cold reionization model characterized by inefficient X-ray heating, in line with other power spectra measurements. Small signals in m3 due to the instrument response of the Phase I observation and wedge-filtering make it challenging to use these non-Gaussian statistics to explore model parameters. Forecasts with the full HERA array predict high signal-to-noise ratios for m2, m3, and S3 assuming no foregrounds, but wedge-filtering drastically reduces these ratios. This work demonstrates conclusively that a comprehensive understanding of instrumental effects on m2 and m3 is essential for their use as a cosmological probe, given their dependence on the underlying model.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of dark energy using DESI DR2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using a model-independent Gaussian process (GP) method to reconstruct the dimensionless luminosity distance $D$ and its derivatives, we derive the evolution of the dimensionless Hubble parameter $E$, the deceleration parameter $q$, and the state parameter $w$ of dark energy. We utilize the PantheonPlus, SH0ES, and Gamma Ray Burst (GRB) data to derive the dimensionless luminosity distance $D$. Additionally, we employ observational $H(z)$ data (OHD) and baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) from Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release 2 (DR2) to obtain the first derivative of the dimensionless luminosity distance $D^{'}$. To obtain the reconstructed $D$ and $D^{'}$, we utilize the fiducial value from each dataset, with particular emphasis on the varying $H_0$. According to the reconstruction results obtained from PantheonPlus+SH0ES+GRB+OHD and PantheonPlus+SH0ES+GRB+OHD+DESI data, we find that $E$ are consistent with the predictions of the $\Lambda$CDM model at a $2\sigma$ confidence level within the redshift range of $z&lt;2$. However, the reconstruction results for $q$ exhibit deviations from the $\Lambda$CDM model in the range of $z&lt;0.3$. Furthermore, we observe that the mean value of $w$ exhibits evolving behavior, transiting from $w &lt; -1$ to $w &gt; -1$ around $z_{\rm wt}=0.464^{+0.235}_{-0.120}$. Combining data from DESI DR2 can slightly enhance the accuracy of our constraints.</description>

      <title>Weak-Lensing Analysis of the Galaxy Cluster Abell 85: Constraints on the Merger Scenarios of Its Southern Subcluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Abell 85 is a nearby (z=0.055) galaxy cluster that hosts a sloshing cool core, a feature commonly reported in relaxed clusters. However, the presence of multiple past and ongoing mergers indicates that it is an active node within the Abell 85/87/89 complex. We present a weak gravitational lensing (WL) analysis using Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam imaging data to understand its assembly history by investigating the dark matter components of the substructures. Our mass reconstruction resolves three substructures associated with the brightest cluster galaxy (main), the southern (S) subcluster, and the southwestern (SW) subcluster, with WL peak significances of $&gt; 6\sigma$, $&gt; 5\sigma$, and $&gt; 4\sigma$, respectively. The locations of these mass peaks are consistent with those of the member galaxies. We estimate the masses of the main cluster ($M_{200c,main} = 2.91 \pm 0.72 \times 10^{14}\ M_\odot$) and the S subcluster ($M_{200c,S} = 1.23 \pm 0.52 \times 10^{14}\ M_\odot$) by fitting a multi-halo Navarro-Frenk-White profile. This $\sim$2:1 mass ratio indicates that the system is undergoing a major merger that is actively shaping the current dynamical state of Abell 85. Incorporating X-ray observations, we discuss the merger phase of the S subcluster and further examine the star-forming activity along the putative filament extending southeast of Abell 85.</description>

      <title>Redshift-dependent Distance Duality Violation in Resolving Multidimensional Cosmic Tensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate whether violations of the distance-duality relation (DDR) can resolve the multidimensional cosmic tensions characterized by the $H_0$ and $S_8$ discrepancies. Using the Fisher-bias formalism, we reconstruct minimal, data-driven $\eta(z)$ profiles that capture the late-time deviations required to reconcile early- and late-Universe calibrations. While a constant DDR offset preserves the Pantheon-inferred matter density $\Omega_m = 0.334 \pm 0.018$--leaving its inconsistency with the Planck best-fit $\Lambda$CDM model and weak-lensing surveys unresolved--a time-varying DDR substantially reduces cross-dataset inconsistencies and improves the global fit, yielding $\Delta\chi^2 \simeq -10$ relative to $\Lambda$CDM when the SH0ES prior is excluded. This result suggests that the $\Omega_m$ discrepancy may represent indirect evidence for a time-varying DDR. A hybrid scenario combining a time-dependent DDR with a phantom-like dark energy transition achieves the most consistent global reconciliation, reducing the tension with DES-Y3 measurements to below $2\sigma$. These findings indicate that a mild DDR violation, coupled with evolving dark energy, offers a coherent pathway toward jointly addressing the $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions.</description>

      <title>Supernova Classification using the Recurrent Neural Network in the CSST Ultra-Deep Field Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study supernova (SN) classification using the machine learning method of the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) in the Chinese Space Station Survey Telescope Ultra-Deep Field (CSST-UDF) photometric survey, and explore the improvement of the cosmological constraint. We generate the mock light curve data of Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) and core collapse supernova (CCSN) using SNCosmo with SALT3 SN Ia model and CCSN templates, and apply the SuperNNova (SNN) program for classifying SNe. Our study indicates that the SNN combined with the Joint Light-curve Analysis like (JLA-like) cuts can enhance the purity of the CSST-UDF SN Ia sample up to over 99.5% with 2,193 SNe Ia and 4 CCSNe, which can significantly increase the reliability of the cosmological constraint results. The method based on the Bayesian Estimation Applied to Multiple Species (BEAMS) with Bias Corrections (BBC) framework is used to correct the SN Ia magnitude bias caused by the selection effect and CCSN contamination, and the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method is employed for cosmological constraints. We find that the accuracy of the constraints on the matter density $\Omega_{\rm M}$ and the equation of state of dark energy $w$ can achieve 14% and 18%, respectively, assuming the flat $w$CDM model. This result is comparable to that from the current surveys that relied on spectroscopic confirmation. It indicates that our data analysis method is effective, and the CSST-UDF SN photometric survey is powerful in exploring the expansion history of the Universe.</description>

      <title>Measuring the expansion history of the Universe with DESI Cosmic Chronometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studying large samples of massive, passively evolving galaxies (called cosmic chronometers, CC) provides us with the unique ability to measure the Universe's expansion history without assuming a cosmological model. The Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) DR1 is currently the largest, publicly available, homogeneous set of galaxies with reliable spectroscopic redshifts, and covers a wide range in redshift. We extracted all massive galaxies (stellar mass $\log M_{\star}/M_{\odot} &gt; 10.75$, and velocity dispersion $\sigma &gt; 280$ km s$^{-1}$), with no emission in [OII] $\lambda$ 3727 $\r{A}$, with reliable redshifts as well as reliable D4000$_{\rm n}$ measurements from DR1. From this sample of 360 000 massive, passive galaxies, we used D4000$_{\rm n}$ and the method of cosmic chronometers to get three new direct, independent measurements of $H(z)=$ 88.48 $\pm\ 0.57(\rm stat) \pm 12.32(\rm syst)$, $H(z)=$ 119.45 $\pm\ 6.39(\rm stat) \pm 16.64(\rm syst)$, and $H(z)= 108.28 \pm 10.07(\rm stat) \pm 15.08(\rm syst)$ $\rm km\ s^{-1}\ Mpc^{-1}$ at $z=0.46$, $z=0.67$, and $z=0.83$, respectively. This sample, which covers $0.3 &lt; z &lt; 1.0$, is the largest CC sample to date, and we reach statistical uncertainties of 0.65$\%$, 5.35$\%$, and 9.30$\%$ on our three measurements. Our measurements show no significant tension with the $\textit{Planck}$ $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. In our analysis, we also illustrate that even amongst samples of massive, passive galaxies, the effect of downsizing can clearly be seen.</description>

      <title>Reliable Parameter Inference for the Epoch of Reionization using Balanced Neural Ratio Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an application of the Balanced Neural Ratio Estimation (BNRE) algorithm to improve the statistical validity of parameter estimates used to characterize the Epoch of Reionization, where the common assumption of a multivariate Gaussian likelihood leads to overconfident and biased posterior distributions. Using a two-parameter model of the Ly$\alpha$ forest autocorrelation function, we show that BNRE yields posterior distributions that are significantly better calibrated than those obtained under the Gaussian likelihood assumption, as verified through the Test of Accuracy with Random Points (TARP) and Simulation-Based Calibration (SBC) diagnostics. These results demonstrate the potential of Simulation-Based Inference (SBI) methods, and in particular BNRE, to provide statistically robust parameter constraints within existing astrophysical modeling frameworks.</description>

      <title>Physical properties of long-rising type II Supernovae -- Bayesian Analytic Modelling and Spectrophotometric Correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supernova (SN) 1987A, with its long-rising ($\gtrsim$40~days) light curve, defines a rare subclass of type II SNe known as 1987A-like events. Representing only $\sim$1-3\% of all core-collapse SNe and often found in low-metallicity environments, their large diversity suggests a wide range of progenitor and explosion properties. This study aims to improve the understanding of 1987A-like SNe by characterizing their explosion parameters, including kinetic energy, ejected mass, progenitor radius at explosion, and synthesized $^{56}$Ni mass. Additionally, it seeks to identify systematic trends in both the physical properties and the observed features of these peculiar events. A new Bayesian parameter estimation method, based on our $^{56}$Ni-dependent analytical model for hydrogen-rich SNe, is applied to derive explosion parameters from the light curves and expansion velocities of one of the largest and most comprehensive 1987A-like SN samples to date. These data are measured through a consistent analysis of observations available in the literature. The analysis reveals a heterogeneous population that nevertheless clusters into two main groups: (i) lower-energy explosions with modest $^{56}$Ni yields ($\sim$0.07~M$_\odot$), similar to SN~1987A, and (ii) more energetic events (up to $\sim$5~foe) with larger nickel production and, in some cases, unusually extended progenitors. We confirm a robust correlation between $^{56}$Ni mass, peak luminosity, and explosion energy, as well as between ejecta mass and recombination timescale. An anti-correlation between Ba~II line strength and photospheric velocity indicates that stronger Ba~II absorptions in 1987A-like SNe arise from more compact, slowly expanding ejecta. Our study underscores the need to extend analytical frameworks to include additional power sources, enabling scalable and accurate modelling of the growing number of peculiar transients.</description>

      <title>Improving Bayesian inference in PTA data analysis: importance nested sampling with Normalizing Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a detailed study of Bayesian inference workflows for pulsar timing array data with a focus on enhancing efficiency, robustness and speed through the use of normalizing flow-based nested sampling. Building on the Enterprise framework, we integrate the i-nessai sampler and benchmark its performance on realistic, simulated datasets. We analyze its computational scaling and stability, and show that it achieves accurate posteriors and reliable evidence estimates with substantially reduced runtime, by up to three orders of magnitude depending on the dataset configuration, with respect to conventional single-core parallel-tempering MCMC analyses. These results highlight the potential of flow-based nested sampling to accelerate PTA analyses while preserving the quality of the inference.</description>

      <title>Addressing prior dependence in hierarchical Bayesian modeling for PTA data analysis II: Noise and SGWB inference through parameter decorrelation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pulsar Timing Arrays provide a powerful framework to measure low-frequency gravitational waves, but accuracy and robustness of the results are challenged by complex noise processes that must be accurately modeled. Standard PTA analyses assign fixed uniform noise priors to each pulsar, an approach that can introduce systematic biases when combining the array. To overcome this limitation, we adopt a hierarchical Bayesian modeling strategy in which noise priors are parametrized by higher-level hyperparameters. We further address the challenge posed by the correlations between hyperparameters and physical noise parameters, focusing on those describing red noise and dispersion measure variations. To decorrelate these quantities, we introduce an orthogonal reparametrization of the hierarchical model implemented with Normalizing Flows. We also employ i-nessai, a flow-guided nested sampler, to efficiently explore the resulting higher-dimensional parameter space. We apply our method to a minimal 3-pulsar case study, performing a simultaneous inference of noise and SGWB parameters. Despite the limited dataset, the results consistently show that the hierarchical treatment constrains the noise parameters more tightly and partially alleviates the red-noise-SGWB degeneracy, while the orthogonal reparametrization further enhances parameter independence without affecting the correlations intrinsic to the power-law modeling of the physical processes involved.</description>

      <title>Dark neutron stars from a heavy dark sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the formation and properties of dark neutron stars in a scenario where dark matter is made up of (heavy) dark baryons in a sequestered copy of the MSSM. This scenario naturally explains the coincidence of baryonic and dark matter abundances without the need for tuning particle masses. In particular, the supersymmetry breaking scales in the visible and dark sectors may differ by up to 10-11 orders of magnitude. We argue that dark neutrons should be the lightest dark baryons, but that dark protons may be cosmologically long lived. This allows a small fraction of dark matter to remain ionized until the first halos start to form, providing cooling mechanisms that foster the gravitational collapse and fragmentation of sub-halo structures, ultimately resulting in dark neutron star and black hole formation. For a wide range of model parameters, we find dark neutron stars with generally smaller mass and radius than ordinary visible sector neutron stars. We also discuss their potential detectability, particularly through gravitational microlensing and dark magnetic dipole radiation at radio frequencies through photon-dark photon kinetic mixing.</description>

      <title>Ultra-relativistic freeze-out: a bridge from WIMPs to FIMPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We re-examine the case for dark matter (DM) produced by ultra-relativistic freeze-out (UFO). UFO is the mechanism by which Standard Model (SM) neutrinos decouple from the radiation bath in the early universe at a temperature $T_{d} \approx 1$ MeV. This corresponds to chemical freeze-out without Boltzmann suppression, such that the freeze-out (decoupling) temperature $T_{d}$ is much greater than $m_{\nu}$ and the neutrinos are therefore ultra-relativistic at freeze-out. While UFO has historically been rejected as a viable mechanism for DM production due to its association with hot DM and the accompanying incompatibility with $\Lambda$CDM, we show that when the approximation of instantaneous reheating after inflation is lifted, UFO can produce cold DM and account for the entire observed relic density in large regions of parameter space. In fact, DM with masses ranging from sub-eV to PeV scales can undergo UFO and be cold before structure formation, given only a simple perturbative, post-inflationary reheating period prior to radiation domination. For some interactions, such as a contact interaction between the Higgs and DM scalars, there is a seamless transition between the WIMP and FIMP regimes which excludes UFO. However, for many other interactions, such as SM fermions producing fermionic DM via a heavy scalar or vector mediator, the WIMP to FIMP transition occurs \textit{necessarily} via a large intermediate region corresponding to UFO. We characterize the general features of UFO in this paper, while we supply a more detailed analysis in a companion paper. We find that UFO during reheating can produce the correct relic density ($\Omega_{\chi}h^2 = 0.12$) for DM masses spanning about 13 orders of magnitude, reheating temperatures spanning 17 orders of magnitude, and beyond the Standard Model (BSM) effective interaction scales spanning 11 orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Euler-Heisenberg action for fermions coupled to gauge and axial vectors: Hessian diagonalization, sector classification, and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the closed-form one-loop Euler--Heisenberg effective actions for Dirac fermions coupled simultaneously to classical electromagnetic vector and massive pseudo-vector backgrounds within a controlled quasi-static approximation. Through complete diagonalization of the functional Hessian, we systematically delineate the parameter space into distinct sectors characterized by stability properties and spectral structure. We identify subspaces that encompass and extend results from previous studies into a broader class, admitting propagating axial fields as physically viable regimes; strikingly, we note a sector presenting chirality-asymmetric instability. This addresses long-standing questions regarding the well-defined nature, diagonalizability, and stability of the model. From the effective action, we derive novel nonperturbative pair-production rates for simultaneously propagating electromagnetic and axial vector backgrounds; remarkably, we find pronounced vacuum stabilization compared to previous results. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this framework allows for a unified derivation of the chiral anomaly structures in the general case and show that the electromagnetic coupling induces instanton-like configurations for the axial field, even when it is not a fundamental gauge field. As a proof-of-concept, we analyze a cosmological toy model of baryogenesis driven by an axial vector, providing numerical estimates that support the viability of this hypothesis. Additionally, we outline qualitative predictions for Weyl/Dirac semi-metals and briefly discuss potential applications in related phenomena, such as the Strong-CP problem.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter Freeze-in from a $Z^\prime$ Reheaton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the Standard Model (SM) extended by a secluded $U(1)_D$ gauge sector encompassing a Dirac fermion ($\chi$) dark matter (DM), an abelian gauge boson $Z^\prime$ and a SM-singlet complex-scalar field $\Phi$, whose radial component drives cosmic inflation. When the Higgs portal coupling is small, the $Z^\prime$ then acts as a {\it ``reheaton''}, dominating the energy budget of the Universe before finally yielding the SM bath, with reheating temperature $&lt; O(10)$ TeV, through the gauge portal interaction. We explore the possibility that DM freezes-in via non-thermal $Z^\prime$ decays before reheating ends, giving rise to substantial viable parameter space. We account for non-perturbative effects, relevant during the initial stages of reheating, using lattice simulations. We additionally show how the cosmological gravitational wave (GW) background produced by preheating and inflation allow for a direct probe of the reheating mechanism.</description>

      <title>ELAIS-N1 Deep Field uGMRT Band-2: Constraints on Diffuse Galactic Synchrotron Emission Power Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present high sensitivity, low radio frequency continuum observations of the ELAIS-N1 field with 32 hours of observations of the uGMRT Band-2 ($120-250$ MHz) covering $5.86\,\text{deg}^2$ area, achieving a central off-source RMS noise of $237\,\mu\mathrm{Jy}/\mathrm{beam}$ with a resolution of $11.45''$ at the central frequency of 183 MHz. A radio source catalogue of 1027 sources statistically matches with similar observations at different frequencies within the sensitivity range of the uGMRT. The calibrated data is further used to characterise the dominant foreground, the Diffuse Galactic Synchrotron Emission (DGSE), in angular scale and frequency regime. We derived the angular power spectrum (APS) of DGSE in two ways: image-based estimator (i-APS) and visibility-based Tapered Gridded Estimator (TGE; hereafter as t-APS). We assess the characteristics of DGSE with a power-law form of $C_{\ell} = A({1000}/{\ell})^{\beta}$. Combining data from Band-2 and earlier Band-3 observations, we derived a spectral variation of $C_{\ell}$ in the form of $C_{\ell} = A{\nu^{-2{\alpha}}}{\ell^{-{\beta}}}$. Our result indicates a spectral break at $\nu = 230\,{\pm}\,5$ MHz, corresponding to a synchrotron age of $t_\text{syn} = 106\,{\pm}\,1$ Myr for the cosmic-ray electrons (CRe). This break result suggests a low-energy cutoff in the CRe population, leading to spectral curvature at low frequencies. Using both of the techniques, i-APS and t-APS, we find that the mean spectral index $\alpha$ and power-law index $\beta$ are consistent within the frequency range $120-500$ MHz.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent observations suggest that the accelerated expansion of the Universe at late times is caused by a temporally changing dark energy component, rather than the constant one in the standard $\Lambda$CDM scenario. In this context quintessence, i.e. a canonical scalar field minimally coupled to gravity, plays a prominent role. There are, however, three main types of quintessence models: thawing quintessence, scaling freezing quintessence, and tracking quintessence. Dynamical systems reformulations of the field equations for a broad set of scalar field potentials, including some new ones, allow us to use dynamical systems methods to derive global and asymptotic features, visualised in bounded state space pictures clearly illustrating the relationships and properties of the different types of quintessence, clarifying initial data issues, and yielding simple and accurate approximations.</description>

      <title>Observational tests of the conformal osculating Barthel-Kropina cosmological model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider detailed cosmological tests of dark energy models obtained from the general conformal transformation of the Kropina metric, representing an $(\alpha,\beta)$-type Finslerian geometry. In particular, we restrict our analysis to the osculating Barthel-Kropina geometry. The Kropina metric function is defined as the ratio of the square of a Riemannian metric $\alpha$ and of the one-form $\beta$. In this framework we also consider the role of the conformal transformations of the metric, which allows to introduce a family of conformal Barthel-Kropina theories in an osculating geometry. The models obtained in this way are described by second order field equations, in the presence of an effective scalar field induced by the conformal factor. The generalized Friedmann equations of the model are obtained by adopting for the Riemannian metric $\alpha$ the Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker representation. In order to close the cosmological field equations we assume a specific relationship between the component of the one-form $\beta$ and the conformal factor. With this assumption, the cosmological evolution is determined by the initial conditions of the scalar field and a single free parameter $\gamma$ of the model. The conformal Barthel-Kropina cosmological models are compared against several observational datasets, including Cosmic Chronometers, Type Ia Supernovae, and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis, which allows the determination of $\gamma$. A comparison with the predictions of standard $\Lambda$CDM model is also performed. Our results indicate that the conformal osculating Barthel-Kropina model can be considered as a successful, and simple, alternative to standard cosmological models.</description>

      <title>Redshift-Space Distortion constraints on neutrino mass and models to alleviate the Hubble tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21925v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the neutrino mass and Hubble tension solutions and examine their effects on the Redshift-Space Distortion (RSD) observations. An analysis with RSD data indicates smaller amplitude of perturbation. Including RSD data results in a slightly weaker upper limit on the neutrino mass than that derived for data without RSD, which is common in other extended models too. We have evaluated the impacts of RSD observations on some extended models, including the varying electron mass model, a time-dependent dark energy model with two parameter equations of state (EOS), and a model where the number of neutrino species is free. When we estimate the cosmological parameters for data including RSD, we found that the EOS parameter for dark energy is larger than that of the cosmological constant, and the effective number of neutrino species is smaller than the standard value, which infers a smaller present Hubble parameter $H_0$. From the viewpoint of cosmological tensions, the varying electron mass model with non-zero neutrino mass option looks promising to relax the Hubble tension and the $S_8$ tension simultaneously.</description>

      <title>Modified Gravity Constraints from the Full Shape Modeling of Clustering Measurements from DESI 2024</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12026v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present cosmological constraints on deviations from general relativity (GR) from the first-year of clustering observations from Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) in combination with other datasets. We first consider $\mu(a,k)$-$\Sigma(a,k)$ modified gravity (MG) parametrization (as well as $\eta(a,k)$) in flat $\Lambda$CDM and $w_0 w_a$CDM backgrounds. Using a functional form for time-only evolution gives $\mu_0=0.11^{+0.44}_{-0.54}$ from DESI(FS+BAO)+BBN and a wide prior on $n_{s}$. Using DESI(FS+BAO)+CMB+DESY3+DESY5-SN, we obtain $\mu_0=0.05\pm 0.22$ and $\Sigma_0=0.008\pm 0.045$ in the $\Lambda$CDM background. In $w_0 w_a$CDM, we obtain $\mu_0=-0.24^{+0.32}_{-0.28}$ and $\Sigma_0=0.006\pm 0.043$, consistent with GR, and still find a preference for dynamical dark energy with $w_0&gt;-1$ and $w_a&lt;0$. We then use binned forms in the 2 backgrounds starting with 2 bins in redshift and then adding 2 bins in scale for a total of 4 and 8 MG parameters, respectively. All MG parameters are found consistent with GR. We also find that the tension reported for $\Sigma_0$ with GR from Planck PR3 goes away when using LoLLiPoP+HiLLiPoP likelihoods. As noted previously, this seems to indicate the tension is related to CMB lensing anomaly in PR3 which is also resolved when using these likelihoods. We then constrain the class of Horndeski theory in both EFT-basis and $\alpha$-basis. Assuming a power law for the non-minimal coupling function $\Omega$, we obtain $\Omega_0=0.012^{+0.001}_{-0.012}$ and $s_0=0.996^{+0.54}_{-0.20}$ from DESI(FS+BAO)+DESY5SN+CMB in a $\Lambda$CDM background, consistent with GR. Using the $\alpha$-basis with no-braiding ($\alpha_B=0$) gives $c_M&lt;1.14$, in agreement with GR. However, we see a mild yet consistent indication for $c_B&gt;0$ when $\alpha_B$ is varied which will require further study to determine whether this is due to systematics or new physics.

      <title>BrahMap: A scalable and modular map-making framework for the CMB experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16122v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments have reached an era of unprecedented precision and complexity. Aiming to detect the primordial B-mode polarization signal, these experiments will soon be equipped with $10^{4}$ to $10^{5}$ detectors. Consequently, future CMB missions will face the substantial challenge of efficiently processing vast amounts of raw data to produce the initial scientific outputs - the sky maps - within a reasonable time frame and with available computational resources. To address this, we introduce BrahMap, a new map-making framework that will be scalable across both CPU and GPU platforms. Implemented in C++ with a user-friendly Python interface for handling sparse linear systems, BrahMap employs advanced numerical analysis and high-performance computing techniques to maximize the use of super-computing infrastructure. This work features an overview of the BrahMap's capabilities and preliminary performance scaling results, with application to a generic CMB polarization experiment.</description>

Abstract: In this article we use the latest cosmological observations, including SNe, BAO, CC and RSD, to reconstruct the cosmological evolution via the Gaussian process. At the background level, we find consistency with the quintom dynamics for different data combinations and divide the characteristics of dark energy into three different categories, which are negative-energy dark energy, late-dominated dark energy and oscillating dark energy, respectively. Considering the effect of modified gravity on the growth of matter perturbations, the reconstruction results at the perturbative level show that we only need minor corrections to general relativity. Furthermore, we provide theoretical interpretation for the three different types of dynamical dark-energy behavior, in the framework of modified gravity, scalar fields, and dark-energy equation-of-state parametrizations. Finally, we show that all of these models can be unified in the framework of effective field theory.</description>

      <title>Accelerating the standard siren method: Improved constraints on modified gravitational-wave propagation with future data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02034v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) from compact binary mergers have emerged as one of the most promising probes of cosmology and General Relativity (GR). However, a major challenge in fully exploiting GWs as standard sirens with current and future GW observatories is developing efficient and robust codes capable of analyzing the increasing data volumes that are, and will be, acquired. We present here CHIMERA 2.0, an advanced computational framework for hierarchical Bayesian inference of cosmological, modified gravity, and population hyperparameters using standard sirens and galaxy catalogs. This upgrade introduces novel GPU-accelerated algorithms to estimate the hierarchical likelihood, enabling the analysis of thousands of events - crucial for next-generation experiments - and includes the two-parameter ($\Xi_0-n$) modified GW propagation model. Using CHIMERA 2.0, we forecast cosmological and modified GW propagation constraints for the future LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA O5-like run. We analyze three binary black hole populations of 300 events at SNR&gt;20, each with a different value of $\Xi_0$: 0.6, 1 (corresponding to GR), and 1.8. Multiple analyses were performed each catalog, comprising a population of approximately 5000 events, thanks to CHIMERA 2.0, which is 10-1000 times faster depending on the settings and catalog size. We jointly infer cosmological, modified GW propagation, and population hyperparameters. With spectroscopic galaxy catalogs, the fiducial $\Xi_0$ is recovered with a precision of $22\%$, $7.5\%$, and $10\%$ for $\Xi_0$ = 0.6, 1, and 1.8, respectively; while the precision on $H_0$ is 2-7 times worse than when $\Xi_0$ is not inferred. Finally,in the case of photometric redshifts the constraints degrade on average by 3.5 times in all cases, underscoring the importance of future spectroscopic surveys in maximizing the constraining power of standard sirens.</description>

Abstract: The multi-tracer (MT) technique has been shown to outperform single-tracer analyses in the context of galaxy clustering. In this paper, we conduct a series of Fisher analyses to further explore MT information gains within the framework of non-linear bias expansion. We examine how MT performance depends on the bias parameters of the subtracers, showing that directly splitting the non-linear bias generally leads to smaller error bars in $A_s$, $h$, and $\omega_{\rm cdm}$ compared to a simple split in $b_1$. This finding opens the door to identifying subsample splits that do not necessarily rely on very distinct linear biases. We discuss different total and subtracer number density scenarios, as well as the possibility of splitting into more than two tracers. Additionally, we consider how different Fingers-of-God suppression scales for the subsamples can be translated into different $k_{\rm max}$ values. Finally, we present forecasts for ongoing and future galaxy surveys.</description>

      <title>Effective Field Theory Constraints on Primordial Black Holes from the High-Redshift Lyman-$\alpha$ Forest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04767v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present updated constraints on the abundance of primordial black holes (PBHs) dark matter from the high-redshift Lyman-$\alpha$ forest data from MIKE/HIRES experiments. Our analysis leverages an effective field theory (EFT) description of the 1D flux power spectrum, allowing us to analytically predict the Lyman-$\alpha$ fluctuations on quasi-linear scales from first principles. Our EFT-based likelihood enables robust inference across redshifts $z = 4.2-5.4$ and down to scales of 100 kpc, within previously unexplored regions of parameter space for this dataset. We derive new bounds on the PBH fraction with respect to the total dark matter $f_{\text{PBH}}$, excluding populations with $f_{\text{PBH}} \gtrsim 10^{-3}$ for masses $M_{\text{PBH}} \sim 10^{4}-10^{16} M_{\odot}$. This offers the leading constraint for PBHs heavier than $10^{9} M_{\odot}$ and highlights the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest as a uniquely sensitive probe of new physics models that modify the structure formation history of our universe.</description>

      <title>Constraining Cosmology with Double-source-plane Strong Gravitational Lenses from the AGEL Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15012v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Double-source-plane strong gravitational lenses (DSPLs), with two sources at different redshifts, are independent cosmological probes of the dark energy equation of state parameter $w$ and the matter density parameter $\Omega_{\rm m}$. We present the lens model for the DSPL AGEL035346$-$170639 and infer cosmological constraints from this system for flat $\Lambda$ cold dark matter and flat $w$CDM cosmologies. From the joint posterior of $w$ and $\Omega_{\rm m}$ in the flat $w$CDM cosmology, we extract the following median values and 1$\sigma$ uncertainties: $w = -1.52^{+0.49}_{-0.33}$ and $\Omega_{\rm m} = 0.192^{+0.305}_{-0.131}$ from AGEL0353 alone. Combining our measurements with two previously analyzed DSPLs, we present the joint constraint on these parameters from a sample of three, the largest galaxy-scale DSPL sample used for cosmological measurement to date. The combined precision of $w$ from three DSPLs is higher by 15% over AGEL0353 alone. Combining DSPL and cosmic microwave background (CMB) measurements improves the precision of $w$ from CMB-only constraints by 39%, demonstrating the complementarity of DSPLs with the CMB. Despite their promising constraining power, DSPLs are limited by sample size, with only a handful discovered so far. Although ongoing and near-future wide-area sky surveys will increase the number of known DSPLs by up to two orders of magnitude, these systems will still require dedicated high-resolution imaging and spectroscopic follow-ups like those presented in this paper. Our ASTRO 3D Galaxy Evolution with Lenses collaboration is undertaking such follow-up campaigns for several newly discovered DSPLs and will provide cosmological measurements from larger samples of DSPLs in the future.</description>

      <title>Hubble Constant and Mass Determination of Centaurus A &amp; M83 from TRGB Distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09190v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An independent determination of the Hubble constant is crucial given the persistent tension between early- and late-Universe measurements. In this study, we analyze the dynamics of the Centaurus~A (CenA) and M83 galaxies, along with their associated dwarf companions identified via Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB) distance measurements, to constrain both the group mass and the local value of the Hubble constant ($H_0$). By examining the motions of these galaxies relative to the system's barycenter, we apply both the minor and major infall models, which provide bounds on the true radial velocity dispersion. From the overlap of these approaches, we obtain a virial mass estimate of $(7.3 \pm 2.0) \times 10^{12}\,M_{\odot}$ and a Hubble flow-based mass of $(2.6 \pm 1.4) \times 10^{12}\,M_{\odot}$. Modeling the cold Hubble flow around the group center of mass yields a corresponding Hubble constant of $(64.0 \pm 4.6)\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}$. These results offer an independent, dynamically motivated constraint on the local value of $H_0$, explicitly accounting for the impact of peculiar velocities in the nearby Universe. We also discuss the $\sim 2\sigma$ tension between the virial and Hubble flow-based mass estimates, which likely arises from the proximity of M83 to the velocity surface, breaking the assumptions of the Hubble flow model. While the Hubble flow fit emphasizes galaxies that follow smooth expansion on the lower branch of the velocity-distance relation, the virial mass estimate is in good agreement with the group mass derived from the $K$-band luminosity of its brightest members and from projected mass methods.</description>

      <title>Modular invariant inflation and reheating</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18603v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use modular symmetry as an organizing principle that attempts to simultaneously address the lepton flavor puzzle, inflation, and post-inflationary reheating. We demonstrate this approach using the finite modular group $A_4$ in the lepton sector. In our model, neutrino masses are generated via the Type-I see-saw mechanism, with modular symmetry dictating the form of the Yukawa couplings and right-handed neutrino masses. The modular field also drives inflation, providing an excellent fit to recent Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) observations. The corresponding prediction for the tensor-to-scalar ratio is very small, $r \sim \mathcal{O}(10^{-7})$, while the prediction for the running of the spectral index, $\alpha \sim -\mathcal{O}(10^{-3})$, could be tested in the near future. An appealing feature of the setup is that the inflaton-matter interactions required for reheating naturally arise from the expansion of relevant modular forms. Although the corresponding inflaton decay rates are suppressed by the Planck scale, the reheating temperature can still be high enough to ensure successful Big Bang nucleosynthesis. The same couplings responsible for reheating can also contribute to generating baryon asymmetry of the Universe through non-thermal leptogenesis. However, the contribution is negligibly small in the current inflationary setup.</description>

      <title>Modeling spatially-resolved galactic H$\alpha$ emission for galaxy clustering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08778v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Near-infrared spectroscopic surveys target high-redshift emission-line galaxies (ELGs) to probe cosmological scenarios. Understanding the clustering properties of ELGs is essential to derive optimal constraints. We present a simple radiative transfer model for spatially resolved galactic H$\alpha$ emission, which includes emission from the warm-hot diffuse interstellar medium. The atomic level populations are in steady-state and computed in the coronal approximation. The model is applied to multiple IllustrisTNG simulations in the redshift range $1\leq z \leq 2$ to produce the luminosity function (LF) and the halo occupation distribution (HOD). Collisional processes account for a significant fraction of $\approx 40\%$ of the total ${\rm H}\alpha$ luminosity ($L_{{\rm H}\alpha}$). Our LFs are in reasonable agreement with measurements from H$\alpha$ surveys if a uniform extinction of $0.3&lt;A_{{\rm H}\alpha}&lt;0.85$ mag is assumed. Our HOD is consistent with that of the ${\it Euclid}$ Flagship galaxy mock up to differences that can be attributed to baryonic feedback, which is absent from the latter. When H$\alpha$ luminosities are computed from an empirical relation between $L_{{\rm H}\alpha}$ and the total star formation rate (SFR) the resulting LFs are in tension with previous observations. Our approach can be extended to other atomic lines, which should be helpful for the mining of high-redshift galaxy spectra in forthcoming surveys.</description>

      <title>Insights from leptohadronic modelling of the brightest blazar flare</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12111v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The blazar 3C 454.3 experienced a major flare in November 2010, making it the brightest $\gamma$-ray source in the sky of the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT). We obtain seven daily consecutive spectral-energy distributions (SEDs) of the flare in the infrared, optical, ultraviolet, X-ray and $\gamma$-ray bands with publicly available data. We simulate the physical conditions in the blazar and show that the observed SEDs are well reproduced in the framework of a "standing feature" where the position of the emitting region is almost stationary, located beyond the outer radius of the broad-line region and into which fresh blobs of relativistically moving magnetised plasma are continuously injected. Meanwhile, a model with a single "moving blob" does not describe the data well. We obtain a robust upper limit to the amount of high-energy protons in the jet of 3C 454.3 from the electromagnetic SED. We construct a neutrino light curve of 3C 454.3 and estimate the expected neutrino yield at energies $\geq 100$ TeV for 3C 454.3 to be up to $6 \times 10^{-3}$ $\nu_{\mu}$ per year. Finally, we extrapolate our model findings to the light curves of all Fermi-LAT flat-spectrum radio quasars. We find that next-generation neutrino telescopes are expected to detect approximately one multimessenger ($\gamma + \nu_{\mu}$) flare per year from bright blazars with neutrino peak energy in the hundreds TeV -- hundreds PeV energy range and show that the electromagnetic flare peak can precede the neutrino arrival by months to years.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter Density Profile Around a Newborn First Star</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.17828v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ambient dark matter (DM) around binary black holes can imprint characteristic signatures on gravitational waves emitted from their merger. The exact signature depends sensitively on the DM density profile around the black holes. We run very high resolution cosmological hydrodynamics simulations of first star formation that follow the collapse of a $3\times10^{5}\,M_\odot$ mini-halo from $z=49$ to $z\simeq22$. Our flagship model achieves a DM particle mass of $3.7\times10^{-4}\,M_\odot$ and resolves the inner-most structure down to $0.02\,$pc. We show that the halo experiences a two-stage gravitational collapse, where a rotating, constant-density core with $r\lesssim3\,$pc is formed first, surrounded by an extended outskirts. Baryonic infall toward the center continues to raise the local Keplerian velocity and promotes adiabatic contraction of DM. The resulting density profile has an approximately power-law shape of $\rho_{\rm dm} \propto r^{-0.6}$ inside $\sim\!1\,$pc.We find that a piecewise power-law fit reproduces the simulation result to better than 10\%, and also find numerical convergence down to $\simeq\!0.01\,$pc. The DM density profile is typical for ordinary Pop~III halos, but our additional simulations reveal that inner slope varies significantly with halo-to-halo scatter, and the effect of Lyman-Werner irradiation and of supersonic baryon-DM streaming velocities, implying a wide distribution of slopes rather than a single universal curve. The large variation should be considered when calculating the predicted DM-induced dephasing of gravitational waves by up to an order of magnitude relative to the classical analytic model of the DM spike.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02719v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose the experimental simulation of cosmological perturbations governed by a Planck-scale induced Lorentz violating dispersion, aimed at distinguishing between early-universe models with similar power spectra. Employing a novel variant of the scaling approach for the evolution of a Bose-Einstein condensate with both contact and dipolar interactions, we capture the hitherto unobserved phenomenon of trans-Planckian damping. We show that scale invariance, and in turn, the duality of the power spectrum is subsequently broken at large momenta for an inflating gas, and at small momenta for a contracting gas. We thereby furnish a Planck-scale sensitive approach to analogue quantum cosmology that can readily be implemented in the quantum gas laboratory.</description>

      <title>Symmetries of Hot SM, Magnetic Flux &amp; Baryogenesis from Helicity Decay</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01576v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the electroweak crossover of the Standard Model (SM) in the early Universe, focusing on the interplay between generalized global symmetries, magnetic flux dynamics, and baryogenesis. Employing the dimensionally reduced 3d effective field theory of the SM at high temperature, we identify the symmetry structure -- including higher-form and magnetic symmetries -- and analyze their spontaneous breaking patterns across the crossover. We further define a gauge-invariant mixing angle that interpolates between $\mathrm{U}(1)_Y$ and $\mathrm{U}(1)_\mathrm{em}$ magnetic fields. Based on this framework, we examine baryogenesis via decaying magnetic helicity and identify three key effects: the baryon asymmetry is modified by an $\mathcal{O}(1)$ factor due to (1) the gauge-invariant definition of the mixing angle and (2) the approximate conservation of the unconfined magnetic flux; (3) a novel non-perturbative process in the presence of magnetic flux, which has been overlooked in previous analyses. Our findings suggest that the previous estimation of baryon asymmetry from the magnetic helicity decay may have sizable uncertainties, and we caution against relying on it, calling for further investigation.</description>

      <title>Weak Lensing Approximation of Wave-optics Effects from General Symmetric Lens Profiles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17486v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational lensing of electromagnetic (EM) waves has yielded many profound discoveries across fundamental physics, astronomy, astrophysics, and cosmology. Similar to EM waves, gravitational waves (GWs) can also be lensed. When their wavelength is comparable to the characteristic scale of the lens, wave-optics (WO) effects manifest as frequency-dependent modulations in the GW waveform. These WO features encode valuable information about the lensing system but are challenging to model, especially in the weak lensing regime, which has a larger optical depth than strong lensing. We present a novel and efficient framework to accurately approximate WO effects induced by general symmetric lens profiles. Our method is validated against numerical calculations and recovers the expected asymptotic behavior in both high- and low-frequency limits. Accurate and efficient modeling of WO effects in the weak lensing regime will enable improved lens reconstruction, delensing of standard sirens, and provide a unique probe to the properties of low-mass halos with minimal baryonic content, offering new insights into the nature of dark matter.</description>

Abstract: We present a comprehensive, self-contained pedagogical computation of the baryon asymmetry of the Universe within electroweak baryogenesis (EWBG), from the derivation of the semiclassical, CP-dependent force to the formulation and solution of the transport equations obtained from the Boltzmann equations$-$all implemented in the open-source code BARYONET. Our analysis follows the semiclassical WKB approach, where spatially varying complex masses across expanding bubble walls feel CP-violating forces that bias plasma transport. Starting from the stationary Boltzmann equation in the wall frame and projecting onto a hierarchy of velocity moments, we derive a compact, fluid-like system of coupled differential equations for chemical potentials and velocity perturbations. After obtaining the solutions, one can define the left-handed baryon chemical potential, which acts as the source term for the weak sphalerons. These processes generate the baryon asymmetry in front of the wall, which is subsequently frozen once it passes through it.
  We validate the framework against established formalisms and provide benchmarks in representative scenarios, including singlet extensions of the Standard Model, two-Higgs-doublet models, and Higgs$-\phi^6$ constructions. The resulting BARYONET implementation delivers an automated, reproducible pipeline for WKB-based baryogenesis studies, connecting formal derivations with phenomenological applications.
  In parallel, we revisit standard EWBG ingredients$-$diffusion constants, Yukawa/helicity-flip rates, and strong/weak sphaleron rates$-$to clarify conventions, update numerical inputs, and present a pedagogical derivation, ensuring transparent reproducibility.</description>
