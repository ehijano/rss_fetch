      <title>Event-Driven Learning for Spiking Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brain-inspired spiking neural networks (SNNs) have gained prominence in the field of neuromorphic computing owing to their low energy consumption during feedforward inference on neuromorphic hardware. However, it remains an open challenge how to effectively benefit from the sparse event-driven property of SNNs to minimize backpropagation learning costs. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive examination of the existing event-driven learning algorithms, reveal their limitations, and propose novel solutions to overcome them. Specifically, we introduce two novel event-driven learning methods: the spike-timing-dependent event-driven (STD-ED) and membrane-potential-dependent event-driven (MPD-ED) algorithms. These proposed algorithms leverage precise neuronal spike timing and membrane potential, respectively, for effective learning. The two methods are extensively evaluated on static and neuromorphic datasets to confirm their superior performance. They outperform existing event-driven counterparts by up to 2.51% for STD-ED and 6.79% for MPD-ED on the CIFAR-100 dataset. In addition, we theoretically and experimentally validate the energy efficiency of our methods on neuromorphic hardware. On-chip learning experiments achieved a remarkable 30-fold reduction in energy consumption over time-step-based surrogate gradient methods. The demonstrated efficiency and efficacy of the proposed event-driven learning methods emphasize their potential to significantly advance the fields of neuromorphic computing, offering promising avenues for energy-efficiency applications.</description>

      <title>Parallel Hyperparameter Optimization Of Spiking Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNN). SNNs are based on a more biologically inspired approach than usual artificial neural networks. Such models are characterized by complex dynamics between neurons and spikes. These are very sensitive to the hyperparameters, making their optimization challenging. To tackle hyperparameter optimization of SNNs, we initially extended the signal loss issue of SNNs to what we call silent networks. These networks fail to emit enough spikes at their outputs due to mistuned hyperparameters or architecture. Generally, search spaces are heavily restrained, sometimes even discretized, to prevent the sampling of such networks. By defining an early stopping criterion detecting silent networks and by designing specific constraints, we were able to instantiate larger and more flexible search spaces. We applied a constrained Bayesian optimization technique, which was asynchronously parallelized, as the evaluation time of a SNN is highly stochastic. Large-scale experiments were carried-out on a multi-GPU Petascale architecture. By leveraging silent networks, results show an acceleration of the search, while maintaining good performances of both the optimization algorithm and the best solution obtained. We were able to apply our methodology to two popular training algorithms, known as spike timing dependent plasticity and surrogate gradient. Early detection allowed us to prevent worthless and costly computation, directing the search toward promising hyperparameter combinations. Our methodology could be applied to multi-objective problems, where the spiking activity is often minimized to reduce the energy consumption. In this scenario, it becomes essential to find the delicate frontier between low-spiking and silent networks. Finally, our approach may have implications for neural architecture search, particularly in defining suitable spiking architectures.</description>

      <title>PIP-Net: Pedestrian Intention Prediction in the Wild</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12810v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate pedestrian intention prediction (PIP) by Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) is one of the current research challenges in this field. In this article, we introduce PIP-Net, a novel framework designed to predict pedestrian crossing intentions by AVs in real-world urban scenarios. We offer two variants of PIP-Net designed for different camera mounts and setups. Leveraging both kinematic data and spatial features from the driving scene, the proposed model employs a recurrent and temporal attention-based solution, outperforming state-of-the-art performance. To enhance the visual representation of road users and their proximity to the ego vehicle, we introduce a categorical depth feature map, combined with a local motion flow feature, providing rich insights into the scene dynamics. Additionally, we explore the impact of expanding the camera's field of view, from one to three cameras surrounding the ego vehicle, leading to enhancement in the model's contextual perception. Depending on the traffic scenario and road environment, the model excels in predicting pedestrian crossing intentions up to 4 seconds in advance which is a breakthrough in current research studies in pedestrian intention prediction. Finally, for the first time, we present the Urban-PIP dataset, a customised pedestrian intention prediction dataset, with multi-camera annotations in real-world automated driving scenarios.</description>
