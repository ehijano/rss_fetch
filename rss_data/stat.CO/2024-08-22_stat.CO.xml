      <title>Optimised Annealed Sequential Monte Carlo Samplers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Annealed Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) samplers are special cases of SMC samplers where the sequence of distributions can be embedded in a smooth path of distributions. Using this underlying path of distributions and a performance model based on the variance of the normalisation constant estimator, we systematically study dense schedule and large particle limits. From our theory and adaptive methods emerges a notion of global barrier capturing the inherent complexity of normalisation constant approximation under our performance model. We then turn the resulting approximations into surrogate objective functions of algorithm performance, and use them for methodology development. We obtain novel adaptive methodologies, Sequential SMC (SSMC) and Sequential AIS (SAIS) samplers, which address practical difficulties inherent in previous adaptive SMC methods. First, our SSMC algorithms are predictable: they produce a sequence of increasingly precise estimates at deterministic and known times. Second, SAIS, a special case of SSMC, enables schedule adaptation at a memory cost constant in the number of particles and require much less communication. Finally, these characteristics make SAIS highly efficient on GPUs. We develop an open-source, high-performance GPU implementation based on our methodology and demonstrate up to a hundred-fold speed improvement compared to state-of-the-art adaptive AIS methods.</description>

      <title>Disclosure risk assessment with Bayesian non-parametric hierarchical modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Micro and survey datasets often contain private information about individuals, like their health status, income or political preferences. Previous studies have shown that, even after data anonymization, a malicious intruder could still be able to identify individuals in the dataset by matching their variables to external information. Disclosure risk measures are statistical measures meant to quantify how big such a risk is for a specific dataset. One of the most common measures is the number of sample unique values that are also population-unique. \cite{Man12} have shown how mixed membership models can provide very accurate estimates of this measure. A limitation of that approach is that the number of extreme profiles has to be chosen by the modeller. In this article, we propose a non-parametric version of the model, based on the Hierarchical Dirichlet Process (HDP). The proposed approach does not require any tuning parameter or model selection step and provides accurate estimates of the disclosure risk measure, even with samples as small as 1$\%$ of the population size. Moreover, a data augmentation scheme to address the presence of structural zeros is presented. The proposed methodology is tested on a real dataset from the New York census.</description>

      <title>kendallknight: Efficient Implementation of Kendall's Correlation Coefficient Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09618v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The kendallknight package introduces an efficient implementation of Kendall's correlation coefficient computation, significantly improving the processing time for large datasets without sacrificing accuracy. The kendallknight package, following Knight (1966) and posterior literature, reduces the computational complexity resulting in drastic reductions in computation time, transforming operations that would take minutes or hours into milliseconds or minutes, while maintaining precision and correctly handling edge cases and errors. The package is particularly advantageous in econometric and statistical contexts where rapid and accurate calculation of Kendall's correlation coefficient is desirable. Benchmarks demonstrate substantial performance gains over the base R implementation, especially for large datasets.</description>

      <title>A Multiple Random Scan Strategy for Latent Space Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11725v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Latent Space (LS) network models project the nodes of a network on a $d$-dimensional latent space to achieve dimensionality reduction of the network while preserving its relevant features. Inference is often carried out within a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) framework. Nonetheless, it is well-known that the computational time for this set of models increases quadratically with the number of nodes. In this work, we build on the Random-Scan (RS) approach to propose an MCMC strategy that alleviates the computational burden for LS models while maintaining the benefits of a general-purpose technique. We call this novel strategy Multiple RS (MRS). This strategy is effective in reducing the computational cost by a factor without severe consequences on the MCMC draws. Moreover, we introduce a novel adaptation strategy that consists of a probabilistic update of the set of latent coordinates of each node. Our Adaptive MRS adapts the acceptance rate of the Metropolis step to adjust the probability of updating the latent coordinates. We show via simulation that the Adaptive MRS approach performs better than MRS in terms of mixing. Finally, we apply our algorithm to a multi-layer temporal LS model and show how our adaptive strategy may be beneficial to empirical applications.</description>

      <title>Accelerated stochastic approximation with state-dependent noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.01497v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a class of stochastic smooth convex optimization problems under rather general assumptions on the noise in the stochastic gradient observation. As opposed to the classical problem setting in which the variance of noise is assumed to be uniformly bounded, herein we assume that the variance of stochastic gradients is related to the "sub-optimality" of the approximate solutions delivered by the algorithm. Such problems naturally arise in a variety of applications, in particular, in the well-known generalized linear regression problem in statistics. However, to the best of our knowledge, none of the existing stochastic approximation algorithms for solving this class of problems attain optimality in terms of the dependence on accuracy, problem parameters, and mini-batch size.
  We discuss two non-Euclidean accelerated stochastic approximation routines--stochastic accelerated gradient descent (SAGD) and stochastic gradient extrapolation (SGE)--which carry a particular duality relationship. We show that both SAGD and SGE, under appropriate conditions, achieve the optimal convergence rate, attaining the optimal iteration and sample complexities simultaneously. However, corresponding assumptions for the SGE algorithm are more general; they allow, for instance, for efficient application of the SGE to statistical estimation problems under heavy tail noises and discontinuous score functions. We also discuss the application of the SGE to problems satisfying quadratic growth conditions, and show how it can be used to recover sparse solutions. Finally, we report on some simulation experiments to illustrate numerical performance of our proposed algorithms in high-dimensional settings.</description>

      <title>Node classification in networks via simplicial interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10114v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the node classification task, it is natural to presume that densely connected nodes tend to exhibit similar attributes. Given this, it is crucial to first define what constitutes a dense connection and to develop a reliable mathematical tool for assessing node cohesiveness. In this paper, we propose a probability-based objective function for semi-supervised node classification that takes advantage of higher-order networks' capabilities. The proposed function reflects the philosophy aligned with the intuition behind classifying within higher order networks, as it is designed to reduce the likelihood of nodes interconnected through higher-order networks bearing different labels. Additionally, we propose the Stochastic Block Tensor Model (SBTM) as a graph generation model designed specifically to address a significant limitation of the traditional stochastic block model, which does not adequately represent the distribution of higher-order structures in real networks. We evaluate the objective function using networks generated by the SBTM, which include both balanced and imbalanced scenarios. Furthermore, we present an approach that integrates the objective function with graph neural network (GNN)-based semi-supervised node classification methodologies, aiming for additional performance gains. Our results demonstrate that in challenging classification scenarios-characterized by a low probability of homo-connections, a high probability of hetero-connections, and limited prior node information-models based on the higher-order network outperform pairwise interaction-based models. Furthermore, experimental results suggest that integrating our proposed objective function with existing GNN-based node classification approaches enhances classification performance by efficiently learning higher-order structures distributed in the network.</description>

      <title>skscope: Fast Sparsity-Constrained Optimization in Python</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18540v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Applying iterative solvers on sparsity-constrained optimization (SCO) requires tedious mathematical deduction and careful programming/debugging that hinders these solvers' broad impact. In the paper, the library skscope is introduced to overcome such an obstacle. With skscope, users can solve the SCO by just programming the objective function. The convenience of skscope is demonstrated through two examples in the paper, where sparse linear regression and trend filtering are addressed with just four lines of code. More importantly, skscope's efficient implementation allows state-of-the-art solvers to quickly attain the sparse solution regardless of the high dimensionality of parameter space. Numerical experiments reveal the available solvers in skscope can achieve up to 80x speedup on the competing relaxation solutions obtained via the benchmarked convex solver. skscope is published on the Python Package Index (PyPI) and Conda, and its source code is available at: https://github.com/abess-team/skscope.</description>

      <title>Graph Simplification Solutions to the Street Intersection Miscount Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00258v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Street intersection counts and densities are fundamental measures in transport geography and urban planning. Conventional street network data and analysis tools often lead to significant overcounting of these measures. This study investigates the causes of such overcounting and proposes remedies. It introduces algorithms to streamline urban street network models through edge simplification and node consolidation, which enhance computational efficiency and improve accuracy in network measures like intersection counts, street segment lengths, and node degrees. The algorithms are validated and subjected to a global empirical assessment to evaluate the extent of count bias. These findings highlight the prevalence of this bias and underscore the necessity for better methods to mitigate inaccuracies in intersection representation.</description>

      <title>Regularized estimation of Monge-Kantorovich quantiles for spherical data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02085v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tools from optimal transport (OT) theory have recently been used to define a notion of quantile function for directional data. In practice, regularization is mandatory for applications that require out-of-sample estimates. To this end, we introduce a regularized estimator built from entropic optimal transport, by extending the definition of the entropic map to the spherical setting. We propose a stochastic algorithm to directly solve a continuous OT problem between the uniform distribution and a target distribution, by expanding Kantorovich potentials in the basis of spherical harmonics. In addition, we define the directional Monge-Kantorovich depth, a companion concept for OT-based quantiles. We show that it benefits from desirable properties related to Liu-Zuo-Serfling axioms for the statistical analysis of directional data. Building on our regularized estimators, we illustrate the benefits of our methodology for data analysis.</description>

      <title>Optical ISAC: Fundamental Performance Limits and Transceiver Design</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11792v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper characterizes the optimal capacity-distortion (C-D) tradeoff in an optical point-to-point (P2P) system with single-input single-output for communication and single-input multiple-output for sensing (SISO-COM and SIMO-SEN) within an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) framework. We consider the optimal rate-distortion (R-D) region and explore several inner (IB) and outer (OB) bounds. We introduce practical, asymptotically optimal maximum a posteriori (MAP) and maximum likelihood estimators (MLE) for target distance, addressing nonlinear measurement-to-state relationships and non-conjugate priors. As the number of sensing antennas increases, these estimators converge to the Bayesian Cram\'er-Rao bound (BCRB). We also establish that the achievable rate-CRB (AR-CRB) serves as an OB for the optimal C-D region, valid for both unbiased estimators and asymptotically large numbers of receive antennas. To clarify that the input distribution determines the tradeoff across the Pareto boundary of the C-D region, we propose two algorithms: \textit{i}) an iterative Blahut-Arimoto algorithm (BAA)-type method, and \textit{ii}) a memory-efficient closed-form (CF) approach. The CF approach includes a CF optimal distribution for high optical signal-to-noise ratio (O-SNR) conditions. Additionally, we adapt and refine the Deterministic-Random Tradeoff (DRT) to this optical ISAC context.</description>
