      <title>A Spectroscopic Hunt for Post-Red Supergiants in the Large Magellanic Cloud II: Turbulent Line Broadening in the Spectra of LMC Yellow Supergiants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive stars in the Hertzsprung gap are a mixed population of objects in short-lived evolutionary phases: yellow supergiants (YSGs) evolving towards the red supergiant (RSG) phase, partially-stripped post-RSGs, and other, rarer outcomes of stellar evolution. Studies of sufficiently large samples of these objects can constrain massive star structure and evolution during these poorly-understood phases. As part of our ongoing program searching for post-RSGs, we characterized the spectral line profiles of 32 YSGs in the Large Magellanic Cloud using high-resolution spectra obtained with the MIKE spectrograph on the Magellan 2/Clay telescope at Las Campanas Observatory. We find that the line profiles are strongly broadened by turbulent photospheric motion. After fitting the profiles to measure microturbulent and macroturbulent velocities, we identify two groups within our sample that are separated by the ratio of the two velocity scales. In both groups, the macroturbulent velocity scales with stellar properties such as effective temperature. Additionally, we find statistically-significant correlations between the macroturbulent velocity and other possible probes of large-scale photospheric motions: line profile asymmetry, as well as the amplitude and quality factor of the stochastic low frequency variability measured from {\it Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite} lightcurves. These correlations differ between the two groups of YSGs. Finally, we construct 1D evolutionary models of YSGs in both pre- and post-RSG phases, and find reasonable agreement between the convective velocities in these models and our measured microturbulent velocities. However, the macroturbulent velocities are much higher than the convective velocities in the models.</description>

      <title>Trans-Fe elements from Type Ia Supernovae. I. Heavy element nucleosynthesis during the formation of near-Chandrasekhar white dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Type Ia supernovae (SNIa) are thermonuclear explosions of white dwarfs in binary systems. They are central to galactic chemical evolution and serve as standardizable candles in cosmology, yet their progenitors remain uncertain. In this work, we present a grid of five models detailing the evolution and nucleosynthesis of slowly merging carbon-oxygen white dwarfs approaching the Chandrasekhar mass. These models test a variety of physics input settings, including accretion rates, nuclear reaction rates, convection parameters, and the composition of the accreted material. During the merger process, as the mass of the primary white dwarf approaches the Chandrasekhar limit, carbon burning is initiated first on the surface before eventually igniting explosively at the center. As a consequence, the 22Ne(a,n)25Mg reaction activates in the outer layers of all models. The neutrons released in this way produce a weak s-process-like abundance distribution peaking at Kr, which is overproduced by more than a factor of 1000 compared to solar. The trans-Fe elements-enriched outer layer mass varies from 0.04 Msun to 0.11 Msun, depending on the accretion rate. Our explosion simulation of these progenitor models ejects significant amount of first-peak elements (e.g., Kr, Sr) as well as of some long-lived radioactive species, such as 60Fe. In a previous theoretical study, we found that a similar nucleosynthesis process during the progenitor phase may also occur on the surface of near-Chandrasekhar white dwarfs formed through the accretion of H-rich material via the single-degenerate scenario. Therefore, these results suggest trans-Fe enrichment might be a hallmark of near-Chandrasekhar SNIa ejecta, regardless of the specific progenitor channel, and could provide a new spectral signature distinguishing them from sub-Chandrasekhar explosions.</description>

      <title>Hard X-ray Contribution in AU Mic Flares and Its Minor Role in Atmospheric Escape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flares from stars can significantly impact the atmospheres of their orbiting planets, yet the role of hard X-ray (HXR; 3-20 keV) emission in driving escape and tracing particle acceleration remains poorly constrained. With the aim of quantifying the HXR share of the total radiative budget, we obtained a NuSTAR observation, quasi-simultaneous with Swift and Einstein Probe observations, of the young M1Ve star AU Mic, detecting two flares. We build an empirical soft X-ray (SXR; 0.3-3 keV)-HXR scaling relation and, on that basis, quantify the HXR share of the total radiative budget, defined as the sum of extreme ultraviolet (EUV; 0.01-0.3 keV), SXR, and HXR, and assess its effect on atmospheric escape. We find that the HXR fraction is 1.7% in quiescence and rises to 3.3% at flare peaks; even adopting the EUV + SXR (collectively referred to as XUV) escape efficiency as an upper bound, HXR-powered mass loss amounts to only a few percent of the XUV-driven rate. High-energy spectral tails are detected in quiescence and in Flare 2. Both nonthermal and high temperature thermal models provide acceptable fits to the data; however, the presence of two localized Neupert effect episodes in Flare 2, combined with the implausibly large energy budget required for a 290 MK plasma, strongly favors a nonthermal interpretation. Consistent with this picture, spectral-timing analysis shows that the 6-20 keV share of the emission actually declines during flares, while heating is dominated by 3-6 keV photons-implying rapid thermalization of accelerated electrons and a predominantly thermal energy release. Overall, the flares are thermally dominated, nonthermal electrons can power chromospheric heating episodically, but HXR-induced escape appears to be marginal for the long-term atmospheric evolution of AU Mic's planets.</description>

      <title>Thackeray's globules in IC 2944: the rocket effect revisited by ALMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The prominent Thackeray's globules are a collection of cloudlets seen in silhouette against the bright emission of the IC 2944 HII region, ionized by the Collinder 249 cluster of early-type stars (placed at 2331$\pm$30 pc, derived from a Gaia DR3 analysis of the parallaxes of 11 massive stars). Here we present the analysis of Band 3 ALMA data that reveals the cold emission (continuum and molecular) associated with the neutral gas and its kinematic behavior. Many of the globules follow a linear velocity gradient that can be explained as the result of an acceleration process due to the rocket effect, where freshly ionized material streams away from the globule, compressing and accelerating it. We identified 46 globules (12 of which are new detections), measured their kinematics, and estimated their densities and masses. At least 5 of them are associated with emission of dense molecular tracers and/or millimeter continuum sources and have indications of possible gravitational collapse. We applied a simple model for the acceleration of the globules which accounts for the observed kinematics. In this scenario only the most massive of the globules will be able to gravitationally collapse before being completely destroyed, in the process reaching speeds of tens km/s, and potentially becoming low-mass walkaway/runaway protostars.</description>

      <title>A unified model of solar prominence formation with self-consistent heating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several models have been proposed to explain the formation of solar prominences, among which the evaporation--condensation model and the direct injection model are the most popular ones. In our previous study we proposed to unify these two models, namely, both are due to localized heating in the chromosphere, presumably via magnetic reconnection. When the localized heating is located in the upper chromosphere, the cold in-situ plasmas are heated to coronal temperatures, then evaporated to the corona, and finally condensate to form a prominence. Such a process is manifested as the evaporation-condensation model. When the localized heating is located in the lower chromosphere, the enhanced in-situ pressure would push the cold plasmas in the upper chromosphere to the corona directly, which is manifested as the direct injection model. While the idea was confirmed by the one-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations, the heating was imposed ad hoc. In order to simulate the localized heating more self-consistently, we perform two-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations in this paper, where the localized heating is naturally realized by magnetic reconnection at different heights. The simulations further validate our model. Besides, mass circulation in the solar atmosphere is also briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Nyquist frequency: Asteroseismic catalog of undersampled Kepler late subgiants and early red giants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Subgiants and early red giants are crucial for studying the first dredge-up, a key evolutionary phase where the convective envelope deepens, mixing previously interior-processed material and bringing it to the surface. Yet, very few have been seismically characterized with Kepler because their oscillation frequencies are close to the 30 minute sampling frequency of the mission. We developed a new method as part of the new PyA2Z code to identify super-Nyquist oscillators and infer their global seismic parameters, $\nu_\mathrm{max}$ and large separation, $\Delta\nu$. Applying PyA2Z to 2 065 Kepler targets, we seismically characterize 285 super-Nyquist and 168 close-to-Nyquist stars with masses from 0.8 to 1.6 M$_\odot$. In combination with APOGEE spectroscopy, Gaia spectro-photometry, and stellar models, we derive stellar ages for the sample. There is good agreement between the predicted and actual positions of stars on the HR diagram (luminosity vs. effective temperature) as a function of mass and composition. While the timing of dredge-up is consistent with predictions, the magnitude and mass dependence show discrepancies with models, possibly due to uncertainties in model physics or calibration issues in observed abundance scales.</description>

      <title>The Status of the Astrophysical Parameters of Upper Main Sequence Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Calibrating the ages, masses, and radii of stars on the upper main sequence depends heavily on accurate measurements of the effective temperature ($T_\mathrm{eff}$) and surface gravity ($\log g$). These parameters are difficult to obtain meticulously due to the nature of hot stars, which exhibit features such as rapid rotation, atomic diffusion, pulsation, and stellar winds. We compare the $T_\mathrm{eff}$, and $\log g$, values of apparent normal B-F stars in four recent catalogues that employ different methods and pipelines to obtain these parameters. We derived various statistical parameters to compare the differences between the catalogues and discussed the astrophysical implications of these differences. Our results show that the huge differences in $T_\mathrm{eff}$, (up to $10^4$\,K) and $\log g$, (up to 2 dex) between the catalogues have serious implications on the determination of ages, masses, and radii of the stars in question. We conclude that there appears to be no homogeneous set of stellar parameters on the upper main sequence, and one must be cautious when interpreting results obtained from using only one of the catalogues. The homogenisation of said parameters is an essential task for the future and will have a significant impact on astrophysical research dealing with stars on the upper main sequence.</description>

      <title>Tidal Tails of Nearby Open Clusters. II. A Review of Simulated Properties and the Reliability of Observational Catalogues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context: Recent studies using Gaia data have reported tidal tail detections for tens to hundreds of open clusters. However, a comprehensive assessment of the reliability &amp; completeness of these detections is lacking. Aims: This work aims to summarise the expected properties of tidal tails based on N-body simulations, review the reliability of tidal tail detections in the literature, and grade them according to a set of diagnostic tests. Methods: We used a grid of 68-20000 Msun simulated clusters &amp; analysed the formation &amp; evolution of the tails. We compiled 122 catalogues (58 unique clusters) from literature, within 500 pc of the Sun. We employed tests based on photometric, morphological &amp; dynamical signatures, &amp; comparisons with simulations, to grade their tails. Results: Based on the simulations, we analysed the complex morphology of the tails &amp; their properties (e.g., size, span, stellar types, number density, &amp; mass function) at various cluster masses &amp; ages. During the first 200 Myr of evolution, the tails typically form a characteristic S shape, with an amplitude that scales with cluster mass. The tail span increases at a rate of 4 times the initial velocity dispersion, &amp; the near-tail is predominantly populated by recent escapees. Conclusions: In the 122 published tail catalogues, we found that 15 gold &amp; 55 silver catalogues passed the majority of the tests. The remaining 51 were graded as bronze; care should be taken before using these for further analysis. The age, metallicity, binary fraction, &amp; mass function of stars in the tails were generally consistent with those of their parent clusters. The gold/silver catalogues (69 catalogues of 40 clusters) represent reliable samples for detailed analyses of tails. Future data will be essential for further validation &amp; for leveraging tidal tails as tracers of cluster dissolution &amp; the Galactic potential.</description>

      <title>Correlating Particle Acceleration Rates with Plasma Conditions in Colliding Wind Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent observations have revealed star-forming regions as possible origin sites of very-high-energy (TeV) cosmic rays, not associated with supernova remnants. Colliding-wind binaries (CWBs) are strong X-ray and radio synchrotron emitters and have been proposed as potential accelerators of such particles. We perform high-resolution three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations coupled with test-particle integration to investigate how local plasma conditions affect particle acceleration in CWBs. We find that the maximum particle energies and the hardness of the energy distributions depend on the shock magnetization and cooling efficiency. For moderate magnetization ($\gt$1 G), CWBs can accelerate hadronic particles up to hundreds of TeV or even PeV energies, with more than 1\% of particles reaching the very-high-energy range. By correlating the local acceleration rate with plasma quantities - \textit{magnetic field strength, current density, vorticity, and velocity divergence} - we show that turbulence and magnetic field complexity dominate the acceleration, while classical diffusive shock acceleration plays a limited role. These results suggest that turbulent, magnetically driven processes are key to producing relativistic particles in CWBs, with implications for future high sensitivity $\gamma$-ray observations (e.g. LACT and CTAO).</description>

      <title>Condensation Clouds in Substellar Atmospheres with Virga</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Here we present an open-source cloud model for substellar atmospheres, called Virga. The Virga-v0 series has already been widely adopted in the literature. It is written in Python and has heritage from the Ackerman &amp; Marley (2001) model (often referred to as eddysed), used to study clouds on both exoplanets and brown dwarfs. In the development of the official Virga-v1 we have retained all the original functionality of eddysed and updated/expanded several components including the back-end optical constants data, calculations of the Mie properties, available condensate species, saturation vapor pressure curves and formalism for fall speeds calculations. Here we benchmark Virga by reproducing key results in the literature, including the SiO2 cloud detection in WASP-17 b and the brown dwarf Diamondback-Sonora model series. Development of Virga is ongoing, with future versions already planned and ready for release. We encourage community feedback and collaborations within the GitHub code repository.</description>

      <title>Optimized scintillation configuration for IMPISH hard x-ray detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Integrating Miniature Piggyback for Impulsive Solar Hard X-rays (IMPISH) is a solar X-ray spectrometer that features large-area scintillators, fast readout electronics, and good energy resolution in the hard X-ray band. IMPISH is a low-cost spectrometer designed to measure subsecond variation in hard X-ray time profiles from solar flares, with the goal of constraining particle acceleration timescales. To meet these requirements, we carried out a systematic optimization of the scintillation design, focusing on maximizing photon collection, reducing noise level, and improving energy resolution. We tested two high-yield scintillating crystals (LYSO, lutetium yttrium oxyorthosilicate, and GAGG, gadolinium aluminum gallium garnet), two reflector types (specular and lambertian), two kinds of surface finishes (all sides polished and readout face only polished), different optical coupling materials and thicknesses, multiple geometries, and readout face angles. Our studies show that light collection improves with increasing the crystal's effective area, breaking its symmetry, and reducing the photon's travel length. These minimize photon loss due to self-absorption and total internal reflection. Through combined simulation and laboratory tests, we achieved an optimal energy resolution with the LYSO trapezoid-shaped crystal coupled to a Broadcom NUV-MT SiPM with an approximately 0.25 mm thin Sylgard 184 optical pad.</description>

Abstract: SCUPOL, the polarimeter for SCUBA on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT), was used for polarization observations of 104 regions at 850 micron wavelength and 15 arcsec resolution in the mapping mode by Matthews et al. (2009). They presented the polarization values and magnetic field morphologies in these regions. In this work, we took the opportunity to use this big legacy survey data to investigate further the collective statistical properties of the measured polarization in different star-forming regions containing cores and filaments. We did not reproduce the polarization maps but used the polarization value catalogs to investigate the statistics of distributions. In some of these regions, the data from the Combined Array for Research in Millimeter-wave Astronomy (CARMA) polarization observation at 1.3 mm wavelength and 2.5 arcsec resolution were also available from the TADPOL survey (Hull et al., 2014). We used that data and compared it with JCMT/SCUPOL values. We also study how the direction of outflows appears to relate to the mean B-field direction from large scale (JCMT observation at 15 arcsec) to small scale (CARMA observation at 2.5 arcsec) for the nine core regions common in both.</description>

      <title>The Missing Giant: Do FAST Spectroscopic Observations Reveal a Scarcity of Large Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons in Astronomical Environments?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The search for large polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with over 100 carbon atoms is crucial to resolving the origin of unidentified infrared emission (UIE) bands. These bands are commonly observed in nebulae and the interstellar medium, yet their spectroscopic assignment has remained unknown for decades. Using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Radio Telescope (FAST), the world's most sensitive instrument operating in the decimeter-wavelength range, we conducted a search for rotational transitions of large, quasi-symmetric PAHs. Our sample included two prototypical UIE sources, NGC 7027 and TMC-1, along with a non-UIE source, IRC+10216, for comparison. A matched filter technique was employed to isolate comb-like spectral features from quasi-symmetric PAHs containing 138 to 194 carbon atoms in the FAST spectra. This method significantly enhanced detection sensitivity to these astrophysically critical molecular signatures. Although no such features were detected, we derived upper limits on the abundance of large PAHs based on simplifying assumptions. These upper limits are lower than the values predicted by theoretical models, which might tentatively suggest that large PAHs may not be the primary carriers of UIE bands. However, this conclusion should be treated as tentative, given that it rests on simplistic assumptions which have not been empirically validated.</description>

      <title>SPHEREx Discovery of Strong Water Ice Absorption and an Extended Carbon Dioxide Coma in 3I/ATLAS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In mid-August 2025, 0.75-5.0 micron SPHEREx imaging spectrophotometric and ancillary NASA-IRTF SpeX 0.7-2.5 micron low-resolution spectral observations of Interstellar Object 3I ATLAS were obtained. The combined spectrophotometry is dominated by features due to water ice absorption and CO2 gas emission. A bright, 3 arcmin radius CO2 gas coma was clearly resolved, corresponding to Qgas,CO2 = 9.4 x 10{^26} molec/sec. From the SPHEREx photometry, we put conservative, preliminary 3sigma upper limits on the gas production rates for H2O and CO of 1.5 x 10{^26} and 2.8 x 10{^26} molec/sec. No obvious jet, tail, or trail structures were found in SPHEREx images. Assuming all observed 1-um flux is scattered light from an pv = 0.04 albedo spherical nucleus, its radius would be 23 km. Compared to the nucleus size limit r = 2.8km of Jewitt+ 2025, this suggests that greater than 99 percent of the measured SPHEREx continuum flux is from coma dust.</description>

      <title>Formation of heavy double neutron stars I: Eddington-limited accretion for a 1.4 $M_{\odot}$ neutron star at solar metallicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: More than 30 Galactic double neutron star (DNS) binaries have now been identified through radio pulsar timing. The 24 DNSs in the Galactic field with measured total masses lie in the narrow range of 2.3--2.9 $M_{\odot}$. In contrast, gravitational-wave observations have detected two DNS mergers: GW170817, with a total mass of 2.7 $M_{\odot}$, and GW190425, with a significantly higher mass of 3.4 $M_{\odot}$. The unusually high mass of GW190425 suggests a non-standard formation channel not represented in the known Galactic population. To investigate the origin of such a massive DNS system, we model the late evolutionary stages of helium stars with initial masses between 2.5 and 9.8 $M_{\odot}$ in binaries with 1.4 $M_{\odot}$ neutron star companions, using the 1D stellar evolution code MESA at solar metallicity. We test alternative formation pathways and calibrate our models to reproduce the observed Galactic DNS mass and orbital distributions. By incorporating a modified natal kick prescription, our population synthesis results are broadly consistent with the observed total mass distribution of known DNS systems. Only a small fraction of DNSs of our model have total masses $\geq$ 3 $M_{\odot}$, insufficient to explain the high rate of massive DNS mergers inferred from GW observations. However, our model rules out the formation of heavy DNS systems like GW190425 via the second unstable mass transfer.</description>

      <title>Populations of evolved massive binary stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud I: Predictions from detailed evolution models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23876v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context. The majority of massive stars are born with a close binary companion. How this affects their evolution and fate is still largely uncertain, especially at low metallicity. Aims. We derive synthetic populations of massive post-interaction binary products and compare them with corresponding observed populations in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). Methods. We analyse 53298 detailed binary evolutionary models computed with MESA. Our models include the physics of rotation, mass and angular momentum transfer, magnetic internal angular momentum transport, and tidal spin-orbit coupling. They cover initial primary masses of 5-100Msun, initial mass ratios of 0.3-0.95, and all initial periods for which interaction is expected. They are evolved through the first mass transfer and the donor star death, a possible ensuing Be/X-ray binary phase, and they end when the mass gainer leaves the main sequence. Results.In our fiducial synthetic population, 8% of the OB stars in the SMC are post-mass transfer systems, and 7% are merger products. In many of our models, the mass gainers are spun up and form Oe/Be stars. While our model underpredicts the number of Be/X-ray binaries in the SMC, it reproduces the main features of their orbital period distribution and the observed number of SMC binary WR stars. We expect $\sim$50 OB+BH binaries below and $\sim$170 above 20d orbital period. The latter might produce merging double BHs. However, their progenitors, the predicted long-period WR+OB binaries, are not observed. Conclusions. While the comparison with the observed SMC stars supports many physics assumptions in our high-mass binary models, a better match of the large number of observed OBe stars and Be/X-ray binaries likely requires a lower merger rate and/or a higher mass transfer efficiency during the first mass transfer. The fate of the initially wide O star binaries remains uncertain.</description>

      <title>Symbiotic star candidates in Gaia Data Release 3</title>

Abstract: Symbiotic stars, binary pairs with a cool giant fueling accretion onto a hot compact companion, offer unique insights to our understanding of stellar evolution. Yet, only a few hundred symbiotic stars are confirmed. Here, we report on a new search for symbiotic star candidates in Gaia Data Release 3 (GDR3), based entirely on the archive's astrometric, photometric, and spectroscopic information. To begin our search, we identified known symbiotic stars in GDR3 and assessed their absolute magnitude and colors, which are dominated by the cool giant. We also considered measures of astrometric quality that might be affected by binary motion in these systems. Finally, from those sources with Gaia spectroscopic data, we built a low-resolution spectral template that characterizes the unique features of these systems, including H$\alpha$ emission from interaction with the giant's wind and radiation from the hot star. We then queried the full GDR3 archive for sources with spectroscopic data that are bright (&lt; 17 mag in G-band), have modest relative parallax uncertainties (&lt; 20%), and fall within a region of color-magnitude space characteristic of red giants, keeping only sources with spectra that quantitatively match our template. A machine-learning algorithm, trained on known symbiotic stars, produced a new catalog of 1,674 sources. From cross-matches with infrared and X-ray surveys, we present 25 of these sources as particularly compelling candidates for new symbiotic stars.</description>

      <title>Detection of young massive white dwarfs in core-collapsed globular cluster NGC 362</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12337v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Core-collapsed globular clusters are ideal targets to explore the presence of stellar collision products. Here, we have studied seventeen FUV bright white dwarf members in the globular cluster NGC 362 using data obtained from the Ultra Violet Imaging Telescope (UVIT) mounted on AstroSat and from HST. Multi-wavelength spectral energy distributions (SEDs) are analyzed using UV and optical data sets to characterize and determine the parameters of white dwarfs. Fourteen of the white dwarfs fit single-component SEDs well, while three showed a good fit with a two-component SED model,indicating a binary system comprising a white dwarf and a low-mass main-sequence star. The effective temperature, radius, luminosity, and mass of white dwarfs range between 22000 - 70000 K, 0.008 - 0.028 Rsun, 0.09 - 3.0 Lsun, and 0.30 - 1.13 Msun, respectively. The effective temperature, radius, luminosity, and mass of the companions (low-mass main-sequence stars) are 3500 - 3750 K, 0.150 - 0.234 Rsun,0.003 - 0.01 Lsun, and 0.14 - 0.24 Msun, respectively. The three binary systems (WD-MS), along with the massive WDs may have formed through dynamical processes that occurred during the core collapse of the cluster. This is the first evidence of a massive WD formation in a core-collapsed cluster, which is the missing link in the formation of a fast radio burst (FRB) progenitor in a globular cluster. This study provides evidence that NGC 362 hosts stellar systems that may evolve into exotic stars such as Type Ia supernovae, and/or FRBs in the future. *This is paper VI of the Globular Cluster UVIT Legacy Survey.</description>

      <title>Surya: Foundation Model for Heliophysics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14112v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Heliophysics is central to understanding and forecasting space weather events and solar activity. Despite decades of high-resolution observations from the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), most models remain task-specific and constrained by scarce labeled data, limiting their capacity to generalize across solar phenomena. We introduce Surya, a 366M parameter foundation model for heliophysics designed to learn general-purpose solar representations from multi-instrument SDO observations, including eight Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) channels and five Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) products. Surya employs a spatiotemporal transformer architecture with spectral gating and long--short range attention, pretrained on high-resolution solar image forecasting tasks and further optimized through autoregressive rollout tuning. Zero-shot evaluations demonstrate its ability to forecast solar dynamics and flare events, while downstream fine-tuning with parameter-efficient Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) shows strong performance on solar wind forecasting, active region segmentation, solar flare forecasting, and EUV spectra. Surya is the first foundation model in heliophysics that uses time advancement as a pretext task on full-resolution SDO data. Its novel architecture and performance suggest that the model is able to learn the underlying physics behind solar evolution.</description>

      <title>Vortex-magnetic competition and regime transitions in antiparallel flux tubes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10648v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vortex-magnetic interactions shape magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence, influencing energy transfer in astrophysical, geophysical, and industrial systems. On the Sun, granular-scale vortex flows couple strongly with magnetic fields, channeling energy into the corona. At high Reynolds numbers, vorticity and magnetic fields are nearly frozen into the charged fluid, and MHD flows emerge from the Lorentz force mediated interactions between coherent vortex structures in matter and the field. To probe this competition in a controlled setting, we revisit the canonical problem of two antiparallel flux tubes. By varying the magnetic flux threading each tube--and thus sweeping the interaction parameter $N_i$, which gauges Lorentz-to-inertial force balance--we uncover three distinct regimes: vortex-dominated joint reconnection, instability-triggered cascade, and Lorentz-induced vortex disruption. At low $N_i$, classical vortex dynamics dominate, driving joint vortex-magnetic reconnection and amplifying magnetic energy via a dynamo effect. At moderate $N_i$, the system oscillates between vorticity-driven attraction and magnetic damping, triggering instabilities and nonlinear interactions that spawn secondary filaments and drive an energy cascade. At high $N_i$, Lorentz forces suppress vortex interactions, aligning the tubes axially while disrupting vortex cores and rapidly converting magnetic to kinetic energy. These findings reveal how the inertial-Lorentz balance governs energy transfer and coherent structure formation in MHD turbulence, offering insight into vortex-magnetic coevolution in astrophysical plasmas.</description>
