      <title>Locally noetherian quiver representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is shown that a quiver is left noetherian if and only if the category of quiver representations in any locally noetherian abelian category is again locally noetherian. Here, locally noetherian means that any object is the directed union of its noetherian subobjects. For a quiver to be left noetherian means that the left ideals of paths starting at any fixed vertex satisfy the ascending chain condition. The proof generalises to representations of any small category that admits a Gr\"obner enrichment.</description>

      <title>Loop Grassmannian of quivers and Compactified Coulomb branch of quiver gauge theory with no framing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mirkovi\'c introduced the notion of loop Grassmannian for symmetric integer matrix $\kappa$. It is a two-step limit of the local projective space $Z_{\kappa}^{\alpha}$, which generalizes the usual Zastava for a simply laced group $G$. The usual loop Grassmannian of $G$ is recovered when the matrix $\kappa$ is the Cartan matrix of $G$.
  On the other hand, Braverman, Finkelberg, and Nakajima showed that the Compactified Coulomb branch $\mathbf{M}_{Q}^{\alpha}$ for the quiver gauge theory with no framing also generalizes the usual Zastava. We show that in the case when $\kappa$ is the associated matrix of the quiver $Q$, these two generalizations of Zastava coincide, i.e $\mathbf{M}_{Q}^{\alpha}\cong Z_{\kappa(Q)}^{\alpha}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend the notion of Weyl modules for twisted toroidal Lie algebra $\mathcal{T}(\mu)$. We prove that the level one global Weyl modules of $\mathcal{T}(\mu)$ are isomorphic to the tensor product of the level one representation of twisted affine Lie algebras and certain lattice vertex algebras. As a byproduct, we calculate the graded character of the level one local Weyl modules of $\mathcal{T}(\mu)$.</description>

      <title>Webb's conjecture and generalised Harish-Chandra theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Webb's conjecture states that the orbit space of the Brown complex of a finite group at any given prime $\ell$ is contractible. This conjecture was proved by Symonds in 1998. In this paper, we suggest a generalisation of Webb's conjecture for finite reductive groups. This is done by associating to each irreducible character a new simplicial complex defined in terms of Deligne--Lusztig theory. We then show that our conjecture follows from a condition, called ($e$-HC-conj) below, related to generalised Harish-Chandra theory. In particular, using earlier results of the author, we prove our conjecture and recover Symonds result for finite reductive groups under mild restrictions on the prime $\ell$. Finally, we show that the condition ($e$-HC-conj) is implied by the contractibility of the orbit spaces associated to our newly defined complex offering an unexplored topological approach to proving the uniqueness of $e$-cuspidal pairs up to conjugation.</description>

      <title>Hopf algebra and the duality operation for $\mathfrak{gl}_n(\mathbb{F}_q)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06191v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the space $C(\mathfrak{gl}_n(\mathbb{F}_q))$ of complex invariant functions on $\mathfrak{gl}_n(\mathbb{F}_q)$, through a Hopf algebra viewpoint. First, we consider a variant notion of Zelevinsky's PSH algebra defined over the real numbers $\mathbb{R}$. In particular, we show that two specific $\mathbb{R}$-lattices inside the complex Hopf algebra $\bigoplus_nC(\mathfrak{gl}_n(\mathbb{F}_q))$ are real PSH algebras, and that they do not descend to $\mathbb{Z}$. Then, among consequences, we prove that every element in $C(\mathfrak{gl}_n(\mathbb{F}_q))$ is a linear combination of Harish-Chandra inductions of Kawanaka's pre-cuspidal functions, and give a conceptual characterisation of duality operation for $\mathfrak{gl}_n(\mathbb{F}_q)$, which in turn allows us to give a new proof of a classical result of Kawanaka.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $R$ be an Artin algebra. Under certain Auslander-type conditions, we give some equivalent characterizations of (weakly) Gorenstein algebras in terms of the properties of Gorenstein projective modules and modules satisfying Auslander-type conditions. As applications, we provide some support for several homological conjectures. In particular, we prove that if $R$ is left quasi Auslander, then $R$ is Gorenstein if and only if it is (left and) right weakly Gorenstein; and that if $R$ satisfies the Auslander condition, then $R$ is Gorenstein if and only if it is left or right weakly Gorenstein. This is a reduction of an Auslander--Reiten's conjecture, which states that $R$ is Gorenstein if $R$ satisfies the Auslander condition.</description>

Abstract: We give the definition of a dg-division algebra, that is a concept of a differential graded algebra which may serve as an analogue of a division algebra. Using this concept, we study their dg-modules, give examples when they occur and study their relation to dg-simple algebras.</description>

      <title>Enumerative geometry via elliptic stable envelope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Assume $X$ is a variety for which the elliptic stable envelope exists. In this note we construct natural $q$-difference equations from the elliptic stable envelope of $X$. In examples, these equations coincide with the quantum difference equations, which give a natural $q$-deformation of the Dubrovin connection of $X$. Solutions of the quantum difference equations provide generating functions counting curves in $X$. In this way, our construction connects curve counting and equivariant elliptic cohomology.
  This is an overview paper based on the author's talk at the workshop The 16th MSJ-SI: Elliptic Integrable Systems, Representation Theory and Hypergeometric Functions, Tokyo 2023.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $q$ be a prime power, $\ell$ a prime not dividing $q$, and $e$ the order of $q$ modulo $\ell$. We show that the geometric realisation of the nerve of the transporter category of $e$-split Levi subgroups of a finite reductive group $G$ over $\mathbb{F}_q$ is homotopy equivalent to the classifying space $BG$ up to $\ell$-completion. We suggest a generalisation of this equivalence to the setting of $\mathbb{Z}_\ell$-reflection cosets and establish a related fact involving the associated orbit spaces. We also establish a Dade-like formula for unipotent characters of $\mathbb{Z}_\ell$-spetses inspired by a question of Brou\'e.</description>

      <title>Koszul duality and a conjecture of Francis-Gaitsgory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Koszul duality is a fundamental correspondence between algebras for an operad $\mathcal{O}$ and coalgebras for its dual cooperad $B\mathcal{O}$, built from $\mathcal{O}$ using the bar construction. Francis-Gaitsgory proposed a conjecture about the general behavior of this duality. The main result of this paper, roughly speaking, is that Koszul duality provides an equivalence between the subcategories of nilcomplete algebras and conilcomplete coalgebras and that these are the largest possible subcategories for which such a result holds. This disproves Francis-Gaitsgory's prediction, but does provide an adequate replacement. We show that many previously known partial results about Koszul duality can be deduced from our results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the study of vertex operator algebra extensions, we answer the question of when the category of local modules over a commutative exact algebra in a braided finite tensor category is a (non-semisimple) modular tensor category. Along the way we provide sufficient conditions for the category of local modules to be rigid, pivotal and ribbon. We also discuss two ways to construct such commutative exact algebras. The first is the class of simple current algebras and the second is using right adjoints of central tensor functors. Furthermore, we discuss Witt equivalence and its relation with extensions of VOAs.</description>

      <title>Lattice theory of torsion classes: Beyond $\tau$-tilting theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.01785</link>
      <description>arXiv:1711.01785v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to establish a lattice theoretical framework to study the partially ordered set $\operatorname{\mathsf{tors}} A$ of torsion classes over a finite-dimensional algebra $A$. We show that $\operatorname{\mathsf{tors}} A$ is a complete lattice which enjoys very strong properties, as bialgebraicity and complete semidistributivity. Thus its Hasse quiver carries the important part of its structure, and we introduce the brick labelling of its Hasse quiver and use it to study lattice congruences of $\operatorname{\mathsf{tors}} A$. In particular, we give a representation-theoretical interpretation of the so-called forcing order, and we prove that $\operatorname{\mathsf{tors}} A$ is completely congruence uniform. When $I$ is a two-sided ideal of $A$, $\operatorname{\mathsf{tors}} (A/I)$ is a lattice quotient of $\operatorname{\mathsf{tors}} A$ which is called an algebraic quotient, and the corresponding lattice congruence is called an algebraic congruence. The second part of this paper consists in studying algebraic congruences. We characterize the arrows of the Hasse quiver of $\operatorname{\mathsf{tors}} A$ that are contracted by an algebraic congruence in terms of the brick labelling. In the third part, we study in detail the case of preprojective algebras $\Pi$, for which $\operatorname{\mathsf{tors}} \Pi$ is the Weyl group endowed with the weak order. In particular, we give a new, more representation theoretical proof of the isomorphism between $\operatorname{\mathsf{tors}} k Q$ and the Cambrian lattice when $Q$ is a Dynkin quiver. We also prove that, in type $A$, the algebraic quotients of $\operatorname{\mathsf{tors}} \Pi$ are exactly its Hasse-regular lattice quotients.</description>

      <title>Gelfand-Tsetlin modules in the Coulomb context</title>

      <description>arXiv:1904.05415v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper gives a new perspective on the theory of principal Galois orders, as developed by Futorny, Ovsienko, Hartwig, and others. Every principal Galois order can be written as $eFe$ for any idempotent $e$ in an algebra $F$, which we call a flag Galois order; and in most important cases we can assume that these algebras are Morita equivalent. These algebras have the property that the completed algebra controlling the fiber over a maximal ideal has the same form as a subalgebra in a skew group ring, which gives a new perspective to a number of results about these algebras.
  We also discuss how this approach relates to the study of Coulomb branches in the sense of Braverman-Finkelberg-Nakajima, which are particularly beautiful examples of principal Galois orders. These include most of the interesting examples of principal Galois orders, such as $U(\mathfrak{gl}_n)$. In this case, all the objects discussed have a geometric interpretation, which endows the category of Gelfand-Tsetlin modules with a graded lift and allows us to interpret the classes of simple Gelfand-Tsetlin modules in terms of dual canonical bases for the Grothendieck group. In particular, we classify the Gelfand-Tsetlin modules over $U(\mathfrak{gl}_n)$ and relate their characters to a generalization of Leclerc's shuffle expansion for dual canonical basis vectors.
  Finally, as an application, we disprove a conjecture of Mazorchuk, showing that the fiber over a maximal ideal of the Gelfand-Tsetlin subalgebra appearing in a finite-dimensional representation has an infinite-dimensional module in its fiber for $n\geq 6$.</description>

Abstract: We describe the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) for a cyclic group when $p|N$ by factoring $x^N-1$ over finite fields and constructing the Fourier transform and its inverse using B\'{e}zout's identity for polynomials. For the symmetric group, in the modular case when $p|n!$ we construct the Peirce decomposition using central primitive orthogonal idempotents, yielding a change-of-basis matrix which generalizes the DFT. We compute the unitary DFT for the symmetric group over number fields containing sufficiently many square roots. For $n=3$, we compute the Galois group of the splitting field of the characteristic polynomial. All constructions are implemented in SageMath.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.14791v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the zero-fiber of the moment map of a totally negative quiver has rational singularities. Our proof consists in generalizing dimension bounds on jet spaces of this fiber, which were introduced by Budur. We also transfer the rational singularities property to other moduli spaces of objects in 2-Calabi-Yau categories, based on recent work of Davison. This has interesting arithmetic applications on quiver moment maps and moduli spaces of objects in 2-Calabi-Yau categories. First, we generalize results of Wyss on the asymptotic behaviour of counts of jets of quiver moment maps over finite fields. Moreover, we interpret the limit of counts of jets on a given moduli space as its p-adic volume under a canonical measure analogous to the measure built by Carocci, Orecchia and Wyss on certain moduli spaces of coherent sheaves.</description>

Abstract: The question of when a vertex algebra is a quantization of the arc space of its associated scheme has recently received a lot of attention in both the mathematics and physics literature. This property was first studied by Tomoyuki Arakawa and Anne Moreau [Lectures on $\mathcal{W}$-algebras, Australian Representation Theory Workshop 2016, University of Melbourne], and was given the name "classical freeness" by Jethro van Ekeren and Reimundo Heluani in their work on chiral homology [Comm. Math. Phys. 386 (2021), no. 1, 495-550]. Later, it was extended to vertex superalgebras by Hao Li [Eur. J. Math. 7 (2021), 1689-1728]. In this note, we prove the classical freeness of the simple affine vertex superalgebra $L_n(\mathfrak{osp}_{m|2r})$ for all positive integers $m,n,r$ satisfying $-\frac{m}{2} + r +n+1 &gt; 0$. In particular, it holds for the rational vertex superalgebras $L_n(\mathfrak{osp}_{1|2r})$ for all positive integers $r,n$.</description>

      <title>On the complexity of isomorphism problems for tensors, groups, and polynomials III: actions by classical groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.03135v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the complexity of isomorphism problems for d-way arrays, or tensors, under natural actions by classical groups such as orthogonal, unitary, and symplectic groups. Such problems arise naturally in statistical data analysis and quantum information. We study two types of complexity-theoretic questions. First, for a fixed action type (isomorphism, conjugacy, etc.), we relate the complexity of the isomorphism problem over a classical group to that over the general linear group. Second, for a fixed group type (orthogonal, unitary, or symplectic), we compare the complexity of the decision problems for different actions.
  Our main results are as follows. First, for orthogonal and symplectic groups acting on 3-way arrays, the isomorphism problems reduce to the corresponding problem over the general linear group. Second, for orthogonal and unitary groups, the isomorphism problems of five natural actions on 3-way arrays are polynomial-time equivalent, and the d-tensor isomorphism problem reduces to the 3-tensor isomorphism problem for any fixed d&gt;3. For unitary groups, the preceding result implies that LOCC classification of tripartite quantum states is at least as difficult as LOCC classification of d-partite quantum states for any d. Lastly, we also show that the graph isomorphism problem reduces to the tensor isomorphism problem over orthogonal and unitary groups.</description>

      <title>Easy quantum groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12368v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A closed subgroup $G\subset_uU_N^+$ is called easy when its associated Tannakian category $C_{kl}=Hom(u^{\otimes k},u^{\otimes l})$ appears from a category of partitions, $C=span(D)$ with $D=(D_{kl})\subset P$, via the standard implementation of partitions as linear maps. The examples abound, and the main known subgroups $G\subset U_N^+$ are either easy, or not far from being easy. We discuss here the basic theory, examples and known classification results for the easy quantum groups $G\subset U_N^+$, as well as various generalizations of the formalism, known as super-easiness theories, and the unification problem for them.</description>

      <title>Noncommutative Hamiltonian structures and quantizations on preprojective algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17578v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a noncommutative Hamiltonian space $A$, we show that the conjecture ``{\it quantization commutes with reduction}'' holds on $A$. We also construct a semi-product algebra $A \rtimes \mG^A$, equivariant sheaves on the representation space are related to left $A \rtimes \mG^A$-modules. In the quiver setting, via the quantum and classical trace maps, we establish the explicit correspondence between quantizations on a preprojective algebra and those on a quiver variety.</description>

      <title>Borel and parabolic-type subalgebras of the lattice vertex operator algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02278v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce and study new classes of subVOAs of the lattice vertex operator algebra, which we call the Borel and parabolic-type subVOAs. These CFT-type VOAs, which are not necessarily strongly finitely generated, satisfy properties similar to the usual Borel and parabolic subalgebras of a Lie algebra and lead to a new definition of induced modules for VOAs. For the lowest-rank examples of Borel-type subVOAs $V_{B}$ of $V_{\Z\al}$, and one typical lowest-rank example of the parabolic-type subVOA $V_P$ of the lattice VOA $V_{A_2}$ associated to the root lattice $A_2$, we explicitly determine their Zhu's algebras $A(V_B)$ and $A(V_P)$ in terms of generators and relations. Using the descriptions of $A(V_B)$ and $A(V_P)$, we classify the irreducible modules over $V_B$ and $V_P$ and explicitly determine the induced modules for these examples.</description>
