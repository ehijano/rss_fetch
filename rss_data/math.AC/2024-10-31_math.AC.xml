      <title>Rees Algebras and the reduced fiber cone of divisorial filtrations on two dimensional normal local rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal I=\{I_n\}$ be a divisorial filtration on a two dimensional normal excellent local ring $(R,m_R)$. Let $R[\mathcal I]=\oplus_{n\ge 0}I_n$ be the Rees algebra of $\mathcal I$ and $\tau:\mbox{Proj}R[\mathcal I])\rightarrow \mbox{Spec}(R)$ be the natural morphism. The reduced fiber cone of $\mathcal I$ is the $R$-algebra $R[\mathcal I]/\sqrt{m_RR[\mathcal I]}$, and the reduced exceptional fiber of $\tau$ is $\mbox{Proj}(R[\mathcal I]/\sqrt{m_RR[\mathcal I]})$. We give an explicit description of the scheme structure of $\mbox{Proj}(R[\mathcal I])$. As a corollary, we obtain a new proof of a theorem of F. Russo, showing that $\mbox{Proj}(R[\mathcal I])$ is always Noetherian and that $R[\mathcal I]$ is Noetherian if and only if $\mbox{Proj}(R[\mathcal I])$ is a proper $R$-scheme. We give an explicit description of the scheme structure of the reduced exceptional fiber $\mbox{Proj}(R[\mathcal I]/\sqrt{m_RR[\mathcal I]})$ of $\tau$, in terms of the possible values 0, 1 or 2 of the analytic spread $\ell(\mathcal I)=\dim R[\mathcal I]/m_RR[\mathcal I]$. In the case that $\ell(\mathcal I)=0$, $\tau^{-1}(m_R)$ is the emptyset; this case can only occur if $R[\mathcal I]$ is not Noetherian.</description>

      <title>On the weak Lefschetz property for ideals generated by powers of general linear forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a description of initial ideals for almost complete intersections generated by powers of general linear forms and prove that WLP in a fixed degree $d$ holds when the number of variables $n$ is sufficiently large compared to $d$. In particular, we show that if $n\geq 3d-2$ then WLP holds for the ideal generated by squares at the degree $d$ spot and for $n\ge \frac{3d-3}{2}$ WLP holds for ideal generated by cubes at the degree $d$ spot. Finally, we prove that WLP fails for the ideal generated by squares when $n&lt; 3d -2$ at the $d$th spot by finding an explicit element in the kernel of the multiplication by a general linear form. This shows that our bound on $n$ is sharp in the case of the squares.</description>

      <title>Symbolic powers via extension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article investigates under which conditions the symbolic powers of the extension of an ideal is the same as the extension of the symbolic powers. Our result generalizes the known scenarios. As an application, we prove formulas for the resurgence of sum of two homogeneous ideals in finitely generated k-algebra domains, where k is algebraically closed. Initially, these were known for ideals in polynomial rings.</description>

      <title>Generalized cryptographic semi-regular sequences: A variant of Fr\"{o}berg conjecture and a simple complexity estimation for Gr\"{o}bner basis computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study generalized cryptographic semi-regular sequences, which are expected to generic in the space of homogeneous polynomial sequences on which the coordinate rings have Krull dimension one. We provide an upper-bound on the complexity of the Gr\"{o}bner basis computation for such a sequence.</description>

      <title>On the Tambara Affine Line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tambara functors are the analogue of commutative rings in equivariant algebra. Nakaoka defined ideals in Tambara functors, leading to the definition of the Nakaoka spectrum of prime ideals in a Tambara functor. In this work, we continue the study of the Nakoaka spectra of Tambara functors. We describe, in terms of the Zariski spectra of ordinary commutative rings, the Nakaoka spectra of many Tambara functors. In particular: we identify the Nakaoka spectrum of the fixed point Tambara functor of any $G$-ring with the GIT quotient of its classical Zariski spectrum; we describe the Nakaoka spectrum of the complex representation ring Tambara functor over a cyclic group of prime order $p$; we describe the affine line (the Nakaoka spectra of free Tambara functors on one generator) over a cyclic group of prime order $p$ in terms of the Zariski spectra of $\mathbb{Z}[x]$, $\mathbb{Z}[x,y]$, and the ring of cyclic polynomials $\mathbb{Z}[x_0,\ldots,x_{p-1}]^{C_p}$. To obtain these results, we introduce a "ghost construction" which produces an integral extension of any $C_p$-Tambara functor, the Nakaoka spectrum of which is describable. To relate the Nakaoka spectrum of a Tambara functor to that of its ghost, we prove several new results in equivariant commutative algebra, including a weak form of the Hilbert basis theorem, going up, lying over, and levelwise radicality of prime ideals in Tambara functors. These results also allow us to compute the Krull dimensions of many Tambara functors.</description>

      <title>Stabilization of associated prime ideals of monomial ideals -- Bounding the copersistence index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.13431v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The sequence $(\operatorname{Ass}(R/I^n))_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ of associated primes of powers of a monomial ideal $I$ in a polynomial ring $R$ eventually stabilizes by a known result by Markus Brodmann. L\^e Tu\^an Hoa gives an upper bound for the index where the stabilization occurs. This bound depends on the generators of the ideal and is obtained by separately bounding the powers of $I$ after which said sequence is non-decreasing and non-increasing, respectively. In this paper, we focus on the latter and call the smallest such number the copersistence index. We take up the proof idea of L\^e Tu\^an Hoa, who exploits a certain system of inequalities whose solution sets store information about the associated primes of powers of $I$. However, these proofs are entangled with a specific choice for the system of inequalities. In contrast to that, we present a generic ansatz to obtain an upper bound for the copersistence index that is uncoupled from this choice of the system. We establish properties for a system of inequalities to be eligible for this approach to work. We construct two suitable inequality systems to demonstrate how this ansatz yields upper bounds for the copersistence index and compare them with Hoa's. One of the two systems leads to an improvement of the bound by an exponential factor.</description>

      <title>Gotzmann's persistence theorem for smooth projective toric varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02275v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gotzmann's persistence theorem enables us to confirm the Hilbert polynomial of a subscheme of projective space by checking the Hilbert function in just two points, regardless of the dimension of the ambient space. We generalise this result to products of projective spaces, and then extend our result to any smooth projective toric variety. The number of points to check depends solely on the Picard rank of the ambient space, with no dependence on the dimension.</description>
