      <title>Effective action approach to quantum and thermal effects: from one particle to Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed derivation of the quantum and quantum-thermal effective action for non-relativistic systems, starting from the single particle case and extending to the Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) field theory for weakly interacting bosons. In the single-particle framework, we introduce the one-particle irreducible 1PI effective action formalism taking explicitly into account the choice of the initial quantum state, its saddle-point plus Gaussian fluctuation approximation, and its finite temperature extension via Matsubara summation. This yields a clear physical interpretation in terms of zero-point and thermal contributions to the Helmholtz free energy. The formalism is then applied to the GP action producing the 1PI effective potential at zero and finite temperature including beyond-mean-field Lee-Huang-Yang and thermal corrections. We discuss the gapless and gapped Bogoliubov spectra, their relevance to equilibrium and nonequilibrium regimes, and the role of regularization. Applications include the inclusion of an external potential within the local density approximation, the derivation of finite-temperature Josephson equations, and the extension to D dimensional systems. This unified approach provides a transparent connection between microscopic quantum fluctuations and effective macroscopic equations of motion for Bose-Einstein condensates.</description>

      <title>Proposals for realizing a Josephson diode in Atomtronic circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Josephson diode, a non-reciprocal quantum element analogous to the familiar semiconductor p-n junction diode, has been realized in solid-state systems but remains unexplored in tunable atomtronic circuits. In this work, we propose and numerically demonstrate the realization of the Josephson diode effect in an atomtronic circuit consisting of a ring-shaped Bose-Einstein condensate and with optical barriers serving as Josephson junctions. Our implementation of this macroscopic non-reciprocal quantum phenomenon is based on realizing the required inversion symmetry breaking through asymmetric barrier placement and an asymmetric alternating current (AC) drive, enabling position- and drive-tunable diode effects with efficiencies up to 15% and 91%, respectively. While standard time-of-flight absorption imaging can readily observe these effects, we employ cavity optomechanics for in situ, real-time, and non-destructive measurements of the relevant condensate dynamics. Our results establish a highly tunable platform for nonreciprocal Josephson transport, opening avenues for diode-based neutral-atom technologies in future quantum circuits.</description>

      <title>Probing BCS pairing and quasiparticle formation in ultracold gases by Rydberg atom spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Locally probing pairing in fermionic superfluids, ranging from micro- to macroscopic scales, has been a long-standing challenge. Here, we investigate a new approach that uses Rydberg impurities as a spectroscopic sensor of the surrounding strongly correlated state of ultracold paired fermions. The extended wavefunction of the Rydberg electron induces a finite-range potential that can bind atoms from the BCS medium, forming molecular states. As a consequence, the optical absorption spectrum of the impurity encodes key many-body properties. Using the functional determinant approach, we provide a direct measure of the superfluid gap through frequency shifts of dimer and trimer peaks. The spectra also reveal whether the Cooper pairs are broken or trapped intact. For static Rydberg atoms, we relate this signature of pairing to the suppression of the orthogonality catastrophe due to the superconducting gap resulting in the formation of well-defined polaron quasiparticles. Our work establishes Rydberg atom spectroscopy as a powerful local probe of strongly correlated matter.</description>

      <title>Measuring Hall voltage and Hall resistance in an atom-based quantum simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09744v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the Hall effect, a voltage drop develops perpendicularly to the current flow in the presence of a magnetic field, leading to a transverse Hall resistance. Recent developments with quantum simulators have unveiled strongly correlated and universal manifestations of the Hall effect. However, a direct measurement of the Hall voltage and of the Hall resistance in a non-electronic system of strongly interacting fermions was not achieved to date. Here, we demonstrate a technique for measuring the Hall voltage in a neutral-atom-based quantum simulator. From that we provide the first direct measurement of the Hall resistance in a cold-atom analogue of a solid-state Hall bar and study its dependence on the carrier density, along with theoretical analyses. Our work closes a major gap between analogue quantum simulations and measurements performed in solid-state systems, providing a key tool for the exploration of the Hall effect in highly tunable and strongly correlated systems.</description>

      <title>Response of superfluid fermions at finite temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20751v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A consistent finite-temperature microscopic theory for the response of strongly coupled superfluid fermionic systems is formulated. We start from the general many-body Hamiltonian with the vacuum (bare) two-fermion interaction and derive the equation of motion (EOM) for the thermally averaged two-time two-fermion correlation function, which determines the spectrum of the system under study. The superfluidity is introduced via the Bogoliubov transformation of the fermionic field operators, and the entire formalism is carried out in the basis of Bogoliubov's quasiparticles, keeping the complete 4x4 block matrix structure of the two-fermion EOM. Fully correlated static and dynamical interaction kernels of the resulting EOM are discussed. A special focus is then placed on the latter kernel, which is advanced to a factorized form, enabling a minimal truncation of the many-body problem while keeping important effects of emergent collectivity and mapping to the quasiparticle-vibration coupling (qPVC). As in the zero-temperature and non-superfluid cases, the qPVC can be associated with a new order parameter, qPVC vertex. In the thermal superfluid theory, the latter vertex, as well as the components of the dynamical kernel, acquire an extended form including thermally unblocked transition amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Nucleation line in three-component Bose-Einstein condensates in Gross-Pitaevskii theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02213v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By means of Gross-Pitaevskii theory we investigate the possibility of wetting phase transition in three-component Bose-Einstein condensates within the strong segregation between components 1 and 2. Third component plays the role of a surfactant, which can wet the interface formed by components 1 and 2. The case of symmetry of components 1 and 2, the equation for nucleation line and wetting phase diagram are studied. By linearizing the set of three-coupled Gross-Pitaevskii equations, the wave functions of the components are found. An analytical approximation for the surfactant thickness in the prewetting phase is presented. The results indicate that the surfactant thickness in the prewtting phase varies linearly with the chemical potential ratio in the logarithmic scale.</description>

      <title>Quench spectroscopy for Lieb-Liniger bosons in the presence of harmonic trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07699v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quench spectroscopy has emerged as a novel and powerful technique for probing the energy spectrum of various quantum phases for quantum systems from out-of-equilibrium dynamics. While its efficacy has been demonstrated in the homogeneous systems theoretically, most experimental setups feature a confining potential, such as a harmonic trap, which complicates the practical implementations. In this work, we experimentally probe the quench spectroscopy for one-dimensional bosons in optical lattices with the presence of a harmonic trap, and comparing our results with the density matrix renormalization group simulation. For the Mott insulator phase, although a gap is still observed, the band signal is broadened along the frequency space and cut at the half Brillouin zone, which can be explained by the nearest-neighbor tunneling excitations under harmonic confinement. Comparing with the superfluid spectrum, we can see a clear distinction between the two phases and find the inverse quench with larger amplitude yields the clearest spectrum. Our work offers pivotal insights into conducting quench spectroscopy effectively in practical systems.</description>

      <title>Wavefront Curvature and Transverse Atomic Motion in Time-Resolved Atom Interferometry: Impact and Mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26739v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time-resolved atom interferometry, as employed in applications such as gravitational wave detection and searches for ultra-light dark matter, requires precise control over systematic effects. In this work, we investigate phase noise arising from shot-to-shot fluctuations in the atoms' transverse motion in the presence of the wavefront curvature of the interferometer beam, and analyse its dependence on the laser-beam geometry in long-baseline, large-momentum-transfer atom interferometers. We use a semi-classical framework to derive analytical expressions for the effective phase perturbation in position-averaged measurements and validate them using Monte Carlo simulations. Applied to 100-m and 1-km atom gradiometers representative of next-generation experiments, the model shows that configurations maximizing pulse efficiency also amplify curvature-induced phase noise, requiring micron-level control of the atom cloud's centre-of-mass position and sub-micron-per-second control of its centre-of-mass velocity to achieve sub-$10^{-5}$ rad phase stability. Alternative beam geometries can suppress this noise by up to two orders of magnitude, but at the cost of reduced pulse efficiency. To address this limitation, we propose a mitigation strategy based on position-resolved phase-shift readout, which empirically learns and corrects the wavefront-induced bias from measurable quantities such as the phase-shift gradient and final cloud position. This approach restores high-sensitivity operation in the maximum-pulse-efficiency configuration without detailed beam characterisation, providing a practical route towards next-generation, time-resolved atom interferometers operating at the $10^{-5}$ rad noise level.</description>
