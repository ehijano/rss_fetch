      <title>Estimation of Change Points for Non-linear (auto-)regressive processes using Neural Network Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new test for the detection of a change in a non-linear (auto-)regressive time series as well as a corresponding estimator for the unknown time point of the change. To this end, we consider an at-most-one-change model and approximate the unknown (auto-)regression function by a neuronal network with one hidden layer. It is shown that the test has asymptotic power one for a wide range of alternatives not restricted to changes in the mean of the time series. Furthermore, we prove that the corresponding estimator converges to the true change point with the optimal rate OP (1/n) and derive the asymptotic distribution. Some simulations illustrate the behavior of the estimator with a special focus on the misspecified case, where the true regression function is not given by a neuronal network. Finally, we apply the estimator to some financial data.</description>

      <title>The weak-feature-impact effect on the NPMLE in monotone binary regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nonparametric maximum likelihood estimator (NPMLE) in monotone binary regression models is studied when the impact of the features on the labels is weak. Here, weakness is colloquially understood as ``close to flatness'' of the feature-label relationship $x \mapsto \mathbb{P}(Y=1 | X=x)$. Statistical literature provides the analysis of the NPMLE for the two extremal cases: If there is a non-vanishing derivative of the regression function, then the NPMLE possesses a nonparametric rate of convergence with Chernoff-type limit distribution, and it converges at the parametric $\sqrt{n}$-rate if the underlying function is (locally) flat. To investigate the transition of the NPMLE between these two extremal cases, we introduce a novel mathematical scenario. New pointwise and $L^1$-rates of convergence and corresponding limit distributions of the NPMLE are derived. They are shown to exhibit a sharp phase transition solely characterized by the level of feature impact.</description>

      <title>Estimation for linear parabolic SPDEs in two space dimensions with unknown damping parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study parametric estimation for second order linear parabolic stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) in two space dimensions driven by two types of $Q$-Wiener processes based on high frequency spatio-temporal data. First, we give estimators for damping parameters of the $Q$-Wiener processes of the SPDE using realized quadratic variations based on temporal and spatial increments. We next propose minimum contrast estimators of four coefficient parameters in the SPDE and obtain estimators of the rest of unknown parameters in the SPDE using an approximate coordinate process. We also examine numerical simulations of the proposed estimators.</description>

      <title>Parameters estimation of a Threshold Chan-Karolyi-Longstaff-Sanders process from continuous and discrete observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a continuous time process that is self-exciting and ergodic, called threshold Chan-Karolyi-Longstaff-Sanders (CKLS) process. This process is a generalization of various models in econometrics, such as Vasicek model, Cox-Ingersoll-Ross, and Black-Scholes, allowing for the presence of several thresholds which determine changes in the dynamics. We study the asymptotic behavior of maximum-likelihood and quasi-maximum-likelihood estimators of the drift parameters in the case of continuous time and discrete time observations. We show that for high frequency observations and infinite horizon the estimators satisfy the same asymptotic normality property as in the case of continuous time observations. We also discuss diffusion coefficient estimation. Finally, we apply our estimators to simulated and real data to motivate considering (multiple) thresholds.</description>

      <title>Kullback-Leibler excess risk bounds for exponential weighted aggregation in Generalized linear models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aggregation methods have emerged as a powerful and flexible framework in statistical learning, providing unified solutions across diverse problems such as regression, classification, and density estimation. In the context of generalized linear models (GLMs), where responses follow exponential family distributions, aggregation offers an attractive alternative to classical parametric modeling. This paper investigates the problem of sparse aggregation in GLMs, aiming to approximate the true parameter vector by a sparse linear combination of predictors. We prove that an exponential weighted aggregation scheme yields a sharp oracle inequality for the Kullback-Leibler risk with leading constant equal to one, while also attaining the minimax-optimal rate of aggregation. These results are further enhanced by establishing high-probability bounds on the excess risk.</description>

      <title>Spectral estimation for high-dimensional linear processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel estimation procedure for certain spectral distributions associated with a class of high dimensional linear time series. The processes under consideration are of the form $X_t = \sum_{\ell=0}^\infty \mathbf{A}_\ell Z_{t-\ell}$ with iid innovations $(Z_t)$. The key structural assumption is that the coefficient matrices and the variance of the innovations are simultaneously diagonalizable in a common orthonormal basis. We develop a strategy for estimating the joint spectral distribution of the coefficient matrices and the innovation variance by making use of the asymptotic behavior of the eigenvalues of appropriately weighted integrals of the sample periodogram. Throughout we work under the asymptotic regime $p,n \to \infty$, such that $p/n\to c \in (0,\infty)$, where $p$ is the dimension and $n$ is the sample size. Under this setting, we first establish a weak limit for the empirical distribution of eigenvalues of the aforementioned integrated sample periodograms. This result is proved using techniques from random matrix theory, in particular the characterization of weak convergence by means of the Stieltjes transform of relevant distributions. We utilize this result to develop an estimator of the joint spectral distribution of the coefficient matrices, by minimizing an $L^\kappa$ discrepancy measure, for $\kappa \geq 1$, between the empirical and limiting Stieltjes transforms of the integrated sample periodograms. This is accomplished by assuming that the joint spectral distribution is a discrete mixture of point masses. We also prove consistency of the estimator corresponding to the $L^2$ discrepancy measure. We illustrate the methodology through simulations and an application to stock price data from the S\&amp;P 500 series.</description>

      <title>Perfect Clustering in Nonuniform Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While there has been tremendous activity in the area of statistical network inference on graphs, hypergraphs have not enjoyed the same attention, on account of their relative complexity and the lack of tractable statistical models. We introduce a hyper-edge-centric model for analyzing hypergraphs, called the interaction hypergraph, which models natural sampling methods for hypergraphs in neuroscience and communication networks, and accommodates interactions involving different numbers of entities. We define latent embeddings for the interactions in such a network, and analyze their estimators. In particular, we show that a spectral estimate of the interaction latent positions can achieve perfect clustering once enough interactions are observed.</description>

      <title>A Hierarchical Decomposition of Kullback-Leibler Divergence: Disentangling Marginal Mismatches from Statistical Dependencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence is a foundational measure for comparing probability distributions. Yet in multivariate settings, its structure is often opaque, conflating marginal mismatches and statistical dependencies. We derive an algebraically exact, additive, and hierarchical decomposition of the KL divergence between a joint distribution \( P_k \) and a product reference \( Q^{\otimes k} \). The total divergence splits into the sum of marginal KLs, \( \sum_{i=1}^k \mathrm{KL}(P_i \| Q) \), and the total correlation \( C(P_k) \), which we further decompose as \( C(P_k) = \sum_{r=2}^k I^{(r)}(P_k) \), using Moebius inversion on the subset lattice. Each \( I^{(r)} \) quantifies the distinct contribution of \( r \)-way statistical interactions to the total divergence. This yields the first decomposition of this form that is both algebraically complete and interpretable using only standard Shannon quantities, with no approximations or model assumptions. Numerical validation using hypergeometric sampling confirms exactness to machine precision across diverse system configurations. This framework enables precise diagnosis of divergence origins, marginal versus interaction, across applications in machine learning, econometrics, and complex systems.</description>

      <title>Bayesian shrinkage priors subject to linear constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Bayesian regression models with categorical predictors, constraints are needed to ensure identifiability when using all $K$ levels of a factor. The sum-to-zero constraint is particularly useful as it allows coefficients to represent deviations from the population average. However, implementing such constraints in Bayesian settings is challenging, especially when assigning appropriate priors that respect these constraints and general principles. Here we develop a multivariate normal prior family that satisfies arbitrary linear constraints while preserving the local adaptivity properties of shrinkage priors, with an efficient implementation algorithm for probabilistic programming languages. Our approach applies broadly to various shrinkage frameworks including Bayesian Ridge, horseshoe priors and their variants, demonstrating excellent performance in simulation studies. The covariance structure we derive generalizes beyond regression models to any Bayesian analysis requiring linear constraints on parameters, providing practitioners with a principled approach to parameter identification while maintaining proper uncertainty quantification and interpretability.</description>

      <title>Statistical Inference for High-Dimensional Robust Linear Regression Models via Recursive Online-Score Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework for estimation and inference in penalized M-estimators applied to robust high-dimensional linear regression models. Traditional methods for high-dimensional statistical inference, which predominantly rely on convex likelihood-based approaches, struggle to address the nonconvexity inherent in penalized M-estimation with nonconvex objective functions. Our proposed method extends the recursive online score estimation (ROSE) framework of Shi et al. (2021) to robust high-dimensional settings by developing a recursive score equation based on penalized M-estimation, explicitly addressing nonconvexity. We establish the statistical consistency and asymptotic normality of the resulting estimator, providing a rigorous foundation for valid inference in robust high-dimensional regression. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated through simulation studies and a real-world application, showcasing its superior performance compared to existing approaches.</description>

      <title>On the rate of convergence of estimating the Hurst parameter of rough stochastic volatility models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In [8], easily computable scale-invariant estimator $\widehat{\mathscr{R}}^s_n$ was constructed to estimate the Hurst parameter of the drifted fractional Brownian motion $X$ from its antiderivative. This paper extends this convergence result by proving that $\widehat{\mathscr{R}}^s_n$ also consistently estimates the Hurst parameter when applied to the antiderivative of $g \circ X$ for a general nonlinear function $g$. We also establish an almost sure rate of convergence in this general setting. Our result applies, in particular, to the estimation of the Hurst parameter of a wide class of rough stochastic volatility models from discrete observations of the integrated variance, including the fractional stochastic volatility model.</description>

      <title>No-Regret Generative Modeling via Parabolic Monge-Amp\`ere PDE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel generative modeling framework based on a discretized parabolic Monge-Amp\`ere PDE, which emerges as a continuous limit of the Sinkhorn algorithm commonly used in optimal transport. Our method performs iterative refinement in the space of Brenier maps using a mirror gradient descent step. We establish theoretical guarantees for generative modeling through the lens of no-regret analysis, demonstrating that the iterates converge to the optimal Brenier map under a variety of step-size schedules. As a technical contribution, we derive a new Evolution Variational Inequality tailored to the parabolic Monge-Amp\`ere PDE, connecting geometry, transportation cost, and regret. Our framework accommodates non-log-concave target distributions, constructs an optimal sampling process via the Brenier map, and integrates favorable learning techniques from generative adversarial networks and score-based diffusion models. As direct applications, we illustrate how our theory paves new pathways for generative modeling and variational inference.</description>

      <title>Inferring Outcome Means of Exponential Family Distributions Estimated by Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the widespread use of deep neural networks (DNNs) for prediction, inference on estimated means for categorical or exponential family outcomes remains underexplored. We address this gap by framing the problem within the generalized linear models (GLMs) framework and developing a rigorous statistical approach for inference on DNN-estimated means. To address a key limitation of assuming independence between prediction errors and input variables in the literature, which often fails in GLMs, we introduce a truncation technique that partitions the problem into regimes with distinct noise behaviors, enabling refined analysis and robust theoretical guarantees under general GLM frameworks. To implement inference, we consider an Ensemble Subsampling Method (ESM) that leverages U-statistics and the Hoeffding decomposition to construct reliable confidence intervals. This method enables model-free variance estimation and accounts for heterogeneity among individuals in the population. Through extensive simulations across Binary, Poisson and Binomial models, we demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method. We further apply the method to real-world data from the eICU dataset to predict patient readmission risks, providing actionable insights for clinical decision-making.</description>

      <title>Optimal sparse phase retrieval via a quasi-Bayesian approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of sparse phase retrieval, a fundamental inverse problem in applied mathematics, physics, and engineering, where a signal need to be reconstructed using only the magnitude of its transformation while phase information remains inaccessible. Leveraging the inherent sparsity of many real-world signals, we introduce a novel sparse quasi-Bayesian approach and provide the first theoretical guarantees for such an approach. Specifically, we employ a scaled Student distribution as a continuous shrinkage prior to enforce sparsity and analyze the method using the PAC-Bayesian inequality framework. Our results establish that the proposed Bayesian estimator achieves minimax-optimal convergence rates under sub-exponential noise, matching those of state-of-the-art frequentist methods. To ensure computational feasibility, we develop an efficient Langevin Monte Carlo sampling algorithm. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate that our method performs comparably to existing frequentist techniques, highlighting its potential as a principled alternative for sparse phase retrieval in noisy settings.</description>

      <title>Ordinary Least Squares as an Attention Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I show that ordinary least squares (OLS) predictions can be rewritten as the output of a restricted attention module, akin to those forming the backbone of large language models. This connection offers an alternative perspective on attention beyond the conventional information retrieval framework, making it more accessible to researchers and analysts with a background in traditional statistics. It falls into place when OLS is framed as a similarity-based method in a transformed regressor space, distinct from the standard view based on partial correlations. In fact, the OLS solution can be recast as the outcome of an alternative problem: minimizing squared prediction errors by optimizing the embedding space in which training and test vectors are compared via inner products. Rather than estimating coefficients directly, we equivalently learn optimal encoding and decoding operations for predictors. From this vantage point, OLS maps naturally onto the query-key-value structure of attention mechanisms. Building on this foundation, I discuss key elements of Transformer-style attention and draw connections to classic ideas from time series econometrics.</description>

      <title>Offline Dynamic Inventory and Pricing Strategy: Addressing Censored and Dependent Demand</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the offline sequential feature-based pricing and inventory control problem where the current demand depends on the past demand levels and any demand exceeding the available inventory is lost. Our goal is to leverage the offline dataset, consisting of past prices, ordering quantities, inventory levels, covariates, and censored sales levels, to estimate the optimal pricing and inventory control policy that maximizes long-term profit. While the underlying dynamic without censoring can be modeled by Markov decision process (MDP), the primary obstacle arises from the observed process where demand censoring is present, resulting in missing profit information, the failure of the Markov property, and a non-stationary optimal policy. To overcome these challenges, we first approximate the optimal policy by solving a high-order MDP characterized by the number of consecutive censoring instances, which ultimately boils down to solving a specialized Bellman equation tailored for this problem. Inspired by offline reinforcement learning and survival analysis, we propose two novel data-driven algorithms to solving these Bellman equations and, thus, estimate the optimal policy. Furthermore, we establish finite sample regret bounds to validate the effectiveness of these algorithms. Finally, we conduct numerical experiments to demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithms in estimating the optimal policy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first data-driven approach to learning optimal pricing and inventory control policies in a sequential decision-making environment characterized by censored and dependent demand. The implementations of the proposed algorithms are available at https://github.com/gundemkorel/Inventory_Pricing_Control</description>

      <title>Learning with Positive and Imperfect Unlabeled Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of learning binary classifiers from positive and unlabeled data when the unlabeled data distribution is shifted, which we call Positive and Imperfect Unlabeled (PIU) Learning. In the absence of covariate shifts, i.e., with perfect unlabeled data, Denis (1998) reduced this problem to learning under Massart noise; however, that reduction fails under even slight shifts.
  Our main results on PIU learning are the characterizations of the sample complexity of PIU learning and a computationally and sample-efficient algorithm achieving a misclassification error $\varepsilon$. We further show that our results lead to new algorithms for several related problems.
  1. Learning from smooth distributions: We give algorithms that learn interesting concept classes from only positive samples under smooth feature distributions, bypassing known existing impossibility results and contributing to recent advances in smoothened learning (Haghtalab et al, J.ACM'24) (Chandrasekaran et al., COLT'24).
  2. Learning with a list of unlabeled distributions: We design new algorithms that apply to a broad class of concept classes under the assumption that we are given a list of unlabeled distributions, one of which--unknown to the learner--is $O(1)$-close to the true feature distribution.
  3. Estimation in the presence of unknown truncation: We give the first polynomial sample and time algorithm for estimating the parameters of an exponential family distribution from samples truncated to an unknown set approximable by polynomials in $L_1$-norm. This improves the algorithm by Lee et al. (FOCS'24) that requires approximation in $L_2$-norm.
  4. Detecting truncation: We present new algorithms for detecting whether given samples have been truncated (or not) for a broad class of non-product distributions, including non-product distributions, improving the algorithm by De et al. (STOC'24).</description>

      <title>Understanding Best Subset Selection: A Tale of Two C(omplex)ities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.06259v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of best subset selection (BSS) under high-dimensional sparse linear regression model. Recently, Guo et al. (2020) showed that the model selection performance of BSS depends on a certain identifiability margin, a measure that captures the model discriminative power of BSS under a general correlation structure that is robust to the design dependence, unlike its computational surrogates such as LASSO, SCAD, MCP, etc. Expanding on this, we further broaden the theoretical understanding of best subset selection in this paper and show that the complexities of the residualized signals, the portion of the signals orthogonal to the true active features, and spurious projections, describing the projection operators associated with the irrelevant features, also play fundamental roles in characterizing the margin condition for model consistency of BSS. In particular, we establish both necessary and sufficient margin conditions depending only on the identifiability margin and the two complexity measures. We also partially extend our sufficiency result to the case of high-dimensional sparse generalized linear models (GLMs).</description>

      <title>Local asymptotics of selection models with applications in Bayesian selective inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08365v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Contemporary focus on selective inference provokes interest in the asymptotic properties of selection models, as the working inferential models in the conditional approach to inference after selection. In this paper, we derive an asymptotic expansion of the local likelihood ratios of selection models. We show that under mild regularity conditions, they behave asymptotically like a sequence of Gaussian selection models. This generalizes the Local Asymptotic Normality framework of Le Cam (1960) to a class of non-regular models, and indicates a notion of local asymptotic selective normality as the appropriate simplifying theoretical framework for analysis of selective inference. Furthermore, we establish practical consequences for Bayesian selective inference. Specifically, we derive the asymptotic shape of Bayesian posterior distributions constructed from selection models, and show that they will typically be significantly miscalibrated in a frequentist sense, demonstrating that the familiar asymptotic equivalence between Bayesian and frequentist approaches does not hold under selection.</description>

Abstract: This study explores a Gaussian quasi-likelihood approach for estimating parameters of diffusion processes with Markovian regime switching. Assuming the ergodicity under high-frequency sampling, we will show the asymptotic normality of the unknown parameters contained in the drift and diffusion coefficients and present a consistent explicit estimator for the generator of the Markov chain.

      <title>Functional worst risk minimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00412v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to extend worst risk minimization, also called worst average loss minimization, to the functional realm. This means finding a functional regression representation that will be robust to future distribution shifts on the basis of data from two environments. In the classical non-functional realm, structural equations are based on a transfer matrix $B$. In section~\ref{sec:sfr}, we generalize this to consider a linear operator $\mathcal{T}$ on square integrable processes that plays the the part of $B$. By requiring that $(I-\mathcal{T})^{-1}$ is bounded -- as opposed to $\mathcal{T}$ -- this will allow for a large class of unbounded operators to be considered. Section~\ref{sec:worstrisk} considers two separate cases that both lead to the same worst-risk decomposition. Remarkably, this decomposition has the same structure as in the non-functional case. We consider any operator $\mathcal{T}$ that makes $(I-\mathcal{T})^{-1}$ bounded and define the future shift set in terms of the covariance functions of the shifts. In section~\ref{sec:minimizer}, we prove a necessary and sufficient condition for existence of a minimizer to this worst risk in the space of square integrable kernels. Previously, such minimizers were expressed in terms of the unknown eigenfunctions of the target and covariate integral operators (see for instance \cite{HeMullerWang} and \cite{YaoAOS}). This means that in order to estimate the minimizer, one must first estimate these unknown eigenfunctions. In contrast, the solution provided here will be expressed in any arbitrary ON-basis. This completely removes any necessity of estimating eigenfunctions. This pays dividends in section~\ref{sec:estimation}, where we provide a family of estimators, that are consistent with a large sample bound. Proofs of all the results are provided in the appendix.</description>

      <title>Ask for More Than Bayes Optimal: A Theory of Indecisions for Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12807v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Selective classification is a powerful tool for automated decision-making in high-risk scenarios, allowing classifiers to make only highly confident decisions while abstaining when uncertainty is too high. Given a target classification accuracy, our goal is to minimize the number of indecisions, which are observations that we do not automate. For problems that are hard, the target accuracy may not be achievable without using indecisions. In contrast, by using indecisions, we are able to control the misclassification rate to any user-specified level, even below the Bayes optimal error rate, while minimizing the frequency of identifying an indecision. We provide a full characterization of the minimax risk in selective classification, proving key continuity and monotonicity properties that enable optimal indecision selection. Our results extend to hypothesis testing, where we control type II error given a fixed type I error, introducing a novel perspective in selective inference. We analyze the impact of estimating the regression function $\eta$, showing that plug-in classifiers remain consistent and that accuracy-based calibration effectively controls indecision levels. Additionally, we develop finite-sample calibration methods and identify cases where no training data is needed under the Monotone Likelihood Ratio (MLR) property. In the binary Gaussian mixture model, we establish sharp phase transition results, demonstrating that minimal indecisions can yield near-optimal accuracy even with suboptimal class separation. These findings highlight the potential of selective classification to significantly reduce misclassification rates with a relatively small cost in terms of indecisions.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the strong consistency of the sparse K-means clustering for high dimensional data. We prove the consistency in both risk and clustering for the Euclidean distance. We discuss the characterization of the limit of the clustering under some special cases. For the general (non-Euclidean) distance, we prove the consistency in risk. Our result naturally extends to other models with the same objective function but different constraints such as l0 or l1 penalty in recent literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.10375v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In problems such as variable selection and graph estimation, models are characterized by Boolean logical structure such as presence or absence of a variable or an edge. Consequently, false positive error or false negative error can be specified as the number of variables/edges that are incorrectly included or excluded in an estimated model. However, there are several other problems such as ranking, clustering, and causal inference in which the associated model classes do not admit transparent notions of false positive and false negative errors due to the lack of an underlying Boolean logical structure. In this paper, we present a generic approach to endow a collection of models with partial order structure, which leads to a hierarchical organization of model classes as well as natural analogs of false positive and false negative errors. We describe model selection procedures that provide false positive error control in our general setting and we illustrate their utility with numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Affine Invariance in Continuous-Domain Convolutional Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.09245v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The notion of group invariance helps neural networks in recognizing patterns and features under geometric transformations. Group convolutional neural networks enhance traditional convolutional neural networks by incorporating group-based geometric structures into their design. This research studies affine invariance on continuous-domain convolutional neural networks. Despite other research considering isometric invariance or similarity invariance, we focus on the full structure of affine transforms generated by the group of all invertible $2 \times 2$ real matrices (generalized linear group $\mathrm{GL}_2(\mathbb{R})$). We introduce a new criterion to assess the invariance of two signals under affine transformations. The input image is embedded into the affine Lie group $G_2 = \mathbb{R}^2 \ltimes \mathrm{GL}_2(\mathbb{R})$ to facilitate group convolution operations that respect affine invariance. Then, we analyze the convolution of embedded signals over $G_2$. In sum, our research could eventually extend the scope of geometrical transformations that usual deep-learning pipelines can handle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09604v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extremal graphical models encode the conditional independence structure of multivariate extremes and provide a powerful tool for quantifying the risk of rare events. Prior work on learning these graphs from data has focused on the setting where all relevant variables are observed. For the popular class of H\"usler-Reiss models, we propose the \texttt{eglatent} method, a tractable convex program for learning extremal graphical models in the presence of latent variables. Our approach decomposes the H\"usler-Reiss precision matrix into a sparse component encoding the graphical structure among the observed variables after conditioning on the latent variables, and a low-rank component encoding the effect of a few latent variables on the observed variables. We provide finite-sample guarantees of \texttt{eglatent} and show that it consistently recovers the conditional graph as well as the number of latent variables. We highlight the improved performances of our approach on synthetic and real data.</description>

      <title>Exact Exploratory Bi-factor Analysis: A Constraint-based Optimisation Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00679v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bi-factor analysis is a form of confirmatory factor analysis widely used in psychological and educational measurement. The use of a bi-factor model requires the specification of an explicit bi-factor structure on the relationship between the observed variables and the group factors. In practice, the bi-factor structure is sometimes unknown, in which case an exploratory form of bi-factor analysis is needed to find the bi-factor structure. Unfortunately, there are few methods for exploratory bi-factor analysis, with the exception of a rotation-based method proposed in Jennrich and Bentler (2011, 2012). However, this method only finds approximate bi-factor structures, as it does not yield an exact bi-factor loading structure, even after applying hard thresholding. In this paper, we propose a constraint-based optimisation method that learns an exact bi-factor loading structure from data, overcoming the issue with the rotation-based method. The key to the proposed method is a mathematical characterisation of the bi-factor loading structure as a set of equality constraints, which allows us to formulate the exploratory bi-factor analysis problem as a constrained optimisation problem in a continuous domain and solve the optimisation problem with an augmented Lagrangian method. The power of the proposed method is shown via simulation studies and a real data example. Extending the proposed method to exploratory hierarchical factor analysis is also discussed. The codes are available on ``https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Bifactor-ALM-method-757D".</description>

      <title>Implicit High-Order Moment Tensor Estimation and Learning Latent Variable Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15669v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the task of learning latent-variable models. A common algorithmic technique for this task is the method of moments. Unfortunately, moment-based approaches are hampered by the fact that the moment tensors of super-constant degree cannot even be written down in polynomial time. Motivated by such learning applications, we develop a general efficient algorithm for {\em implicit moment tensor computation}. Our framework generalizes the work of~\cite{LL21-opt} which developed an efficient algorithm for the specific moment tensors that arise in clustering mixtures of spherical Gaussians.
  By leveraging our implicit moment estimation algorithm, we obtain the first $\mathrm{poly}(d, k)$-time learning algorithms for the following models.
  * {\bf Mixtures of Linear Regressions} We give a $\mathrm{poly}(d, k, 1/\epsilon)$-time algorithm for this task, where $\epsilon$ is the desired error.
  * {\bf Mixtures of Spherical Gaussians} For density estimation, we give a $\mathrm{poly}(d, k, 1/\epsilon)$-time learning algorithm, where $\epsilon$ is the desired total variation error, under the condition that the means lie in a ball of radius $O(\sqrt{\log k})$. For parameter estimation, we give a $\mathrm{poly}(d, k, 1/\epsilon)$-time algorithm under the {\em optimal} mean separation of $\Omega(\log^{1/2}(k/\epsilon))$.
  * {\bf Positive Linear Combinations of Non-Linear Activations} We give a general algorithm for this task with complexity $\mathrm{poly}(d, k) g(\epsilon)$, where $\epsilon$ is the desired error and the function $g$ depends on the Hermite concentration of the target class of functions. Specifically, for positive linear combinations of ReLU activations, our algorithm has complexity $\mathrm{poly}(d, k) 2^{\mathrm{poly}(1/\epsilon)}$.</description>

Abstract: We study the problem of computationally efficient robust estimation of the covariance/scatter matrix of elliptical distributions -- that is, affine transformations of spherically symmetric distributions -- under the strong contamination model in the high-dimensional regime $d \gtrsim 1/\varepsilon^2$, where $d$ is the dimension and $\varepsilon$ is the fraction of adversarial corruptions.
  We propose an algorithm that, under a very mild assumption on the scatter matrix $\Sigma$, and given a nearly optimal number of samples $n = \tilde{O}(d^2/\varepsilon^2)$, computes in polynomial time an estimator $\hat{\Sigma}$ such that, with high probability, \[ \left\| \Sigma^{-1/2} \hat{\Sigma} \Sigma^{-1/2} - Id \right\|_{\text F} \le O(\varepsilon \log(1/\varepsilon))\,. \]
  As an application of our result, we obtain the first efficiently computable, nearly optimal robust covariance estimators that extend beyond the Gaussian case. Specifically, for elliptical distributions satisfying the Hanson--Wright inequality (such as Gaussians and uniform distributions over ellipsoids), our estimator $\hat{\Sigma}$ of the covariance $\Sigma$ achieves the same error guarantee as in the Gaussian case. Moreover, for elliptical distributions with sub-exponential tails (such as the multivariate Laplace distribution), we construct an estimator $\hat{\Sigma}$ satisfying the spectral norm bound \[ \left\| \Sigma^{-1/2} \hat{\Sigma} \Sigma^{-1/2} - Id \right\| \le O(\varepsilon \log(1/\varepsilon))\,. \]
  Our approach is based on estimating the covariance of the spatial sign of elliptical distributions. The estimation proceeds in several stages, one of which involves a novel spectral covariance filtering algorithm. This algorithm combines covariance filtering techniques with degree-4 sum-of-squares relaxations, and we believe it may be of independent interest for future applications.</description>

      <title>Robust Learning of Multi-index Models via Iterative Subspace Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09525v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the task of learning Multi-Index Models (MIMs) with label noise under the Gaussian distribution. A $K$-MIM is any function $f$ that only depends on a $K$-dimensional subspace. We focus on well-behaved MIMs with finite ranges that satisfy certain regularity properties. Our main contribution is a general robust learner that is qualitatively optimal in the Statistical Query (SQ) model. Our algorithm iteratively constructs better approximations to the defining subspace by computing low-degree moments conditional on the projection to the subspace computed thus far, and adding directions with relatively large empirical moments. This procedure efficiently finds a subspace $V$ so that $f(\mathbf{x})$ is close to a function of the projection of $\mathbf{x}$ onto $V$. Conversely, for functions for which these conditional moments do not help, we prove an SQ lower bound suggesting that no efficient learner exists. As applications, we provide faster robust learners for the following concept classes:
  * {\bf Multiclass Linear Classifiers} We give a constant-factor approximate agnostic learner with sample complexity $N = O(d) 2^{\mathrm{poly}(K/\epsilon)}$ and computational complexity $\mathrm{poly}(N ,d)$. This is the first constant-factor agnostic learner for this class whose complexity is a fixed-degree polynomial in $d$.
  * {\bf Intersections of Halfspaces} We give an approximate agnostic learner for this class achieving 0-1 error $K \tilde{O}(\mathrm{OPT}) + \epsilon$ with sample complexity $N=O(d^2) 2^{\mathrm{poly}(K/\epsilon)}$ and computational complexity $\mathrm{poly}(N ,d)$. This is the first agnostic learner for this class with near-linear error dependence and complexity a fixed-degree polynomial in $d$.
  Furthermore, we show that in the presence of random classification noise, the complexity of our algorithm scales polynomially with $1/\epsilon$.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Inference for High-dimensional Time Series with a Directed Acyclic Graphical Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23563v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In multivariate time series analysis, understanding the underlying causal relationships among variables is often of interest for various applications. Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) provide a powerful framework for representing causal dependencies. This paper proposes a novel Bayesian approach for modeling multivariate time series where conditional independencies and causal structure are encoded by a DAG. The proposed model allows structural properties such as stationarity to be easily accommodated. Given the application, we further extend the model for matrix-variate time series. We take a Bayesian approach to inference, and a ``projection-posterior'' based efficient computational algorithm is developed. The posterior convergence properties of the proposed method are established along with two identifiability results for the unrestricted structural equation models. The utility of the proposed method is demonstrated through simulation studies and real data analysis.</description>

      <title>A Piecewise Lyapunov Analysis of Sub-quadratic SGD: Applications to Robust and Quantile Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08178v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by robust and quantile regression problems, we investigate the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm for minimizing an objective function $f$ that is locally strongly convex with a sub--quadratic tail. This setting covers many widely used online statistical methods. We introduce a novel piecewise Lyapunov function that enables us to handle functions $f$ with only first-order differentiability, which includes a wide range of popular loss functions such as Huber loss. Leveraging our proposed Lyapunov function, we derive finite-time moment bounds under general diminishing stepsizes, as well as constant stepsizes. We further establish the weak convergence, central limit theorem and bias characterization under constant stepsize, providing the first geometrical convergence result for sub--quadratic SGD. Our results have wide applications, especially in online statistical methods. In particular, we discuss two applications of our results. 1) Online robust regression: We consider a corrupted linear model with sub--exponential covariates and heavy--tailed noise. Our analysis provides convergence rates comparable to those for corrupted models with Gaussian covariates and noise. 2) Online quantile regression: Importantly, our results relax the common assumption in prior work that the conditional density is continuous and provide a more fine-grained analysis for the moment bounds.</description>
