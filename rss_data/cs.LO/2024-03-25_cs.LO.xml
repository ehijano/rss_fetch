      <title>Formally Verifying the Safety of Pipelined Moonshot Consensus Protocol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decentralized Finance (DeFi) has emerged as a contemporary competitive as well as complementary to traditional centralized finance systems. As of 23rd January 2024, per Defillama approximately USD 55 billion is the total value locked on the DeFi applications on all blockchains put together.
  A Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) State Machine Replication (SMR) protocol, popularly known as the consensus protocol, is the central component of a blockchain. If forks are possible in a consensus protocol, they can be misused to carry out double spending attacks and can be catastrophic given high volumes of finance that are transacted on blockchains. Formal verification of the safety of consensus protocols is the golden standard for guaranteeing that forks are not possible. However, it is considered complex and challenging to do. This is reflected by the fact that not many complex consensus protocols are formally verified except for Tendermint and QBFT.
  We focus on Supra's Pipelined Moonshot consensus protocol. Similar to Tendermint's formal verification, we too model Pipelined Moonshot using IVy and formally prove that for all network sizes, as long as the number of Byzantine validators is less than one thirds, the protocol does not allow forks, thus proving that Pipelined Moonshot is safe and double spending cannot be done using forks. The IVy model and proof of safety is available on Github.</description>

      <title>SAT Encoding of Partial Ordering Models for Graph Coloring Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we suggest new SAT encodings of the partial-ordering based ILP model for the graph coloring problem (GCP) and the bandwidth coloring problem (BCP). The GCP asks for the minimum number of colors that can be assigned to the vertices of a given graph such that each two adjacent vertices get different colors. The BCP is a generalization, where each edge has a weight that enforces a minimal "distance" between the assigned colors, and the goal is to minimize the "largest" color used. For the widely studied GCP, we experimentally compare our new SAT encoding to the state-of-the-art approaches on the DIMACS benchmark set. Our evaluation confirms that this SAT encoding is effective for sparse graphs and even outperforms the state-of-the-art on some DIMACS instances. For the BCP, our theoretical analysis shows that the partial-ordering based SAT and ILP formulations have an asymptotically smaller size than that of the classical assignment-based model. Our practical evaluation confirms not only a dominance compared to the assignment-based encodings but also to the state-of-the-art approaches on a set of benchmark instances. Up to our knowledge, we have solved several open instances of the BCP from the literature for the first time.</description>

      <title>Term rewriting on nestohedra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define term rewriting systems on the vertices and faces of nestohedra, and show that the former are confluent and terminating. While the associated poset on vertices generalizes Barnard--McConville's flip order for graph-associahedra, the preorder on faces likely generalizes the facial weak order for permutahedra. Moreover, we define and study contextual families of nestohedra, whose local confluence diagrams satisfy a certain uniformity condition. Among them are associahedra and operahedra, whose associated proofs of confluence for their rewriting systems reproduce proofs of categorical coherence theorems for monoidal categories and categorified operads.</description>

      <title>Many-one reducibility with realizability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we propose a new classification of $\Sigma^0_2$ formulas under the realizability interpretation of many-one reducibility (i.e., Levin reducibility). For example, ${\sf Fin}$, the decision of being eventually zero for sequences, is many-one/Levin complete among $\Sigma^0_2$ formulas of the form $\exists n\forall m\geq n.\varphi(m,x)$, where $\varphi$ is decidable. The decision of boundedness for sequences ${\sf BddSeq}$ and posets ${\sf PO}_{\sf top}$ are many-one/Levin complete among $\Sigma^0_2$ formulas of the form $\exists n\forall m\geq n\forall k.\varphi(m,k,x)$, where $\varphi$ is decidable. However, unlike the classical many-one reducibility, none of the above is $\Sigma^0_2$-complete. The decision of non-density of linear order ${\sf NonDense}$ is truly $\Sigma^0_2$-complete.</description>

      <title>Can Language Models Pretend Solvers? Logic Code Simulation with LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in addressing logic problems. capitalizing on the great capabilities of LLMs for code-related activities, several frameworks leveraging logical solvers for logic reasoning have been proposed recently. While existing research predominantly focuses on viewing LLMs as natural language logic solvers or translators, their roles as logic code interpreters and executors have received limited attention. This study delves into a novel aspect, namely logic code simulation, which forces LLMs to emulate logical solvers in predicting the results of logical programs. To further investigate this novel task, we formulate our three research questions: Can LLMs efficiently simulate the outputs of logic codes? What strength arises along with logic code simulation? And what pitfalls? To address these inquiries, we curate three novel datasets tailored for the logic code simulation task and undertake thorough experiments to establish the baseline performance of LLMs in code simulation. Subsequently, we introduce a pioneering LLM-based code simulation technique, Dual Chains of Logic (DCoL). This technique advocates a dual-path thinking approach for LLMs, which has demonstrated state-of-the-art performance compared to other LLM prompt strategies, achieving a notable improvement in accuracy by 7.06% with GPT-4-Turbo.</description>

      <title>Logic-based Explanations for Linear Support Vector Classifiers with Reject Option</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Support Vector Classifier (SVC) is a well-known Machine Learning (ML) model for linear classification problems. It can be used in conjunction with a reject option strategy to reject instances that are hard to correctly classify and delegate them to a specialist. This further increases the confidence of the model. Given this, obtaining an explanation of the cause of rejection is important to not blindly trust the obtained results. While most of the related work has developed means to give such explanations for machine learning models, to the best of our knowledge none have done so for when reject option is present. We propose a logic-based approach with formal guarantees on the correctness and minimality of explanations for linear SVCs with reject option. We evaluate our approach by comparing it to Anchors, which is a heuristic algorithm for generating explanations. Obtained results show that our proposed method gives shorter explanations with reduced time cost.</description>

      <title>On a fibrational construction for optics, lenses, and Dialectica categories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Categories of lenses/optics and Dialectica categories are both comprised of bidirectional morphisms of basically the same form. In this work we show how they can be considered a special case of an overarching fibrational construction, generalizing Hofstra's construction of Dialectica fibrations and Spivak's construction of generalized lenses. This construction turns a tower of Grothendieck fibrations into another tower of fibrations by iteratively twisting each of the components, using the opposite fibration construction.</description>

      <title>An incremental MaxSAT-based model to learn balanced rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16418v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing advancements in the field of machine learning have led to the development of numerous applications that effectively address a wide range of problems with accurate predictions. However, in certain cases, accuracy alone may not be sufficient. Many real-world problems also demand explanations and interpretability behind the predictions. One of the most popular interpretable models that are classification rules. This work aims to propose an incremental model for learning interpretable and balanced rules based on MaxSAT, called IMLIB. This new model was based on two other approaches, one based on SAT and the other on MaxSAT. The one based on SAT limits the size of each generated rule, making it possible to balance them. We suggest that such a set of rules seem more natural to be understood compared to a mixture of large and small rules. The approach based on MaxSAT, called IMLI, presents a technique to increase performance that involves learning a set of rules by incrementally applying the model in a dataset. Finally, IMLIB and IMLI are compared using diverse databases. IMLIB obtained results comparable to IMLI in terms of accuracy, generating more balanced rules with smaller sizes.</description>

      <title>Chase Termination Beyond Polynomial Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The chase is a widely implemented approach to reason with tuple-generating dependencies (tgds), used in data exchange, data integration, and ontology-based query answering. However, it is merely a semi-decision procedure, which may fail to terminate. Many decidable conditions have been proposed for tgds to ensure chase termination, typically by forbidding some kind of "cycle" in the chase process. We propose a new criterion that explicitly allows some such cycles, and yet ensures termination of the standard chase under reasonable conditions. This leads to new decidable fragments of tgds that are not only syntactically more general but also strictly more expressive than the fragments defined by prior acyclicity conditions. Indeed, while known terminating fragments are restricted to PTime data complexity, our conditions yield decidable languages for any k-ExpTime. We further refine our syntactic conditions to obtain fragments of tgds for which an optimised chase procedure decides query entailment in PSpace or k-ExpSpace, respectively.</description>

      <title>Learning Concepts Definable in First-Order Logic with Counting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.03820</link>
      <description>arXiv:1909.03820v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study Boolean classification problems over relational background structures in the logical framework introduced by Grohe and Tur\'an (TOCS 2004). It is known (Grohe and Ritzert, LICS 2017) that classifiers definable in first-order logic over structures of polylogarithmic degree can be learned in sublinear time, where the degree of the structure and the running time are measured in terms of the size of the structure. We generalise the results to the first-order logic with counting FOCN, which was introduced by Kuske and Schweikardt (LICS 2017) as an expressive logic generalising various other counting logics. Specifically, we prove that classifiers definable in FOCN over classes of structures of polylogarithmic degree can be consistently learned in sublinear time. This can be seen as a first step towards extending the learning framework to include numerical aspects of machine learning. We extend the result to agnostic probably approximately correct (PAC) learning for classes of structures of degree at most $(\log \log n)^c$ for some constant $c$. Moreover, we show that bounding the degree is crucial to obtain sublinear-time learning algorithms. That is, we prove that, for structures of unbounded degree, learning is not possible in sublinear time, even for classifiers definable in plain first-order logic.</description>

      <title>Dual Box Embeddings for the Description Logic EL++</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.11118v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: OWL ontologies, whose formal semantics are rooted in Description Logic (DL), have been widely used for knowledge representation. Similar to Knowledge Graphs (KGs), ontologies are often incomplete, and maintaining and constructing them has proved challenging. While classical deductive reasoning algorithms use the precise formal semantics of an ontology to predict missing facts, recent years have witnessed growing interest in inductive reasoning techniques that can derive probable facts from an ontology. Similar to KGs, a promising approach is to learn ontology embeddings in a latent vector space, while additionally ensuring they adhere to the semantics of the underlying DL. While a variety of approaches have been proposed, current ontology embedding methods suffer from several shortcomings, especially that they all fail to faithfully model one-to-many, many-to-one, and many-to-many relations and role inclusion axioms. To address this problem and improve ontology completion performance, we propose a novel ontology embedding method named Box$^2$EL for the DL EL++, which represents both concepts and roles as boxes (i.e., axis-aligned hyperrectangles), and models inter-concept relationships using a bumping mechanism. We theoretically prove the soundness of Box$^2$EL and conduct an extensive experimental evaluation, achieving state-of-the-art results across a variety of datasets on the tasks of subsumption prediction, role assertion prediction, and approximating deductive reasoning.</description>

      <title>Flip-width: Cops and Robber on dense graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.00352v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define new graph parameters, called flip-width, that generalize treewidth, degeneracy, and generalized coloring numbers for sparse graphs, and clique-width and twin-width for dense graphs. The flip-width parameters are defined using variants of the Cops and Robber game, in which the robber has speed bounded by a fixed constant $r\in\mathbb N\cup\{\infty\}$, and the cops perform flips (or perturbations) of the considered graph. We then propose a new notion of tameness of a graph class, called bounded flip-width, which is a dense counterpart of classes of bounded expansion of Ne\v{s}etril and Ossona de Mendez, and includes classes of bounded twin-width of Bonnet, Kim, Thomass{\'e}, and Watrigant. This unifies Sparsity Theory and Twin-width Theory, providing a common language for studying the central notions of the two theories, such as weak coloring numbers and twin-width -- corresponding to winning strategies of one player -- or dense shallow minors, rich divisions, or well-linked sets, corresponding to winning strategies of the other player. We prove that boundedness of flip-width is preserved by first-order interpretations, or transductions, generalizing previous results concerning classes of bounded expansion and bounded twin-width. We provide an algorithm approximating the flip-width of a given graph, which runs in slicewise polynomial time (XP) in the size of the graph. Finally, we propose a more general notion of tameness, called almost bounded flip-width, which is a dense counterpart of nowhere dense classes. We conjecture, and provide evidence, that classes with almost bounded flip-width coincide with monadically dependent (or monadically NIP) classes, introduced by Shelah in model theory. We also provide evidence that classes of almost bounded flip-width characterise the hereditary graph classes for which the model-checking problem is fixed-parameter tractable.</description>

Abstract: The demonstrated code-understanding capability of LLMs raises the question of whether they can be used for automated program verification, a task that demands high-level abstract reasoning about program properties that is challenging for verification tools. We propose a general methodology to combine the power of LLMs and automated reasoners for automated program verification. We formally describe this methodology as a set of derivation rules and prove its soundness. We instantiate the calculus as a sound automated verification procedure, which led to practical improvements on a set of synthetic and competition benchmarks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.14347v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a type-theoretic framework for describing and proving properties of quantum computations, in particular those presented as quantum circuits. Our proposal is based on an observation that, in the polymorphic type system of Coq, currying on quantum states allows us to apply quantum gates directly inside a complex circuit. By introducing a discrete notion of lens to control this currying, we are further able to separate the combinatorics of the circuit structure from the computational content of gates. We apply our development to define quantum circuits recursively from the bottom up, and prove their correctness compositionally.</description>

Abstract: This paper discusses the development of synthetic cohomology in Homotopy Type Theory (HoTT), as well as its computer formalisation. The objectives of this paper are (1) to generalise previous work on integral cohomology in HoTT by the current authors and Brunerie (2022) to cohomology with arbitrary coefficients and (2) to provide the mathematical details of, as well as extend, results underpinning the computer formalisation of cohomology rings by the current authors and Lamiaux (2023). With respect to objective (1), we provide new direct definitions of the cohomology group operations and of the cup product, which, just as in (Brunerie et al., 2022), enable significant simplifications of many earlier proofs in synthetic cohomology theory. In particular, the new definition of the cup product allows us to give the first complete formalisation of the axioms needed to turn the cohomology groups into a graded commutative ring. We also establish that this cohomology theory satisfies the HoTT formulation of the Eilenberg-Steenrod axioms for cohomology and study the classical Mayer-Vietoris and Gysin sequences. With respect to objective (2), we characterise the cohomology groups and rings of various spaces, including the spheres, torus, Klein bottle, real/complex projective planes, and infinite real projective space. All results have been formalised in Cubical Agda and we obtain multiple new numbers, similar to the famous `Brunerie number', which can be used as benchmarks for computational implementations of HoTT. Some of these numbers are infeasible to compute in Cubical Agda and hence provide new computational challenges and open problems which are much easier to define than the original Brunerie number.</description>

      <title>Forcing with Language Fragments, Extending Namba Forcing, and Models of Theories with Constraints in Interpretation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01213v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a forcing framework based on the idea of amalgamating language fragments into a theory with a canonical Henkin model. We then demonstrate the usefulness of this framework by applying it to both the extended Namba problem and the analysis of models of certain theories with constraints in interpretation (TCIs). The foundations for a theory of TCIs and their models are laid in parallel to the development of our framework, and are of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Free Doubly-Infinitary Distributive Categories are Cartesian Closed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10447v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We delve into the concept of categories with products that distribute over coproducts, which we call doubly-infinitary distributive categories. We show various instances of doubly-infinitary distributive categories aiming for a comparative analysis with established notions such as extensivity, infinitary distributiveness, and cartesian closedness. Our exploration reveals that this condition represents a substantial extension beyond the classical understanding of infinitary distributive categories. Our main theorem establishes that free doubly-infinitary distributive categories are cartesian closed. We end the paper with remarks on non-canonical isomorphisms, open questions, and future work.</description>

      <title>Modal logic, fundamentally</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14043v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-classical generalizations of classical modal logic have been developed in the contexts of constructive mathematics and natural language semantics. In this paper, we discuss a general approach to the semantics of non-classical modal logics via algebraic representation theorems. We begin with complete lattices $L$ equipped with an antitone operation $\neg$ sending $1$ to $0$, a completely multiplicative operation $\Box$, and a completely additive operation $\Diamond$. Such lattice expansions can be represented by means of a set $X$ together with binary relations $\vartriangleleft$, $R$, and $Q$, satisfying some first-order conditions, used to represent $(L,\neg)$, $\Box$, and $\Diamond$, respectively. Indeed, any lattice $L$ equipped with such a $\neg$, a multiplicative $\Box$, and an additive $\Diamond$ embeds into the lattice of propositions of a frame $(X,\vartriangleleft,R,Q)$. Building on our recent study of "fundamental logic", we focus on the case where $\neg$ is dually self-adjoint ($a\leq \neg b$ implies $b\leq\neg a$) and $\Diamond \neg a\leq\neg\Box a$. In this case, the representations can be constrained so that $R=Q$, i.e., we need only add a single relation to $(X,\vartriangleleft)$ to represent both $\Box$ and $\Diamond$. Using these results, we prove that a system of fundamental modal logic is sound and complete with respect to an elementary class of bi-relational structures $(X,\vartriangleleft, R)$.</description>
