      <title>AMACA: Astronomy education with a Multi-sensory, Accessible, and Circular Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The AMACA project (Astronomy education with a Multi-sensory, Accessible, and Circular Approach) develops multi-sensory activities for accessible education and engagement in astronomy. Despite promising innovations, existing resources are often poorly documented, designed for one-time events, expensive, and lack interdisciplinary collaboration, user testing, and broad dissemination. AMACA addresses these challenges by creating multi-sensory activities for education and outreach, with a particular focus on accessibility for people with sensory disabilities. A circular approach informs its educational structure: (1) a PhD course on multi-sensory astronomy outreach develops hands-on activities with the support of astronomers, psychologists, and organizations for the visually impaired and the deaf; (2) PhD candidates teach High School (HS) students how to deliver the activities; (3) HS students lead the activities at the Astronomy Festival "The Universe in All Senses"; (4) HS students train teachers to implement the activities in their classrooms. AMACA also develops tools to guide project development and track participants' learning. Key findings show improved communication and accessibility awareness among PhD candidates, increased emotional engagement with astronomy among HS students, enhanced public engagement with research and accessibility awareness, and high teacher satisfaction with the flipped-roles, hands-on approach. Overall, AMACA enhances accessibility and engagement in astronomy education across audiences.</description>

      <title>It's Not The Plane -- It's The Pilot: A Framework for Cognitive-Activated AI-Augmentation to Avoid the Boiling Frog Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13812v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (AI) systems can now reliably solve many standard tasks used in introductory physics courses, producing correct equations, graphs, and explanations. While this capability is often framed as an opportunity for efficiency or personalization, it also poses a subtle ethical and educational risk: students may increasingly submit correct results without engaging in the epistemic practices that define learning physics.This challenge has recently been described as the "boiling frog problem" because we may not fully recognize how rapidly AI capabilities are advancing and fail to respond with commensurate urgency. In this article, we argue that the central challenge of AI in physics education is not cheating or tool selection, but instructional design. Drawing on research on self-regulated learning, cognitive load, multiple representations, and hybrid intelligence, we propose a practical framework for cognitively activated learning activities that structures student activities before, during, and after AI use. Using an example from an introductory kinematics laboratory, we show how AI can be integrated in ways that preserve prediction, interpretation, and evaluation as core learning activities. Rather than treating AI as an answer-generating tool, the framework positions AI as an epistemic partner whose contributions are deliberately bounded and reflected upon.</description>

      <title>The physics of cranberry bogs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The common New England sight of a cranberry bog presents a rich tapestry of fluid dynamics and soft matter phenomena. Here, we present four connected problems exploring the behavior of cranberries in their stages of harvest: the buoyant rise of a cranberry in a flooded bog, the stable floating configuration of a cranberry on the surface, the aggregation and interaction between many floating cranberries collected with a boom, and the piling of cranberries onto a truck for transportation. We model these phenomena from first principles and develop simple computational simulations of their collective behaviors. Additionally, we describe tabletop experiments to accompany these problems, either as in-class demonstrations or lab activities. Throughout, we draw connections to broader physical principles in soft condensed matter and fluids, allowing the real-world example of the cranberry bog to serve as a bridge between the undergraduate curriculum and topics in soft matter research.</description>

      <title>sangkuriang: A pseudo-spectral Python library for Korteweg-de Vries soliton simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation serves as a foundational model in nonlinear wave physics, describing the balance between dispersive spreading and nonlinear steepening that gives rise to solitons. This article introduces sangkuriang, an open-source Python library for solving this equation using Fourier pseudo-spectral spatial discretization coupled with adaptive high-order time integration. The implementation leverages just-in-time (JIT) compilation for computational efficiency while maintaining accessibility for instructional purposes. Validation encompasses progressively complex scenarios including isolated soliton propagation, symmetric two-wave configurations, overtaking collisions between waves of differing amplitudes, and three-body interactions. Conservation of the classical invariants is monitored throughout, with deviations remaining small across all test cases. Measured soliton velocities conform closely to theoretical predictions based on the amplitude-velocity relationship characteristic of integrable systems. Complementary diagnostics drawn from information theory and recurrence analysis confirm that computed solutions preserve the regular phase-space structure expected for completely integrable dynamics. The solver outputs data in standard scientific formats compatible with common analysis tools and generates visualizations of spatiotemporal wave evolution. By combining numerical accuracy with practical accessibility on modest computational resources, sangkuriang offers a platform suitable for both classroom demonstrations of nonlinear wave phenomena and exploratory research into soliton dynamics.</description>

      <title>Graduate education in optics in Japan and the United States: impact of funding levels on educational structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08933v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compare the optical science &amp; engineering graduate-level educational environments at two universities in two countries: Utsunomiya University in Japan, and the University of Arizona in the United States. Because the university education systems in the two countries are so different, we also explain how financial resources drive many of these differences and discuss how these impact student and faculty life.</description>
