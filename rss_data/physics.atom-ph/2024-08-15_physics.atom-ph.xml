      <title>Spectrum and energy levels of the high-lying singly excited configurations of Nd III</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fourier transform spectra of Nd Penning and hollow cathode discharge lamps were recorded within the region 32,500-54,000 cm$^{-1}$ (3077-1852 {\AA}) and grating spectra of Nd vacuum sliding sparks were recorded within the regions 820-1159 {\AA} and 1600-3250 {\AA}. New energy levels were found using the observed wavelengths measured accurate to a few parts in $10^8$ in Fourier transform spectra and to a few parts in $10^7$ in grating spectra. Atomic structure and transition probability calculations of Nd III were made using the Cowan codes by adjusting energy parameters to fit all known Nd III levels. Nd-rich stellar spectra were also used to evaluate the new calculations. In total, 355 transitions were classified from observed spectra involving 116 previously experimentally unknown energy levels of the 4f$^3$7s, 4f$^3$6d, and 4f$^3$5f configurations of Nd III, all reported here for the first time. One newly identified level of the 4f$^3$5d configuration is also reported. Typical level energy uncertainties are 0.01 cm$^{-1}$ for the 4f$^3$7s and 4f$^3$6d levels and 0.3 cm$^{-1}$ for the 4f$^3$5f levels. In addition, calculated energy levels up to 130,936 cm$^{-1}$ are presented, including eigenvector composition and calculated level lifetimes. Calculated transition probabilities and wavelengths between 1900-50,000 {\AA} are also presented. Using newly established levels of the 4f$^3$7s configuration and the recently established levels of the 4f$^3$6s configuration, the ionisation energy of Nd III was estimated at $178,090\pm330$ cm$^{-1}$, doubling the accuracy of the previously published value.</description>

      <title>Laboratory confirmation and improved Accuracy of 4f and 5d energy levels of Fe II previously identified from stellar spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many energy levels of singly ionised iron (Fe II, $Z=26$) remain uncertain or experimentally unknown. Their identification and spectral line data are required in reliable astrophysical spectral analyses. In motivation for improving the atomic data of Fe II, we analysed emission spectra of a Fe-Ne plasma produced by a Penning discharge lamp recorded by high-resolution Fourier transform spectroscopy in the region 9000-27,000 cm$^{-1}$ (11,111-3704 {\AA}). Semi-empirical transition probability calculations and stellar spectra of Fe II were used to guide the analysis. In total, 24 energy levels of the 3d$^6$4f and 3d$^6$5d configurations of Fe II lying between 122,351-127,881 cm$^{-1}$ were confirmed in the laboratory for the first time, in agreement with their identities proposed by previous investigations involving only stellar spectra. Level energy and wavelength uncertainties of the 24 levels are improved by up to an order-of-magnitude compared to previously published values. These results will enable more reliable application of Fe II in astrophysical spectroscopic analyses and support further investigations of the spectrum and energy levels of Fe II.</description>

      <title>Non-iterative triples for transcorrelated coupled cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an implementation of a perturbative triples correction for coupled cluster including single and double excitations based on the transcorrelated Hamiltonian. Transcorrelation introduces explicit electron correlation in the electronic Hamiltonian through similarity transformation with a correlation factor. Due to this transformation, the transcorrelated Hamiltonian includes up to three-body couplings and becomes non-hermitian. Since conventional coupled cluster is solved by projection, it is well suited to harbor non-hermitian Hamiltonians. The arising three-body operator, however, creates a huge memory bottleneck and increases the runtime scaling of the coupled cluster equations. As it has been shown that the three-body operator can be approximated, by expressing the Hamiltonian in the normal-ordered form, we investigate this approximation for the perturbative triples correction. Results are compared with code-generation based transcorrelated coupled cluster up to quadruple excitations.</description>

      <title>Low Thermal Resistance of Diamond-AlGaN Interfaces Achieved Using Carbide Interlayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates thermal transport across nanocrystalline diamond/AlGaN interfaces, crucial for enhancing thermal management in AlGaN/AlGaN-based devices. Chemical vapor deposition growth of diamond directly on AlGaN resulted in a disordered interface with a high thermal boundary resistance (TBR) of 20.6 m^2-K/GW. We employed sputtered carbide interlayers (e.g., $B_4C$, $SiC$, $B_4C/SiC$) to reduce thermal boundary resistance in diamond/AlGaN interfaces. The carbide interlayers resulted in record-low thermal boundary resistance values of 3.4 and 3.7 m^2-K/GW for Al$_{0.65}$Ga$_{0.35}$N samples with $B_4C$ and $SiC$ interlayers, respectively. STEM imaging of the interface reveals interlayer thicknesses between 1.7-2.5 nm, with an amorphous structure. Additionally, Fast-Fourier Transform (FFT) characterization of sections of the STEM images displayed sharp crystalline fringes in the AlGaN layer, confirming it was properly protected from damage from hydrogen plasma during the diamond growth. In order to accurately measure the thermal boundary resistance we develop a hybrid technique, combining time-domain thermoreflectance and steady-state thermoreflectance fitting, offering superior sensitivity to buried thermal resistances. Our findings underscore the efficacy of interlayer engineering in enhancing thermal transport and demonstrate the importance of innovative measurement techniques in accurately characterizing complex thermal interfaces. This study provides a foundation for future research in improving thermal properties of semiconductor devices through interface engineering and advanced measurement methodologies.</description>

      <title>A universal neutral-atom quantum computer with individual optical addressing and non-destructive readout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computers must achieve large-scale, fault-tolerant operation to deliver on their promise of transformational processing power [1-4]. This will require thousands or millions of high-fidelity quantum gates and similar numbers of qubits [5]. Demonstrations using neutral-atom qubits trapped and manipulated by lasers have shown that this modality can provide high two-qubit gate (CZ) fidelities and scalable operation [6-10]. However, the gates in these demonstrations are driven by lasers that do not resolve individual qubits, with universal computation enabled by physical mid-circuit shuttling of the qubits. This relatively slow operation will greatly extend runtimes for useful, large-scale computation. Here we demonstrate a universal neutral-atom quantum computer with gate rates limited by optical switching times, rather than shuttling, by individually addressing tightly focused laser beams at an array of single atoms. We achieve CZ fidelity of 99.35(4)% and local single qubit RZ gate fidelity of 99.902(8)%. Moreover, we demonstrate non-destructive readout of alkali-atom qubits with sub-percent loss, which boosts operational speed. This technique also enables us to measure 99.73(3)% CZ fidelity with atom-loss events excluded, which is a record among long lived neutral-atom qubits and highlights the path to higher fidelity and error correction. Our results represent a critical step towards large-scale, fault-tolerant neutral-atom quantum computers that can execute computations on practical timescales.</description>
