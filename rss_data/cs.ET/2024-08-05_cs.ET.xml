      <title>Vertiport Terminal Scheduling with Multiple Surface Directions along with Throughput Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) vehicles have gained immense popularity in the delivery drone market and are now being developed for passenger transportation in urban areas to efficiently enable Urban Air Mobility (UAM). UAM aims to utilize the urban airspace \hidetxt{vertical dimension} to address the problem of heavy road congestion in dense urban cities. VTOL vehicles require vertiport terminals for landing, take-off, passengers boarding or deboarding, refuelling (or charging), and maintenance. An efficient scheduling algorithm is essential to maximize the throughput of the vertiport terminal (vertiminal)\hidetxt{ as well as efficient use of airspace} while maintaining safety protocols to handle the UAM traffic. While traditional departure and taxiing operations can be applied in the context of vertiminal, specific algorithms are required for take-off and landing schedules. Unlike fixed-wing aircraft that require a runway to take-off and climb in a single direction, VTOL vehicles can approach and climb in several directions. We propose a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP) formulation to schedule flights for taxiing, climbing (or approaching) using multiple directions after take-off (before landing) and turnaround on gates. We also derived equations to thoroughly analyze the throughput capacity of a vertiminal considering all its core elements. We have shown that our MILP can achieve the maximum throughput obtained through the equations. Given the input parameters, our analysis can be used to analyze the capacity of a vertiminal without running any simulation, while our MILP can be used to get the most efficient schedule.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Routing in Quantum Networks: A Comprehensive Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement routing in near-term quantum networks consists of choosing the optimal sequence of short-range entanglements to combine through swapping operations to establish end-to-end entanglement between two distant nodes. Similar to traditional routing technologies, a quantum routing protocol uses network information to choose the best paths to satisfy a set of end-to-end entanglement requests. However, in addition to network state information, a quantum routing protocol must also take into account the requested entanglement fidelity, the probabilistic nature of swapping operations, and the short lifetime of entangled states. In this work, we formulate a practical entanglement routing problem and analyze and categorize the main approaches to address it, drawing comparisons to, and inspiration from, classical network routing strategies where applicable. We classify and discuss the studied quantum routing schemes into reactive, proactive, opportunistic, and virtual routing</description>

      <title>Learning Structurally Stabilized Representations for Multi-modal Lossless DNA Storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present Reed-Solomon coded single-stranded representation learning (RSRL), a novel end-to-end model for learning representations for multi-modal lossless DNA storage. In contrast to existing learning-based methods, the proposed RSRL is inspired by both error-correction codec and structural biology. Specifically, RSRL first learns the representations for the subsequent storage from the binary data transformed by the Reed-Solomon codec. Then, the representations are masked by an RS-code-informed mask to focus on correcting the burst errors occurring in the learning process. With the decoded representations with error corrections, a novel biologically stabilized loss is formulated to regularize the data representations to possess stable single-stranded structures. By incorporating these novel strategies, the proposed RSRL can learn highly durable, dense, and lossless representations for the subsequent storage tasks into DNA sequences. The proposed RSRL has been compared with a number of strong baselines in real-world tasks of multi-modal data storage. The experimental results obtained demonstrate that RSRL can store diverse types of data with much higher information density and durability but much lower error rates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The facilitation of STEM education can be enhanced by the provision of opportunities for learners to gain a better understanding of science through the utilization of tangible and visual examples. The objective of this work is to present an account of our experiences and activities carried out in Italian schools with this novel approach. The selection of projects and experiences discussed --in which students develop a range of core competencies such as collaboration, creativity, critical thinking, experimentation, prototyping, communication and problem-solving; include tangible complex 3D printed structures, large micro-controller board replicas and the visualization of wind dynamics and tiny invisible elementary particles among others. These hands-on experiences demonstrate the benefits on the use of digital fabrication technologies implemented within a FabLab for STEM learning.</description>

      <title>Design and Implementation of ARA Wireless Living Lab for Rural Broadband and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To address the rural broadband challenge and to leverage the unique opportunities that rural regions provide for piloting advanced wireless applications, we design and implement the ARA wireless living lab for research and innovation in rural wireless systems and their applications in precision agriculture, community services, and so on. ARA focuses on the unique community, application, and economic context of rural regions, and it features the first-of-its-kind, real-world deployment of long-distance, high-capacity wireless x-haul and access platforms across a rural area of diameter over 30 km. With both software-defined radios and programmable COTS systems and through effective orchestration of these wireless resources with fiber as well as compute resources embedded end-to-end across user equipment, base stations, edge, and cloud, ARA offers programmability, performance, robustness, and heterogeneity at the same time, thus enabling rural-focused co-evolution of wireless and applications while helping advance the frontiers of wireless systems in domains such as O-RAN, NextG, and agriculture applications. Here we present the design principles and implementation strategies of ARA, characterize its performance and heterogeneity, and highlight example wireless and application experiments uniquely enabled by ARA.</description>

      <title>Extracting Object Heights From LiDAR &amp; Aerial Imagery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work shows a procedural method for extracting object heights from LiDAR and aerial imagery. We discuss how to get heights and the future of LiDAR and imagery processing. SOTA object segmentation allows us to take get object heights with no deep learning background. Engineers will be keeping track of world data across generations and reprocessing them. They will be using older procedural methods like this paper and newer ones discussed here. SOTA methods are going beyond analysis and into generative AI. We cover both a procedural methodology and the newer ones performed with language models. These include point cloud, imagery and text encoding allowing for spatially aware AI.</description>

      <title>Rubric-based Learner Modelling via Noisy Gates Bayesian Networks for Computational Thinking Skills Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In modern and personalised education, there is a growing interest in developing learners' competencies and accurately assessing them. In a previous work, we proposed a procedure for deriving a learner model for automatic skill assessment from a task-specific competence rubric, thus simplifying the implementation of automated assessment tools. The previous approach, however, suffered two main limitations: (i) the ordering between competencies defined by the assessment rubric was only indirectly modelled; (ii) supplementary skills, not under assessment but necessary for accomplishing the task, were not included in the model. In this work, we address issue (i) by introducing dummy observed nodes, strictly enforcing the skills ordering without changing the network's structure. In contrast, for point (ii), we design a network with two layers of gates, one performing disjunctive operations by noisy-OR gates and the other conjunctive operations through logical ANDs. Such changes improve the model outcomes' coherence and the modelling tool's flexibility without compromising the model's compact parametrisation, interpretability and simple experts' elicitation. We used this approach to develop a learner model for Computational Thinking (CT) skills assessment. The CT-cube skills assessment framework and the Cross Array Task (CAT) are used to exemplify it and demonstrate its feasibility.</description>

      <title>Tailoring Graph Neural Network-based Flow-guided Localization to Individual Bloodstreams and Activities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flow-guided localization using in-body nanodevices in the bloodstream is expected to be beneficial for early disease detection, continuous monitoring of biological conditions, and targeted treatment. The nanodevices face size and power constraints that produce erroneous raw data for localization purposes. On-body anchors receive this data, and use it to derive the locations of diagnostic events of interest. Different Machine Learning (ML) approaches have been recently proposed for this task, yet they are currently restricted to a reference bloodstream of a resting patient. As such, they are unable to deal with the physical diversity of patients' bloodstreams and cannot provide continuous monitoring due to changes in individual patient's activities. Toward addressing these issues for the current State-of-the-Art (SotA) flow-guided localization approach based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), we propose a pipeline for GNN adaptation based on individual physiological indicators including height, weight, and heart rate. Our results indicate that the proposed adaptions are beneficial in reconciling the individual differences between bloodstreams and activities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper aims to give readers a high-level overview of the different MCX depth reduction techniques that utilize ancilla qubits. We also exhibit a brief analysis of how they would perform under different quantum topological settings. The techniques examined are recursion and v-chain, as they are the most commonly used techniques in the most popular quantum computing libraries, Qiskit. The target audience of this paper is people who do not have intricate mathematical or physics knowledge related to quantum computing.</description>

      <title>How Ethical Should AI Be? How AI Alignment Shapes the Risk Preferences of LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01168v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study examines the risk preferences of Large Language Models (LLMs) and how aligning them with human ethical standards affects their economic decision-making. Analyzing 30 LLMs reveals a range of inherent risk profiles, from risk-averse to risk-seeking. We find that aligning LLMs with human values, focusing on harmlessness, helpfulness, and honesty, shifts them towards risk aversion. While some alignment improves investment forecast accuracy, excessive alignment leads to overly cautious predictions, potentially resulting in severe underinvestment. Our findings highlight the need for a nuanced approach that balances ethical alignment with the specific requirements of economic domains when using LLMs in finance.</description>

      <title>Identifying Bottlenecks of NISQ-friendly HHL algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06288v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing promises enabling solving large problem instances, e.g. large linear equation systems with HHL algorithm, once the hardware stack matures. For the foreseeable future quantum computing will remain in the so-called NISQ era, in which the algorithms need to account for the flaws of the hardware such as noise. In this work, we perform an empirical study to test scaling properties and directly related noise resilience of the the most resources-intense component of the HHL algorithm, namely QPE and its NISQ-adaptation Iterative QPE. We explore the effectiveness of noise mitigation techniques for these algorithms and investigate whether we can keep the gate number low by enforcing sparsity constraints on the input or using circuit optimization techniques provided by Qiskit package. Our results indicate that currently available noise mitigation techniques, such as Qiskit readout and Mthree readout packages, are insufficient for enabling results recovery even in the small instances tested here. Moreover, our results indicate that the scaling of these algorithms with increase in precision seems to be the most substantial obstacle. These insights allowed us to deduce an approximate bottleneck for algorithms that consider a similar time evolution as QPE. Such observations provide evidence of weaknesses of such algorithms on NISQ devices and help us formulate meaningful future research directions.</description>
