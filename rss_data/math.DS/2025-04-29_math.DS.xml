      <title>Genericity of ergodicity for Sobolev homeomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we obtain a weak version of Lusin's theorem in the Sobolev-$(1,p)$ uniform closure of volume preserving Lipschitz homeomorphisms on closed and connected $d$-dimensional manifolds, $d \geq 2$ and $0&lt;p&lt;1$. With this result at hand we will be able to prove that the ergodic elements are generic. This establishes a version of Oxtoby and Ulam theorem for this Sobolev class. We also prove that, for $1\leq p&lt;d-1$, the topological transitive maps are generic.</description>

      <title>Lemon limbs of the cubic connectedness locus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe a primary limb structure in the connectedness locus of complex cubic polynomials, where the limbs are indexed by the periodic points of the doubling map $t \mapsto 2t \ (\operatorname{mod} {\mathbb Z})$. The main renormalization locus in each limb is parametrized by the product of a pair of (punctured) Mandelbrot sets. This parametrization is the inverse of the straightening map and can be thought of as a tuning operation that manufactures a unique cubic of a given combinatorics from a pair of quadratic hybrid classes.</description>

      <title>Existence and Finiteness of equilibrium states for some Partially hyperbolic endomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the existence and finiteness of equilibrium states for a class of partially hyperbolic endomorphisms. In our first result, we assume that the central direction is simple. In the second result, we consider the case where there exists a dominated splitting along the central direction, which is decomposed into one-dimensional subbundles. This latter result extends the work of C. Alvarez and M. Cantarino \cite{alvarez2022existence} to higher-dimensional central directions. Finally, we demonstrate the finiteness of measures of maximal entropy under the assumption that the central direction is one-dimensional and the integrated Lyapunov exponent is bounded away from zero.</description>

      <title>Dynamical decomposition of generalized interval exchange transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a renormalization scheme which extends the classical Rauzy-Veech induction used to study interval exchange tranformations (IETs) and allows to study generalized interval exchange transformations (GIETs) $T: [0,1) \to [0,1)$ with possibly more than one quasiminimal component (i.e. not infinite-complete, or, equivalently, not semi-conjugated to a minimal IET). The renormalization is defined for more general maps that we call interval exchange transformations with gaps (g-GIETs), namely partially defined GIETs which appear naturally as the first return map of $C^r$-flows on two-dimensional manifolds to any transversal segment. We exploit this renormalization scheme to find a decomposition of $[0,1)$ into finite unions of intervals which either contain no recurrent orbits, or contain only recurrent orbits which are closed, or contain a unique quasiminimal. This provides an alternative approach to the decomposition results for foliations and flows on surfaces by Levitt, Gutierrez and Gardiner from the $1980s$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the seventies', Zehnder found a Nash-Moser type implicit function theorem in the analytic set-up. This theorem has found many applications in dynamical systems although its applications require, as a general rule, some efforts. We develop further the analytic theory and give fixed point theorems with direct applications to the study of dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Multiple Polynomial Recurrence in Weyl Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we give a full characterization of sets of multiple polynomial recurrence in Weyl systems, which are ergodic unipotent affine transformations on products of tori and finite abelian groups. In particular, we show that measurable and topological recurrence in Weyl systems coincide. Our analysis also yields a structure theorem for polynomial multicorrelation sequences in Weyl systems. These results stem from an in-depth study of the Weyl complexity of a set of polynomials and the introduction of a new concept: the \textit{Weyl polynomials} generated by a set of polynomials.</description>

      <title>Rigorous lower bounds for the domains of definition of extended generating functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recently developed theory of extended generating functions of symplectic maps are combined with methods to prove invertibility via high-order Taylor model methods to obtain rigorous lower bounds for the domains of definition of generating functions. The examples presented suggest that there are considerable differences in the size of the domains of definition of the various types of generating functions studied. Furthermore, the types of generating functions for which, in general, large domains of definitions can be guarantied were identified. The resulting domain sizes of these generators are usually sufficiently large to be useful in practice, for example for the long-term simulations of accelerator and other Hamiltonian system dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a cohomological criterion for certain decomposition of Borel graphs, which is an analog of Dunwoody's work on accessibility of groups. As an application, we prove that a Borel graph $(X,G)$ with uniformly bounded degrees of cohomological dimension one is Lipschitz equivalent to a Borel acyclic graph on $X$. This gives a new proof of a result of Chen-Poulin-Tao-Tserunyan on Borel graphs with components quasi-isometric to trees.</description>

      <title>Reeb orbits frequently intersecting a symplectic surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider a symplectic surface in a three-dimensional contact manifold with boundary on Reeb orbits (periodic orbits of the Reeb vector field). We assume that the rotation numbers of the boundary Reeb orbits satisfy a certain inequality, and we also make a technical assumption that the Reeb vector field has a particular ``nice'' form near the boundary of the surface. We then show that there exist Reeb orbits which intersect the interior of the surface, with a lower bound on the frequency of these intersections in terms of the symplectic area of the surface and the contact volume of the three-manifold. No genericity of the contact form is assumed. As a corollary of the main result, we obtain a generalization of various recent results relating the mean action of periodic orbits to the Calabi invariant for area-preserving surface diffeomorphisms.</description>

      <title>Sliding motions on systems with non-Euclidean state spaces: A differential-geometric perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper extends sliding-mode control theory to nonlinear systems evolving on smooth manifolds. Building on differential geometric methods, we reformulate Filippov's notion of solutions, characterize well-defined vector fields on quotient spaces, and provide a consistent geometric definition of higher-order sliding modes. We generalize the regular form to non-Euclidean settings and design explicit first- and second-order sliding-mode controllers that respect the manifold structure. Particular attention is given to the role of topological obstructions, which are illustrated through examples on the cylinder, M\"obius bundle, and 2-sphere. Our results highlight how geometric and topological properties fundamentally influence sliding dynamics and suggest new directions for robust control in nonlinear spaces.</description>

      <title>Boundary crisis and long transients of the Atlantic overturning circulation mediated by an edge state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), a large-scale ocean current and vital climate component, could transition to a substantially weakened flow state. Despite severe associated impacts, it remains difficult to reliably estimate the proximity to potential critical thresholds and predict the AMOC's fate under global warming. To advance our understanding of Earth system stability, a global view on the dynamics is needed beyond the local stability analysis underlying, e.g., standard early warning signs. Here we explore the phase space of an intermediate-complexity climate model featuring a metastable AMOC. For two atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO$_2$) levels, we explicitly compute the edge state (also called Melancholia state), a chaotic saddle embedded in the basin boundary that separates the strong and weak AMOC attractors found in the model. While being unstable, the edge state can govern the transient climate for centuries. Its dynamics exhibits strong centennial AMOC oscillations driven by atmosphere-ice-ocean interactions in the North Atlantic. We demonstrate that at CO$_2$ levels projected to be reached in the next decades, the simulated AMOC undergoes a boundary crisis where the current AMOC attractor collides with the edge state. Near but beyond the crisis, long chaotic transients occur due to a resulting ghost state, causing a splitting of ensemble trajectories under time-dependent forcing. Rooted in dynamical systems theory, our results offer an interpretation of large ensemble variances and a so-called stochastic bifurcation observed in earth system models under intermediate forcing scenarios.</description>

Abstract: In this article we address a well known problem at the intersection of ergodic theory and statistical mechanics.
  We prove that there exists a continuous eigenfunction for the transfer
  operator corresponding to pair potentials that satisfy a square summability
  condition on the variations, when the inverse temperature is subcritical. As a corollary we
  obtain a continuous eigenfunction for the classical Dyson model, with
  interactions $\J(k)=\beta \, k^{-\alpha}$, $k\ge1$, in the whole subcritical
  regime $\beta&lt;\beta_c$ for which the parameter $\alpha$ is greater than $3/2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03132v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate diffeomorphisms whose positiveness of topological entropy is destroyed by singular suspensions. We show that this phenomenon is rare in the set of $C^1$-diffeomorphisms. Precisely, we prove that for an open and dense set of $C^1$-diffeomorphism positive topological entropy is preserved by singular suspensions, even for suspensions with infinitely many singularities. We prove a similar result to the conservative diffeomorphisms. We apply our techniques to show that every expansive singular suspension $C^{1+\epsilon}$-flow over a three-dimensional manifold has positive topological entropy. Finally, we explore this phenomenon for Anosov dynamics, showing that to nullify the topological entropy for Anosov suspension flow, the set of singularities must capture the non-wandering set.</description>

Abstract: We study the $(k+1,k)$ diagonal map for $k=2,3,4,...$. We call this map $\Delta_k$. The map $\Delta_1$ is the pentagram map and $\Delta_k$ is a generalization. $\Delta_k$ does not preserve convexity, but we prove that $\Delta_k$ preserves a subset $B_k$ of certain star-shaped polygons which we call $k$-birds. The action of $\Delta_k$ on $B_k$ seems similar to the action of $\Delta_1$ on the space of convex polygons. We show that some classic geometric results about $\Delta_1$ generalize to this setting.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of a state-dependent delay-differential equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13092v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a detailed study of a scalar differential equation with threshold state-dependent delayed feedback. This equation arises as a simplification of a gene regulatory model. There are two monotone nonlinearities in the model: one describes the dependence of delay on state, and the other is the feedback nonlinearity. Both increasing and decreasing nonlinearities are considered. Our analysis is exhaustive both analytically and numerically as we examine the bifurcations of the system for various combinations of increasing and decreasing nonlinearities. We identify rich bifurcation patterns including Bautin, Bogdanov-Takens, cusp, fold, homoclinic, and Hopf bifurcations whose existence depend on the derivative signs of nonlinearities. Our analysis confirms many of these patterns in the limit where the nonlinearities are switch-like and change their value abruptly at a threshold. Perhaps one of the most surprising findings is the existence of a Hopf bifurcation to a periodic solution when the nonlinearity is monotone increasing and the time delay is a decreasing function of the state variable.</description>

      <title>Quantization for a condensation system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14344v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a given $r \in (0, +\infty)$, the quantization dimension of order $r$, if it exists, denoted by $D_r(\mu)$, represents the rate at which the $n$th quantization error of order $r$ approaches to zero as the number of elements $n$ in an optimal set of $n$-means for $\mu$ tends to infinity. If $D_r(\mu)$ does not exist, we define $\underline{D}_r(\mu)$ and $\overline{D}_r(\mu)$ as the lower and the upper quantization dimensions of $\mu$ of order $r$, respectively. In this paper, we investigate the quantization dimension of the condensation measure $\mu$ associated with a condensation system $(\{S_j\}_{j=1}^N, (p_j)_{j=0}^N, \nu).$ We provide two examples: one where $\nu$ is an infinite discrete distribution on $\mathbb{R}$, and one where $\nu$ is a uniform distribution on $\mathbb{R}$. For both the discrete and uniform distributions $\nu$, we determine the optimal sets of $n$-means, and calculate the quantization dimensions of condensation measures $\mu$, and show that the $D_r(\mu)$-dimensional quantization coefficients do not exist. Moreover, we demonstrate that the lower and upper quantization coefficients are finite and positive.</description>

Abstract: In the 1970s, Williams developed an algorithm that has been used to construct and study modular links in the Lorenz template. We introduce an improved algorithm, which we call the bunch algorithm, to provide more insights into the geometry of modular links and Lorenz links. Using the machinery developed for the bunch algorithm, we provide the first upper volume bound that is independent of word exponents and quadratic in the braid index of the Lorenz link component for all modular link complements. We find families of modular knot complements with upper volume bounds that are linear in the braid index. A classification of modular link complements based on the relative magnitudes of word exponents is also presented.</description>

      <title>Jordan and Cartan spectra in higher rank with applications to correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.16329v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a given $d$-tuple $\rho=(\rho_1,\dots,\rho_d):\Gamma \to G$ of faithful Zariski dense convex cocompact representations of a finitely generated group $\Gamma$, we study the correlations of length spectra $\{\ell_{\rho_i(\gamma)}\}_{[\gamma]\in[\Gamma]}$ and correlations of displacement spectra $\{\mathsf{d}(\rho_i(\gamma)o,o)\}_{\gamma\in\Gamma}$. We prove that for any interior vector $\mathsf v=(v_1,\dots,v_d)$ in the spectrum cone, there exists $\delta_\rho(\mathsf v) &gt; 0$ such that for any $\epsilon_1, \dots, \epsilon_d&gt;0$, there exist $c_1,c_2&gt; 0$ such that\begin{align*}&amp;\#\{[\gamma]\in [\Gamma]: v_iT \le \ell_{\rho_i(\gamma)} \le v_i T+\epsilon_i, \;1 \le i \le d\} \sim c_1 \frac{e^{\delta_\rho (\mathsf v)T}}{ T^{{(d+1)}/{2}}};\\&amp;\#\{\gamma\in \Gamma: v_iT \le \mathsf{d}(\rho_i(\gamma)o,o) \le v_i T+\epsilon_i, \;1 \le i \le d\} \sim c_2 \frac{e^{\delta_\rho (\mathsf v)T}}{ T^{{(d-1)}/{2}}}.\end{align*} The special case where $\Gamma$ is a surface group, $G=PSL_2(\mathbb R)$, and $\mathsf v=(1,1)$ was obtained by Schwarz and Sharp in 1993. We deduce this result as a special case of our main theorem on the distribution of Jordan projections with holonomies and Cartan projections in tubes of an Anosov subgroup $\Gamma$ of a semisimple real algebraic group $G$. We also show that the growth indicator of $\Gamma$ remains the same when we use Jordan projections instead of Cartan projections and tubes instead of cones.</description>

      <title>The volume of a divisor and cusp excursions of geodesics in hyperbolic manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01012v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a complete description of the behavior of the volume function at the boundary of the pseudoeffective cone of certain Calabi-Yau complete intersections known as Wehler N-folds. We find that the volume function exhibits a pathological behavior when N&gt;=3, we obtain examples of a pseudoeffective R-divisor D for which the volume of D+sA, with s small and A ample, oscillates between two powers of s, and we deduce the sharp regularity of this function answering a question of Lazarsfeld. We also show that h^0(X,[mD]+A) displays a similar oscillatory behavior as m increases, showing that several notions of numerical dimensions of D do not agree and disproving a conjecture of Fujino. We accomplish this by relating the behavior of the volume function along a segment to the visits of a corresponding hyperbolic geodesics to the cusps of a hyperbolic manifold.</description>

      <title>Chemotaxis-inspired PDE model for airborne infectious disease transmission: analysis and simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17506v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Partial differential equation (PDE) models for infectious disease have received renewed interest in recent years. Most models of this type extend classical compartmental formulations with additional terms accounting for spatial dynamics, with Fickian diffusion being the most common such term. However, while diffusion may be appropriate for modeling vector-borne diseases, or diseases among plants or wildlife, the spatial propagation of airborne diseases in human populations is heavily dependent on human contact and mobility patterns, which are not necessarily well-described by diffusion. By including an additional chemotaxis-inspired term, in which the infection is propagated along the positive gradient of the susceptible population (from regions of low- to high-density of susceptibles), one may provide a more suitable description of these dynamics. This article introduces and analyzes a mathematical model of infectious disease incorporating a modified chemotaxis-type term. The model is analyzed mathematically and the well-posedness of the resulting PDE system is demonstrated. A series of numerical simulations are provided, demonstrating the ability of the model to naturally capture important phenomena not easily observed in standard diffusion models, including propagation over long spatial distances over short time scales and the emergence of localized infection hotspots</description>

      <title>Quantum Algorithms for Optimizing Mycorrhizal Inoculants Using Mycoponics: A Novel Framework for Nutrient Transfer and Protein Discovery in Precision Agriculture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18149v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mycorrhizal fungi form vast subterranean networks that are critical for plant nutrient uptake, carbon sequestration, and ecosystem resilience. Despite their ecological importance, optimizing these networks for precision agriculture, forestry,and carbon sequestration remains an open challenge, particularly when it comes to understanding the complex molecular and quantum-scale processes that govern nutrient exchange. In this paper, we propose a novel experimental framework using mycoponics, a controlled, soil-less environment for the study of plant fungal symbiosis integrated with isotopic labeling and quantum dots to track real-time nutrient transfer.</description>

      <title>Robust high-order low-rank BUG integrators based on explicit Runge-Kutta methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07040v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose high-order basis-update &amp; Galerkin (BUG) integrators based on explicit Runge-Kutta methods for large-scale matrix differential equations. These dynamical low-rank integrators are high-order extensions of the BUG integrator and are constructed by performing a BUG step at each stage of the Runge-Kutta method. In this way, the resulting Runge-Kutta BUG integrator is robust to the presence of small singular values and does not involve backward time-integration steps. We provide an error bound, which shows that the Runge-Kutta BUG integrator retains the order of convergence of the associated Runge-Kutta method until the error reaches a plateau corresponding to the low-rank truncation error and which vanishes as the rank becomes full. This error bound is finally validated experimentally on three numerical test cases. The results demonstrate the high-order convergence of the Runge-Kutta BUG integrator and its superior accuracy compared to other dynamical low-rank integrators proposed in the literature.</description>
