      <title>Maximum Degree-Based Quasi-Clique Search via an Iterative Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cohesive subgraph mining is a fundamental problem in graph theory with numerous real-world applications, such as social network analysis and protein-protein interaction modeling. Among various cohesive subgraphs, the $\gamma$-quasi-clique is widely studied for its flexibility in requiring each vertex to connect to at least a $\gamma$ proportion of other vertices in the subgraph. However, solving the maximum $\gamma$-quasi-clique problem is NP-hard and further complicated by the lack of the hereditary property, which makes designing efficient pruning strategies challenging. Existing algorithms, such as DDA and FastQC, either struggle with scalability or exhibit significant performance declines for small values of $\gamma$. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm, IterQC, which reformulates the maximum $\gamma$-quasi-clique problem as a series of $k$-plex problems that possess the hereditary property. IterQC introduces a non-trivial iterative framework and incorporates two key optimization techniques: (1) the pseudo lower bound (pseudo LB) technique, which leverages information across iterations to improve the efficiency of branch-and-bound searches, and (2) the preprocessing technique that reduces problem size and unnecessary iterations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IterQC achieves up to four orders of magnitude speedup and solves significantly more graph instances compared to state-of-the-art algorithms DDA and FastQC.</description>

      <title>Impact of Distance on Epidemiological Dynamics in Human Connection Network with Mobility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spread of infectious diseases is often influenced by human mobility across different geographical regions. Although numerous studies have investigated how diseases like SARS and COVID-19 spread from China to various global locations, there remains a gap in understanding how the movement of individuals contributes to disease transmission on a more personal or human-to-human level. Typically, researchers have employed the concept of metapopulation movement to analyze how diseases move from one location to another. This paper shifts focus to the dynamics of disease transmission, incorporating the critical factor of distance between an infected person and a healthy individual during human movement. The study delves into the impact of distance on various parameters of epidemiological dynamics throughout human mobility. Mathematical expressions for important epidemiological metrics, such as the basic reproduction number ($R_0$) and the critical infection rate ($\beta_{critical}$), are derived in relation to the distance between individuals. The results indicate that the proposed model closely aligns with observed patterns of COVID-19 spread based on the analysis done on the available datasets.</description>

      <title>Prediction of Reposting on X</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There have been considerable efforts to predict a user's reposting behaviour on X (formerly Twitter) using machine learning models. The problem is previously cast as a supervised classification task, where Tweets are randomly assigned to a test or training set. The random assignment helps to ensure that the test and training sets are drawn from the same distribution. In practice, we would like to predict users' reposting behaviour for a set of messages related to a new, previously unseen, topic (defined by a hashtag). In this case, the problem becomes an out-of-distribution generalisation classification task.
  Experimental results reveal that while existing algorithms, which predominantly use features derived from the content of Tweet messages, perform well when the training and test distributions are the same, these algorithms perform much worse when the test set is out of distribution. We then show that if the message features are supplemented or replaced with features derived from users' profile and past behaviour, the out-of-distribution prediction is greatly improved, with the F1 score increasing from 0.24 to 0.70. Our experimental results suggest that a significant component of reposting behaviour can be predicted based on users' profile and past behaviour, and is independent of the content of messages.</description>

      <title>Graph Foundation Models: A Comprehensive Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph-structured data pervades domains such as social networks, biological systems, knowledge graphs, and recommender systems. While foundation models have transformed natural language processing, vision, and multimodal learning through large-scale pretraining and generalization, extending these capabilities to graphs -- characterized by non-Euclidean structures and complex relational semantics -- poses unique challenges and opens new opportunities. To this end, Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) aim to bring scalable, general-purpose intelligence to structured data, enabling broad transfer across graph-centric tasks and domains. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of GFMs, unifying diverse efforts under a modular framework comprising three key components: backbone architectures, pretraining strategies, and adaptation mechanisms. We categorize GFMs by their generalization scope -- universal, task-specific, and domain-specific -- and review representative methods, key innovations, and theoretical insights within each category. Beyond methodology, we examine theoretical foundations including transferability and emergent capabilities, and highlight key challenges such as structural alignment, heterogeneity, scalability, and evaluation. Positioned at the intersection of graph learning and general-purpose AI, GFMs are poised to become foundational infrastructure for open-ended reasoning over structured data. This survey consolidates current progress and outlines future directions to guide research in this rapidly evolving field.

      <title>Emergence of human-like polarization among large language model agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05171v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rapid advances in large language models (LLMs) have not only empowered autonomous agents to generate social networks, communicate, and form shared and diverging opinions on political issues, but have also begun to play a growing role in shaping human political deliberation. Our understanding of their collective behaviours and underlying mechanisms remains incomplete, however, posing unexpected risks to human society. In this paper, we simulate a networked system involving thousands of large language model agents, discovering their social interactions, guided through LLM conversation, result in human-like polarization. We discover that these agents spontaneously develop their own social network with human-like properties, including homophilic clustering, but also shape their collective opinions through mechanisms observed in the real world, including the echo chamber effect. Similarities between humans and LLM agents -- encompassing behaviours, mechanisms, and emergent phenomena -- raise concerns about their capacity to amplify societal polarization, but also hold the potential to serve as a valuable testbed for identifying plausible strategies to mitigate polarization and its consequences.</description>

      <title>Illusions of Intimacy: Emotional Attachment and Emerging Psychological Risks in Human-AI Relationships</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11649v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Emotionally responsive social chatbots, such as those produced by Replika and Character.AI, increasingly serve as companions that offer empathy, support, and entertainment. While these systems appear to meet fundamental human needs for connection, they raise concerns about how artificial intimacy affects emotional regulation, well-being, and social norms. Prior research has focused on user perceptions or clinical contexts but lacks large-scale, real-world analysis of how these interactions unfold. This paper addresses that gap by analyzing over 30K user-shared conversations with social chatbots to examine the emotional dynamics of human-AI relationships. Using computational methods, we identify patterns of emotional mirroring and synchrony that closely resemble how people build emotional connections. Our findings show that users-often young, male, and prone to maladaptive coping styles-engage in parasocial interactions that range from affectionate to abusive. Chatbots consistently respond in emotionally consistent and affirming ways. In some cases, these dynamics resemble toxic relationship patterns, including emotional manipulation and self-harm. These findings highlight the need for guardrails, ethical design, and public education to preserve the integrity of emotional connection in an age of artificial companionship.</description>

      <title>Robustness Evaluation of Graph-based News Detection Using Network Structural Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14453v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown promising potential in fake news detection, they remain highly vulnerable to adversarial manipulations within social networks. Existing methods primarily establish connections between malicious accounts and individual target news to investigate the vulnerability of graph-based detectors, while they neglect the structural relationships surrounding targets, limiting their effectiveness in robustness evaluation. In this work, we propose a novel Structural Information principles-guided Adversarial Attack Framework, namely SI2AF, which effectively challenges graph-based detectors and further probes their detection robustness. Specifically, structural entropy is introduced to quantify the dynamic uncertainty in social engagements and identify hierarchical communities that encompass all user accounts and news posts. An influence metric is presented to measure each account's probability of engaging in random interactions, facilitating the design of multiple agents that manage distinct malicious accounts. For each target news, three attack strategies are developed through multi-agent collaboration within the associated subgraph to optimize evasion against black-box detectors. By incorporating the adversarial manipulations generated by SI2AF, we enrich the original network structure and refine graph-based detectors to improve their robustness against adversarial attacks. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that SI2AF significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in attack effectiveness with an average improvement of 16.71%, and enhances GNN-based detection robustness by 41.54% on average.</description>

      <title>Universal expansion of human mobility across urban scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06889v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Human mobility is a fundamental process underpinning socioeconomic life and urban structure. Classic theories, such as egocentric activity spaces and central place theory, provide crucial insights into specific facets of movement, like home-centricity and hierarchical spatial organization. However, identifying universal characteristics or an underlying principle that quantitatively links these disparate perspectives has remained a challenge. Here, we reveal such a connection by analyzing the spatial structure of individual daily mobility trajectories using network-based modules. We discover a universal scaling law: the spatial extent (radius) of these mobility modules expands sublinearly with increasing distance from home, a pattern consistent across three orders of magnitude. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these modules precisely map onto the nested hierarchy of urban systems, corresponding to local, city-level, and regional scales as distance from home increases. These findings deepen our understanding of human mobility dynamics and demonstrate the profound connection between classical urban theory, human geography, and mobility studies.</description>

      <title>Examining the Prevalence and Dynamics of AI-Generated Media in Art Subreddits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07302v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Broadly accessible generative AI models like Dall-E have made it possible for anyone to create compelling visual art. In online communities, the introduction of AI-generated content (AIGC) may impact social dynamics, for example causing changes in who is posting content, or shifting the norms or the discussions around the posted content if posts are suspected of being generated by AI. We take steps towards examining the potential impact of AIGC on art-related communities on Reddit. We distinguish between communities that disallow AI content and those without such a direct policy. We look at image-based posts in these communities where the author transparently shares that the image was created by AI, and at comments in these communities that suspect or accuse authors of using generative AI. We find that AI posts (and accusations) have played a surprisingly small part in these communities through the end of 2023, accounting for fewer than 0.5% of the image-based posts. However, even as the absolute number of author-labeled AI posts dwindles over time, accusations of AI use remain more persistent. We show that AI content is more readily used by newcomers and may help increase participation if it aligns with community rules. However, the tone of comments suspecting AI use by others has become more negative over time, especially in communities that do not have explicit rules about AI. Overall, the results show the changing norms and interactions around AIGC in online communities designated for creativity.</description>

      <title>Social Media Harm Abatement: Mechanisms for Transparent Public Health Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10458v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Social media platforms have been accused of causing a range of harms, resulting in dozens of lawsuits across jurisdictions. These lawsuits are situated within the context of a long history of American product safety litigation, suggesting opportunities for remediation outside of financial compensation. Anticipating that at least some of these cases may be successful and/or lead to settlements, this article outlines an implementable mechanism for an abatement and/or settlement plan capable of mitigating abuse. The paper describes the requirements of such a mechanism, implications for privacy and oversight, and tradeoffs that such a procedure would entail. The mechanism is framed to operate at the intersection of legal procedure, standards for transparent public health assessment, and the practical requirements of modern technology products.</description>

      <title>On Signed Network Coordination Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09799v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study binary-action pairwise-separable network games that encompass both coordinating and anti-coordinating behaviors. Our model is grounded in an underlying directed signed graph, where each link is associated with a weight that describes the strenght and nature of the interaction. The utility for each agent is an aggregation of pairwise terms determined by the weights of the signed graph in addition to an individual bias term. We consider a scenario that assumes the presence of a prominent cohesive subset of players, who are either connected exclusively by positive weights, or forms a structurally balanced subset that can be bipartitioned into two adversarial subcommunities with positive intra-community and negative inter-community edges. Given the properties of the game restricted to the remaining players, our results guarantee the existence of Nash equilibria characterized by a consensus or, respectively, a polarization within the first group, as well as their stability under best response transitions. Our results can be interpreted as robustness results, building on the supermodular properties of coordination games and on a novel use of the concept of graph cohesiveness.</description>
