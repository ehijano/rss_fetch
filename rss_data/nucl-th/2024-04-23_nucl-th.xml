      <title>The axially-deformed relativistic quasiparticle random phase approximation based on point-coupling interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collective nuclear excitations, like giant resonances, are sensitive to nuclear deformation, as evidenced by alterations in their excitation energies and transition strength distributions. A common theoretical framework to study these collective modes, the random-phase approximation (RPA), has to deal with large dimensions spanned by all possible particle-hole configurations satisfying certain symmetries. This work aims to establish a new theoretical framework to study the impact of deformation on spin-isospin excitations, that can provide fast and reliable solutions of the RPA equations. The nuclear ground state is determined with the axially-deformed relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov (RHB) model based on relativistic point-coupling energy density functionals (EDFs). To study the excitations in the charge-exchange channel, an axially-deformed proton-neutron relativistic quasiparticle RPA (pnRQRPA) is developed in the linear response approach. After benchmarking the axially-deformed pnRQRPA in the spherical limit, a study of spin-isospin excitations including Fermi, Gamow-Teller (GT), and Spin-Dipole (SD) is performed for selected $pf$-shell nuclei. For GT transitions, it is demonstrated that deformation leads to considerable fragmentation of the strength function. A mechanism inducing the fragmentation is studied by decomposing the total strength to different projections of total angular momentum $K$ and constraining the nuclear shape to either spherical, prolate or oblate. A similar fragmentation is also observed for SD transitions, although somewhat moderated by the complex structure of these transitions, while the Fermi strength is almost shape-independent. The axially-deformed pnRQRPA introduced in this work opens perspectives for future studies of deformation effects on astrophysically relevant weak interaction processes, in particular beta decay and electron capture.</description>

      <title>Light and hyper nuclei formation at $\sqrt{s_{\text{NN}}} =$ 3 GeV Au+Au collisions using Wigner coalescence approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The production of light nuclei and hyper-nuclei in heavy-ion collisions, particularly at high baryon density, is crucial for understanding dynamical evolution of collision system and exploring the internal state of nuclear matter of compacted stellar. Despite being a topic of ongoing debate, an improved theoretical understanding is needed. In this work, production of light nuclei ($d$, $t$, $^{3}$He, $^{4}$He) and hyper-nuclei ($^{3}_{\Lambda}$H, $^{4}_{\Lambda}$H) was investigated using the JAM microscopic transport model combined with an afterburner coalescence process at $\sqrt{s_{\text{NN}}} =$ 3 GeV Au+Au collisions. In the coalescence process, the formation of a specific nucleus is determined by its Wigner function. The calculated $\mathrm{p_T}$ spectra, average $\mathrm{p_T}$, and rapidity distributions were compared with the measurements from the STAR experiment. We investigated the dynamic information carried by light nuclei, and determined the averaged spatial distance $\langle \Delta R \rangle$ and momentum difference $\langle \Delta P \rangle$ of constituent nucleons ($\Lambda$) for each nucleus species.</description>

      <title>Radial and orbital decomposition of charge radii of Ca nuclei:Comparative study of Skyrme and Fayans functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the charge and point-proton radii of the Ca nuclei in detail in the density functional theory framework. As the Fayans energy density functional provides characteristic $N$-dependence, successfully describing the parabolic behavior of the differential charge radii in $20\leq N\leq 28$, we pose our particular focus on its physics origin, by decomposing them into the radial and orbital contributions. The results are compared with those from the Skyrme plus usual pairing functional, which is taken as a representative of the functionals having normal pairing channels. We point out that, because the enhancement of the differential charge radii in $N&lt;20$ with the Fayans functional, which is contradictory with the data, has the origin parallel to the parabolic behavior in $20\leq N\leq 28$, it is significant to describe both $N$ regions simultaneously.</description>

      <title>Fission barriers with Weizs\"acker-Skyrme mass model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on Weizs\"acker-Skyrme (WS4) mass model, the fission barriers of nuclei are systematically studied. Considering the shell corrections and the macroscopic deformation energy, the fission barrier heights for nuclei with $Z\geqslant 82$ can be well described, with an rms deviation of 0.481 MeV with respect to 71 empirical barrier heights. In addition to the shell correction at the ground state, the shell correction at the saddle point and its relative value are also important for both deformed nuclei and spherical nuclei. The fission barriers for nuclei far from the $\beta$-stability line and super-heavy nuclei are also predicted with the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Ab initio description of monopole resonances in light- and medium-mass nuclei: III. Moments evaluation in ab initio PGCM calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper is the third of a series dedicated to the ab initio description of monopole giant resonances in mid-mass closed- and open-shell nuclei via the so-called projected generator coordinate method. The present focus is on the computation of the moments $m_k$ of the monopole strength distribution, which are used to quantify its centroid energy and dispersion. First, the capacity to compute low-order moments via two different methods is developed and benchmarked for the $m_1$ moment. Second, the impact of the angular momentum projection on the centroid energy and dispersion of the monopole strength is analysed before comparing the results to those obtained from consistent quasi-particle random phase approximation calculations. Next, the so-called energy weighted sum rule (EWSR) is investigated. First, the appropriate ESWR in the center-of-mass frame is derived analytically. Second, the exhaustion of the intrinsic EWSR is tested in order to quantify the (unwanted) local-gauge symmetry breaking of the presently employed chiral effective field theory ($\chi$EFT) interactions. Finally, the infinite nuclear matter incompressibility associated with the employed $\chi$EFT interactions is extracted by extrapolating the finite-nucleus incompressibility computed from the monopole centroid energy.</description>

      <title>$\Lambda$ polarization in very high energy heavy ion collisions as a probe of the Quark-Gluon Plasma formation and properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have studied the spin polarization of $\Lambda$ hyperons in heavy ion collisions at center-of-mass energies $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200$ GeV and $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 5.02$ TeV carried out at RHIC and LHC colliders. We have calculated the mean spin vector at local thermodynamic equilibrium, including all known first-order terms in the gradients of the thermo-hydrodynamic fields, assuming that the hadronization hypersurface has a uniform temperature. We have also included the feed-down contributions to the polarization of $\Lambda$ stemming from the decays of polarized $\Sigma^*$ and $\Sigma^0$ hyperons. The obtained results are in good agreement with the data. In general, the component of the spin vector along the global angular momentum, orthogonal to the reaction plane, shows strong sensitivity to the initial longitudinal flow velocity. Furthermore, the longitudinal component of the spin vector turns out to be very sensitive to the bulk viscosity of the plasma at the highest LHC energy. Therefore, the azimuthal dependence of spin polarization can effectively constrain the initial hydrodynamic conditions and the transport coefficients of the Quark Gluon Plasma.</description>

      <title>Isotope shift factors with quantum electrodynamics effects for many-electron systems: A study of the nuclear charge radius of $^{26m}$Al</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A method for calculating the field shift contribution to isotope shifts in many-electron atoms, incorporating quantum electrodynamics (QED) effects, is introduced. We also implement the model QED approach to incorporate QED contribution to the nuclear recoil effect at the high-order correlation effects treatment level. The proposed computational scheme is used to revise the value of the root-mean-square (rms) nuclear charge radius of the isomer of aluminium-26, $^{26m}$Al. This radius is important for the global analysis of the $V_{ud}$ element of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix. The difference in mean-square nuclear charge radii of $^{27}$Al and $^{26m}$Al, obtained by combining the calculated atomic factors with recently measured isotope shift (IS) of the $3s^23p~^2P_{3/2} \to 3s^24s~^2S_{1/2}$ transition in Al, is $0.443(44)(19)~{\rm fm}^2$, where the first and second uncertainties are experimental and theoretical ones, respectively. The latter is reduced by a factor of 4 with respect to the previous study. Using this value and the known value of the rms charge radius of $^{27}$Al, the resultant value $R_c(^{26m}$Al) = 3.132(10)~fm is obtained. With the improved accuracy of the calculated IS factors the error in $R_c(^{26m}$Al) is now dominated by the experimental uncertainty. Similar revision of rms charge radii is made for the $^{28}$Al, $^{29}$Al, $^{30}$Al, $^{31}$Al and $^{32}$Al isotopes using existing IS measurements. Additionally, atomic factors are computed for the {$3s^23p~^2P_{3/2} \to 3s^24s~^2S_{1/2}$}, {$3s^23p~^2P_{1/2} \to 3s^25s~^2S_{1/2}$} and {$3s^23p~^2P_{3/2} \to 3s^25s~^2S_{1/2}$} transitions in Al, which can be used in future experimental studies.</description>

      <title>Local univalence versus stability and causality in hydrodynamic models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our main objective is to compare the analytic properties of hydrodynamic series with the stability and causality conditions applied to hydrodynamic modes. Analyticity, in this context, implies that the hydrodynamic series behaves as a univalent or single-valued function. Stability and causality adhere to physical constraints where hydrodynamic modes neither exhibit exponential growth nor travel faster than the speed of light. Through an examination of various hydrodynamic models, such as the Muller-Israel-Stewart (MIS) and the first-order hydro models like the BDNK (Bemfica-Disconzi-Noronha-Kovtun) model, we observe no new restrictions stemming from the analyticity limits in the shear channel of these models. However, local univalence is maintained in the sound channel of these models despite the global divergence of the hydrodynamic series. Notably, differences in the sound equations between the MIS and BDNK models lead to distinct analyticity limits. The MIS model's sound mode remains univalent at high momenta within a specific transport range. Conversely, in the BDNK model, the univalence of the sound mode extends to intermediate momenta across all stable and causal regions. Generally, the convergence radius is independent of univalence and the given dispersion relation predominantly influences their correlation. For second-order frequency dispersions, the relationship is precise, i.e. within the convergence radius, the hydro series demonstrates univalence. However, with higher-order dispersions, the hydro series is locally univalent within certain transport regions, which may fall within or outside the stable and causal zones.</description>

      <title>Topological susceptibility and axion potential in two-flavor superconductive quark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the potential of the axion, $a$, of Quantum Chromodynamics, in the two-flavor color superconducting phase of cold and dense quark matter. We adopt a Nambu-Jona-Lasinio-like model. Our interaction contains two terms, one preserving and one breaking the $U(1)_A$ symmetry: the latter is responsible of the coupling of axions to quarks. We introduce two quark condensates, $h_L$ and $h_R$, describing condensation for left-handed and right-handed quarks respectively; we then study the loci of the minima of the thermodynamic potential, $\Omega$, in the $(h_L,h_R)$ plane, noticing how the instanton-induced interaction favors condensation in the scalar channel when the $\theta-$angle, $\theta=a/f_a$, vanishes. Increasing $\theta$ we find a phase transition where the scalar condensate rotates into a pseudo-scalar one. We present an analytical result for the topological susceptibility, $\chi$, in the superconductive phase, which stands both at zero and at finite temperature. Finally, we compute the axion mass and its self-coupling. In particular, the axion mass $m_a$ is related to the full topological susceptibility via $\chi=m_a^2 f_a^2$, hence our result for $\chi$ gives an analytical result for $m_a$ in the superconductive phase of high-density Quantum Chromodynamics.</description>

      <title>PM2D: A parallel GPU-based code for the kinetic simulation of laser plasma instabilities in large scale plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Laser plasma instabilities (LPIs) have significant influences on the laser energy deposition efficiency, hot electron generation, and uniformity of irradiation in inertial confined fusion (ICF). In contrast to theoretical analysis of linear development of LPIs, numerical simulations play a more and more important role in revealing the complex physics of LPIs. Since LPIs are typically a three-wave coupling process, the precise kinetic simulation of LPIs requires to resolve the laser period (around one femtosecond) and laser wavelength (less than one micron). In this paper, a full wave fluid model of LPIs is constructed and numerically solved by the particle-mesh method, where the plasma is described by macro particles that can move across the mesh grids freely. Based upon this model, a two-dimensional (2D) GPU code named PM2D is developed. It can simulate the kinetic effects of LPIs self-consistently as normal particle-in-cell (PIC) codes. Moreover, as the physical model adopted in the PM2D code is specifically constructed for LPIs, the required macro particles per grid in the simulations can be largely reduced and thus overall simulation cost is considerably reduced comparing with typical PIC codes. Moreover, the numerical noise in our PM2D code is much lower, which makes it more robust than PIC codes in the simulation of LPIs for the long-time scale above 10 picoseconds. After the distributed computing is realized, our PM2D code is able to run on GPU clusters with a total mesh grids up to several billions, which meets the typical requirements for the simulations of LPIs at ICF experimental scale with reasonable cost.</description>

      <title>Chiral crossover vs chiral density wave in dense nuclear matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.01603v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We employ a model based on nucleonic and mesonic degrees of freedom to discuss the competition between isotropic and anisotropic phases in cold and dense matter. Assuming isotropy, the model exhibits a chiral phase transition which is of second order in the chiral limit and becomes a crossover in the case of a realistic pion mass. This observation crucially depends on the presence of the nucleonic vacuum contribution. Allowing for an anisotropic phase in the form of a chiral density wave can disrupt the smooth crossover. We identify the regions in the parameter space of the model where a chiral density wave is energetically preferred. A high-density re-appearance of the chiral density wave with unphysical behavior, as seen in previous studies, is avoided by a suitable renormalization scheme. A nonzero pion mass tends to disfavor the anisotropic phase compared to the chiral limit and we find that, within our model, the chiral density wave is only realized for baryon densities of at least about 6 times nuclear saturation density.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-restored Skyrme-Random-Phase-Approximation calculations of the monopole strength in deformed nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10410v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Within the Energy Density Functional (EDF) approach, the use of mean-field wave-functions deliberately breaking (some) symmetries of the underlying Hamiltonian is an efficient and largely utilized way to incorporate static correlations. However, the restoration of broken symmetries is eventually mandatory to recover the corresponding quantum numbers and to achieve a more precise description of nuclear properties.
  While symmetry-restored calculations are routinely performed to study ground-state properties and low-lying excitations, similar applications to the nuclear response are essentially limited to either formal studies or to schematic models. In the present paper, the effect of angular momentum restoration on the monopole and quadrupole responses of doubly open-shell nuclei is investigated.
  Based on deformed Skyrme-Random Phase Approximation (RPA) calculations, the exact Angular Momentum Projection (AMP) is implemented in the calculation of the multipole strength functions, thus defining a projection after variation (PAV-RPA) scheme. The method is employed for the first time in a realistic study to investigate the effect of AMP on the coupling of monopole and quadrupole modes in $^{24}$Mg resulting from its intrinsic deformation.</description>

      <title>Extended Skyrme effective interactions for transport model and neutron stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17105v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is important to develop a unified theoretical framework to describe the nuclear experiments and astrophysical observations based on the same effective nuclear interactions. Based on the so-called Skyrme pseudopotential up to next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order, we construct a series of extended Skyrme interactions by modifying the density-dependent term and fitting the empirical nucleon optical potential up to above $1$ GeV, the empirical properties of isospin symmetric nuclear matter, the microscopic calculations of pure neutron matter and the properties of neutron stars from astrophysical observations. The modification of the density-dependent term in the extended Skyrme interactions follows the idea of Fermi momentum expansion and this leads to a highly flexible density behavior of the symmetry energy. In particular, the values of the density slope parameter $L$ of the symmetry energy for the new extended Skyrme interactions range from $L = -5$ MeV to $L = 125$ MeV by construction, to cover the large uncertainty of the density dependence of the symmetry energy. Furthermore, in order to consider the effects of isoscalar and isovector nucleon effective masses, we adjust the momentum dependency of the single-nucleon optical potential and the symmetry potential of these new extended Skyrme interactions and construct a parameter set family, by which we systematically study the impacts of the symmetry energy and the nucleon effective masses on the properties of nuclear matter and neutron stars. The new extended Skyrme interactions constructed in the present work will be useful to determine the equation of state of isospin asymmetric nuclear matter, especially the symmetry energy, as well as the nucleon effective masses and their isospin splitting, in transport model simulations for heavy-ion collisions, nuclear structure calculations and neutron star studies.</description>

Abstract: The mass table in the deformed relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov theory in continuum (DRHBc) with the PC-PK1 density functional has been established for even-$Z$ nuclei with $8\le Z\le120$, extended from the previous work for even-even nuclei [Zhang $\it{et al.}$ (DRHBc Mass Table Collaboration), At. Data Nucl. Data Tables 144, 101488 (2022)]. The calculated binding energies, two-nucleon and one-neutron separation energies, root-mean-square (rms) radii of neutron, proton, matter, and charge distributions, quadrupole deformations, and neutron and proton Fermi surfaces are tabulated and compared with available experimental data. A total of 4829 even-$Z$ nuclei are predicted to be bound, with an rms deviation of 1.477 MeV from the 1244 mass data. Good agreement with the available experimental odd-even mass differences, $\alpha$ decay energies, and charge radii is also achieved. The description accuracy for nuclear masses and nucleon separation energies as well as the prediction for drip lines is compared with the results obtained from other relativistic and nonrelativistic density functional. The comparison shows that the DRHBc theory with PC-PK1 provides an excellent microscopic description for the masses of even-$Z$ nuclei. The systematics of the nucleon separation energies, odd-even mass differences, pairing energies, two-nucleon gaps, $\alpha$ decay energies, rms radii, quadrupole deformations, potential energy curves, neutron density distributions, and neutron mean-field potentials are discussed.</description>

      <title>Kinetic temperature and radial flow velocity estimation using identified hadrons and light (anti-)nuclei produced in relativistic heavy-ion collisions at RHIC and LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02759v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the investigation of the kinetic freeze-out properties of identified hadrons ($\pi^\pm$, $K^\pm$ and $p(\bar p)$) along with light (anti-)nuclei $d (\bar d)$, $t (\bar t)$ and ${}^{3}He$ in relativistic heavy-ion collisions at RHIC and LHC energies. A simultaneous fit is performed with the Blast-Wave (BW) model to the transverse momentum ($p_T$) spectra of identified hadrons together with light (anti-)nuclei produced in $Au+Au$ collisions at $\sqrt{\mathrm{s}_{_{\mathrm{NN}}}}$ = 7.7 -- 200 GeV at the RHIC and in $Pb+Pb$ collisions at $\sqrt{\mathrm{s}_{_{\mathrm{NN}}}}$ = 2.76 TeV at the LHC. The energy and centrality dependence of freeze-out parameters, i.e., kinetic freeze-out temperature ($T_{kin}$) and collective flow velocity $\langle \beta \rangle$ has been studied. It is observed that light (anti-)nuclei also participate in the collective expansion of the medium created in the collision when included in a common fit with the light hadrons. We observe a marginal rise in $T_{kin}$ and a slight decrease in $\langle \beta \rangle$ when compared to the values obtained from the fit to light hadrons. A similar $\langle \beta \rangle$ and significantly larger $T_{kin}$ is observed when a fit is performed to only protons and light (anti-)nuclei. Additionally, we also observe that the $T_{kin}$ increases from central to peripheral collisions, which is consistent with the argument of a short-lived fireball in peripheral collisions. Whereas the $\langle \beta \rangle$ shows a decreasing trend from central to peripheral collisions indicating a more rapid expansion in the central collisions. Both, $T_{kin}$ and $\langle \beta \rangle$ show a weak dependence on the collision energy at most energies.</description>

      <title>Discovering Nuclear Models from Symbolic Machine Learning</title>

Abstract: Numerous phenomenological nuclear models have been proposed to describe specific observables within different regions of the nuclear chart. However, developing a unified model that describes the complex behavior of all nuclei remains an open challenge. Here, we explore whether novel symbolic Machine Learning (ML) can rediscover traditional nuclear physics models or identify alternatives with improved simplicity, fidelity, and predictive power. To address this challenge, we developed a Multi-objective Iterated Symbolic Regression approach that handles symbolic regressions over multiple target observables, accounts for experimental uncertainties and is robust against high-dimensional problems. As a proof of principle, we applied this method to describe the nuclear binding energies and charge radii of light and medium mass nuclei. Our approach identified simple analytical relationships based on the number of protons and neutrons, providing interpretable models with precision comparable to state-of-the-art nuclear models. Additionally, we integrated this ML-discovered model with an existing complementary model to estimate the limits of nuclear stability. These results highlight the potential of symbolic ML to develop accurate nuclear models and guide our description of complex many-body problems.</description>

      <title>Renormalons in the energy-energy correlator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.19311v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The energy-energy correlator (EEC) is an observable of wide interest for collider physics and Standard Model measurements, due to both its simple theoretical description in terms of the energy-momentum tensor and its novel features for experimental studies. Significant progress has been made in both applications and higher-order perturbative predictions for the EEC. Here, we analyze the nature of the asymptotic perturbative series for the EEC by determining its analytic form in Borel space under the bubble-sum approximation. This result provides information on the leading and subleading nonperturbative power corrections through renormalon poles. We improve the perturbative convergence of the $\overline{\mathrm{MS}}$ series for the EEC by removing its leading renormalon using an R scheme, which is independent of the bubble-sum approximation. Using the leading R-scheme power correction determined by fits to thrust, we find good agreement with EEC OPAL data already at ${\mathcal O}(\alpha_s^2)$.</description>

      <title>Scalable Circuits for Preparing Ground States on Digital Quantum Computers: The Schwinger Model Vacuum on 100 Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.04481v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The vacuum of the lattice Schwinger model is prepared on up to 100 qubits of IBM's Eagle-processor quantum computers. A new algorithm to prepare the ground state of a gapped translationally-invariant system on a quantum computer is presented, which we call Scalable Circuits ADAPT-VQE (SC-ADAPT-VQE). This algorithm uses the exponential decay of correlations between distant regions of the ground state, together with ADAPT-VQE, to construct quantum circuits for state preparation that can be scaled to arbitrarily large systems. These scalable circuits can be determined using classical computers, avoiding the challenging task of optimizing parameterized circuits on a quantum computer. SC-ADAPT-VQE is applied to the Schwinger model, and shown to be systematically improvable, with an accuracy that converges exponentially with circuit depth. Both the structure of the circuits and the deviations of prepared wavefunctions are found to become independent of the number of spatial sites, $L$. This allows for a controlled extrapolation of the circuits, determined using small or modest-sized systems, to arbitrarily large $L$. The circuits for the Schwinger model are determined on lattices up to $L=14$ (28 qubits) with the qiskit classical simulator, and subsequently scaled up to prepare the $L=50$ (100 qubits) vacuum on IBM's 127 superconducting-qubit quantum computers ibm_brisbane and ibm_cusco. After introducing an improved error-mitigation technique, which we call Operator Decoherence Renormalization, the chiral condensate and charge-charge correlators obtained from the quantum computers are found to be in good agreement with classical Matrix Product State simulations.</description>

      <title>Shear viscosity of rotating, hot, and dense spin-half fermionic systems from quantum field theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.05284v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we calculate the shear viscosity for rotating fermions with spin-half under conditions of high temperature and density. We employ the Kubo formalism, rooted in finite-temperature quantum field theory, to compute the field correlation functions essential for this evaluation. The one-loop diagram pertinent to shear viscosity is analyzed within the context of curved space, utilizing tetrad formalism as an effective approach in cylindrical coordinates. Our findings focus on extremely high angular velocities, ranging from 0.1 to 1 GeV, which align with experimental expectations. Furthermore, we explore the inter-relationship between the chemical potential and angular velocity within the scope of this study.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave double copy of radiation from gluon shockwave collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.03507v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a recent paper, we showed that the gravitational wave spectrum from trans-Planckian shockwave scattering in Einstein gravity is determined by the gravitational Lipatov vertex expressed as the bilinear double copy $\Gamma^{\mu\nu} = \frac12 C^\mu C^\nu - \frac12 N^\mu N^\nu$ where $C^\mu$ is the QCD Lipatov vertex and $N^\mu$ is the QED soft photon factor. We show here that this result can be directly obtained by careful application of the classical color-kinematic duality to the spectrum obtained in gluon shockwave collisions.</description>

      <title>Order of the SU(N_f) x SU(N_f) chiral transition via the functional renormalization group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00554v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Renormalization group flows of the $SU(N_f)\times SU(N_f)$ symmetric Ginzburg-Landau potential are calculated for a general number of flavors, $N_f$. Our approach does not rely on the $\epsilon$ expansion, but uses the functional renormalization group, formulated directly in $d=3$ spatial dimensions, with the inclusion of all possible (perturbatively) relevant and marginal operators, whose number is considerably larger than those in $d=4$. We find new, potentially infrared stable fixed points spanned throughout the entire $N_f$ range. By conjecturing that the thermal chiral transition is governed by these ``flavor continuous" fixed points, stability analyses show that for $N_f\geq 5$ the chiral transition is of second-order, while for $N_f=2,3,4$, it is of first-order. We argue that the $U_{\rm A}(1)$ anomaly controls the strength of the first-order chiral transition for $N_f=2,3,4$, and makes it almost indistinguishable from a second-order one, if it is sufficiently weak at the critical point. This could open up a new strategy to investigate the strength of the $U_{\rm A}(1)$ symmetry breaking around the critical temperature.</description>

      <title>Analysis of $B_s^0 \to X(3872) [\psi(2S)] \pi^+\pi^- (K^+ K^-)$ decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05114v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have phenomenologically investigated the decays $B_s^0 \to X(3872) \pi^+\pi^- (K^+ K^-)$ and $B_s^0 \to \psi(2S) \pi^+ \pi^- (K^+K^-)$. In our analysis, the scalar meson $f_0(980)$ is formed through the final state interactions of coupled channels $\pi \pi$ and $K\bar{K}$. Our findings indicate that the $\pi^+\pi^-$ invariant mass distribution of the $B_s^0 \to \psi(2S)\pi^+\pi^-$ decay can be accurately reproduced. Furthermore, we have explored the $\pi^+\pi^- (K^+ K^-)$ invariant mass distribution of the $B_s^0 \to X(3872) \pi^+\pi^- (K^+ K^-)$ decay, accounting for the different production mechanisms between $X(3872)$ and $\psi(2S)$, up to a global factor. It is found that the production rates for $X(3872)$ and $\psi(2S)$ are much different, which indicates that the structure of $X(3872)$ is more complicated than the $\psi(2S)$, which is a conventional $c\bar{c}$ state. Additionally, we have considered the contributions from $f_0(1500)$ to $\pi^+\pi^-$ and the $\phi$ meson to $K^+ K^-$ in our analysis. Utilizing the model parameters, we have calculated the branching fraction of $B_s^0 \to X(3872) K^+ K^-$, and anticipate that the findings of our study can be experimentally tested in the future.</description>
