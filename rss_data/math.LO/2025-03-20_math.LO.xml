      <title>Connecting the space of marked groups and the space of group operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a connection between two well-studied spaces of countable groups: the space of group operations and the space of marked groups. This connection shows that the two spaces are equivalent in terms of generic properties in the sense of Baire category, which allows us to translate several results from the former setting to the latter. As an application, we give new, shorter proofs of two theorems that concern the generic behavior of compact metrizable abelian groups.</description>

      <title>Forcing, genericity and CBERS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we continue the study of equivalence of generics filters started by Smythe in [Smy22]. We fully characterize those forcing posets for which the corresponding equivalence of generics is smooth using the purely topological property of condensation. Next we leverage our characterization to show that there are non-homogeneous forcing for which equivalence of generics is not smooth. Then we prove hyperfiniteness in the case of Prikry forcing and some additional results addressing the problem whether generic equivalence for Cohen forcing is hyperfinite.</description>

      <title>Supervaluations, truth, and intuitionistic logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The supervaluationist approach to fixed-point semantics is, arguably, the most celebrated and studied competitor to the Strong Kleene approach within Kripkean truth. In this paper, we show how to obtain a supervaluationist fixed-point theory of truth for intuitionistic logic. In particular, we show how to do supervaluations over Kripke structures for intuitionistic logic, and we obtain the corresponding theories of truth, both semantic and axiomatic. Furthermore, we show how the theory of truth changes when the Kripke structures over which the supervaluations are defined change. Finally, we advance a supervaluationist theory of truth that, unlike the classical case or any of the other intuitionistic, supervaluationist theories, is compositional in nature.</description>

      <title>Constructive Quantum Logics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following a suggestion of Birkhoff and Von Neumann [Ann. Math. 37 (1936), 23-32], we pursue a joint study of quantum logic and intuitionistic logic. We exhibit a linear-time translation which for each quantum logic $Q$ and each superintuitionistic logic $I$ yields an axiomatization of $Q\cap I$ from axiomatizations of $Q$ and $I$. The translation is centered around a certain axiom (Ex) which (together with introduction and elimination rules for connectives) is shown to axiomatize the intersection of orthologic and intuitionistic logic, solving a problem of Holliday [Logics 1 (2023), pp. 36-79]. We prove that the lattice of all super-Ex logics is isomorphic to the product of the lattices of quantum logics and superintuitionistic logics in the signature $\{\land,\lor,\neg\}$. We prove that there are infinitely many sub-Ex logics extending Holliday's fundamental logic.</description>

      <title>A biequivalence of path categories and axiomatic Martin-L\"of type theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The semantics of extensional type theory has an elegant categorical description: models of Sigma-types and extensional Id-types are biequivalent to finitely complete categories. We establish a similar result for intensional type theories: weak models of Sigma-types and axiomatic Id-types are biequivalent to path categories. These axiomatic Id-types only satisfy beta-reduction rule as a propositional equality, and appear in cubical type theory, as well as axiomatic type theory (type theory without definitional equality). Path categories take inspiration from homotopy theory and simplify the structure of type theory using a primitive notion of equivalence. Our biequivalence allows us to turn path categories into actual models of type theory: we turn them into weak models, where substitution is only specified up to isomorphism, which we can in turn strictify using the left adjoint splitting. In addition, we introduce a more fine-grained notion: that of a display path category, and prove a similar biequivalence. These display path categories still model axiomatic Id-types, but not the intensional notion of Sigma-types. We show how they can be extended with axiomatic notions of Sigma-types and Pi-types, allowing us to model axiomatic type theory.</description>

      <title>Simplicial complexes, stellar moves, and projective amalgamation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore connections between stellar moves on simplicial complexes (these are fundamental operations of combinatorial topology) and projective Fra{\"i}ss{\'e} limits (this is a model theoretic construction with topological applications).
  We identify a class of simplicial maps that arise from the stellar moves of welding and subdividing. We call these maps weld-division maps. The core of the paper is the proof that the category of weld-division maps fulfills the projective amalgamation property. This gives an example of an amalgamation class that substantially differs from known classes.
  The weld-division amalgamation class naturally gives rise to a projective Fra{\"i}ss{\'e} class. We compute the canonical limit of this projective Fra{\"i}ss{\'e} class and its canonical quotient space. This computation gives a combinatorial description of the geometric realization of a simplicial complex and an example of a combinatorially defined projective Fra{\"i}ss{\'e} class whose canonical quotient space has topological dimension strictly bigger than $1$.
  The method of proof of the amalgamation theorem is new. It is not geometric or topological, but rather it consists of combinatorial calculations performed on finite sequences of finite sets and functions among such sequences. Set theoretic nature of the entries of the sequences is crucial to the arguments.</description>

      <title>Very large set axioms over constructive set theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.05831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.05831v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate large set axioms defined in terms of elementary embeddings over constructive set theories, focusing on $\mathsf{IKP}$ and $\mathsf{CZF}$. Most previously studied large set axioms, notably the constructive analogues of large cardinals below $0^\sharp$, have proof-theoretic strength weaker than full Second-order Arithmetic. On the other hand, the situation is dramatically different for those defined via elementary embeddings. We show that by adding to $\mathsf{IKP}$ the basic properties of an elementary embedding $j\colon V\to M$ for $\Delta_0$-formulas, which we will denote by $\mathsf{\Delta_0\text{-}BTEE}_M$, we obtain the consistency of $\mathsf{ZFC}$ and more. We will also see that the consistency strength of a Reinhardt set exceeds that of $\mathsf{ZF+WA}$. Furthermore, we will define super Reinhardt sets and $\mathsf{TR}$, which is a constructive analogue of $V$ being totally Reinhardt, and prove that their proof-theoretic strength exceeds that of $\mathsf{ZF}$ with choiceless large cardinals.</description>

      <title>Splitting differential equations using Galois theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14900v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article is interested in pullbacks under the logarithmic derivative of algebraic ordinary differential equations. In particular, assuming the solution set of an equation is internal to the constants, we would like to determine when its pullback is itself internal to the constants. To do so, we develop, using model-theoretic Galois theory and differential algebra, a connection between internality of the pullback and the splitting of a short exact sequence of algebraic Galois groups. We then use algebraic group theory to obtain internality and non-internality results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14790v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is a contribution to the study of extensions of arbitrary models of ZF (Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory), with no regard to countability or well-foundedness of the models involved. We present some new constructions of certain types of extensions, and also establish the existence of models of ZF that cannot be properly end extended to a model of ZF.</description>

      <title>Finite model property of pretransitive analogues of (w)K4 and GL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08465v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A normal modal logic is pretransitive, if the modality corresponding to the transitive closure of an accessibility relation is expressible in it. In the present work we establish the finite model property for pretransitive generalizations of K4, wK4, GL, and their extensions by canonical subframe-hereditary formulas.</description>
