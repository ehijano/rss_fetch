      <title>Field-material coupled neural network: A novel prior-free and data-free inverse problem solver for extracting complex dielectric constant in terahertz band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate extraction of the complex dielectric constant in the terahertz (THz) band is essential for material characterization and non-destructive evaluation yet remains challenging due to the ill-posed nature of electromagnetic inverse problems and the limited availability of reliable reference data. In this work, a field-material couple neural network (FMCNN) is proposed to retrieve the complex dielectric constant directly from THz measurements. The FMCNN consists of a field neural network and a material neural network that are strongly coupled through the frequency-domain Maxwell equations in the form of a Helmholtz equation, with the governing physics enforced by partial differential equation (PDE) and boundary condition constraints. This formulation enables prior-free and data-free inversion, requiring only measured test data as input. The extracted dielectric constants are validated by comparison with results from a one-dimensional normal-incidence model and the Drude-Lorentz model, showing good agreement over a broad frequency range, particularly above 0.2 THz. These results demonstrate that the FMCNN provides a physics-consistent and data-efficient approach for material parameter extraction in the THz band, offering an alternative to conventional model-based methods.</description>

      <title>A large scale multi-modal workflow for battery characterization: from concept to implementation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of material acceleration platforms in battery research requires integrating complementary techniques and correlating heterogeneous experimental datasets. Here, this challenge is tackled in a large-scale multimodal program involving fifteen laboratories and facilities across Europe. Coordinated multi-site experiments are performed on state-of-the-art graphite / LiNiO2 Li-ion full cells to address two archetypal scientific questions: is the electrolyte composition impacting electrode properties, and how do electrode materials evolve when cells are cycled to their end-of-life? A fully standardized and centralized workflow is demonstrated, from sample production and delivery, to metadata and data handling, generating seventy-five concatenated datasets shared among all partners. Their integrated analysis shows that scientific conclusions depend critically on both the observable chosen to describe electrode properties, and the measurement technique employed. Individual experiments provide detailed information into specific aspects, such as crystal structures, redox activity, surface processes, morphology, etc., but can also function as binary diagnostic tool. Two-dimensional observable-technique patterns are introduced, in which each pixel encodes a yes, no or uncertain answer to a given scientific question. These patterns serve as multi-property metaviews, e.g. visual genotypes, enabling to classify material behavior and technique suitability according to predefined user demand and criteria, highlighting the interdependencies between measurement choices, extracted parameters and scientific interpretation. This multimodal workflow establishes a proof-of-concept for correlative analysis and underscores challenges toward fully integrated, automated and holistic approaches in energy material science.</description>

      <title>Thin-Film-Engineered Self-Assembly of 3D Coaxial Microfluidics with a Tunable Polyimide Membrane for Bioelectronic Power</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thin-film self-assembly of three-dimensional (3D) microsystems presents a compelling route to integrate complex functionalities into ultracompact volumes, yet strategies for incorporating tunable ion-conducting elements remain limited. Here, we introduce a strain-induced self-assembly platform that transforms lithographically patterned multilayer thin films into functional 3D coaxial Swiss-roll microtubes with total active volumes below 1 uL. A key innovation is the monolithic integration of a chemically tunable polyimide proton-exchange membrane, enabling post-fabrication optimization of ionic transport. We further implement a dual-mode operational scheme that decouples microbial metabolism from electrochemical power generation, effectively eliminating biofouling and enhancing operational stability. This integrated bio-electronic microsystem achieves a volumetric power density of ca. 3.1 mW cm-3 within an ultra-compact footprint of 4.16 mm2. Our work establishes a scalable thin-film engineering approach to create tunable, 3D-bioelectronic power sources for autonomous microsystems.</description>

      <title>Synchrotron-based Photonuclear Neutron Source for Energy, Medicine and Radiation Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The global availability of high-intensity neutron sources is restricted by the prohibitive costs of spallation facilities and the decommissioning of aging research reactors, while compact accelerator-driven sources (CANS) are fundamentally limited by target power density and thermal-mechanical stress. Here, we introduce SYNERGY (SYnchrotron-driven NEutron source for Research, energy Generation and therapY), a paradigm-shifting architecture that overcomes these bottlenecks by decoupling charged-particle acceleration from neutron production. By utilizing a storage ring to drive external photoneutron targets via synchrotron radiation, this topological separation ensures targets interact exclusively with a continuous-wave (CW) photon beam, minimizing thermo-mechanical shocks and enabling beam powers exceeding 200 kW per beamline. Through a systematic parametric analysis cross-validated using OpenMC, MCNPX, and FLUKA, we demonstrate single-beamline neutron production rates from $2.8\times10^{14}$ n/s to $1.3\times10^{15}$ n/s. With an inherent multi-beamline capacity feeding up to 50 independent stations, the total facility intensity exceeds $6.0\times10^{16}$ n/s. By bridging the gap between laboratory and national-scale infrastructure, SYNERGY provides a high-intensity, multi-user platform for subcritical systems, medical isotope production, and boron neutron capture therapy.</description>

      <title>Training deep physical neural networks with local physical information bottleneck</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning has revolutionized modern society but faces growing energy and latency constraints. Deep physical neural networks (PNNs) are interconnected computing systems that directly exploit analog dynamics for energy-efficient, ultrafast AI execution. Realizing this potential, however, requires universal training methods tailored to physical intricacies. Here, we present the Physical Information Bottleneck (PIB), a general and efficient framework that integrates information theory and local learning, enabling deep PNNs to learn under arbitrary physical dynamics. By allocating matrix-based information bottlenecks to each unit, we demonstrate supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning across electronic memristive chips and optical computing platforms. PIB also adapts to severe hardware faults and allows for parallel training via geographically distributed resources. Bypassing auxiliary digital models and contrastive measurements, PIB recasts PNN training as an intrinsic, scalable information-theoretic process compatible with diverse physical substrates.</description>

      <title>How Geometry Tames Disorder in Lattice Fracture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the fracture behavior of pre-cracked triangular beam-lattices whose elements have failure stresses drawn from a Weibull distribution. Through a statistical analysis and numerical simulations, we identify and verify the existence of three distinct failure regimes: (i) disorder is effectively suppressed, (ii) disorder manifests locally near the crack tip, modifying the crack morphology, and (iii) disorder manifests globally, leading to initially diffuse failure. Our model naturally reveals the key parameters governing this behavior: the Weibull modulus, quantifying the spread in failure thresholds, and a geometric quantity termed the Slenderness Ratio. We also reproduce the disorder-induced toughening reported in previous experimental and numerical studies, further demonstrating that its manifestation depends non-monotonically on disorder. Crucially, our results indicate that this toughening cannot be simply connected to the amount of damage in the lattice, challenging interpretations that attribute increased fracture energy solely to enhanced crack tortuosity or diffuse failure. Overall, our results establish geometry as a powerful control parameter for regulating how disorder is expressed during fracture in beam-lattices, with broader implications for the disorder-induced toughening in engineered materials.</description>

      <title>Intensity-based Segmentation of Tissue Images Using a U-Net with a Pretrained ResNet-34 Encoder: Application to Mueller Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Manual annotation of the images of thin tissue sections remains a time-consuming step in Mueller microscopy and limits its scalability. We present a novel automated approach using only the total intensity M11 element of the Mueller matrix as an input to a U-Net architecture with a pretrained ResNet-34 encoder. The network was trained to distinguish four classes in the images of murine uterine cervix sections: background, internal os, cervical tissue, and vaginal wall. With only 70 cervical tissue sections, the model achieved 89.71% pixel accuracy and 80.96% mean tissue Dice coefficient on the held-out test dataset. Transfer learning from ImageNet enables accurate segmentation despite limited size of training dataset typical of specialized biomedical imaging. This intensity-based framework requires minimal preprocessing and is readily extensible to other imaging modalities and tissue types, with publicly available graphical annotation tools for practical deployment.</description>

      <title>Inverse design of multiresonance filters via quasi-normal mode theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10219v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a practical methodology for inverse design of compact high-order/multiresonance filters in linear passive 2-port wave-scattering systems, targeting any desired transmission spectrum (such as standard pass/stop-band filters). Our formulation allows for both large-scale topology optimization and few-variable parametrized-geometry optimization. It is an extension of a quasi-normal mode theory and analytical filter-design criteria (on the system resonances and background response) derived in our previous work. Our new optimization-oriented formulation relies solely on a scattering solver and imposes these design criteria as equality constraints with easily calculated (via the adjoint method) derivatives, so that our algorithm is numerically tractable, robust, and well-suited for large-scale inverse design. We demonstrate its effectiveness by designing 3rd- and 4th-order elliptic and Chebyshev filters for photonic metasurfaces, multilayer films, and electrical LC-ladder circuits.</description>

      <title>Bilayer Cuprate Antiferromagnets Enable Programmable Cavity Optomagnonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17173v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hybrid platforms that couple microwave photons to collective spin excitations offer promising routes for coherent information processing, yet conventional magnets face inherent trade-offs among coupling strength, coherence, and tunability. We demonstrate that bilayer cuprate antiferromagnets, exemplified by YBa2Cu3O6+x, provide an alternative approach enabled by their unique magnon spectrum. Using a neutron-constrained bilayer spin model, we obtain the complete Gamma-point spectrum and identify an in-plane acoustic alpha mode that remains gapless and Zeeman-linear, alongside an in-plane optical beta mode stabilized by weak anisotropy whose frequency can be tuned from the gigahertz to terahertz range. When coupled to a single-mode microwave cavity, these modes create two distinct channels with a magnetically tunable alpha-photon interaction and a nearly field-independent beta-photon interaction. This asymmetric behavior enables continuous, single-parameter control spanning from dispersive to strong coupling regimes. In the dispersive limit, our analysis reveals cavity-mediated magnon-magnon coupling, while near triple resonance the normal modes reorganize into bright and dark superpositions governed by a single collective energy scale. The calculated transmission exhibits vacuum-Rabi splittings, dispersive shifts, and Fano-like lineshapes that provide concrete experimental benchmarks and suggest potential for programmable filtering and coherent state transfer across the gigahertz-terahertz frequency range if realized experimentally with suitable interfaces.</description>

      <title>Fluorine-substitution-dependent phase diagram and superconducting properties of Sm-based oxypnictides synthesized by a high-pressure growth technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05177v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A series of SmFeAsO1-xFx (Sm1111) bulk samples (x = 0.05 to 0.40) are synthesized by an in-situ cubic-anvil high-pressure technique at 4 GPa and systematically characterized through structural, microstructural, Raman, transport, and magnetic measurements. Structural analysis confirms that the tetragonal Sm1111 phase remains dominant across the entire substitution range, with lattice parameters decreasing smoothly as fluorine content increases, demonstrating effective incorporation of F even in the overdoped regime (x = 0.4). Raman spectroscopy provides complementary, local-phase-sensitive evidence that supports the structural analysis and confirms fluorine substitution in the main Sm1111 phase. In the underdoped region, the superconducting transition temperature (Tc) is enhanced by 10-17 K and the critical current density (Jc) is increased by up to an order of magnitude compared with conventionally synthesized samples at the ambient pressure. The upper critical field, estimated using the WHH model, reaches values approaching 200 T, reflecting strong paramagnetic limitation and multiband effects. TAFF analysis reveals a power-law field dependence of the activation energy, consistent with collective vortex pinning in polycrystalline iron-based superconductors. The superconducting phase diagram constructed from Tc and Jc versus fluorine content reveals a dome-like trend, with a maximum Tc of 57 K and Jc of 10^4 A cm^-2 at the optimal doped region. Comparison with conventionally synthesized Sm1111 samples demonstrates that high-pressure growth significantly extends the effective fluorine substitution range and enhances the superconducting performance, particularly in the underdoped regime. These results establish high-pressure fluorine substitution as an effective materials-engineering approach for tuning the phase diagram and optimizing the superconducting properties of Sm1111.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Sensitivity to Blackbody Radiation in Spintronic Poisson Bolometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12490v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-sensitivity long-wave infrared (LWIR) detection is crucial for observing weak thermal radiation. Recently, the Poisson bolometer is proposed as a fundamentally new platform for uncooled infrared detection. In contrast to traditional analog detectors, where signal and noise are continuous currents or voltages, the Poisson bolometer has both signal and noise governed by Poissonian counting statistics regardless of the light source. In this work, uncooled infrared detection is advanced toward cryogenic-level sensitivity through the integration of spintronic materials and plasmonic materials. Specifically, a plasmonic absorber optimized for broadband LWIR absorption is experimentally integrated with a spintronic Poisson bolometer to enhance thermal coupling and temperature rise in the sensing layer. The plasmonic absorber exhibits an absorptance exceeding 60\% across the LWIR spectrum, matching the peak of room-temperature blackbody radiation. The device achieves a noise-equivalent temperature difference (NEDT) of 35 mK at a 50 Hz frame rate and multiple results close to or below 100 mK, demonstrating room-temperature performance comparable to the most sensitive uncooled LWIR detectors reported to date. This work opens up pathways to high-sensitivity LWIR detection and imaging applications, including remote sensing, high-speed imaging, and industrial monitoring, while eliminating bulky and expensive cooling requirements.</description>

      <title>Optical Response in Spintronic Poisson Bolometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14968v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Analog bolometers based on temperature-dependent phase-transition materials such as vanadium oxide (VOx) and barium titanate (BTO) represent the state of the art in uncooled infrared detectors. Recently, the first room-temperature spintronic Poisson bolometer based on magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) was proposed and demonstrated as a promising infrared detector. Unlike conventional bolometers, the spintronic Poisson bolometer operates in a probabilistic regime dominated by Poissonian noise, where the response is governed by resistance fluctuations arising from thermally activated magnetization transitions. Spontaneous transitions between two metastable magnetic states occur even in the absence of incident light, and the transition probability increases under illumination. In this work, we experimentally study the statistical properties of the optical response of the spintronic Poisson bolometer under illumination. We demonstrate that transitions in spintronic Poisson bolometers, both in the absence and presence of light, exhibit Poissonian behavior, with transition rates and interarrival times modulated by incident radiation. Under illumination, we observe a 153% increase in the count rate accompanied by a 70% reduction in interarrival time. These results establish spintronic Poisson bolometers as a promising platform for probabilistic, high-speed, and high-sensitivity infrared detection at room temperature.</description>
