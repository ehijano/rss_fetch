      <title>A simple inverse power method for balanced graph cut</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The existing inverse power ($\mathbf{IP}$) method for solving the balanced graph cut lacks local convergence and its inner subproblem requires a nonsmooth convex solver. To address these issues, we develop a simple inverse power ($\mathbf{SIP}$) method using a novel equivalent continuous formulation of the balanced graph cut, and its inner subproblem allows an explicit analytic solution, which is the biggest advantage over $\mathbf{IP}$ and constitutes the main reason why we call it $\mathit{simple}$. By fully exploiting the closed-form of the inner subproblem solution, we design a boundary-detected subgradient selection with which $\mathbf{SIP}$ is proved to be locally converged. We show that $\mathbf{SIP}$ is also applicable to a new ternary valued $\theta$-balanced cut which reduces to the balanced cut when $\theta=1$. When $\mathbf{SIP}$ reaches its local optimum, we seamlessly transfer to solve the $\theta$-balanced cut within exactly the same iteration algorithm framework and thus obtain $\mathbf{SIP}$-$\mathbf{perturb}$ -- an efficient local breakout improvement of $\mathbf{SIP}$, which transforms some ``partitioned" vertices back to the ``un-partitioned" ones through the adjustable $\theta$. Numerical experiments on G-set for Cheeger cut and Sparsest cut demonstrate that $\mathbf{SIP}$ is significantly faster than $\mathbf{IP}$ while maintaining approximate solutions of comparable quality, and $\mathbf{SIP}$-$\mathbf{perturb}$ outperforms $\mathtt{Gurobi}$ in terms of both computational cost and solution quality.</description>

      <title>The Hoffman-Wielandt inequality for quaternion matrices and quaternion matrix polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.07638v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The purpose of this manuscript is to derive the Hoffman-Wielandt inequality and its most general form for quaternion matrices. Diagonalizabilty of the block companion matrix of certain quadratic (linear) quaternion matrix polynomials is brought out. As a consequence, we prove that if $Q(\lambda)$ is another quadratic (linear) quaternion matrix polynomial, then under certain conditions on the coefficients, a generalization of the Hoffman-Wielandt inequality for their corresponding block companion matrices holds. We also prove that if $P(\lambda)$ is a quaternion matrix polynomial with unitary coefficients, then any right eigenvalue $\lambda_0$ of $P(\lambda)$ lies in the annular region $\frac{1}{2} &lt; |\lambda_0| &lt; 2$.</description>

      <title>A "lifting" method for exponential large deviation estimates and an application to certain non-stationary 1D lattice Anderson models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.02274v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Proofs of localization for random Schr\"odinger operators with sufficiently regular distribution of the potential can take advantage of the fractional moment method introduced by Aizenman-Molchanov, or use the classical Wegner estimate as part of another method, e.g. the multi-scale analysis introduced by Fr\"ohlich-Spencer and significantly developed by Klein and his collaborators. When the potential distribution is singular, most proofs rely crucially on exponential estimates of events corresponding to finite truncations of the operator in question; these estimates in some sense substitute for the classical Wegner estimate. We introduce a method to "lift" such estimates, which have been obtained for many stationary models, to certain closely related non-stationary models. As an application, we use this method to derive Anderson localization on the 1-D lattice for certain non-stationary potentials along the lines of the non-perturbative approach developed by Jitomirskaya-Zhu in 2019.</description>

      <title>PT-symmetry enabled stable modes in multi-core fiber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08814v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Open systems with balanced gain and loss, described by parity-time PT-symmetric Hamiltonians have been deeply explored over the past decade. Most explorations are limited to finite discrete models (in real or reciprocal spaces) or continuum problems in one dimension. As a result, these models do not leverage the complexity and variability of two-dimensional continuum problems on a compact support. Here, we investigate eigenvalues of the Schrodinger equation on a disk with zero boundary condition, in the presence of constant, PT-symmetric, gain-loss potential that is confined to two mirror-symmetric disks. We find a rich variety of exceptional points, re-entrant PT-symmetric phases, and a non-monotonic dependence of the PT-symmetry breaking threshold on the system parameters. By comparing results of two model variations, we show that this simple model of a multi-core fiber supports propagating modes in the presence of gain and loss.</description>
