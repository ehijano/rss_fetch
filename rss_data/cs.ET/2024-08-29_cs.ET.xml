      <title>UAV's Rotor Micro-Doppler Feature Extraction Using Integrated Sensing and Communication Signal: Algorithm Design and Testbed Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rapid application of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in urban areas, the identification and tracking of hovering UAVs have become critical challenges, significantly impacting the safety of aircraft take-off and landing operations. As a promising technology for 6G mobile systems, integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) can be used to detect high-mobility UAVs with a low deployment cost. The micro-Doppler signals from UAV rotors can be leveraged to address the detection of low-mobility and hovering UAVs using ISAC signals. However, determining whether the frame structure of the ISAC system can be used to identify UAVs, and how to accurately capture the weak rotor micro-Doppler signals of UAVs in complex environments, remain two challenging problems. This paper first proposes a novel frame structure for UAV micro-Doppler extraction and the representation of UAV micro-Doppler signals within the channel state information (CSI). Furthermore, to address complex environments and the interference caused by UAV body vibrations, the rotor micro-Doppler null space pursuit (rmD-NSP) algorithm and the feature extraction algorithm synchroextracting transform (SET) are designed to effectively separate UAV's rotor micro-Doppler signals and enhance their features in the spectrogram. Finally, both simulation and hardware testbed demonstrate that the proposed rmD-NSP algorithm enables the ISAC base station (BS) to accurately and completely extract UAV's rotor micro-Doppler signals. Within a 0.1s observation period, ISAC BS successfully captures eight rotations of the DJI M300 RTK UAV's rotor in urban environments. Compared to the existing AM-FM NSP and NSP signal decomposition algorithms, the integrity of the rotor micro-Doppler features is improved by 60%.</description>

      <title>Beyond Diagonal IRS Assisted Ultra Massive THz Systems: A Low Resolution Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15880</link>

Abstract: The terahertz communications have the potential to revolutionize data transfer with unmatched speed and facilitate the development of new high-bandwidth applications. This paper studies the performance of downlink terahertz system assisted by beyond diagonal intelligent reconfigurable surface (BD-IRS). For enhanced energy efficiency and low cost, a joint precoding and BD-IRS phase shift design satisfying the $1$-bit resolution constraints to maximize the spectral efficiency is presented. The original problem is non-linear, NP-hard, and intricately coupled, and obtaining an optimal solution is challenging. To reduce the complexity, we first transform the optimization problem into two problems and then iteratively solve them to achieve an efficient solution. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed approach for the BD-IRS assisted terahertz system significantly enhances the spectral efficiency compared to the conventional diagonal IRS assisted system.</description>

      <title>Harvesting Brownian Motion: Zero Energy Computational Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.06957v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The key factor currently limiting the advancement of computational power of electronic computation is no longer the manufacturing density and speed of components, but rather their high energy consumption. While it has been widely argued that reversible computation can escape the fundamental Landauer limit of $k_B T\ln(2)$ Joules per irreversible computational step, there is disagreement around whether indefinitely reusable computation can be achieved without energy dissipation. Here we focus on the relatively simpler context of sampling problems, which take no input, so avoids modeling the energy costs of the observer perturbing the machine to change its input. Given an algorithm $A$ for generating samples from a distribution, we desire a device that can perpetually generate samples from that distribution driven entirely by Brownian motion. We show that such a device can efficiently execute algorithm $A$ in the sense that we must wait only $O(\text{time}(A)^2)$ between samples. We consider two output models: Las Vegas, which samples from the exact probability distribution every $4$ tries in expectation, and Monte Carlo, in which every try succeeds but the distribution is only approximated. We base our model on continuous-time random walks over the state space graph of a general computational machine, with a space-bounded Turing machine as one instantiation. The problem of sampling a computationally complex probability distribution with no energy dissipation informs our understanding of the energy requirements of computation, and may lead to more energy efficient randomized algorithms.</description>

      <title>Quantum Annealing for Enhanced Feature Selection in Single-Cell RNA Sequencing Data Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08867v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Feature selection is vital for identifying relevant variables in classification and regression models, especially in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data analysis. Traditional methods like LASSO often struggle with the nonlinearities and multicollinearities in scRNA-seq data due to complex gene expression and extensive gene interactions. Quantum annealing, a form of quantum computing, offers a promising solution. In this study, we apply quantum annealing-empowered quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) for feature selection in scRNA-seq data. Using data from a human cell differentiation system, we show that QUBO identifies genes with nonlinear expression patterns related to differentiation time, many of which play roles in the differentiation process. In contrast, LASSO tends to select genes with more linear expression changes. Our findings suggest that the QUBO method, powered by quantum annealing, can reveal complex gene expression patterns that traditional methods might overlook, enhancing scRNA-seq data analysis and interpretation.</description>
