      <title>Contact feedback helps snake robots propel against uneven terrain using vertical bending</title>

      <description>arXiv:2112.07815v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Snakes can bend their elongate bodies in various forms to traverse various environments. We understand how snakes use lateral bending to push against asperities on flat ground for propulsion, and snake robots can do so effectively. However, snakes can also use vertical bending to push against terrain of large height variation for propulsion, and they can adjust it to adapt to novel terrain presumably using mechano-sensing feedback control. Although some snake robots can traverse uneven terrain, few have used vertical bending for propulsion, and how to control it in novel environments is poorly understood. Here we systematically studied a snake robot with force sensors pushing against large bumps using vertical bending to understand the role of sensory feedback control. We compared a feedforward controller and four feedback controllers that use different senses and generate distinct bending patterns and body-terrain interaction. We challenged the robot with increasing backward load and novel terrain geometry that break its contact with the terrain. We further varied how much the feedback control modulated bending to conform to or push against the terrain to test their effects. Feedforward propagation of vertical bending generated large propulsion when the shape matched terrain geometry. However, when perturbations caused loss of contact, the robot easily lost propulsion or had motor overload. Contact feedback control resolved these by improving contact. Yet excessive conformation interrupted propagation and excessive pushing stalled motors. Unlike that using lateral bending, for propulsion generation using vertical bending, body weight can help maintain contact with the environment but may also overload motors. Our results will help snake robots better traverse terrain with large height variation and can inform how snakes use sensory feedback to control vertical bending for propulsion.</description>

      <title>Super-resolved anomalous diffusion: deciphering the joint distribution of anomalous exponent and diffusion coefficient</title>

Abstract: The molecular motion in heterogeneous media displays anomalous diffusion by the mean-squared displacement $\langle X^2(t) \rangle = 2 D t^\alpha$. Motivated by experiments reporting populations of the anomalous diffusion parameters $\alpha$ and $D$, we aim to disentangle their respective contributions to the observed variability when this last is due to a true population of these parameters and when it arises due to finite-duration recordings. We introduce estimators of the anomalous diffusion parameters on the basis of the time-averaged mean squared displacement and study their statistical properties. By using a copula approach, we derive a formula for the joint density function of their estimations conditioned on their actual values. The methodology introduced is indeed universal, it is valid for any Gaussian process and can be applied to any quadratic time-averaged statistics. We also explain the experimentally reported relation $D\propto\exp(\alpha c_1+c_2)$ for which we provide the exact expression. We finally compare our findings to numerical simulations of the fractional Brownian motion and quantify their accuracy by using the Hellinger distance.</description>

      <title>ML-PWS: Estimating the Mutual Information Between Experimental Time Series Using Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16509v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ability to quantify information transmission is crucial for the analysis and design of natural and engineered systems. The information transmission rate is the fundamental measure for systems with time-varying signals, yet computing it is extremely challenging. In particular, the rate cannot be obtained directly from experimental time-series data without approximations, because of the high dimensionality of the signal trajectory space. Path Weight Sampling (PWS) is a computational technique that makes it possible to obtain the information rate exactly for any stochastic system. However, it requires a mathematical model of the system of interest, be it described by a master equation or a set of differential equations. Here, we present a technique that employs Machine Learning (ML) to develop a generative model from experimental time-series data, which is then combined with PWS to obtain the information rate. We demonstrate the accuracy of this technique, called ML-PWS, by comparing its results on synthetic time-series data generated from a non-linear model against ground-truth results obtained by applying PWS directly to the same model. We illustrate the utility of ML-PWS by applying it to neuronal time-series data.</description>

      <title>SenSnake: A snake robot with contact force sensing for studying locomotion in complex 3-D terrain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.09078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.09078v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite advances in a diversity of environments, snake robots are still far behind snakes in traversing complex 3-D terrain with large obstacles. This is due to a lack of understanding of how to control 3-D body bending to push against terrain features to generate and control propulsion. Biological studies suggested that generalist snakes use contact force sensing to adjust body bending in real time to do so. However, studying this sensory-modulated force control in snakes is challenging, due to a lack of basic knowledge of how their force sensing organs work. Here, we take a robophysics approach to make progress, starting by developing a snake robot capable of 3-D body bending with contact force sensing to enable systematic locomotion experiments and force measurements. Through two development and testing iterations, we created a 12-segment robot with 36 piezo-resistive sheet sensors distributed on all segments with compliant shells with a sampling frequency of 30 Hz. The robot measured contact forces while traversing a large obstacle using vertical bending with high repeatability, achieving the goal of providing a platform for systematic experiments. Finally, we explored model-based calibration considering the viscoelastic behavior of the piezo-resistive sensor, which will for useful for future studies.</description>
