      <title>Observation of Higher-order Topological Bound States in the Continuum using Ultracold Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulating higher-order topological materials in synthetic quantum matter is an active research frontier for its theoretical significance in fundamental physics and promising applications in quantum technologies. Here we experimentally implement two-dimensional (2D) momentum lattices with highly programmable ability using ultracold 87Rb atoms. Through precise control of experimental parameters, we simulate a 2D Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model with this technique, and observe the characteristic dynamics of corner and edge-bound states, where the corner state is identified as a higher-order topological bound state in the continuum. We further study the adiabatic preparation of the corner state by engineering evolutions with time-dependent Hamiltonians. We also demonstrate the higher-order topological phase transition by measuring both the bulk topological invariant and the topological corner state. Our new platform opens the avenue for exploring the exotic dynamics and topology in higher synthetic dimensions, making use of the rich degrees of freedom of cold atoms systems.</description>

      <title>Revealing turbulent Dark Matter via merging of self-Gravitating condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-gravitating condensates have been proposed as potential candidates for modelling dark matter. In this paper, we numerically investigate the dynamics of dark matter utilizing the merging of self-gravitating condensates. We have used the Gross-Pitaevskii-Poisson model and identified distinct turbulent regimes based on the merging speed of the condensate. As a result of collision, we notice the appearance of various dark soliton-mediated instabilities that finally lead to the turbulent state characterized by Kolmogorov-like turbulence scaling \( \varepsilon_{\mathrm{kin}}^i \sim k^{-5/3} \) in the infrared and \( \varepsilon_{\mathrm{kin}}^i \sim k^{-3} \) in the ultraviolet regions. The compressible spectrum suggests weak-wave turbulence. The turbulent fluctuations in the condensate cease as the vortices formed via soliton decay are expelled to the condensate's periphery, manifested in the transferring of kinetic energy from incompressible and compressible flows to the quantum pressure energy. We also establish the significant role played by the self-gravitating trap in determining the distribution of compressible kinetic energy and the resulting density waves, which differ markedly from those observed in atomic condensates under harmonic confinement. Our study may offer valuable insights into the merging of binary stars and open new avenues for understanding the structure and dynamics of the dark matter through self-gravitating condensate.</description>

      <title>Transport of magnetically sensitive atoms in a magnetic environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06640v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Among interesting applications of cold atoms, quantum simulations attract a lot of attention. In this context, rare-earth ultracold atoms are particularly appealing for such simulators due to their numerous Fano-Feshbach resonances and magnetic dipole moments in the ground state. Creating a quantum gas microscope requires a large optical access that may be achieved using transport of atoms between separate vacuum volumes. We demonstrate that in case of the transport of magnetic atoms the magnetic field can be directly measured and adjusted to reduce additional losses after the transport therefore increasing the efficiency of subsequent evaporation cooling. This approach allows to transfer over 85% of the atoms from the main chamber to the scientific chamber, located 38 cm away with moderate laser power of 26 W without atomic polarization decay.</description>

      <title>Optically and remotely controlling localization of exciton polariton condensates in a potential lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03625v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exciton polaritons are inherently tunable systems with adjustable potential landscape. In this work we show that exciton polariton condensates can be selectively localized in a fixed optically induced periodic lattice with uniform potential depth, by judiciously controlling a second focused pump of very small size away from the lattice chain. Specifically, the localized polariton condensate can be tuned among different potential traps by adjusting the relative distance between the small pump spot and the potential lattice. The adjustment of the excitation position of the smaller pump spot and its combination with the fixed larger pump spot for the potential creation induce the mode selection determined by gain profile, group velocity, and potential distribution within the system. The localization of the exciton polariton condensate and its control are independent of the orientation of the potential lattice, thus, even in slightly disordered system, one can selectively excite such localized polariton condensates. Our results illuminate a path to the remote manipulation of exciton polariton bosonic condensates in fixed integrated photonic chips and circuits.</description>

      <title>Coalescing hardcore-boson condensate states with nonzero momentum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13297v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exceptional points (EPs), as an exclusive feature of a non-Hermitian system, support coalescing states to be alternative stable state beyond the ground state. In this work, we explore the influence of non-Hermitian impurities on the dynamic formation of condensate states in one-, two-, and three-dimensional extended Bose-Hubbard systems with strong on-site interaction. Based on the solution for the hardcore limit, we show exactly that condensate modes with off-diagonal long-range order (ODLRO) can exist when certain system parameters satisfy specific matching conditions. Under open boundary conditions, the condensate states become coalescing states when the non-Hermitian $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric boundary gives rise to the EPs. The fundamental mechanism behind this phenomenon is uncovered through analyzing the scattering dynamics of many-particle wavepackets at the non-Hermitian boundaries. The EP dynamics facilitate the dynamic generation of condensate states with non-zero momentum. To further substantiate the theoretical findings, numerical simulations are conducted. This study not only unveils the potential condensation of interacting bosons but also offers an approach for the engineering of condensate states.</description>

      <title>Three-body forces and Efimov physics in nuclei and atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09807v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This review article presents historical developments and recent advances in our understanding on the three-body forces and Efimov physics, from an interdisciplinary viewpoint encompassing nuclear physics and cold atoms. Theoretical attempts to elucidate the three-body force with the chiral effective field theory are explained, followed by an overview of experiments aimed at observing signatures of the nuclear three-body force. Some recent experimental and theoretical works in the field of cold atoms devoted to measuring and engineering three-body forces among atoms are also presented. As a phenomenon arising from the three-body effect, Efimov physics in both cold atoms and nuclear systems is reviewed.</description>
