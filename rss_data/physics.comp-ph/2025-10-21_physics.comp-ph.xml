      <title>Design of Magnetic Lattices with Quantum Optimization Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article investigates the identification of magnetic spin distributions in ferromagnetic materials by minimizing the system's free energy. Magnetic lattices of varying sizes are constructed, and the free energy is computed using an Ising model that accounts for spin-to-spin neighbor interactions and the influence of an external magnetic field. The problem reduces to determining the state of each spin, either up or down, leading to an optimization problem with $2^{n \times n}$ design variables for an $n \times n$ lattice. To address the high-dimensional and computationally intractable nature of this problem, particularly for large domains, we employ a quantum optimization algorithm, BQP. The BQP results are first validated against solutions obtained using a genetic algorithm for smaller lattices. Finally, the approach is extended to large-scale systems, including $50 \times 50$ lattices, where conventional methods become impractical.</description>

      <title>Extended phase-space symplectic integration for electron dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the use of extended phase-space symplectic integration [M. Tao, Phys. Rev. E 94, 043303 (2016)] for simulating two different classes of electron dynamics. The first one, with one and a half degrees of freedom, comes from plasma physics and describes the classical dynamics of a charged particle in a strong, constant, and uniform magnetic field perturbed by a turbulent electrostatic potential. The second one, with an infinite number of degrees of freedom, comes from physical chemistry and corresponds to Kohn-Sham time-dependent density-functional theory. For both we lay out the extension procedure and stability condition for numerical integration of the dynamics using high-order symplectic split-operator schemes. We also identify a computationally inexpensive metric that can be used for on-the-fly estimation of the accuracy of simulations. Our work paves the way for broad application of symplectic split-operator integration of classical and quantum Hamiltonian systems with finite and infinite number of degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Scalable cell filter nudged elastic band (CFNEB) for large-scale transition-path calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nudged elastic band (NEB) method is one of the most widely used techniques for determining minimum-energy reaction pathways and activation barriers between known initial and final states. However, conventional implementations face steep computational scaling with system size, which makes nucleation-type transitions in realistically large supercells practically inaccessible. In this work, we develop a scalable cell-filter nudged elastic band (CFNEB) framework that enables efficient transition-path calculations in systems containing up to $10^5$ atoms. The method combines a deformation-based cell filtering scheme, which treats lattice vectors as generalized coordinates while removing spurious rotational degrees of freedom, with an adaptive image insertion and deletion strategy that dynamically refines the reaction path. We implement CFNEB both within the ASE environment and in a fully GPU-accelerated version using the Graphics Processing Units Molecular Dynamics (GPUMD) engine, achieving throughput on the order of $10^6$ atom$\cdot$steps per second on consumer GPUs. We demonstrate the method on two representative systems: the layer-by-layer $\beta$-$\lambda$ transition in $Ti_3O_5$ and the nucleation-driven graphite-to-diamond transformation. These examples illustrate that CFNEB not only reproduces known concerted pathways but also captures spontaneous symmetry breaking toward nucleated mechanisms when the simulation cell is sufficiently large. Our results establish CFNEB as a practical route to exploring realistic transition mechanisms in large-scale solid-state systems.</description>

      <title>Thermal Conductivity Estimation of Thermoelectric Materials with Uncertainty Quantification Using Bayesian Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Characterizing the temperature-dependent thermal conductivity is challenging because the property varies strongly with temperature and reliable heat flow measurement, not just temperature sensing, is difficult under experimental conditions. Here, we present a physics informed deep learning framework that infers conductivity solely from sparse electric potential measurements. We first develop a deterministic physics-informed neural network (PINN) that embeds coupled thermoelectric transport equations as soft constraints, enabling simultaneous recovery of spatial temperature, voltage, and conductivity profiles without temperature data. The deterministic PINN achieves accurate inference under noise-free conditions, yet its predictions degrade when measurement noise is introduced. To address this, we extend the framework to a Bayesian PINN, which models network parameters probabilistically and employs Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) sampling for posterior inference. This extension produces robust thermal conductivity estimates and, importantly, provides credible intervals that quantify uncertainty from sparse and noisy data. Numerical experiments confirm that the Bayesian PINN not only preserves predictive accuracy under noise but also reveals inference bias and enables uncertainty aware interpretation of material properties. Together, the deterministic and Bayesian formulations establish a scalable and generalizable alternative to conventional methods for determining temperature-dependent properties, offering physics- consistent and risk-aware property inference for thermoelectric systems and other functional materials where direct temperature sensing is impractical</description>

      <title>Large-scale stochastic propagation method beyond the sequential approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $O(N)$ stochastic propagation method, which relies on the numerical solution of the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation using random initial states, is widely used in large-scale first-principles calculations. In this work, we eliminate the conventional sequential computation of intermediate states by introducing a concurrent strategy that minimizes information redundancy. The new method, in its state-, moment-, and energy-based implementations, not only surpasses the time step constraint of sequential propagation but also maintains precision within the framework of the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem. Systematic benchmarking on one billion atoms within the tight-binding model demonstrates that our new concurrent method achieves up to an order-of-magnitude speedup, enabling the rapid computation of a wide range of electronic, optical, and transport properties. This performance breakthrough offers valuable insights for enhancing other time-propagation algorithms, including those employed in large-scale stochastic density functional theory.</description>

      <title>Performance of artificial neural networks in an inverse problem of laser beam diagnostics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Results are presented for the numerical verification of a method devised to identify an unknown spatio-temporal distribution of heat flux that occurs at the surface of thin aluminum plate, as a result of pulsed, high-power laser beam excitation. The presented identification of boundary heat flux function is a part of newly-proposed laser beam profiling method and utilizes artificial neural networks trained on temperature distributions generated with the ANSYS Fluent solver. The paper focuses on the selection of the most effective neural network hyperparameters (Keras, Tensorflow) and compares the results of neural network identification with Levenberg-Marquardt method used earlier and discussed in our previous articles.</description>

      <title>Near-field radiative heat transfer in the dual nanoscale regime between polaritonic membranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The enhancement and attenuation of near-field radiative heat transfer between polaritonic SiC, SiN and SiO2 subwavelength membranes is analyzed. Fluctuational electrodynamics simulations combined with a modal analysis show that all membranes support corner and edge modes, which can induce a large 5.1-fold enhancement for SiC and a 2.1-fold attenuation for SiO2 of the heat transfer coefficient with respect to that between infinite surfaces. The enhancement or attenuation is directly related to material losses which reduce the density of available electromagnetic states between the membranes.</description>

      <title>Numerical modeling of laser cooling in molecules: From simple diatomics to polyatomics and radioactive species</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical Bloch equations and rate equations serve as powerful tools to model light-matter interactions from textbook-like two-level atoms to the complex internal dynamics of molecules. A particular challenge in this context is posed by molecular laser cooling, where many dozens or hundreds of levels need to be taken into account for a comprehensive modeling. Here, we present MoleCool, a numerically efficient Python toolbox to implement and solve the corresponding differential equation systems. We illustrate both the capabilities of the toolbox and some of the intricacies of molecular laser cooling by educational examples, which range from simple Rabi oscillations to spontaneous and coherent cooling schemes for various currently studied or considered molecular species. This includes, in particular, a comprehensive modeling of laser cooling dynamics with full hyperfine structure resolution in radioactive radium monofluoride (RaF), as well as studies of other complex species such as barium monofluoride (BaF) and ytterbium monohydroxide (YbOH).</description>

      <title>Electron Localization in Non-Compact Covalent Bonds Captured by the r2SCAN+V Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In density functional theory, the SCAN (Strongly Constrained and Appropriately Normed) and r2SCAN functionals significantly improve over generalized gradient approximation functionals such as PBE (Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof) in predicting electronic, magnetic, and structural properties across various materials, including transition-metal compounds. However, there remain puzzling cases where SCAN and r2SCAN underperform, such as in calculating the band structure of graphene, the magnetic moment of Fe, the potential energy curve of the Cr2 molecule, and the bond length of VO2. This research identifies a common characteristic among these challenging materials: non-compact covalent bonding through s-s, p-p, or d-d electron hybridization. While SCAN and r2SCAN excel at capturing electron localization at local atomic sites, they struggle to accurately describe electron localization in non-compact covalent bonds, resulting in a biased improvement. To address this issue, we propose the r2SCAN+V approach as a practical modification that improves accuracy across all the tested materials. The parameter V is 4 eV for metallic Fe, but substantially lower for the other cases. Our findings provide valuable insights for the future development of advanced functionals.</description>

      <title>Equivalence of additive and parametric pinning control protocols for systems of weakly coupled oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Controlling the behavior of nonlinear systems on networks is a paramount task in control theory, in particular the control of synchronization, given its vast applicability. In this work, we focus on pinning control and we examine two different approaches: the first, more common in engineering applications, where the control is implemented through an external input (additive pinning); the other, where the parameters of the pinned nodes are varied (parametric pinning). By means of the phase reduction technique, we show that the two pinning approaches are equivalent for weakly coupled systems exhibiting periodic oscillatory behaviors. Through numerical simulations, we validate the claim for a system of coupled Stuart--Landau oscillators. Our results pave the way for further applications of pinning control in real-world systems.</description>

      <title>Efficient High-Accuracy PDEs Solver with the Linear Attention Neural Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural operators offer a powerful data-driven framework for learning mappings between function spaces, in which the transformer-based neural operator architecture faces a fundamental scalability-accuracy trade-off: softmax attention provides excellent fidelity but incurs quadratic complexity $\mathcal{O}(N^2 d)$ in the number of mesh points $N$ and hidden dimension $d$, while linear attention variants reduce cost to $\mathcal{O}(N d^2)$ but often suffer significant accuracy degradation. To address the aforementioned challenge, in this paper, we present a novel type of neural operators, Linear Attention Neural Operator (LANO), which achieves both scalability and high accuracy by reformulating attention through an agent-based mechanism. LANO resolves this dilemma by introducing a compact set of $M$ agent tokens $(M \ll N)$ that mediate global interactions among $N$ tokens. This agent attention mechanism yields an operator layer with linear complexity $\mathcal{O}(MN d)$ while preserving the expressive power of softmax attention. Theoretically, we demonstrate the universal approximation property, thereby demonstrating improved conditioning and stability properties. Empirically, LANO surpasses current state-of-the-art neural PDE solvers, including Transolver with slice-based softmax attention, achieving average $19.5\%$ accuracy improvement across standard benchmarks. By bridging the gap between linear complexity and softmax-level performance, LANO establishes a scalable, high-accuracy foundation for scientific machine learning applications.</description>

      <title>Intermediate-Band Formation in Tm3+-doped Ca2SnO4: A Wide-Gap Oxide Host for Visible-Light Absorption and Energy Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rare earth doping is an effective way to convert chemically stable oxides into multifunctional materials with coupled electronic, optical, and magnetic properties. We present first principles calculations of pristine and Tm3+ doped Ca2SnO4 to understand how localized 4f states change the structural, electronic, magnetic, and optical behavior of the host. Pristine Ca2SnO4 is a mechanically stable, wide band gap insulator with mostly ionic covalent bonding and diamagnetic character. Replacing Ca2+ with Tm3+ introduces several key changes: (i) localized Tm 4f states create intermediate levels inside the wide gap, reducing the optical band gap; (ii) exchange and spin orbit interactions generate strong local magnetic moments and spin asymmetry near the conduction band; (iii) electron localization function analysis shows enhanced covalency and electron pockets that stabilize luminescent centers; and (iv) the optical response shows visible range absorption, refractive index features, and low energy plasmon peaks while maintaining high energy dielectric stability. These effects make Tm doped Ca2SnO4 a mechanically robust, optically tunable, and magnetically active oxide phosphor suitable for red emission, intermediate band photovoltaics, and spin photon coupling. More broadly, our results show how targeted rare earth substitution can enable multifunctionality in wide gap stannates and guide the design of next generation spintronic photonic oxides.</description>

      <title>Optimized Single-Core PCF-Based SPR Biosensor for High-Performance Early-Stage Multi-Cancer Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we present a highly sensitive Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR)-based biosensor integrated with a circular-lattice Photonic Crystal Fiber (PCF) for early-stage cancer detection. The proposed sensor leverages the synergy between SPR and PCF technologies to overcome the bulkiness and limited sensitivity of traditional SPR systems. A thin gold (Au) layer, responsible for plasmon excitation, is deposited on the fiber structure, while a nanolayer of vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) is introduced to enhance adhesion between the gold and the silica background, improving structural stability and field confinement. The sensor is designed to detect refractive index (RI) variations in biological analytes, specifically targeting cancerous cells from skin, blood, and adrenal gland tissues. The optical characteristics and performance of the sensor were thoroughly analyzed using the Finite Element Method (FEM) in COMSOL Multiphysics 6.1, allowing for precise simulation and optimization. The sensor demonstrates high sensitivity within the RI range of 1.360-1.395, corresponding to the RI values of the target cancer cells. Remarkable wavelength sensitivities of 21,250 nm/RIU, 53,571 nm/RIU, and 103,571 nm/RIU were achieved for skin, blood, and adrenal gland cancers, respectively. In addition, a maximum figure of merit (FOM) of 306.424 RIU^-1 and a spectral resolution (SR) of 9.57x10^-7 RIU further affirm the sensor's exceptional detection capabilities. These findings indicate the proposed SPR-PCF sensor's strong potential for real-time, label-free biosensing applications, particularly in precise and early cancer diagnostics.</description>

      <title>Geometry-Driven Charge and Spin Transport in $\beta12$ Borophene Quantum Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Theoretical research has been conducted to study how geometry affects charge and spin transport in $\beta\mathrm{12}$ borophene quantum dots, which are confined systems. The study examined two distinct central regions, which included a circular disc and a regular hexagonal area that connected to semi-infinite zigzag and armchair borophene nanoribbon leads. The system was described by a five-band tight-binding Hamiltonian parameterized using first-principles data, and the transport properties were calculated within the non-equilibrium Green's function framework. Spin resolved transmissions and spin polarization were computed for a range of lead widths and proximity-induced exchange field strengths. The analysis revealed distinct transport characteristics determined by geometry and edge configuration: armchair-connected structures exhibited broader and more stable fully spin-polarized windows compared with zigzag-connected counterparts. Furthermore, critical lead-width thresholds ($\approx 1.01$ nm for zigzag and $\approx 0.87$ nm for armchair) and a moderate exchange field above which complete spin filtering occurs were identified. The results highlight the strong influence of edge termination and confinement geometry on transport properties and provide useful design guidelines for developing borophene-based nanoscale spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Toward Autonomous Neural VMC: An Energy-Variance Convergence Criterion for Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The optimization of neural wave functions in variational Monte Carlo(VMC) crucially relies on a robust convergence criterion. While the energy variance is theoretically a definitive measure of an eigenstate, its systematic application as a primary, practical convergence criterion in neural-network VMC has been underexplored. In this work, we propose and validate the energy variance as a universal, quantitative criterion for convergence. Then its reliability is demonstrated across diverse quantum systems-from harmonic oscillators and hydrogen atoms to charmonium hadrons-showing that a variance below 1*10^{-3} guarantees relative errors under 1%. This empirical threshold provides a system-agnostic benchmark for convergence, enabling hands-off operation of the optimization process. We implement this criterion within a lightweight neural solver, thereby enabling automated parameter scans. Its utility is showcased by efficiently mapping ground-state properties of a 2D double-well potential, a hydrogen atom in a magnetic field, and a three-body quantum dot. Our work positions the energy-variance criterion as a robust and scalable tool that significantly accelerates the preliminary physical verification of quantum Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>N\'eel-Vector-Orientation Induced Intrinsic Half-Metallicity in Two-Dimensional Altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Altermagnets combine zero net magnetization with giant spin splitting, enabling spin-polarized transport without strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC). Deterministically selecting the conducting spin channel, however, requires breaking the 90 degree rotation and time-reversal antisymmetry (C4zT). Using standard axial vector transformation rules as preliminaries, we show that in monolayer Ta2TeSeO this can be achieved naturally and tuned in a symmetry efficient way by rotating the Neel vector. Without considering the Neel vector, Ta2TeSeO has one pair of mirror protected spin polarized Weyl points in each spin channel. Aligning the Neel vector along the crystallographic x or y direction breaks the mirror symmetry Mx or My, inducing selective mirror symmetry breaking that keeps one spin sector gapless and opens a gap in the opposite spin, yielding fully spin polarized transport. The C2z symmetry breaking makes the preserved two Weyl points inequivalent, turning the half semimetal into a half metallic state. The same orientation selective symmetry reduction applies to lattice vibrations, implying phonon chirality splitting. Owing to the near degenerate in plane anisotropy, reversible zero moment switching is achievable with minute in plane strain or weak magnetic fields, and the lattice coupling suggests control by circularly polarized light. The mechanism extends to other two dimensional decorated Lieb altermagnets lacking horizontal mirror Mz, providing a general low power route to spin filtering and logic.</description>

      <title>Semi-supervised Latent Bayesian Optimization for Designing Antimicrobial Peptides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are a promising class of therapeutics to treat bacterial infections. Discovering and designing such peptides is difficult because of the vast number of possible sequences of amino acids. Deep generative models, such as variational autoencoders, have shown value in peptide design due to their ability to model sequence space with a continuous-valued latent space. Although such models have already been used to great effect in biomolecular design, they still suffer from a lack of interpretability and rigorous quantification of latent space quality as a search space. We investigate (1) whether further compression of the design space via dimensionality reduction may facilitate optimization, (2) the interpretability of the spaces, and (3) how organizing latent spaces with physicochemical properties may improve the efficiency of optimizing antimicrobial activity. We find that further reduction of the latent space via dimensionality reduction can be advantageous when organizing the space with more relevant information at data availability, that using the dimensionality reduction search space can be more interpretable, and that we can organize the latent space with different physicochemical properties even at different percentages of available labels.</description>

      <title>A volume-of-fluid model for biomass particle pyrolysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerical models of biomass particle pyrolysis focus on either the solid particle evolution or on the surrounding gas-phase dynamics, neglecting the coupled interactions between the two. This work addresses this limitation by proposing a single-grid model that fully resolves both phases without relying on sub-grid-scale correlations. The model adopts an Eulerian representation of the two-phase system, using a Volume-Of-Fluid (VOF) method to track the interface between the biomass and the surrounding gas phase. Solid-phase pyrolysis reactions are included, and a novel approach is proposed to capture the coupling between the evolution of biomass porosity and the particle shrinkage. The anisotropic nature of the biomass particle is accounted for in this multidimensional framework. The resulting model demonstrates mass conservation and numerical convergence. Extensive validation with experimental data shows excellent agreement in terms of mass and temperature profiles and correct volatiles trends. Shrinking profiles reveal correct trends, but they also highlight the need for a better fundamental understanding of the evolution of the biomass structure. Overall, the model takes a step forward in aiding the development of sustainable pyrolysis processes. The code and simulation setups, developed within the open-source Basilisk framework, are made publicly available.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous rotation and propulsion of suspended capsules in active nematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of elastic capsules suspended in two-dimensional active nematic fluids using lattice Boltzmann simulations. The capsules, modeled as flexible membranes enclosing active internal regions, exhibit a rich variety of behaviors shaped by their geometry and the interplay between internal and external activity. Circular capsules with active interiors undergo persistent rotation driven by internally confined +1/2 topological defects. Axisymmetric capsules, such as boomerangs, develop directed motion along their axis of symmetry due to unbalanced active forces generated by defect distributions near their boundaries. We further show that capsule flexibility suppresses motility and rotation, as active stresses are dissipated into shape deformations. These findings reveal how shape, deformability, and defect dynamics cooperate to produce emergent motility in soft active matter, with potential applications in the design of microswimmers and drug delivery vehicles.</description>

      <title>Picosecond-scale Heterogeneous Melting of Metals at Extreme Non-equilibrium States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20886v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extreme electron-ion non-equilibrium states, generated by ultrafast laser excitation, lead to melting processes that are fundamentally different from those under conventional thermal equilibrium and remain not fully understood. Through neural network-enhanced multiscale simulations of tungsten and gold nanofilms, we identify electronic pressure relaxation as critical to heterogeneous phase transformations. This nonthermal expansion generates a density decrease that enable surface-initiated melting far below equilibrium melting temperatures, creating electronic pressure-driven solid-liquid interface propagation at a high speed of 2500 m/s -- tenfold faster than that of thermal heterogeneous melting mechanisms. Simulated time-resolved X-ray diffraction signatures distinguish this nonthermal expansion from thermal expansion dynamics driven by thermoelastic stress. These results establish hot-electron-mediated lattice destabilization as a universal pathway for laser-induced structural transformations, providing new insights for interpreting time-resolved experiments and controlling laser-matter interactions.</description>

      <title>The dawn of alchemical free-energy methods in biomolecular simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04917v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: From the onset of fundamental statistical mechanical constructs formulated in the late 19th century, alchemical free-energy methods slowly emerged and transitioned to become operational tools of biomolecular simulation applicable to a wide range of problems including protein-ligand binding for drug discovery research. This article reconstructs how statistical mechanical approaches such as thermodynamic integration and free-energy perturbation were reconfigured in the early 1980's to address the complexities of increasingly heterogeneous biomolecular systems. Drawing on oral history interviews and primary literature, the study examines the technical, institutional, theoretical, and infrastructural conditions under which these methods were implemented, and became progressively operational. These conditions encompassed the consolidation of lab-specific software infrastructures, the formulation of practical simulation protocols, as well as essential statistical mechanical clarifications. From this perspective, the progress of free-energy methods proceeded less from a unified convergence than from an iterative troubleshooting process of alignment involving practical and theoretical considerations. The aim of the present article is to offer a historically grounded account of how free-energy techniques acquired practical and functional reliability.</description>

      <title>Computational Crystal Plasticity Homogenization using Empirically Corrected Cluster Cubature (E3C) Hyper-Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11187v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The computational homogenization of elastoplastic polycrystals is a challenging task due to the huge number of grains required, their complicated interactions and due to the complexity of crystal plasticity models per se. Despite a few successes of reduced order models, mean field and simplified homogenization approaches often remain the preferred choice. In this work, a recently proposed hyper-reduction method (called E3C) for projection-based Reduced Order Models (pROMs) is applied to the problem of computational homogenization of geometrically linearly deforming elastoplastic polycrystals. The main novelty lies in the identification of reduced modes (the 'E3C-modes'), which replace the strain modes of the reduced-order model, leading to a significantly smaller number of integration points. The peculiarity, which distinguishes the method from more conventional hyper-reduction techniques, is that the E3C integration points are not taken from the set of FE integration points. Instead, they can be interpreted as generalized integration points in strain space which are trained such as to satisfy an orthogonality condition, which ensures that the hyper-reduced model matches the equilibrium states and macroscopic stresses of full-field model data as accurately as possible. In addition, the number of grains is reduced, preserving the main features of the original texture of the finite element model. Two macroscopic engineering parts (untextured and textured) are simulated, illustrating the performance of the method in three-dimensional two-scale applications involving hundreds of thousands macroscopic degrees of freedom and millions of grains with computing times in the order of hours (cumulated online and offline effort) on standard laptop hardware.</description>

      <title>Bayesian inference of general noise-model parameters from the syndrome statistics of surface codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08981v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The performance of error correction in the surface code can be enhanced by leveraging the knowledge of the noise model for physical qubits. To provide accurate noise information to the decoder in parallel with quantum computation, an adaptive estimation of the noise model based on syndrome measurement statistics is an effective approach. While noise model estimation based on syndrome measurement statistics is well-established for Pauli noise, it remains unexplored for more complex and realistic scenarios such as amplitude damping which cannot be represented as a Pauli channel. In this paper, we propose Bayesian inference methods for general noise models, integrating a tensor network simulator of surface code, which can efficiently simulate various noise models, with Monte Carlo sampling techniques. For stationary noise, we propose a method based on the Markov chain Monte Carlo. For time-varying noise, which is a more realistic scenario, we introduce another method based on the sequential Monte Carlo. We present numerical results of applying our proposed methods to various noise models, such as static, time-varying, and nonuniform cases, and evaluate their performance in detail.</description>

      <title>A highly accurate procedure for computing globally optimal Wannier functions in one-dimensional crystalline insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04369v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A standard task in solid state physics and quantum chemistry is the computation of localized molecular orbitals known as Wannier functions. In this manuscript, we propose a new procedure for computing Wannier functions in one-dimensional crystalline materials. Our approach proceeds by first performing parallel transport of the Bloch functions using numerical integration. Then a simple analytically computable correction is introduced to yield the optimally localized Wannier function. The resulting scheme is rapidly convergent and is proven to yield real-valued Wannier functions that achieve global optimality. The analysis in this manuscript can also be viewed as a proof of the existence of exponentially localized Wannier functions in one dimension. We illustrate the performance of the scheme by a number of numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Flow Matching for Accelerated Simulation of Atomic Transport in Crystalline Materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01464v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Atomic transport underpins the performance of materials in technologies such as energy storage and electronics, yet its simulation remains computationally demanding. In particular, modeling ionic diffusion in solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) requires methods that can overcome the scale limitations of traditional ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD). We introduce LiFlow, a generative framework to accelerate MD simulations for crystalline materials that formulates the task as conditional generation of atomic displacements. The model uses flow matching, with a Propagator submodel to generate atomic displacements and a Corrector to locally correct unphysical geometries, and incorporates an adaptive prior based on the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution to account for chemical and thermal conditions. We benchmark LiFlow on a dataset comprising 25-ps trajectories of lithium diffusion across 4,186 SSE candidates at four temperatures. The model obtains a consistent Spearman rank correlation of 0.7-0.8 for lithium mean squared displacement (MSD) predictions on unseen compositions. Furthermore, LiFlow generalizes from short training trajectories to larger supercells and longer simulations while maintaining high accuracy. With speed-ups of up to 600,000$\times$ compared to first-principles methods, LiFlow enables scalable simulations at significantly larger length and time scales.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16827v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kinetic simulations of relativistic gases and plasmas are critical for understanding diverse astrophysical and terrestrial systems, but the accurate construction of the relativistic Maxwellian, the Maxwell-J\"uttner (MJ) distribution, on a discrete simulation grid is challenging. Difficulties arise from the finite velocity bounds of the domain, which may not capture the entire distribution function, as well as errors introduced by projecting the function onto a discrete grid. Here we present a novel scheme for iteratively correcting the moments of the projected distribution applicable to all grid-based discretizations of the relativistic kinetic equation. In addition, we describe how to compute the needed nonlinear quantities, such as Lorentz boost factors, in a discontinuous Galerkin (DG) scheme through a combination of numerical quadrature and weak operations. The resulting method accurately captures the distribution function and ensures that the moments match the desired values to machine precision.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01119v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The intrinsic dimension (ID) is a powerful tool to detect and quantify correlations from data. Recently, it has been successfully applied to study statistical and many-body systems in equilibrium, yet its application to systems away from equilibrium remains largely unexplored. Here we study the ID of nonequilibrium growth dynamics data, and show that even after reducing these data to binary form, their binary intrinsic dimension (BID) retains essential physical information. Specifically, we find that, akin to the surface width, it exhibits Family-Vicsek dynamical scaling -- a fundamental feature to describe universality in surface roughness phenomena. These findings highlight the ability of the BID to correctly discern key properties and correlations in nonequilibrium data, and open an avenue for alternative characterizations of out-of-equilibrium dynamics.</description>

      <title>Primal-dual splitting methods for phase-field surfactant model with moving contact lines</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09469v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Surfactants have important effects on the dynamics of droplets on solid surfaces, which has inspired many industrial applications. Phase-field surfactant model with moving contact lines (PFS-MCL) has been employed to investigate the complex droplet dynamics with surfactants, while its numerical simulation remains challenging due to the coupling of gradient flows with respect to transport distances involving nonlinear and degenerate mobilities. We propose a novel structure-preserving variational scheme for PFS-MCL model with the dynamic boundary condition based on the minimizing movement scheme and optimal transport theory for Wasserstein gradient flows. The proposed scheme consists of a series of convex minimization problems and can be efficiently solved by our proposed primal-dual splitting method and its accelerated versions. By respecting the underlying PDE's variational structure with respect to the transport distance, the proposed scheme is proved to inherits the desirable properties including original energy dissipation, bound-preserving, and mass conservation. Through a suite of numerical simulations, we validate the performance of the proposed scheme and investigate the effects of surfactants on the droplet dynamics.</description>

      <title>PICT -- A Differentiable, GPU-Accelerated Multi-Block PISO Solver for Simulation-Coupled Learning Tasks in Fluid Dynamics</title>

Abstract: Despite decades of advancements, the simulation of fluids remains one of the most challenging areas of in scientific computing. Supported by the necessity of gradient information in deep learning, differentiable simulators have emerged as an effective tool for optimization and learning in physics simulations. In this work, we present our fluid simulator PICT, a differentiable pressure-implicit solver coded in PyTorch with Graphics-processing-unit (GPU) support. We first verify the accuracy of both the forward simulation and our derived gradients in various established benchmarks like lid-driven cavities and turbulent channel flows before we show that the gradients provided by our solver can be used to learn complicated turbulence models in 2D and 3D. We apply both supervised and unsupervised training regimes using physical priors to match flow statistics. In particular, we learn a stable sub-grid scale (SGS) model for a 3D turbulent channel flow purely based on reference statistics. The low-resolution corrector trained with our solver runs substantially faster than the highly resolved references, while keeping or even surpassing their accuracy. Finally, we give additional insights into the physical interpretation of different solver gradients, and motivate a physically informed regularization technique. To ensure that the full potential of PICT can be leveraged, it is published as open source: https://github.com/tum-pbs/PICT.</description>

      <title>Inverse design for robust inference in integrated computational spectrometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02194v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an inverse-design approach for computational spectrometers in which the scattering media are topology-optimized to achieve better performance in inference of unknown spectra. Unlike traditional end-to-end approaches, our inverse design of the scattering media does not need a training set of spectra, a distribution of detector noise, or an inference algorithm. Our approach allows the selection of the inference algorithm to be decoupled from that of the scatterer. For smooth spectra, we additionally devise a regularized reconstruction algorithm based on Chebyshev interpolation, which yields higher accuracy compared with conventional methods in which the spectra are sampled at equally spaced frequencies or wavelengths with equal weights. Our approaches are numerically demonstrated via inverse design of integrated computational spectrometers and reconstruction of example spectra. The inverse-designed spectrometers exhibit significantly better performance in the presence of noise than their counterparts with random scatterers. Our method provides a useful complement to end-to-end co-design methods.</description>

      <title>First-Principles Theory of Five- and Six-Phonon Scatterings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09918v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Higher-order phonon scatterings beyond fourth order remain largely unexplored despite their potential importance in strongly anharmonic materials at elevated temperatures. We develop a theoretical formalism for first-principles calculation of five- and six-phonon scatterings using Green's function techniques based on a diagrammatic formalism, and systematically investigate multi-phonon interactions in Si, MgO, and BaO from room temperature to near melting points. Our calculations reveal dramatically different material-dependent behaviors: while five- and six-phonon processes remain negligible in Si even at high temperatures, they become increasingly important in MgO near its melting point (3100~K) and in BaO at intermediate temperatures (1200~K). Most remarkably, five- and six-phonon scatterings surpass three- and four-phonon scattering intensity in BaO near its melting point (2100~K), reducing lattice thermal conductivity by over 50\%. We demonstrate that the strength of higher-order interactions is primarily governed by interatomic force constants, with BaO exhibiting five- and six-phonon scattering rates over one order of magnitude stronger than MgO despite identical crystal structures, due to large scattering phase space arising from softened harmonic interactions. Our work provides theoretical insights into the lattice dynamics and thermal transport in strongly anharmonic materials and at elevated temperatures.</description>

      <title>Probing non-Markovian qubit noise and modeling Post Markovian Master Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12894v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the noise characteristics of quantum processors is crucial when achieving fault-tolerant quantum computing. However, typical qubit designs are often studied under the Markovian approximation, which does not fully capture realistic dynamics. Factors such as qubit-qubit coupling and extended bath correlation times can introduce significant non-Markovian effects into the noise processes. In this study, we employ the Post-Markovian Master Equation (PMME) formalism to characterize memory effects in the noise dynamics. We further experimentally validate the PMME framework using superconducting qubits on an IBM Quantum device, demonstrating clear non-Markovian behavior during circuit execution. Additionally, we quantify the crosstalk effect using an information-theoretic approach and reveal that crosstalk can dominate the observed non-Markovian effects in current quantum hardware.</description>
