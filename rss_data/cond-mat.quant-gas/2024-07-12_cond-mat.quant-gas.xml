      <title>Uncovering Emergent Spacetime Supersymmetry with Rydberg Atom Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the zoo of emergent symmetries in quantum many-body physics, the previously unrealized emergent spacetime supersymmetry (SUSY) is particularly intriguing. Although it was known that spacetime SUSY could emerge at the (1+1)d tricritical Ising transition, an experimental realization is still absent. In this letter, we propose to realize the tricritical Ising transition with Rydberg atom arrays, taking advantage of the reconfigurability of these systems. In such systems, the spacetime SUSY manifests itself in the respective correlation functions of a bosonic mode and its fermionic partner. However, the correlation function of the fermionic mode inevitably involves a string operator, making direct measurement challenging in the conventional setting. Here, we utilize the analog--digital hybrid nature of the Rydberg atom arrays, which can simulate a physical Hamiltonian and perform a digital quantum circuit on the same platform, to measure the correlation function of the fermionic mode. This hybridized protocol provides an experimentally feasible way to reveal the hidden structure of the spacetime SUSY that emerges at the tricritical Ising transition.</description>

      <title>The ideal gas of Bosons and Fermions in Harmonic Traps in the framework of Extended Uncertainty Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This manuscript studies harmonically trapped ideal Bose and Fermi gas systems and their thermodynamics in the framework of the Extended Uncertainty Principle (EUP). In particular, we reveal how the ground and thermal particle ratios, condensate temperature, internal energy, specific heat and equation of state functions change in the EUP formalism. Nevertheless, we conclude that, in contrast to the effects of the Gravitational (Generalized) Uncertainty Principle (GUP), the EUP modifications can be disregarded in ideal Bose and Fermi gas systems.</description>

      <title>Production and stabilization of a spin mixture of ultracold dipolar Bose gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mixtures of ultracold gases with long-range interactions are expected to open new avenues in the study of quantum matter. Natural candidates for this research are spin mixtures of atomic species with large magnetic moments. However, the lifetime of such assemblies can be strongly affected by the dipolar relaxation that occurs in spin-flip collisions. Here we present experimental results for a mixture composed of the two lowest Zeeman states of $^{162}$Dy atoms, that act as dark states with respect to a light-induced quadratic Zeeman effect. We show that, due to an interference phenomenon, the rate for such inelastic processes is dramatically reduced with respect to the Wigner threshold law. Additionally, we determine the scattering lengths characterizing the s-wave interaction between these states, providing all necessary data to predict the miscibility range of the mixture, depending on its dimensionality.</description>

      <title>An Equation of State for Turbulence in the Gross-Pitaevskii model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the numerical observation of a far-from-equilibrium equation of state (EoS) in the Gross-Pitaevskii model. This universal dimensionless EoS is constructed by relating the turbulent cascade's scale-free spectrum amplitude to the energy flux of the steady state that emerges from the large-length-scale driving of a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). Remarkably, this EoS defies the generic predictions of wave-turbulent kinetic theory, even though the cascade spectra are quantitatively well understood within that theory. Finally, we find that the concept of quasi-static thermodynamic processes between equilibrium states extends to far-from-equilibrium steady states.</description>

Abstract: We show that the dynamical stability under linear perturbations of interacting systems in the hydrodynamic regime follows from the first and the second laws of thermodynamics. Our argument extends to systems with spontaneously or softly broken symmetries and in the presence of magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Coherence length in a dilute flat-band superconductor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To explore the influence of quantum-geometric effects on the Ginzburg-Landau coherence length in a dilute flat-band superconductor, we adopt a BCS-BEC crossover approach to the multiband pyrochlore-Hubbard model near the critical temperature for superconductivity. Our self-consistent formulation for this three-dimensional lattice benchmarks very well against the so-called zero-temperature coherence length, demonstrating the monotonic decay of the coherence length to zero as the interaction strength increases. Additionally, we show that the effective mass of the many-body bound states (i.e., Cooper pairs) is nearly identical to that of the lowest-lying two-body bound states in the dilute flat-band limit.</description>

      <title>Three-component fractional quantum Hall effect in topological flat bands</title>

Abstract: We study the many-body ground states of three-component quantum particles in two prototypical topological lattice models under strong intercomponent and intracomponent repulsions. At band filling $\nu=3/4$ for hardcore bosons, we demonstrate the emergence of three-component fractional quantum Hall (FQH) effect characterized by the $\mathbf{K}$ matrix, through exact diagonalization study of four-fold quasidegenerate ground states with a robust spectrum gap and the combined density-matrix renormalization group calculation of fractional drag charge pumping. Further we formulate the topological characterization of FQH states of three-component Bose-Fermi mixtures at various fillings by the $\mathbf{K}$ matrix. At last we discuss the possible generalization of our approach to identify non-Abelian three-component spin-singlet FQH states.</description>

      <title>Magnetic, thermodynamic and dynamical properties of the three-dimensional fermionic Hubbard model: a comprehensive Monte Carlo study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interplay between quantum and thermal fluctuations can induce rich phenomena at finite temperatures in strongly correlated fermion systems. Here we report a {\it numerically exact} auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) study for the finite-temperature properties of three-dimensional repulsive Hubbard model at half filling. We concentrate on the complete temperature-interaction strength phase diagram of the model, which contains the low-temperature antiferromagnetic (AFM) long-range ordered phase and metal-insulator crossover (MIC) in the paramagnetic phase. Enabling access to unprecedented system sizes up to $20^3$, we achieve highly accurate results of the N\'{e}el transition temperature for representative values of on-site interaction $U$ via finite-size analysis of AFM structure factor. To quantitatively characterize the MIC above the N\'{e}el transition, we have developed fully new techniques allowing to compute the thermal entropy versus $U$ at fixed temperature and to directly calculate the $U$-derivative of double occupancy in AFQMC simulations. Then combining variously thermodynamic and dynamical observables, we establish an efficient scheme to precisely determine the boundaries for the MIC by cross-checking different observables. We also demonstrate the temperature dependence of many commonly used observables. Away from half filling, we explore the behavior of the sign problem and AFM spin correlation versus hole doping, and demonstrate the persistance of N\'{e}el AFM ordered phase to finite doping with limited results.</description>

Abstract: Conservation of angular momentum depends on the existence of rotational symmetry. However, even in systems where this symmetry is broken, flipping between angular momentum eigenstates often requires an activation energy. Here we discuss an example of superfluid flow in an azimuthally asymmetric toroidal potential, which shows sustained oscillations between two different rotation directions. The energy required to change the direction of rotation is taken out of and temporarily restored into the rotational and intra-component interaction energies of the system.</description>

      <title>Quantum many-body thermal machines enabled by atom-atom correlations</title>

Abstract: Particle-particle correlations, characterized by Glauber's second-order correlation function,play an important role in the understanding of various phenomena in radio and optical astronomy, quantum and atom optics, particle physics, condensed matter physics, and quantum many-body theory. However, the relevance of such correlations to quantum thermodynamics has so far remained illusive. Here, we propose and investigate a class of quantum many-body thermal machines whose operation is directly enabled by second-order atom-atom correlations in an ultracold atomic gas. More specifically, we study quantum thermal machines that operate in a sudden interaction-quench Otto cycle and utilize a one-dimensional Lieb-Liniger gas of repulsively interacting bosons as the working fluid. The atom-atom correlations in such a gas are different to those of a classical ideal gas, and are a result of the interplay between interparticle interactions, quantum statistics, and thermal fluctuations. We show that operating these thermal machines in the intended regimes, such as a heat engine, refrigerator, thermal accelerator, or heater, would be impossible without such atom-atom correlations. Our results constitute a step forward in the design of conceptually new quantum thermodynamic devices which take advantage of uniquely quantum resources such as quantum coherence, correlations, and entanglement.</description>

      <title>Probing spontaneously symmetry-broken phases with spin-charge separation through noise correlation measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08374v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spontaneously symmetry-broken (SSB) phases are locally ordered states of matter characterizing a large variety of physical systems. Because of their specific ordering, their presence is usually witnessed by means of local order parameters. Here, we propose an alternative approach based on statistical correlations of noise after the ballistic expansion of an atomic cloud. We indeed demonstrate that probing such noise correlators allows one to discriminate among different SSB phases characterized by spin-charge separation. As a particular example, we test our prediction on a 1D extended Fermi-Hubbard model, where the competition between local and nonlocal couplings gives rise to three different SSB phases: a charge density wave, a bond-ordering wave, and an antiferromagnet. Our numerical analysis shows that this approach can accurately capture the presence of these different SSB phases, thus representing an alternative and powerful strategy to characterize strongly interacting quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Microscopic scale of quantum phase transitions: from doped semiconductors to spin chains, cold gases and moir\'e superlattices</title>

Abstract: In the vicinity of continuous quantum phase transitions (QPTs), quantum systems become scale-invariant and can be grouped into universality classes characterized by sets of critical exponents. We have found that despite scale-invariance and universality, the experimental data still contain information related to the microscopic processes and scales governing QPTs. We have found that for many systems, the scaled data near QPTs can be approximated by the generic exponential dependence introduced in the scaling theory of localization; this dependence includes as a parameter a microscopic seeding scale of the renormalization group, $L_0$. We have also conjectured that for interacting systems, the temperature cuts the renormalization group flow at the length travelled by a system-specific elementary excitation over the life-time set by the Planckian time, $\tau_P$=$\hbar/k_BT$. We have adapted this approach for QPTs in several systems and showed that $L_0$ extracted from experiment is comparable to physically-expected minimal length scales, namely (i) the mean free path for metal-insulator transition in doped semiconductor Si:B, (ii) the distance between spins in Heisenberg and Ising chains, (iii) the period of an optical lattice for cold atom boson gases, and (iv) the period of a moir\'e superlattice for the Mott QPT in dichalcogenide bilayers. The metal-insulator transition in Si:P has been explained using a non-interacting version of the model. In two companion papers, we show that in superconducting systems, $L_0$ is comparable to superconducting coherence length, and in quantum Hall systems, to the magnetic length. The developed new method of data analysis identifies microscopic processes leading to QPTs and quantitatively explains and unifies a large body of experimental data.</description>
