      <title>Probing the spin polarization of an Anderson impurity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy measurements of an Anderson impurity system in MoS$_{2}$ mirror twin boundaries, where both the quantum confined impurity state and the Kondo resonance resulting from the interaction with the substrate are accessible. Using a spin-polarized tip, we observe magnetic field induced changes in the peak heights of the Anderson impurity states as well as in the magnetic field-split Kondo resonance. Quantitative comparison with numerical renormalization group calculations provides evidence of the notable spin polarization of the spin-resolved impurity spectral function under the influence of a magnetic field. Moreover, we extract the field and temperature dependence of the impurity magnetization from the differential conductance measurements and demonstrate that this exhibits the universality and asymptotic freedom of the $S=1/2$ Kondo effect. This work shows that mirror twin boundaries can be used as a testing ground for theoretical predictions on quantum impurity models.</description>

      <title>Optical Absorption and Emission from Wannier-Stark Spectra of Moir\'{e} Superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using a formalism based on the non-Abelian Berry connection, we explore quantum geometric signatures of Wannier-Stark spectra in two-dimensional superlattices. The Stark energy can be written as \textit{intraband} Berry phases, while Zener tunneling is given by \textit{interband} Berry connections. We suggest that the gaps induced by interband hybridization can be probed by THz optical absorption and emission spectroscopy. This is especially relevant to modern moir\'{e} materials wherein mini-bands are often spectrally entangled, leading to strong interband hybridization in the Wannier-Stark regime. Furthermore, owing to their large superlattice constants, both the low-field and high-field regimes can be accessed in these materials using presently available technology. Importantly, even at moderate electric fields, we find that stimulated emission can dominate absorption, raising the possibility of lasing at practically relevant parameter regimes.</description>

      <title>Terahertz antiferromagnetic dynamics induced by ultrafast spin currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Insulating antiferromagnets are anticipated as the main protagonists of ultrafast spintronics, with their intrinsic terahertz dynamics and their abililty to transport spin information over long distances. However, direct transfer of spin angular momentum to an antiferromagnetic insulator at picosecond time scales remains to be demonstrated. Here, studying the ultrafast behaviour of ferromagnetic metal/antiferromagnetic insulator bilayers, we evidence the generation of coherent excitations in the antiferromagnet combined with a modulation of the demagnetization behavior of the ferromagnet. This confirms that magnetic information can indeed be propagated into antiferromagnetic spin waves at picosecond timescales, thereby opening an avenue towards ultrafast manipulation of magnetic information.</description>

      <title>Non-Abelian Gauge Theory for Magnons in Topologically Textured Frustrated Magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop an effective gauge theory for three-flavored magnons in frustrated magnets hosting topological textures with the aid of the quaternion representation of the SO(3) order parameter. We find that the effect of topological solitons on magnons is captured generally by the non-Abelian emergent electromagnetic fields, distinct from the previously established gauge theory for magnons in collinear magnets where the gauge theory is often restricted to be Abelian. As concrete examples, $4\pi$-vortices in two-/three-dimensional magnets and Shankar skyrmions in three-dimensional magnets are discussed in detail, which are shown to induce, respectively, the Abelian and the non-Abelian topological magnetic field on magnons, and thereby engender the topological Hall transport in textured frustrated magnets. Our work is applicable to a broad class of magnetic materials whose low-energy manifold is described by the SO(3) order parameter. We envision that the discovery of the non-Abelian magnonic gauge theory will enrich the field of magnonics as well as prompt the study of magnon transport in textured frustrated magnets.</description>

      <title>Disentangling Electronic and Phononic Thermal Transport Across 2D Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrical and thermal transport across material interfaces is key for 2D electronics in semiconductor technology, yet their relationship remains largely unknown. We report a theoretical proposal to separate electronic and phononic contributions to thermal conductance at 2D interfaces, which is validated by non-equilibrium Green's function calculations and molecular dynamics simulations for graphene-gold contacts. Our results reveal that while metal-graphene interfaces are transparent for both electrons and phonons, non-covalent graphene interfaces block electronic tunneling beyond two layers but not phonon transport. This suggests that the Wiedemann-Franz law can be experimentally tested by measuring transport across interfaces with varying graphene layers.</description>

      <title>Infrared magneto-polaritons in MoTe$_2$ mono- and bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: MoTe$_2$ monolayers and bilayers are unique within the family of van-der-Waals materials since they pave the way towards atomically thin infrared light-matter quantum interfaces, potentially reaching the important telecommunication windows. Here, we report emergent exciton-polaritons based on MoTe$_2$ monolayer and bilayer in a low-temperature open micro-cavity in a joint experiment-theory study. Our experiments clearly evidence both the enhanced oscillator strength and enhanced luminescence of MoTe$_2$ bilayers, signified by a 38 \% increase of the Rabi-splitting and a strongly enhanced relaxation of polaritons to low-energy states. The latter is distinct from polaritons in MoTe$_2$ monolayers, which feature a bottleneck-like relaxation inhibition. Both the polaritonic spin-valley locking in monolayers and the spin-layer locking in bilayers are revealed via the Zeeman effect, which we map and control via the light-matter composition of our polaritonic resonances.</description>

      <title>Electron energy-loss spectrum and exciton band structure of ${\mathrm{WSe}}_{2}$ monolayer studied by ab initio Bethe-Salpeter equation calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bounded excitons in transition metal dichalcogenides monolayers lead to numerous opto-electronic applications, which require a detailed understanding of the exciton dynamics. The dynamical properties of excitons with finite momentum transfer $\textbf{Q}$ can be investigated experimentally using electron energy-loss (EEL) spectroscopy. The EEL spectrum depends on the response function of the material which in turn is determined by the exciton energies and eigenvectors in the exciton band structure. In this work, we utilize ab initio density-functional theory plus Bethe-Salpeter equation (DFT+BSE) approach to explore the exciton band structure and also $\textbf{Q}$-resolved EEL spectrum in monolayer ${\mathrm{WSe}}_{2}$. In particular, we carefully examine the discrepancies and connections among the existing EEL spectrum formulas for quasi-two-dimensional (2D) systems, and establish a proper definition of the EEL spectrum, which is then used to calculate the EEL spectra of monolayer ${\mathrm{WSe}}_{2}$. We find that remarkably, the dispersion of the calculated lowest-energy EELS peaks for the in-plane momentum transfer follows almost precisely the non-parabolic upper band of the lowest bright A exciton, and also agrees well with the previous experiment. Furthermore, we show that only the bright exciton with its electric dipole being parallel to the direction of the transfered momentum is excited, i.e., EEL spectroscopy selectively probes bright exciton bands. This explains why only the upper band of the A exciton, which is a longitudinal exciton with an in-plane dipole moment, was observed in the previous experiment. Our findings will stimulate further EEL experiments to measure other branches of the exciton band structure, such as the parabolic lower band of the A exciton, and hence will lead to a better understanding of the exciton dynamics in quasi-2D materials.</description>

      <title>Magneto-thermoelectricty of anisotropic two-dimensional materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use semiclassical Boltzmann transport theory to analytically study the electronic contribution to the linear thermoelectric response of anisotropic two-dimensional materials subjected to a perpendicular magnetic field. Conventional methods, such as the relaxation-time approximation within the Boltzmann formalism, often yield qualitatively incorrect results when applied to anisotropic mediums. On the other hand, the vector mean free path provides exact solutions for the linearized Boltzmann transport equation, and in principle, we can systematically evaluate it to any desired order in the external magnetic field. After laying out the general formalism of the magneto-thermoelectric responses of anisotropic systems based on the vector mean free path approach, we study the longitudinal and Hall charge conductivities, as well as the Seebeck and Nernst coefficients of two representative anisotropic two-dimensional electronic systems: a semi-Dirac semimetal and a two-dimensional system of tilted massless Dirac fermions.</description>

      <title>Entangled photon-pair emission in circuit QED from a Cooper pair splitter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As part of a circuit QED architecture, we investigate photon emission from a Cooper pair splitter composed of two double quantum dots, each coupled to a microwave transmission line. We demonstrate the capability to generate frequency-entangled photon pairs in the left and right transmission lines, specifically a superposition of two photon wavepackets at different frequencies. The photon frequencies are determined by the energy detuning in each double quantum dot and by the nonlocal superconducting pairing amplitude, which results from the tunnel coupling with the superconducting nanocontact placed between the two double quantum dots. The frequency entanglement of the two photons arises from the particle-hole coherent superposition involving the delocalized entangled spin singlet. We also estimate an upper bound for the efficiency of entangled photon-pair generation, accounting for the presence of non-radiative processes such as phonon emissions. Using parameters from cutting-edge circuit QED devices with quantum dots, our proposal is realistic and could be implemented with state-of-the-art microwave nanoscale engineering.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15314v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a room temperature, all-electric device that reaches a strong coupling regime where external environmental coupling dominates over internal mechanical dissipation. The device has four orders of magnitude lower insertion loss than a comparable commercial quartz crystal, and achieves a position imprecision rivaling an optical interferometer. With the help of a back-action isolation scheme, we observe radiative cooling of mechanical motion by a remote cryogenic load.</description>

      <title>Towards high spatial resolution magnetic imaging with a compact practical quantum diamond microscope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Widefield quantum diamond microscopy is a powerful technique for imaging magnetic fields with high sensitivity and spatial resolution. However, current methods to approach the ultimate spatial resolution ($&lt;500\,$nm) are impractical for routine use as they require time-consuming fabrication or transfer techniques to precisely interface the diamond sensor with the sample to be imaged. To address this challenge, we have designed a co-axial sensor holder that enables simple, repeatable sensor-sample interfacing while being compatible with high numerical aperture (NA) optics. With our new design we demonstrate low standoffs $&lt;500\,$nm with a millimetre sized sensor. We also explore the relationship between spatial resolution and NA spanning from 0.13 to 1.3. The spatial resolution shows good agreement with the optical diffraction limit at low NA but deviates at high NA, which is shown to be due to optical aberrations. Future improvements to our design are discussed, which should enable magnetic imaging with $&lt;500\,$nm resolution in an accessible, easy-to-use instrument.</description>

      <title>One-dimensional quantum dot array integrated with charge sensors in an InAs nanowire</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report an experimental study of a one-dimensional quintuple-quantum-dot array integrated with two quantum dot charge sensors in an InAs nanowire. The device is studied by measuring double quantum dots formed consecutively in the array and corresponding charge stability diagrams are revealed with both direct current measurements and charge sensor signals. The one-dimensional quintuple-quantum-dot array are then tuned up and its charge configurations are fully mapped out with the two charge sensors. The energy level of each dot in the array can be controlled individually by using a compensated gate architecture (i.e., "virtual gate"). After that, four dots in the array are selected to form two double quantum dots and ultra strong inter-double-dot interaction is obtained. A theoretical simulation based on a 4-dimensional Hamiltonian confirms the strong coupling strength between the two double quantum dots. The highly controllable one-dimensional quantum dot array achieved in this work is expected to be valuable for employing InAs nanowires to construct advanced quantum hardware in the future.</description>

      <title>Terahertz and gigahertz magneto-ratchets in graphene-based 2D metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the observation and study of the magneto-ratchet effect in a graphene-based two-dimensional metamaterial formed by a graphite gate that is placed below a graphene monolayer and patterned with an array of triangular antidots. We demonstrate that terahertz/gigahertz excitation of the metamaterial leads to sign-alternating magneto-oscillations with an amplitude that exceeds the ratchet current at zero magnetic field by orders of magnitude. The oscillations are shown to be related to the Shubnikov-de Haas effect. In addition to the giant ratchet current oscillations we detect resonant ratchet currents caused by the cyclotron and electron spin resonances. The results are well described by the developed theory considering the magneto-ratchet effect caused by the interplay of the near-field radiation and the nonuniform periodic electrostatic potential of the metamaterial controlled by the gate voltages.</description>

      <title>Polarons shape the interlayer exciton emission of MoSe$_2$/WSe$_2$ heterobilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present time-resolved and CW optical spectroscopy studies of interlayer excitons (IXs) in 2$H-$ and 3$R-$stacked MoSe$_2$/WSe$_2$ heterobilayers and obtain evidence for the strong participation of hot phonons in the underlying photo-physics. Photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy reveals that excess energy associated with optical excitation of \textit{intra}-layer excitons and relaxation to IXs affects the overall IX-PL lineshape, while the spectrally narrow emission lines conventionally associated with moir\'e IXs are unaffected. A striking uniform line-spacing of the sharp emission lines is observed together with temperature and excitation level dependent spectra suggesting an entirely new picture that photo-generated phonons lead to phonon-replicas shaping the IX-emission. Excitation power and time resolved data indicate that these features are polaronic in nature. Our experimental findings modify our current understanding of the photophysics of IXs beyond current interpretations based on moir\'e-trapped IXs.</description>

      <title>A backgate for enhanced tunability of holes in planar germanium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planar semiconductor heterostructures offer versatile device designs and are promising candidates for scalable quantum computing. Notably, heterostructures based on strained germanium have been extensively studied in recent years, with emphasis on their strong and tunable spin-orbit interaction, low effective mass, and high hole mobility. However, planar systems are still limited by the fact that the shape of the confinement potential is directly related to the density. In this work, we present the successful implementation of a backgate for a planar germanium heterostructure. The backgate, in combination with a topgate, enables independent control over the density and the electric field, which determines important state properties such as the effective mass, the $g$-factor and the quantum lifetime. This unparalleled degree of control paves the way towards engineering qubit properties and facilitates the targetted tuning of bilayer quantum wells, which promise denser qubit packing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fiber-coupled sensors are well suited for sensing and microscopy in hard-to-reach environments such as biological or cryogenic systems. We demonstrate fiber-based magnetic imaging based on nitrogen-vacancy (NV) sensor spins at the tip of a fiber-coupled diamond nanobeam. We incorporated angled ion implantation into the nanobeam fabrication process to realize a small ensemble of NV spins at the nanobeam tip. By gluing the nanobeam to a tapered fiber, we created a robust and transportable probe with optimized optical coupling efficiency. We demonstrate the imaging capability of the fiber-coupled nanobeam by measuring the magnetic field generated by a current-carrying wire. With its robust coupling and efficient readout at the fiber-coupled interface, our probe could allow new studies of (quantum) materials and biological samples.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The superior computational power promised by quantum computers utilises the fundamental quantum mechanical principle of entanglement. However, achieving entanglement and verifying that the generated state does not follow the principle of local causality has proven difficult for spin qubits in gate-defined quantum dots, as it requires simultaneously high concurrence values and readout fidelities to break the classical bound imposed by Bell's inequality. Here we employ advanced operational protocols for spin qubits in silicon, such as heralded initialization and calibration via gate set tomography (GST), to reduce all relevant errors and push the fidelities of the full 2-qubit gate set above 99%. We demonstrate a 97.17% Bell state fidelity without correcting for readout errors and violate Bell's inequality with a Bell signal of S = 2.731 close to the theoretical maximum of 2{\sqrt{2}}. Our measurements exceed the classical limit even at elevated temperatures of 1.1K or entanglement lifetimes of 100 {\mu}s.</description>

      <title>Effects of GaAs buffer layer on quantum anomalous Hall insulator Vy(BixSb1-x)2-yTe3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the growth, structural characterization, and transport properties of the quantum anomalous Hall insulator Vy(BixSb1-x)2-yTe3 (VBST) grown on a GaAs buffer layer by molecular beam epitaxy on a GaAs(111)A substrate. X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy show that the implementation of a GaAs buffer layer improves the crystal and interface quality compared to the control sample grown directly on an InP substrate. Both samples exhibit the quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE), but with similar thermal stability despite the different structural properties. Notably, the QAHE in the sample grown on a GaAs buffer layer displays a significantly larger (almost double) coercive field with a much smaller resistivity peak at the magnetization reversal. Possible effects of the interface quality on the magnetic properties of VBST and the QAHE are discussed.</description>

      <title>ELEQTRONeX: A GPU-Accelerated Exascale Framework for Non-Equilibrium Quantum Transport in Nanomaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-equilibrium electronic quantum transport is crucial for the operation of existing and envisioned electronic, optoelectronic, and spintronic devices. The ultimate goal of encompassing atomistic to mesoscopic length scales in the same nonequilibrium device simulation approach has traditionally been challenging due to the computational cost of high-fidelity coupled multiphysics and multiscale requirements. In this work, we present ELEQTRONeX (ELEctrostatic Quantum TRansport modeling Of Nanomaterials at eXascale), a massively-parallel GPU-accelerated framework for self-consistently solving the nonequilibrium Green's function formalism and electrostatics in complex device geometries. By customizing algorithms for GPU multithreading, we achieve orders of magnitude improvement in computational time, and excellent scaling on up to 512 GPUs and billions of spatial grid cells. We validate our code by computing band structures, current-voltage characteristics, conductance, and drain-induced barrier lowering for various 3D configurations of carbon nanotube field-effect transistors. We also demonstrate that ELEQTRONeX is suitable for complex device/material geometries where periodic approaches are not feasible, such as modeling of arrays of misaligned carbon nanotubes requiring fully 3D simulations.</description>

      <title>Competitive helical bands and highly efficient diode effect in F/S/TI/S/F hybrid structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The diode effect in superconducting materials has been actively investigated in recent years. Plenty of different devices have been proposed as a platform to observe the superconducting diode effect. In this work we discuss the possibility of a highly efficient superconducting diode design with controllable polarity. We propose the mesoscopic device that consists of two separated superconducting islands with proximity induced ferromagnetism deposited on top of the three-dimensional topological insulator. Using the quasiclassical formalism of the Usadel equations we demonstrate that the sign of the diode efficiency can be controlled by magnetization tuning of a single superconducting island. Moreover, we show that the diode efficiency can be substantially increased in such device. We argue that the dramatic increase of the diode efficiency is due to competing contribution of the two superconducting islands to the supercurrent with single helical bands linked through the topological insulator surface.</description>

      <title>Microstructure-Dependent Particulate Filtration using Multifunctional Metallic Nanowire Foams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic has shown the urgent need for the development of efficient, durable, reusable and recyclable filtration media for the deep-submicron size range. Here we demonstrate a multifunctional filtration platform using porous metallic nanowire foams that are efficient, robust, antimicrobial, and reusable, with the potential to further guard against multiple hazards. We have investigated the foam microstructures, detailing how the growth parameters influence the overall surface area and characteristic feature size, as well as the effects of the microstructures on the filtration performance. Nanogranules deposited on the nanowires during electrodeposition are found to greatly increase the surface area, up to 20 m$^{2}$/g. Surprisingly, in the high surface area regime, the overall surface area gained from the nanogranules has little correlation with the improvement in capture efficiency. However, nanowire density and diameter play a significant role in the capture efficiency of PM$_{0.3}$ particles, as do the surface roughness of the nanowire fibers and their characteristic feature sizes. Antimicrobial tests on the Cu foams show a &gt;99.9995% inactivation efficiency after contacting the foams for 30 seconds. These results demonstrate promising directions to achieve a highly efficient multifunctional filtration platform with optimized microstructures.</description>

      <title>Deterministic and Efficient Switching of Sliding Ferroelectrics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies highlight the scientific importance and broad application prospects of two-dimensional (2D) sliding ferroelectrics, which prevalently exhibit vertical polarization with suitable stackings. It is crucial to understand the mechanisms of sliding ferroelectricity and to deterministically and efficiently switch the polarization with optimized electric fields. Here, applying our newly developed DREAM-Allegro multi-task equivariant neural network, which simultaneously predicts interatomic potentials and Born effective charges, we construct a comprehensive potential for boron nitride ($\mathrm{BN}$) bilayer. The molecular dynamics simulations reveal a remarkably high Curie temperature of up to 1500K, facilitated by robust intralayer chemical bonds and delicate interlayer van der Waals(vdW) interactions. More importantly, it is found that, compared to the out-of-plane electric field, the inclined field not only leads to deterministic switching of electric polarization, but also largely lower the critical strength of field, due to the presence of the in-plane polarization in the transition state. This strategy of an inclined field is demonstrated to be universal for other sliding ferroelectric systems with monolayer structures belonging to the symmetry group $p \bar{6} m 2$, such as transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs).</description>

      <title>Holographic nature of critical quantum states of proteins</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Anderson metal-insulator transition is a fundamental phenomenon in condensed matter physics, describing the transition from a conducting (metallic) to a non-conducting (insulating) state driven by disorder in a material. At the critical point of the Anderson transition, wave functions exhibit multifractal behavior, and energy levels display a universal distribution, indicating non-trivial correlations in the eigenstates. Recent studies have shown that proteins, traditionally considered as insulators, exhibit much higher conductivity than previously assumed. In this paper, we investigate several proteins known for their efficient electron transport properties. We compare their energy level statistics, eigenfunction correlation, and electron return probability to those expected in metallic, insulating, or critical states. Remarkably, these proteins exhibit properties of critically disordered metals in their natural state without any parameter adjustment. Their composition and geometry are self-organized into the critical state of the Anderson transition, and their fractal properties are universal and unique among critical systems. Our findings suggest that proteins' wave functions fulfill "holographic" area laws, and the correlation fractal dimension is precisely $d_2=2$.</description>

      <title>Spin Qubits with Scalable milli-kelvin CMOS Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A key virtue of spin qubits is their sub-micron footprint, enabling a single silicon chip to host the millions of qubits required to execute useful quantum algorithms with error correction. With each physical qubit needing multiple control lines however, a fundamental barrier to scale is the extreme density of connections that bridge quantum devices to their external control and readout hardware. A promising solution is to co-locate the control system proximal to the qubit platform at milli-kelvin temperatures, wired-up via miniaturized interconnects. Even so, heat and crosstalk from closely integrated control have potential to degrade qubit performance, particularly for two-qubit entangling gates based on exchange coupling that are sensitive to electrical noise. Here, we benchmark silicon MOS-style electron spin qubits controlled via heterogeneously-integrated cryo-CMOS circuits with a low enough power density to enable scale-up. Demonstrating that cryo-CMOS can efficiently enable universal logic operations for spin qubits, we go on to show that mill-kelvin control has little impact on the performance of single- and two-qubit gates. Given the complexity of our milli-kelvin CMOS platform, with some 100-thousand transistors, these results open the prospect of scalable control based on the tight packaging of spin qubits with a chiplet style control architecture.</description>

      <title>Investigating Metal Dopants for Lowering the Contact Resistance of Top Gold Contacted Monolayer MoS2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interface properties between gold (Au) contacts and molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) are critical for optimizing the performance of semiconductor devices. This study investigates the impact of metal dopants (D) on the transport properties of MoS2 devices with top Au contacts, aiming to reduce contact resistance and enhance device performance. Using density functional theory (DFT) and non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF)- based first-principles calculations, we examine the structural, electronic, and quantum transport properties of Au-contacted, metal-doped MoS2. Our results indicate that Cd, Re, and Ru dopants significantly improve the structural stability and electronic properties of MoS2. Specifically, formation energy calculations show that Cd and Re are stable at hollow sites, while Ru prefers bond sites. Remarkably, Au-Ru-MoS2-based device exhibits tunnel resistance (RT ) up to 4.82 ohm-um. Furthermore, a dual-gated Au-Ru-MoS2 field effect transistor (FET) demonstrates an impressive Ion/Ioff ratio of 10^8 at Vgs of 2 V, highlighting its potential for nano-switching applications.</description>

Abstract: Silicon nanomechanical resonators display ultra-long lifetimes at cryogenic temperatures and microwave frequencies. Achieving quantum control of single-phonons in these devices has so far relied on nonlinearities enabled by coupling to ancillary qubits. In this work, we propose using atomic forces to realize a silicon nanomechanical qubit without coupling to an ancillary qubit. The proposed qubit operates at 60 MHz with a single-phonon level anharmonicity of 5 MHz. We present a circuit quantum acoustodynamics architecture where electromechanical resonators enable dispersive state readout and multi-qubit operations. The combination of strong anharmonicity, ultrahigh mechanical quality factors, and small footprints achievable in this platform could enable quantum-nonlinear phononics for quantum information processing and transduction.</description>

      <title>Accurate estimation of interfacial thermal conductance between silicon and diamond enabled by a machine learning interatomic potential</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermal management at silicon-diamond interface is critical for advancing high-performance electronic and optoelectronic devices. In this study, we calculate the interfacial thermal conductance between silicon and diamond using machine learning (ML) interatomic potentials trained on density functional theory (DFT) data. Using non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulations, we compute the interfacial thermal conductance (ITC) for various system sizes. Our results show a closer agreement with experimental data than those obtained using traditional semi-empirical potentials such as Tersoff and Brenner which overestimate ITC by a factor of about 3. In addition, we analyze the frequency-dependent heat transfer spectrum, providing insights into the contributions of different phonon modes to the interfacial thermal conductance. The ML potential accurately captures the phonon dispersion relations and lifetimes, in good agreement with DFT calculations and experimental observations. It is shown that the Tersoff potential predicts higher phonon group velocities and phonon lifetimes compared to the DFT results. Furthermore, it predicts higher interfacial bonding strength, which is consistent with higher interfacial thermal conductance as compared to the ML potential. This study highlights the use of the ML interatomic potential to improve the accuracy and computational efficiency of thermal transport simulations in complex material systems.</description>

Abstract: We report a detailed characterization of two inductively coupled superconducting fluxonium qubits for implementing high-fidelity cross-resonance gates. Our circuit stands out because it behaves very closely to the case of two transversely coupled spin-1/2 systems. In particular, the generally unwanted static ZZ-term due to the non-computational transitions is nearly absent despite a strong qubit-qubit hybridization. Spectroscopy of the non-computational transitions reveals a spurious LC-mode arising from the combination of the coupling inductance and the capacitive links between the terminals of the two qubit circuits. Such a mode has a minor effect on our specific device, but it must be carefully considered for optimizing future designs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the past few years, ionic conductors have gained a lot of attention given the possibility to implement them in various applications such as supercapacitors, batteries or fuel cells as well as for resistive memories. Especially, layered two-dimensional (2D) crystals such as h-BN, graphene oxide and MoSe2 have shown to provide unique properties originating from the specific 2D confinement of moving ions. Two important parameters are the ion conductivity and the chemical stability over a wide range of operating conditions. In this vein, Rb2Ti2O5 has been recently found displaying remarkable properties such as superionic conduction and colossal equivalent dielectric constant. Here, a first approach to the study of the electrical properties of layered Rb2Ti2O5 at the 100-nanometer scale is presented. Characterizations by means of micro-Raman spectroscopy and atomic force microscope (AFM) measurements of mechanically exfoliated RTO nanocrystals via the so-called adhesive-tape technique are reported. Finally, the results of electrical measurements performed on an exfoliated RTO nanocrystals are presented, and are found to be consistent with the results obtained on macroscopic crystals. 4</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biological vision systems seamlessly integrate feature-sensitive spatial processing and strong nonlinearity. The retina performs feature detection via ganglion cells, which nonlinearly enhance image features such as edges through lateral inhibition processes between neighbouring cells. As demand for specialised machine learning hardware increases, physical systems are sought which combine feature detection with the nonlinear processing required for tasks such as image classification. Currently, physical machine vision schemes detect features linearly, then employ separate digital systems for subsequent nonlinear activation. Here, we introduce a bio-inspired 'retinomorphic' machine vision platform using a semiconductor network laser. The system hosts many spatially-overlapping lasing modes which detect multiple image features in parallel via their lasing amplitude. Integrated nonlinearity is provided by antagonistic competition for gain between modes - a photonic analogue of the lateral inhibition in retinal cells. Detected feature maps are fed back through the system, providing multi-layer image classification with intrinsic nonlinear processing. Accuracies of 98.05% and 87.85% are achieved for MNIST digits and Fashion-MNIST tasks respectively.</description>

Abstract: Spacetime metamaterials (ST-MMs) are opening new regimes of light-matter interactions based on the breaking of temporal and spatial symmetries, as well as intriguing concepts associated with synthetic motion. In this work, we investigate the continuous spatiotemporal translation symmetry of ST-MMs with uniform modulation velocity. Using Noether theorem, we demonstrate that such symmetry entails the conservation of the energy-momentum. We highlight how energy-momentum conservation imposes constraints on the range of allowed light-matter interactions within ST-MMs, as illustrated with examples of the collision of electromagnetic and modulation pulses. Furthermore, we discuss the similarities and differences between the conservation of energy-momentum and relativistic effects. We believe that our work provides a step forward in clarifying the fundamental theory underlying ST-MMs.</description>

Abstract: Halide perovskites, such as methylammonium lead bromide (MAPbBr$_3$), host tightly bound three-dimensional excitons which are robust at room temperature. Excellent optical properties of MAPbBr$_3$ allow for designing of optical single-mode waveguides and cavities in the frequency range close to the excitonic transitions. Taken together, this turns MAPbBr$_3$ into an excellent platform for probing exciton-polariton nonlinear phenomena at room temperature. Here we investigate ultrafast non-equilibrium dynamics of polaritons under pulsed fs non-resonant excitation. We demonstrate the presence of the stimulated acoustic phonon-assisted scattering regime above threshold pump fluence, characterized by the explosive growth of emission intensity, a redshift of the emission spectral maximum, spectral narrowing, and sub-picosecond emission dynamics. Our theoretical findings are well confirmed by the results of experimental measurements.</description>

      <title>24 days-stable CNOT-gate on fluxonium qubits with over 99.9% fidelity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fluxonium qubit is a promising building block for quantum information processing due to its long coherence time and strong anharmonicity. In this paper, we realize a 60 ns direct CNOT-gate on two inductively-coupled fluxonium qubits using selective darkening approach, resulting in a gate fidelity as high as 99.94%. The fidelity remains above 99.9% for 24 days without any recalibration between randomized benchmarking measurements. Compared with the 99.96% fidelity of a 60 ns identity gate, our data brings the investigation of the non-decoherence-related errors during gate operations down to $2 \times 10^{-4}$. The present result adds a simple and robust two-qubit gate into the still relatively small family of "the beyond three nines" demonstrations on superconducting qubits.</description>

Abstract: The spin of a single electron confined in a semiconductor quantum dot is a natural qubit candidate. Fundamental building blocks of spin-based quantum computing have been demonstrated in double quantum dots with significant spin-orbit coupling. Here, we show that spin-orbit-coupled double quantum dots can be categorised in six classes, according to a partitioning of the multi-dimensional space of their $g$-tensors. The class determines physical characteristics of the double dot, i.e., features in transport, spectroscopy and coherence measurements, as well as qubit control, shuttling, and readout experiments. In particular, we predict that the spin physics is highly simplified due to pseudospin conservation, whenever the external magnetic field is pointing to special directions (`magic directions'), where the number of special directions is determined by the class. We also analyze the existence and relevance of magic loops in the space of magnetic-field directions, corresponding to equal local Zeeman splittings. These results present an important step toward precise interpretation and efficient design of spin-based quantum computing experiments in materials with strong spin-orbit coupling.</description>

      <title>Valley-Free Silicon Fins Caused by Shear Strain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.13448v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electron spins confined in silicon quantum dots are promising candidates for large-scale quantum computers. However, the degeneracy of the conduction band of bulk silicon introduces additional levels dangerously close to the window of computational energies, where the quantum information can leak. The energy of the valley states -- typically 0.1 meV -- depends on hardly controllable atomistic disorder and still constitutes a fundamental limit to the scalability of these architectures. In this work, we introduce designs of complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS)-compatible silicon fin field-effect transistors that enhance the energy gap to noncomputational states by more than one order of magnitude. Our devices comprise realistic silicon-germanium nanostructures with a large shear strain, where troublesome valley degrees of freedom are completely removed. The energy of noncomputational states is therefore not affected by unavoidable atomistic disorder and can further be tuned in situ by applied electric fields. Our design ideas are directly applicable to a variety of setups and will offer a blueprint toward silicon-based large-scale quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Studying magnon band topology through low-energy magnon excitations: role of anisotropic Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07201v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study topological properties of magnons via creating spin excitations in both ferromagnets and antiferromagnets in presence of an external magnetic field on a two-dimensional square lattice. It is known that Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) plays an important role in coupling between different particle (spin excitation) sectors, here we consider an anisotropic DMI and ascertain the role of the anisotropy parameter in inducing topological phase transitions. While the scenario, for dealing with ferromagnets, albeit with isotropic DMI is established in literature, we have developed the formalism for studying magnon band topology for the antiferromagnetic case. The calculations for the ferromagnetic case are included to facilitate a comparison between the two magnetically ordered systems. Owing to the presence of a two-sublattice structure of an antiferromagnet, a larger number of magnon bands participate in deciding upon the topological properties. However, in both the cases, an extended trivial region is observed even with the DMI to be non-zero, which is surprising since the DMI is the origin of the finite Berry curvature in presence of external magnetic field. Furthermore, in an antiferromagnet, a smaller anisotropy is capable of inducing a gap-closing transition from a topological to a trivial phase compared to that for a ferromagnet. The nature of the phases in both the cases and the phase transitions therein are characterized by the band structure, presence (or absence) of the chiral edge modes observed in a semi-infinite nano-ribbon geometry, computation of the thermal Hall effect, etc. Moreover, the strength of the magnetic field is found to play a decisive role in controlling the critical point that demarcates various topological phases.</description>

      <title>Finite width of anyons changes their braiding signature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.15094v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Anyons are particles intermediate between fermions and bosons, characterized by a nontrivial exchange phase, yielding remarkable braiding statistics. Recent experiments have shown that anyonic braiding has observable consequences on edge transport in the fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE). Here, we study transport signatures of anyonic braiding when the anyons have a finite width. We show that the width of the anyons, even extremely small, can have a tremendous impact on transport properties and braiding signatures. In particular, we find that taking the finite width into account allows us to explain recent experimental results on FQHE at filling factor $2/5$ [Ruelle et al., Phys. Rev. X \textbf{13}, 011031 (2023)]. Our work shows that the finite width of anyons crucially influences setups involving anyonic braiding, especially when the exchange phase is larger than $\pi/2$.</description>

      <title>Non-Abelian Hopf-Euler insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17305v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss a class of three-band non-Abelian topological insulators in three dimensions which carry a single bulk Hopf index protected by spatiotemporal ($\mathcal{PT}$) inversion symmetry. These phases may also host subdimensional topological invariants given by the Euler characteristic class, resulting in real Hopf-Euler insulators. Such systems naturally realize helical nodal structures in the 3D Brillouin zone, providing a physical manifestation of the linking number described by the Hopf invariant. We show that, by opening a gap between the valence bands of these systems, one finds a fully-gapped `flag' phase, which displays a three-band multi-gap Pontryagin invariant. Unlike the previously reported $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric four-band real Hopf insulator, which hosts a $\mathbb{Z} \oplus \mathbb{Z}$ invariant, these phases are not unitarily equivalent to two copies of a complex two-band Hopf insulator. We show that these uncharted phases can be obtained through dimensional extension of two-dimensional Euler insulators, and that they support (1) an optical bulk integrated circular shift effect quantized by the Hopf invariant, (2) quantum-geometric breathing in the real space Wannier functions, and (3) surface Euler topology on boundaries. Consequently, our findings pave a way for novel experimental realizations of real-space quantum-geometry, as these systems may be directly simulated by utilizing synthethic dimensions in metamaterials or ultracold atoms.</description>

      <title>The mechanism of electrical conduction in glassy semiconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04829v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We argue that the dominant charge carrier in glassy semiconducting alloys is a compound particle in the form of an electron or hole bound to an intimate pair of topological lattice defects; the particle is similar to the polaron solution of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger Hamiltonian. The spatial component of the density of states for these special polarons is determined by the length scale of spatial modulation of electronegativity caused by a separate set of standalone topological defects. The latter length scale is fixed by the cooperativity size for structural relaxation; the size is largely independent of temperature in the glass but above melting, it decreases with temperature. Thus we predict that the temperature dependence of the electrical conductivity should exhibit a jump in the slope near the glass transition; the size of the jump is predicted to increase with the fragility of the melt. The predicted values of the jump and of the conductivity itself are consistent with experiment.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Entanglement in Trion-Micropillars under Artificial Magnetic Fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06402v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate quantum phenomena in a system of three coupled microcavities each supporting regime of strong coupling with exciton resonance. The possibility of observing polariton blockade in a dimer and triple micropillar configuration is discussed. We identify the resonance conditions corresponding to the onset of the photon blockade. The discovered quantum effects allow using these systems as versatile sources of individual polaritons. Various manifestations of the quantum blockade can be tuned with the use of the pumping laser frequency. We demonstrate that the presence of the cascade coupling between pillars enhances manifestations of sub-Poissonian statistics. Application of the effective gauge field in the triangle configuration allows for manifestation of a collective antibunching effect. In particular, we identify conditions of a multimode blockade -- a phenomenon consisting in blocking of excitation of the state with $n$ particles distributed over multiple coupled modes. A new effect of quantum entanglement of a non-Hermitian dimer with a micropillar in an artificial magnetic field has been discovered, associated with the simultaneous manifestation of antibunching on the dimer, the micropillar associated with it, and the triple-micropillar.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09458v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While topology can impose obstructions to exponentially localized Wannier functions, certain topological insulators are exempt from such Wannier obstructions. The absence of the Wannier obstructions can further accompany topological boundary states that are detachable from the bulk bands. Here, we elucidate a close connection between these detachable topological boundary states and non-Hermitian topology. Identifying topological boundary states as non-Hermitian topology, we demonstrate that intrinsic non-Hermitian topology leads to the inevitable spectral flow. By contrast, we show that extrinsic non-Hermitian topology underlies the detachment of topological boundary states and clarify anti-Hermitian topology of the detached boundary states. Based on this connection and $K$-theory, we complete the tenfold classification of Wannier localizability and detachable topological boundary states.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity from spin-canting fluctuations in rhombohedral graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17036v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rhombohedral graphene multilayers host various broken-symmetry metallic phases as well as superconductors whose pairing mechanism and order parameter symmetry remain unsettled. Strikingly, experiments have revealed prominent new superconducting regions in rhombohedral bilayer and trilayer graphene devices with proximity-induced Ising spin-orbit coupling. We propose that these superconductors descend from a common spin-canted normal state that spontaneously breaks a U(1) spin symmetry and thus supports a gapless (Goldstone) magnon mode. In particular, we develop a scenario wherein pairing in the spin-canted state emerges from a novel type of magnon-mediated attraction: Contrary to conventional mechanisms that involve the exchange of a single boson, we show that second-order processes that exchange two magnons are dominant and produce an $s$-wave pairing interaction featuring a unique logarithmic low-frequency divergence. This low-frequency divergence disappears when spin-orbit coupling vanishes, providing a promising explanation for spin-orbit-enabled pairing. Numerous other experimental observations -- including nontrivial dependence of superconductivity on the spin-orbit coupling strength, in-plane magnetic fields, and Fermi surface structure -- also naturally follow from our scenario.</description>

      <title>Induction of non-Fermi liquids by critical cavity photons at the onset of superradiance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10963v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the emergence of a non-Fermi liquid (NFL) at a putative quantum critical point signalling the onset of superradiance, in a set-up involving cavity quantum electrodynamics. Although the finiteness of the cavity, being bounded by reflecting mirrors, endows the cavity photons with an effective mass, they become massless at the continuous phase transition point. We consider the matter part coming from the fermions hopping on a honeycomb lattice near half-filling, featuring doped Dirac cones at two sets of inequivalent valleys. This choice is dictated by the presence of a fermion-boson interaction vertex which can give rise to Landau damping of the critical bosons, eventually leading to an NFL phase for the fermions. To set up the quantum effective action, we identify the hot spots of the generically anisotropic (trigonally-warped) Fermi surfaces, which are the set of points having parallel/antiparallel tangent vectors. The cavity photons act as charge density wave (CDW) order parameters, connecting pairs of hot spots belonging to the Fermi surface of a single valley. With these ingredients, we have set upon identifying NFL phases, using the tools of dimensional regularization and renormalization-group-flow equations. Our final results indicate that stable NFL phases exist in the low-energy limit, for the projections of the flows along the CDW coupling constant.</description>

      <title>Uhlmann quench and geometric dynamic quantum phase transition of mixed states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11809v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dynamic quantum phase transitions (DQPT) following quantum quenches exhibit singular behavior of the overlap between the initial and evolved states. Here we present a formalism to incorporate a geometric phase into quench dynamics of mixed quantum states, a process named the Uhlmann quench, based on the Uhlmann parallel transport. To overcome the incompatibility between the Uhlmann parallel-transport condition and Hamiltonian dynamics, we formulate the evolution of purification of the density matrix in a form which not only respects the dynamics according to the density matrix but also follows the Uhlmann parallel-transport condition to generate a geometric phase after a quantum quench. For cyclic processes exemplified by a spin-1/2 system, geometric DQPTs (GDQPTs) can emerge with both singular behavior in the dynamic analogue of the free energy and jumps of the geometric phase. Moreover, the Uhlmann phase reflecting the holonomy is generated at the end of each cycle. The Uhlmann quench thus paves the way for investigating the interplay between quantum dynamics and geometric processes in mixed states.</description>

Abstract: As an homage to Quantum Energy Teleportation, we generalize the idea to arbitrary physical observables, not limited to energy, and prove a rigorous upper bound on the activated ("teleported") quantity. The essence of this protocol is a quantum feedback control with respect to the entangled ground state of a quantum many-body system. To demonstrate the concept, we explore a (1+1)-dimensional chiral Dirac system and execute the protocol for the electric current and charge. One of the most significant results is the creation of long-range correlations across the system after applying control operations only to one local site. Consequently but surprisingly, the induced charge susceptibility fully reconstructs the phase diagram, despite the model initially having no charge. Moreover, we find an activation of novel chiral dynamics induced by feedback control operations, which can be experimentally confirmed using trapped ions and neutral atoms.</description>
