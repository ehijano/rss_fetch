      <title>Uncovering origins of heterogeneous superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ using quantum sensors</title>

Abstract: The family of nickelate superconductors have long been explored as analogs of the high temperature cuprates. Nonetheless, the recent discovery that certain stoichiometric nickelates superconduct up to high $T_c$ under pressure came as a surprise. The mechanisms underlying the superconducting state remain experimentally unclear. In addition to the practical challenges posed by working in a high pressure environment, typical samples exhibit anomalously weak diamagnetic responses, which have been conjectured to reflect inhomogeneous `filamentary' superconducting states. We perform wide-field, high-pressure, optically detected magnetic resonance spectroscopy to image the local diamagnetic responses of as grown La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ samples \emph{in situ}, using nitrogen vacancy quantum sensors embedded in the diamond anvil cell. These maps confirm significant inhomogeneity of the functional superconducting responses at the few micron scale. By spatially correlating the diamagnetic Meissner response with both the local tensorial stress environment, also imaged \emph{in situ}, and stoichiometric composition, we unravel the dominant mechanisms suppressing and enhancing superconductivity. Our wide-field technique simultaneously provides a broad view of sample behavior and excellent local sensitivity, enabling the rapid construction of multi-parameter phase diagrams from the local structure-function correlations observed at the sub-micron pixel scale.</description>

      <title>Mean-field analysis of a neural network with stochastic STDP</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Analysing biological spiking neural network models with synaptic plasticity has proven to be challenging both theoretically and numerically. In a network with N all-to-all connected neurons, the number of synaptic connections is on the order of $N^2$, making these models computationally demanding. Furthermore, the intricate coupling between neuron and synapse dynamics, along with the heterogeneity generated by plasticity, hinder the use of classic theoretical tools such as mean-field or slow-fast analyses. To address these challenges, we introduce a new variable which we term a typical neuron X. Viewed as a post-synaptic neuron, X is composed of the activity state V , the time since its last spike S, and the empirical distribution $\xi$ of the triplet V , S and W (incoming weight) associated to the pre-synaptic neurons. In particular, we study a stochastic spike-timing- dependent plasticity (STDP) model of connection in a probabilistic Wilson-Cowan spiking neural network model, which features binary neural activity. Taking the large N limit, we obtain from the empirical distribution of the typical neuron a simplified yet accurate representation of the original spiking network. This mean-field limit is a piecewise deterministic Markov process (PDMP) of McKean-Vlasov type, where the typical neuron dynamics depends on its own distribution. We term this analysis McKean-Vlasov mean-field (MKV-MF). Our approach not only reduces computational complexity but also provides insights into the dynamics of this spiking neural network with plasticity. The model obtained is mathematically exact and capable of tracking transient changes. This analysis marks the first exploration of MKV-MF dynamics in a network of spiking neurons interacting with STDP.</description>

      <title>Dynamic roughening of cities driven by multiplicative noise</title>

Abstract: The evolution of urban landscapes is rapidly altering the surface of our planet. Yet, our understanding of the urbanisation phenomenon remains far from complete. A fundamental challenge is to describe spatiotemporal changes in the built environment. A dynamic theory of urban evolution should account for both vertical and horizontal city expansion, analogous to the dynamical behaviour of surface growth in physical and biological systems. Here we show that building-height dynamics in cities around the world are well described by a zero-dimensional geometric Brownian motion (GBM), where multiplicative noise drives stochastic fluctuations around a deterministic drift associated with economic growth. To account for intra-city correlations, we extend the GBM with spatial coupling, revealing how local interactions effectively mitigate noise-driven fluctuations and shape urban morphology. The continuum limit of this spatial model can be recasted into the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation and we find that empirical estimates of the roughness exponent are in the range of the KPZ prediction for most cities. Together, these results show that multiplicative noise, moderated by local interactions, governs the evolution of urban roughness, anchoring spatiotemporal city dynamics in a well-established statistical physics framework.</description>

      <title>Modeling Quantum Geometry for Fractional Chern Insulators with unsupervised learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) in moire materials present a unique platform for exploring strongly correlated topological phases beyond the paradigm of ideal quantum geometry. While analytical approaches to FCIs and fractional quantum Hall states (FQHS) often rely on idealized Bloch wavefunctions, realistic moire models lack direct tunability of quantum metric and Berry curvature, limiting theoretical and numerical exploration. Here, we introduce an unsupervised machine learning framework to model interacting Hamiltonians directly through the distribution of single-particle form factors. Using a variational autoencoder (VAE), we show that unsupervised learning can not only distinguish FCI and non-FCI states, but also generate new form factors with distinct topological character, not present in the training set. This latent space enables the generation and interpolation of form factors for topological flatbands with Chern number $|C|=1$, enabling the discovery of unobserved many-body states such as charge density waves. Principal component analysis (PCA) further reveals that the dominant patterns in the form factors-reflecting correlations across the Brillouin zone-can be decomposed into components with approximately quantized Chern numbers, providing new insights into the global and topological structure of quantum geometry. Our results highlight the ability of machine learning to generalize and model topological quantum systems, paving the way for the inverse design of form factors with tailored quantum geometry and many-body phases in flatband materials.</description>

      <title>Modeling the spatial growth of cities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.03045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growth of cities has traditionally been studied from a population perspective, while urban sprawl - its spatial growth - has often been approached qualitatively. However, characterizing and modeling this spatial expansion is crucial, particularly given its parallels with surface growth extensively studied in physics. Despite these similarities, approaches to urban sprawl modeling are fragmented and scattered across various disciplines and contexts. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the mathematical modeling of this complex phenomenon. We discuss the key challenges hindering progress and examine models inspired by statistical physics, economics and geography, and theoretical ecology. Finally, we highlight critical directions for future research in this interdisciplinary field.</description>

      <title>Detection and characterization of targets in complex media using fingerprint matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07052v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When waves propagate through a complex medium, they undergo several scattering events. This phenomenon is detrimental to imaging, as it causes full blurring of the image. Here we describe a method for detecting, localizing and characterizing any scattering target embedded in a complex medium. We introduce a fingerprint operator that contains the specific signature of the target with respect to its environment. When applied to the recorded reflection matrix, it provides a likelihood index of the target state. This state can be the position of the target for localization purposes, its shape for characterization or any other parameter that influences its response. We demonstrate the versatility of our method by performing proof-of-concept ultrasound experiments on elastic spheres buried inside a strongly scattering granular suspension and on lesion markers, which are commonly used to monitor breast tumours, embedded in a foam mimicking soft tissue. Furthermore, we show how the fingerprint operator can be leveraged to characterize the complex medium itself by mapping the fibre architecture within muscle tissue. Our method is broadly applicable to different types of waves beyond ultrasound for which multi-element technology allows a reflection matrix to be measured.</description>

      <title>Complexity transitions in chaotic quantum systems: Nonstabilizerness, entanglement, and fractal dimension in SYK and random matrix models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09707v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Complex quantum systems -- composed of many, interacting particles -- are intrinsically difficult to model. When a quantum many-body system is subject to disorder, it can undergo transitions to regimes with varying non-ergodic and localized behavior, which can significantly reduce the number of relevant basis states. It remains an open question whether such transitions are also directly related to an abrupt change in the system's complexity. In this work, we study the transition from chaotic to integrable phases in several paradigmatic models, the power-law random banded matrix model, the Rosenzweig--Porter model, and a hybrid SYK+Ising model, comparing three complementary complexity markers -- fractal dimension, von Neumann entanglement entropy, and stabilizer R\'enyi entropy. For all three markers, finite-size scaling reveals sharp transitions between high- and low-complexity regimes, which, however, can occur at different critical points. As a consequence, while in the ergodic and localized regimes the markers align, they diverge significantly in the presence of an intermediate fractal phase. Additionally, our analysis reveals that the stabilizer R\'enyi entropy is more sensitive to underlying many-body symmetries, such as fermion parity and time reversal, than the other markers. As our results show, different markers capture complementary facets of complexity, making it necessary to combine them to obtain a comprehensive diagnosis of phase transitions. The divergence between different complexity markers also has significant consequences for the classical simulability of chaotic many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum Signatures of Strange Attractors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01416v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In classical mechanics, driven systems with dissipation often exhibit complex, fractal dynamics known as strange attractors. This paper addresses the fundamental question of how such structures manifest in the quantum realm. We investigate the quantum Duffing oscillator, a paradigmatic chaotic system, using the Caldirola-Kanai (CK) framework, where dissipation is integrated directly into a time-dependent Hamiltonian. By employing the Husimi distribution to represent the quantum state in phase space, we present the first visualization of a quantum strange attractor within this model. Our simulations demonstrate how an initially simple Gaussian wave packet is stretched, folded, and sculpted by the interplay of chaotic dynamics and energy loss, causing it to localize onto a structure that beautifully mirrors the classical attractor. This quantum "photograph" is inherently smoothed, blurring the infinitely fine fractal details of its classical counterpart as a direct consequence of the uncertainty principle. We supplement this analysis by examining the out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC), which shows that stronger dissipation clarifies the exponential growth associated with the classical Lyapunov exponent, thereby confirming the model's semiclassical behavior. This work offers a compelling geometric perspective on open chaotic quantum systems and sheds new light on the quantum-classical transition.</description>
