      <title>NuSTAR observations of a varying-flux quasar in the Epoch of Reionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With enough X-ray flux to be detected in a 160s scan by SRG/eROSITA, the $z = 6.19$ quasar CFHQS J142952+544717 is, by far, the most luminous X-ray source known at $z &gt; 6$. We present deep (245 ks) NuSTAR observations of this source; with $\sim180$ net counts in the combined observations, CFHQS J142952+544717 is the most distant object ever observed by the observatory. Fortuitously, this source was independently observed by Chandra $\sim110$ days earlier, enabling the identification of two nearby (30'' and 45'' away), fainter X-ray sources. We jointly fit both Chandra and NuSTAR observations--self-consistently including interloper sources--and find that, to greater than 90% confidence, the observed 3-7 keV flux varied by a factor of $\sim2.6$ during that period, corresponding to approximately two weeks in the quasar rest-frame. This brightening is one the most extreme instances of statistically significant X-ray variability seen in the Epoch of Reionization. We discuss possible scenarios that could produce such rapid change, including X-ray emission from jets too faint at radio frequencies to be observed.</description>

      <title>PSZ2 G181.06+48.47 I: X-ray exploration of a low-mass cluster with exceptionally-distant radio relics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relics are diffuse, highly-polarized radio sources that trace merger-driven shocks at the periphery of merging galaxy clusters. The LOFAR survey recently discovered a rare example of double relics in the low-mass cluster PSZ2 G181.06+48.47. Through a detailed exploration of new Chandra and XMM-Newton observations, we reveal that PSZ2 G181.06+48.47 has a lower mass ($M_{500,X}=2.57^{+0.37}_{-0.38}\times10^{14}$ M$_{\odot}$) than previously thought. Despite its cool global temperature of $kT_{500}=3.86^{+0.27}_{-0.29}$ keV, PSZ2 G181.06+48.47 is one of the most disturbed clusters in the Planck sample, with a complex morphological and thermodynamic structure. We discover a set of three discontinuities within &lt;500 kpc of the cluster center, and, from a surface brightness analysis, place $5\sigma$ upper limits of $M_{NE}&lt;1.43$ and $M_{SW}&lt;1.57$ for any shock associated with the relic locations. We also revise established scaling relations for double radio-relics by adding 12 new systems not included in previous work. The PSZ2 G181.06+48.47 relics have the widest separation (scaled for $r_{500}$) of all known double-relic systems. The exceptional distance from the cluster center ($&gt;r_{200}$), indicates the relics may be associated with shocks in the ``run-away" phase. We propose that this late-stage, post-apocenter merger is captured as the two subclusters with a mass ratio of 1.2-1.4 fall back into each other. The outer relic shocks were likely produced at the first core passage, while the inner discontinuities are associated with the second infall.</description>

      <title>Cassiopeia A's Reverse Shock and its Effects on the Expanding SN Ejecta</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using optical and near-infrared images of the Cassiopeia A (Cas A) supernova remnant covering the time period 1951 to 2022, together with optical spectra of selected filaments, we present an investigation of Cas A's reverse shock velocity and the effects it has on the remnant's metal-rich ejecta. We find the sequence of optical ejecta brightening and the appearance of new optical ejecta indicating the advancement of the remnant's reverse shock in the remnant's main shell has velocities typically between 1000 and 2000 km/s, which is ~1000 km/s less than recent measurements made in X-rays. We further find the reverse shock appears to move much more slowly and is nearly even stationary in the sky frame along the remnant's western limb. However, we do not find the reverse shock to move inward at velocities as large as ~2000 km/s as has been reported. Optical ejecta in Cas A's main emission shell have proper motions indicating outward tangential motions ~3500 - 6000 km/s, with the smaller values preferentially along the remnant's southern regions which we speculate may be partially the cause of the remnant's faint and more slowly evolving southern sections. Following interaction with the reverse shock, ejecta knots exhibit extended mass ablated trails 0.2" - 0.5" in length leading to extended emission indicating reverse shock induced decelerated velocities as large as 1000 km/s. Such ablated material is most prominently seen in higher ionization line emissions, whereas denser parts of ejecta knots show surprisingly little deceleration.</description>

      <title>Timing and noise analysis of five millisecond pulsars observed with MeerKAT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Millisecond pulsars (MSPs) in binary systems are precise laboratories for tests of gravity and the physics of dense matter. Their orbits can show relativistic effects that provide a measurement of the neutron star mass and the pulsars are included in timing array experiments that search for gravitational waves. Neutron star mass measurements are key to eventually solving the neutron star equation of state and these can be obtained by a measure of the Shapiro delay if the orbit is viewed near edge-on. Here we report on the timing and noise analysis of five MSPs observed with the MeerKAT radio telescope: PSRs J0900$-$3144, J0921$-$5202, J1216$-$6410, J1327$-$0755 and J1543$-$5149. We searched for the Shapiro delay in all of the pulsars and obtain weak detections for PSRs J0900$-$3144, J1216$-$6410, and J1327$-$0755. We report a higher significance detection of the Shapiro delay for PSR J1543$-$5149, giving a precise pulsar mass of $M_{\rm p} = 1.349^{+0.043}_{-0.061}\,$M$_\odot$ and companion white-dwarf mass $M_{\rm c} = 0.223^{+0.005}_{-0.007}\,$M$_\odot$. This is an atypically low mass measurement for a recycled MSP. In addition to these Shapiro delays, we also obtain timing model parameters including proper motions and parallax constraints for most of the pulsars.</description>

      <title>Periodic Gamma-ray Modulation of the blazar PG 1553+113 Confirmed by Fermi-LAT and Multi-wavelength Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A 2.1-year periodic oscillation of the gamma-ray flux from the blazar PG 1553+113 has previously been tentatively identified in almost 7 year of data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope. After 15 years of Fermi sky-survey observations, doubling the total time range, we report &gt;7 cycle gamma-ray modulation with an estimated significance of 4 sigma against stochastic red noise. Independent determinations of oscillation period and phase in the earlier and the new data are in close agreement (chance probability &lt;0.01). Pulse timing over the full light curve is also consistent with a coherent periodicity. Multiwavelength new data from Swift X-Ray Telescope, Burst Alert Telescope, and UVOT, and from KAIT, Catalina Sky Survey, All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae, and Owens Valley Radio Observatory ground-based observatories as well as archival Rossi X-Ray Timing Explorer satellite-All Sky Monitor data, published optical data of Tuorla, and optical historical Harvard plates data are included in our work. Optical and radio light curves show clear correlations with the gamma-ray modulation, possibly with a nonconstant time lag for the radio flux. We interpret the gamma-ray periodicity as possibly arising from a pulsational accretion flow in a sub-parsec binary supermassive black hole system of elevated mass ratio, with orbital modulation of the supplied material and energy in the jet. Other astrophysical scenarios introduced include instabilities, disk and jet precession, rotation or nutation, and perturbations by massive stars or intermediate-mass black holes in polar orbit.</description>

      <title>Role of injection parameters in jet propagation through realistic binary neutron star merger environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: After the first multi-messenger observation of a binary neutron star (BNS) merger powering a short-duration gamma-ray burst (GRB), GW170817-GRB 170817A, remarkable effort is ongoing to unravel the evolution of the collimated, relativistic outflow (or jet) that was launched during the merger and fed the GRB event, imprinting its angular structure onto the follow-up afterglow signal. Current theoretical models, based on relativistic magneto-hydrodynamic (RMHD) simulations, offer detailed insights into the launch and propagation processes that govern jet evolution. Notably, these simulations point out that jet injection parameters, such as luminosity, magnetization, power decay time scale, and launch time relative to merger, play a crucial role. However, the impact of these parameters is typically investigated within simplified jet propagation environments, lacking a direct connection with a realistic BNS merger aftermath. In this work, we present the first suite of 3D RMHD simulations exploring the influence of such parameters on the propagation of magnetized incipient GRB jets injected into magnetized environments directly imported from the outcome of a general-relativistic MHD BNS merger simulation. Our results demonstrate that, alongside the injection parameters, the BNS merger environment has a central role in shaping the overall jet evolution. Specifically, under identical jet parameters, the fate of an incipient jet (whether it successfully breaks out or becomes choked) depends strongly on the properties of such environment. Further quantitative comparison between realistic and simplified environments reveals major differences, emphasizing the importance of incorporating the former for accurate modeling.</description>

      <title>Probing Spectral Evolution and Intrinsic Variability of Mkn\,421: A Multi-Epoch AstroSat Study of X-ray Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our study presents a time-resolved X-ray spectral analysis of Mkn 421, using AstroSat observations taken during different epochs between 2016 and 2019. The variability of the source in X-rays is utilized to investigate the evolution of its spectral properties. Each observation period was divided into segments of about 10 ks, and we employed three forms of particle distributions: broken-power law (BPL), log-parabola (LP), and power-law with maximum electron energy (xi-max model) undergoing synchrotron losses to fit the broad X-ray spectrum in each segment. We observed that all of these models provided good fits to the spectra. In the case of the broken-power law model, we investigated the relationship between normalized particle density at an energy less than the break energy and the index before the break. The results revealed an inverse correlation between the index and particle density with no time delay. Additionally, correlations between spectral parameters were used to determine the pivot energy. We observed that the pivot energy remained the same across the observations. For xi-max and LP models, we define analogous pivot energies and show that they also do not vary, indicating the model-independent nature of the result. The constant pivot energy suggests that the source's variability arises from index variations and not due to changes in the normalization. Consequently, parameters such as magnetic field strength, Doppler factor, etc., do not contribute to the source's variability. Instead, variations are primarily associated with the acceleration or escape timescales of emitted particles within the source.</description>

      <title>Reflection-dominated Compton-thick AGN Candidates in the SRG/eROSITA Lockman Hole Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We search for reflection-dominated Compton-thick active galactic nuclei (CT AGN) candidates in the Lockman Hole region using the data of SRG/eROSITA Lockman Hole survey. We selected sources with anomalously hard photon indices in the $0.3 - 8.0$ keV band, untypical for type I AGN. In particular, we required that the upper end of the $90\%$ error interval did not exceed a fiducial boundary of $\Gamma=1.3$. We found 291 sources which constitute a rare subpopulation among extragalactic X-ray sources detected by eROSITA in the Lockman Hole field, $\approx 5\%$. These sources constitute the eROSITA sample of CT AGN candidates in the Lockman Hole field. We further divide the sources into three categories depending on the availability of reliable redshift and statistically significant detection of intrinsic absorption. We present two catalogues: the bright sample (37 sources) and the faint one (254). We estimate the fraction and sky density of reflection-dominated CT AGN candidates. We show examples of individual spectra and use stacking analysis to search for possible redshift evolution of their properties with redshift. We analyse combined eROSITA spectra of bright sources of different categories with a physically motivated spectral model UXCLUMPY and find them fully consistent with the fits to the about $\sim 1$ Msec XMM-Newton data for one of our reflection-dominated CT candidates, Type 2 galaxy $\text{SRGe J105348.6+573032}$. The catalogues of CT AGN candidates could be a good starting point for planning future studies and follow-ups at all wavelengths.</description>

      <title>Discovery of 26 new Galactic radio transients by MeerTRAP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio searches for single pulses provide the opportunity to discover one-off events, fast transients and some pulsars that might otherwise be missed by conventional periodicity searches. The MeerTRAP real-time search pipeline operates commensally to observations with the MeerKAT telescope. Here, we report on 26 new Galactic radio transients, mostly rotating radio transients (RRATs) and also the detection of one RRAT and two pulsars that were independently discovered by other surveys. The dispersion measures of two of the new sources marginally exceed the Galactic contribution depending on the electron density model used. Using a simple method of fitting a Gaussian function to individual pulses, and obtaining positions of arcsecond accuracy from image-based localisations using channelised voltage data from our transient buffer, we have derived timing solutions spanning multiple years for five sources. The timing parameters imply ages of several Myr and low surface magnetic field strengths which is characteristic of RRATs. We were able to measure spin periods for eight more transients, including one source which appears to rotate every 17.5 seconds. A majority of the sources have only been seen in one observation, sometimes despite multiple return visits to the field. Some sources exhibit complex emission features like component switching and periodic microstructure.</description>

      <title>Cosmic quenching and scaling laws for the evolution of supermassive black holes and host galaxies</title>

Abstract: Observations suggest an SMBH-host coevolution. We consider the mass and energy flow in a bulge suffused by gases of varying temperatures. By assuming the rate of energy flow independent of the distance from the bulge center and the local virial equilibrium for permeated gases, a key parameter $\varepsilon_b$ was identified that quantifies the rate of mass and energy flow in gases and the efficiency of gas cooling and thus regulates the coevolution of SMBHs and hosts. Using Illustris simulations, we found $\varepsilon_b\propto (1+z)^{5/2}$. A higher $\varepsilon_b$ in the early Universe means a more efficient gas cooling that allows initial rapid growth of SMBHs and hosts. This simple theory, characterized by $\varepsilon_b$, provides the dominant mean cosmic evolution of SMBHs and hosts. All other transient phenomena may only contribute to the dispersion around mean evolution. Relevant scaling laws involving $\varepsilon_b$ were identified. For host galaxies, the mass-size relation $M_b\propto \varepsilon_b^{2/3}r_b^{5/3}G^{-1}$, dispersion-size relation $\sigma_b^2\propto(\varepsilon_b r_b)^{2/3}\propto (1+z)$, or the mass-dispersion relation $M_b\propto \varepsilon_b^{-1}G^{-1}\sigma_b^5$ were identified, where size $r_b\propto (1+z)^{-1}$. For SMBHs, three evolution phases were found involving an initial rapid growth stage with a rising luminosity $L_B\propto (\varepsilon_b M_{BH})^{4/5}$, a transition stage with a declining $L_B\propto \varepsilon_b^2 M_{BH} \propto (1+z)^5$, and a dormant stage with $L_B\propto (\varepsilon_b M_{BH})^{4/3}$. Results suggest a rapid initial super-Eddington growth with a new redshift-dependent luminosity limit $L_X\propto\varepsilon_b^{4/5}M_{BH}^{4/5}G^{-1/5}c$, in contrast to the Eddington limit. Analytical solutions are formulated for the BH and AGN mass functions and AGN duty cycle and predict a slope of -1/5 for the faint-end luminosity function.</description>

      <title>Helical Magnetic Field in a Massive Protostellar Jet</title>

Abstract: Highly collimated outflows (jets) are observed across a wide range of astrophysical systems involving the accretion of material onto central objects, from supermassive black holes in active galaxies to proto-brown dwarfs and stellar-mass black holes. Despite the diversity of their driving sources, it is believed that all jets are different manifestations of a single universal phenomenon. However, a unified explanation for their ejection and collimation remains elusive. In this study we present the first rotation measure analysis of the polarized synchrotron emission ever performed in a protostellar radio jet, which allows us to reveal its true 3D magnetic structure. Unlike extragalactic radio jets, which often exhibit faint counterjets, protostellar radio jets allow both the jet and the counterjet to be analyzed. This exceptional circumstance allows us to unveil the magnetic field structure of both components. Our findings provide the first solid evidence for a helical magnetic field within a protostellar jet, supporting the universality of the jet collimation mechanism.</description>

      <title>Widen the Resonance: Probing a New Regime of Neutrino Self-Interactions with Astrophysical Neutrinos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutrino self-interactions beyond the standard model have profound implications in astrophysics and cosmology. In this work, we study an uncharted scenario in which one of the three neutrino species has a mass much smaller than the temperature of the cosmic neutrino background. This results in a relativistic component that significantly broadens the absorption feature on the astrophysical neutrino spectra, in contrast to the sharply peaked absorption expected in the extensively studied scenarios assuming a fully nonrelativistic cosmic neutrino background. By solving the Boltzmann equations for neutrino absorption and regeneration, we demonstrate that this mechanism provides novel sensitivity to sub-keV mediator masses, well below the traditional $\sim 1$--100 MeV range. Future observations of the diffuse supernova neutrino background with Hyper-Kamiokande could probe coupling strengths down to $g \sim 10^{-8}$, surpassing existing constraints by orders of magnitude. These findings open new directions for discoveries and offer crucial insights into the interplay between neutrinos and the dark sector.</description>

      <title>Numerical and Physical Challenges to Nebular Spectroscopy in Thermonuclear Supernovae</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermodynamical explosions of White Dwarfs (WD)are one of the keys to high precision cosmology. Nebular spectra, namely mid-infrared (MIR) with JWST are an effective tool to probe for the multi-dimensional imprints of the explosion physics of WDs and their progenitor systems but also pose a challenge for simulations. What we observe as SNe Ia are low-energy photons, namely light curves, and spectra detected some days to years after the explosion. The light is emitted from a rapidly expanding envelope consisting of a low-density and low-temperature plasma with atomic population numbers far from thermodynamical equilibrium. SNe Ia are powered radioactive decays which produce hard X- and gamma-rays and MeV leptons which are converted within the ejecta to low-energy photons. We find that the optical and IR nebular spectra depend sensitively on the proper treatment of the physical conversion of high to low energies. The low-energy photons produced by forbidden line transitions originate from a mostly optically thin envelope. However, the UV is optically thick because of a quasi-continuum formed by allowed lines and bound-free transitions even several years after the explosion. We find that stimulated recombination limits the over-ionization of high ions with populations governed by the far UV. The requirements to simulate nebular spectra are well beyond both classical stellar atmospheres and nebulae. Using our full non-LTE HYDrodynamical RAdiation code (HYDRA) as a test-bed, the sensitivity on the physics on synthetic spectra are demonstrated using observations as a benchmark. At some examples, we establish the power of high-precision nebular spectroscopy as quantitative tool. Centrally ignited, off-center delayed-detonation near Chandrasekhar-mass models can reproduce line-ratios and line profiles of Branch-normal and underluminous SNe Ia observed with JWST.</description>

Abstract: Core-collapse supernovae (SNe) provide a unique environment to study Feebly Interacting Particles (FIPs) such as Axion-Like Particles (ALPs), sterile neutrinos, and Dark Photons (DPs). This paper focuses on heavy FIPs produced in SNe, whose decay produces electrons and positrons, generating observable secondary signals during their propagation and annihilation. We focus on the In-flight Annihilation (IA) of positrons, which emerge as the most significant contribution to the resulting gamma-ray spectrum. Using data from COMPTEL and EGRET we derive the most stringent bounds on the FIP-electron couplings for heavy ALPs, sterile neutrinos, and DPs. These results strenghten existing bounds of one or two orders of magnitude, depending on the FIP model.</description>

      <title>New Constraints on Axion Mediated Dipole-Dipole Interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The search for axions sits at the intersection of solving critical problems in fundamental physics, including the strong CP problem in QCD, uncovering the nature of dark matter, and understanding the origin of the universe's matter-antimatter asymmetry. The measurement of axion-mediated spin-dependent interactions offers a powerful approach for axion detection. However, it has long been restricted to regions outside the 'axion window' due to a significant trade-off: the need to effectively suppress the magnetic leakage from highly polarized spin sources while simultaneously detecting sub-femtotesla level exotic physics signals at sub-decimeter-scale distances. In this work, we report new experimental results on axion-mediated exotic spin-spin interactions using an iron-shielded SmCo$_5$ spin source in combination with a specially designed self-compensation comagnetometer. Employing a composite shielding structure, we achieved a suppression of the magnetic field by up to $10^{11}$. This enabled us to establish new constraints on the coupling between electrons and neutrons, surpassing previous experimental limits by more than 10000 times within the axion window. Furthermore, we also set strongest constraints on the coupling between electrons and protons. The proposed method holds substantial potential not only for advancing the search for new physics beyond the Standard Model but also for enabling transformative applications in biological and chemical research.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The work investigates the features of galactic cosmic ray density and anisotropy behavior and their relation to solar sources, interplanetary and geomagnetic disturbances from May 8 to May 13, 2024. During this time, powerful solar flares and fast CMEs were recorded, leading to registration of an extreme geomagnetic storm along with one of the most significant Forbush effects for the entire observation period. All the calculations of cosmic ray characteristics are made using the data of global neutron monitor network and unique methods maintained at IZMIRAN: the Global Survey Method and the Ring of Stations Method. It is determined that the magnitude of Forbush effect under study was 15.7% (for particles with 10 GV rigidity) and as an extreme geomagnetic storm was recorded there was a significant magnetospheric effect observed in the data of neutron monitors (~4%).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-consistent mean-field methods with Skyrme-type effective interactions and semiclassical approximations, such as the Thomas-Fermi approach and its extensions are particularly well-suited for describing in a thermodynamically consistent way the various phases of the dense matter present in the interior of neutron stars. These methods have been applied to predict the composition of the different regions, including the inner crust constituted by nuclear clusters coexisting with free neutrons and electrons. Because of the computational cost, the energy is typically calculated for a few selected average baryon number densities, and the results are interpolated to obtain the pressure numerically. However, this may introduce systematic errors in the calculations of the global structure of a neutron star and its dynamical evolution. In this paper, we show how the full equation of state can be consistently calculated within the same framework by deriving exact formulas for the chemical potentials and for the pressure that can be easily implemented in existing computer codes. These formulas are applicable to both catalyzed and accreted crusts. We discuss in each case the suitable conditions to impose to determine the composition. Numerical examples are also presented and discussed. Results from refined calculations of the BSk24 equation of state for the inner crust of nonaccreted neutron stars and the corresponding adiabatic index are provided.</description>

      <title>Global 3-D Simulations of Magnetospheric Accretion: II. Hot Spots, Equilibrium Torque, Episodic Wind, and Midplane Outflow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Global 3-D magnetohydrodynamical simulations have been conducted to study magnetospheric accretion around stars with various spin rates. For slow rotators, characterized by a fastness parameter $\omega_s\lesssim 0.78$, the disk's inner edge at the magnetospheric truncation radius becomes unstable to the interchange instability, leading to intruding filaments which produce hot spots closer to the stellar equator. Depending on spin rate, slow rotators can be in ``chaotic'' or ``ordered'' unstable regimes. For fast rotators, the interchange instability is suppressed by the super-Keplerian rotation beyond the corotation radius, and hot spots are generated only through polar accretion. Low- and mid-energy flux hot spots cover $\lesssim20\%$ and $\lesssim3\%$ of the surface, with faster rotators tending to produce hotter spots. Beyond the truncation radius, angular momentum transfers from the disk surface to the midplane, resulting in surface accretion and midplane outflow. The midplane outflow may transport thermally processed materials (e.g. those in chondrites) to the outer disk. Field inflation generates episodic winds with mass-loss rates $\sim 1\%-40\%$ of the accretion rate, depending on stellar spin. Frequent magnetic reconnections lead to efficient star-disk coupling. We derive the torque exerted by the disk on the star as a function of stellar spin. For fast rotators/propellers, both spin-down torque and disk wind rate increase dramatically with stellar spin. The equilibrium spin state occurs at $\omega_s\sim0.7$, with wind/jet speeds ($\sim$500 km/s) and mass loss rates ($\sim10\%$ accretion rate) aligning with observations. Most results are insensitive to disk thickness. Finally, we present testable predictions for how observables vary with stellar spin.</description>

      <title>New Limits on Ultralight Axionlike Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: New limits on the axion-nucleon coupling over the axion mass region $10^{-24} \leq m_a \leq 5 \times 10^{-21}$ eV are derived by reanalyzing data from laboratory measurements on Lorentz and $CPT$ violation. These results establish the first laboratory constraints on the axion-nucleon coupling for axion masses below $10^{-22}$ eV. For $10^{-22} \leq m_a \leq 5 \times 10^{-21}$ eV, the results improve upon previous laboratory limits by more than 3 orders of magnitude, exceeding for the first time the astrophysical limits from supernova SN1987A cooling. For the axion mass range of interest corresponding to ultralow frequencies, the crucial initial phase of the axion field is considered. Furthermore, the obtained limits are nearly equivalent to those projected for a recently proposed experiment employing high-intensity neutron beams at the European Spallation Source [Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 181001 (2024)]. For an alternative type of axion-nucleon interaction, the quadratic wind coupling, the constraints exceed the current best results by approximately 2 orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Neutrino fast flavor oscillations with moments: linear stability analysis and application to neutron star mergers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.11968v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Providing an accurate modeling of neutrino physics in dense astrophysical environments such as binary neutron star mergers presents a challenge for hydrodynamic simulations. Nevertheless, understanding how flavor transformation can occur and affect the dynamics, the mass ejection, and the nucleosynthesis will need to be achieved in the future. Computationally expensive, large-scale simulations frequently evolve the first classical angular moments of the neutrino distributions. By promoting these quantities to matrices in flavor space, we develop a linear stability analysis of fast flavor oscillations using only the first two "quantum" moments, which notably requires generalizing the classical closure relations that appropriately truncate the hierarchy of moment equations in order to treat quantum flavor coherence. After showing the efficiency of this method on a well-understood test situation, we perform a systematic search of the occurrence of fast flavor instabilities in a neutron star merger simulation. We discuss the successes and shortcomings of moment linear stability analysis, as this framework provides a time-efficient way to design and study better closure prescriptions in the future.</description>

Abstract: We carried out long-term monitoring of the LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA binary black hole (BBH) merger candidate S230922g in search of electromagnetic emission from the interaction of the merger remnant with an embedding active galactic nuclei (AGN) accretion disk. Using a dataset primarily composed of wide-field imaging from the Dark Energy Camera (DECam) and supplemented by additional photometric and spectroscopic resources, we searched ~ 70% of the sky area probability for transient phenomena, and discovered 6 counterpart candidates. One especially promising candidate - AT 2023aagj - exhibited temporally varying asymmetric components in spectral broad line regions, a feature potentially indicative of an off-center event such as a BBH merger. This represents the first live search and multiwavelength, photometric, and spectroscopic monitoring of a GW BBH optical counterpart candidate in the disk of an AGN.</description>

      <title>Neutrino-driven Core-collapse Supernova Yields in Galactic Chemical Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14319v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide yields from 189 neutrino-driven core-collapse supernova (CCSN) simulations covering zero-age main sequence masses between 11 and 75 solar masses and three different metallicities. Our CCSN simulations have two main advantages compared to previous methods used for applications in Galactic chemical evolution (GCE). Firstly, the mass cut between remnant and ejecta evolves naturally. Secondly, the neutrino luminosities and thus the electron fraction are not modified. Both is key to obtain an accurate nucleosynthesis. We follow the composition with an in-situ nuclear reaction network including the 16 most abundant isotopes and use the yields as input in a GCE model of the Milky Way. We adopt a GCE which takes into account infall of gas as well as nucleosynthesis from a large variety of stellar sources. The GCE model is calibrated to reproduce the main features of the solar vicinity. For the CCSN models, we use different calibrations and propagate the uncertainty. We find a big impact of the CCSN yields on our GCE predictions. We compare the abundance ratios of C, O, Ne, Mg, Si, S, Ar, Ca, Ti, and Cr with respect to Fe to an observational data set as homogeneous as possible. From this, we conclude that at least half of the massive stars have to explode to match the observed abundance ratios. If the explosions are too energetic, the high amount of iron will suppress the abundance ratios. With this, we demonstrate how GCE models can be used to constrain the evolution and deaths of massive stars.</description>

      <title>Hyperons during proto-neutron star deleptonization and the emission of dark flavoured particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01406v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Complementary to high-energy experimental efforts, indirect astrophysical searches of particles beyond the standard model have long been pursued. The present article follows the latter approach and considers, for the first time, the self-consistent treatment of the energy losses from dark flavoured particles produced in the decay of hyperons during a core-collapse supernova (CCSN). To this end, general relativistic supernova simulations in spherical symmetry are performed, featuring six-species Boltzmann neutrino transport, and covering the long-term evolution of the nascent remnant proto-neutron star (PNS) deleptonization for several tens of seconds. A well-calibrated hyperon equation of state (EOS) is therefore implemented into the supernova simulations and tested against the corresponding nucleonic model. It is found that supernova observables, such as the neutrino signal, are robustly insensitive to the appearance of hyperons for the simulation times considered in the present study. The presence of hyperons enables an additional channel for the appearance of dark sector particles, which is considered at the level of the $\Lambda$ hyperon decay. Assuming massless particles that escape the PNS after being produced, these channels expedite the deleptonizing PNS and the cooling behaviour. This, in turn, shortens the neutrino emission timescale. The present study confirms the previously estimated upper limits on the corresponding branching ratios for low and high mass PNS, by effectively reducing the neutrino emission timescale by a factor of two. This is consistent with the classical argument deduced from the neutrino detection associated with SN1987A.</description>

      <title>Reality of inverse cascading in neutron star crusts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08819v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The braking torque that dictates the timing properties of magnetars is closely tied to the large-scale dipolar magnetic field on their surface. The formation of this field has been a topic of ongoing debate. One proposed mechanism, based on macroscopic principles, involves an inverse cascade within the neutron star's crust. However, this phenomenon has not been observed in realistic simulations. In this study, we provide compelling evidence supporting the feasibility of the inverse cascading process in the presence of an initial helical magnetic field within realistic neutron star crusts and discuss its contribution to the amplification of the large-scale magnetic field. Our findings, derived from a systematic investigation that considers various coordinate systems, peak wavenumber positions, crustal thicknesses, magnetic boundary conditions, and magnetic Lundquist numbers, reveal that the specific geometry of the crustal domain-with its extreme aspect ratio-requires an initial peak wavenumber from small-scale structures for the inverse cascade to occur. However, this same aspect ratio confines the cascade to structures on the scale of the crust, making the formation of a large-scale dipolar surface field unlikely. Despite these limitations, the inverse cascade remains a significant factor in the magnetic field evolution within the crust and may help explain highly magnetized objects with weak surface dipolar fields, such as low-field magnetars and central compact objects.</description>

Abstract: The Zwicky Transient Facility SN Ia Data Release 2 (ZTF SN Ia DR2) contains more than 3,000 Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), providing the largest homogeneous low-redshift sample of SNe Ia. Having at least one spectrum per event, this data collection is ideal for large-scale statistical studies of the photometric, spectroscopic and host-galaxy properties of SNe Ia, particularly of the rarer 'peculiar' sub-classes. In this paper we first present the method we developed to spectroscopically classify the SNe in the sample, and the techniques we used to model their multi-band light curves and explore their photometric properties. We then show a method to distinguish between the peculiar sub-types and the normal SNe Ia. We also explore the properties of their host galaxies and estimate their relative rates, focusing on the peculiar sub-types and their connection to the cosmologically useful SNe Ia. Finally, we discuss the implications of our study with respect to the progenitor systems of the peculiar SN Ia events.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16189v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A hadron-quark phase transition (PT) may trigger supernova explosions during stellar core collapse. However, both success and failure have occurred in previous attempts to explode dying stars via this mechanism. We systematically explore the outcomes of the PT-induced collapse of mock proto-compact stars (PCSs) with a constant entropy and lepton fraction, with spherically symmetric general relativistic hydrodynamic simulations and a controlled series of hybrid equations of state. Our results reveal the qualitative dependence of successful and failed explosions on the PT and quark matter characteristics. A small portion ($\sim\!0.04\%\!-\!1\%$) of the released binding energy $\Delta E_B$ transforms into the diagnostic explosion energy $E_{\rm exp,diag}$, which saturates at $\sim\!6\times10^{51}$ erg near the black hole formation. Note that our $E_{\rm exp,diag}$ represents an upper limit of the final explosion energies in realistic supernova simulations. We draw the phase diagrams indicative of the possible fates of supernova explosions driven by hadron-quark PTs, where the control parameters are the onset density, energy gap of the PT, and the quark matter speed of sound. Our findings can guide further self-consistent investigations on PT-driven core-collapse supernovae and help identify hadron-quark PT-induced PCS collapse from future observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07036v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new predictive theory for the analysis of common envelope (CE) events which incorporates the effects of relevant hydrodynamical processes into a simple analytical framework. We introduce the ejection and dynamical parameters $\xi$ and $\beta$, which define if envelope ejection is energetically or hydrodynamically favorable, respectively, during CE inspiral. When combined, these parameters offer a detailed narrative of how inspiral begins, proceeds, and ends that is consistent with preliminary comparisons to 3D hydrodynamical models. This physically-motivated framework impacts predictions for CE outcomes, especially for systems that have energy excess, and offers promise as a potential alternative for the treatment of CE in binary population synthesis.</description>

      <title>Ultralight Black Holes as Sources of High-Energy Particles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07037v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The \textit{memory burden} effect, stating that the amount of information stored within a system contributes to its stabilization, is particularly significant in systems with a high capacity for information storage such as black holes (BHs). In these systems, the evaporation process is halted, at the latest, after approximately half of the BH's initial mass has been radiated away. Consequently, light primordial BHs (PBHs) of mass $m_{\rm PBH} \lesssim 10^{15}$\,g, which are expected to have fully evaporated by present time, may remain viable candidates for dark matter (DM). In this scenario, we demonstrate that their mergers would continue to occur today, leading to the formation of ``young'' BHs that resume evaporating, producing ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays detectable by current experiments. The emission spectrum would be thermal in all Standard Model particle species, offering a clear and distinguishable signature. Current measurements of the isotropic neutrino flux at Earth are in tension with light PBHs as DM candidates within the mass range $7\times10^3\lesssim m_{\rm PBH}/{\rm g}\lesssim 4\times 10^8$. Contrarily to existing bounds, our results depend uniquely on the mass of the remnant and not on the specific model building details of the stabilized phase. We also discuss the potential for refining these constraints through gamma-ray and cosmic-ray observations, as well as gravitational wave detections.</description>

      <title>Bulk Motions in the Black Hole Jet Sheath as a Candidate for the Comptonizing Corona</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10662v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using two-dimensional general relativistic resistive magnetohydrodynamic simulations, we investigate the properties of the sheath separating the black hole jet from the surrounding medium. We find that the electromagnetic power flowing through the jet sheath is comparable to the overall accretion power of the black hole. The sheath is an important site of energy dissipation as revealed by the copious appearance of reconnection layers and plasmoid chains. About 20% of the sheath power is dissipated between 2 and 10 gravitational radii. The plasma in the dissipative sheath moves along a nearly paraboloidal surface with trans-relativistic bulk motions dominated by the radial component, whose dimensionless 4-velocity is $\sim1.2\pm0.5$. In the frame moving with the mean (radially-dependent) velocity, the distribution of stochastic bulk motions resembles a Maxwellian with an `effective bulk temperature' of $\sim$100 keV. Scaling the global simulation to Cygnus X-1 parameters gives a rough estimate of the Thomson optical depth across the jet sheath $\sim 0.01-0.1$, and it may increase in future magnetohydrodynamic simulations with self-consistent radiative losses. These properties suggest that the dissipative jet sheath may be a viable `coronal' region, capable of upscattering seed soft photons into a hard, nonthermal tail, as seen during the hard states of X-ray binaries and active galactic nuclei.</description>

      <title>Energy-resolved pulse profile changes in V 0332+53: Indications of wings in the cyclotron absorption line profile</title>

Abstract: We aim to investigate the energy-resolved pulse profile changes of the accreting X-ray pulsar V 0332+53, focusing in the cyclotron line energy range, using the full set of available NuSTAR observations. We applied a tailored pipeline to study the energy dependence of the pulse profiles and to build the pulsed fraction spectra (PFS) for the different observations. We studied the profile changes also using cross-correlation and lag spectra. We re-analysed the energy spectra to search for links between the local features observed in the PFS and spectral emission components associated with the shape of the fundamental cyclotron line. In the PFS data, with sufficiently high statistics, we observe a consistent behaviour around the cyclotron line energy. Specifically, two Gaussian-shaped features appear symmetrically on either side of the putative cyclotron line. These features exhibit minimal variation with source luminosity, and their peak positions consistently remain on the left and right of the cyclotron line energy. Associated with the cyclotron line-forming region, we interpret them as evidence for the resonant cyclotron absorption line wings, as predicted by theoretical models of how the cyclotron line profile should appear along the observer's line of sight. A phase-resolved analysis of the pulse in the energy bands surrounding these features enables us to determine both the spectral shape and the intensity of the photons responsible for these peaks in the PFS. Assuming these features correspond to a spectral component, we used their shapes as priors for the corresponding emission components, finding a statistically satisfactory description of the spectra. To explain these results, we propose that our line of sight is close to the direction of the spin axis, while the magnetic axis is likely orthogonal to it.</description>

      <title>Modeling the Saddle-like GeV-TeV Spectrum of HESS J1809-193: $\gamma$-Rays Arising from Reverse-Shocked Pulsar Wind Nebula?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05944</link>

Abstract: Evolution of pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe) could be expected to leave imprints in $\gamma$-rays. We suggest that intriguing GeV-TeV spectral energy distribution (SED) of HESS J1809$-$193 and Fermi-LAT source J1810.3$-$1925e is very likely to be the $\gamma$-ray signature of PWN J1809$-$193 in light of the scenario that the PWN was struck by the reverse shock of the parent supernova remnant. Based on evolutionary theory of PWNe, we consider that, when the PWN was disrupted during collision by the reverse shock, some very high-energy electrons escaped impulsively. The remaining electrons stayed in the relic PWN, which was displaced from the pulsar. The very high-energy part of the remaining electrons were depleted by the strong magnetic field that was enhanced by the reverse shock compression in the reverberation stage, leaving the other part of them generating GeV emission. The particles injected from the pulsar after the disruption enter the relic PWN through the newly formed tunnel called the cocoon. The $\gamma$-ray emission from the escaped electrons can account for the TeV spectrum of component A of HESS J1809$-$193 or the TeV halo, while the electrons remaining after disruption can account for the GeV spectrum of J1810.3$-$1925e. Thus, combination of contributions from these two populations of electrons naturally reproduces the saddle-like SED of HESS J1809$-$193 and J1810.3$-$1925e from 5 GeV to 30 TeV, together with the spectral hardening around 100 GeV. We also show that the post-disruption injection of electrons can explain the spectrum of the relatively faint $\gamma$-ray emission of component B of HESS J1809$-$193.</description>

      <title>Probing internal dissipative processes of neutron stars with gravitational waves during the inspiral of neutron star binaries</title>

Abstract: We study the impact of out-of-equilibrium, dissipative effects on the dynamics of inspiraling neutron stars. We find that modeling dissipative processes (such as those from the stars internal effective fluid viscosity) requires that one introduce a new tidal deformability parameter--the dissipative tidal deformability--which modifies the phase of gravitational waves emitted during the inspiral phase of a neutron star binary. We show that the dissipative tidal deformability corrects the gravitational-wave phase at 4 post-Newtonian order for quasi-circular binaries. This correction receives a large finite-size enhancement by the stellar compactness, analogous to the case of the tidal deformability. Moreover, the correction is not degenerate with the time of coalescence, which also enters at 4PN order, because it contains a logarithmic frequency-dependent contribution. Using a simple Fisher analysis, we show that physically allowed values for the dissipative tidal deformability may be constrained by measurements of the phase of emitted gravitational waves to roughly the same extent as the (electric-type, quadrupolar) tidal deformability. Finally, we show that there are no out-of-equilibrium, dissipative corrections to the tidal deformability itself. We conclude that there are at least two relevant tidal deformability parameters that can be constrained with gravitational-wave phase measurements during the late inspiral of a neutron star binary: one which characterizes the adiabatic tidal response of the star, and another which characterizes the leading-order out-of-equilibrium, dissipative tidal response. These findings open a window to probe dissipative processes in the interior of neutron stars with gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>Gravitational-wave dark siren cosmology systematics from galaxy weighting</title>

Abstract: The detection of GW170817 and the measurement of its redshift from the associated electromagnetic counterpart provided the first gravitational wave determination of the Hubble constant ($H_0$), demonstrating the potential power of standard-siren cosmology. In contrast to this bright siren approach, the dark siren approach can be utilized for gravitational-wave sources in the absence of an electromagnetic counterpart: one considers all galaxies contained within the localization volume as potential hosts. When statistically averaging over the potential host galaxies, weighting them by physically-motivated properties (e.g., tracing star formation or stellar mass) could improve convergence. Using mock galaxy catalogs, we explore the impact of these weightings on the measurement of $H_0$. We find that incorrect weighting schemes can lead to significant biases due to two effects: the assumption of an incorrect galaxy redshift distribution, and preferentially weighting incorrect host galaxies during the inference. The magnitudes of these biases are influenced by the number of galaxies along each line of sight, the measurement uncertainty in the gravitational-wave luminosity distance, and correlations in the parameter space of galaxies. We show that the bias may be overcome from improved localization constraints in future GW detectors, a strategic choice of priors or weighting prescription, and by restricting the analysis to a subset of high-SNR events. We propose the use of hierarchical inference as a diagnostic of incorrectly-weighted prescriptions. Such approaches can simultaneously infer the correct weighting scheme and the values of the cosmological parameters, thereby mitigating the bias in dark siren cosmology due to incorrect host-galaxy weighting.</description>

      <title>Multi-wavelength constraints on the local black hole occupation fraction</title>

Abstract: The fraction of dwarf galaxies hosting central, intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) at low redshifts is an important observational probe of black hole seeding at high redshift. Detections of nuclear accretion signatures in dwarf galaxies provides strong evidence for the presence of these IMBHs. We develop a Bayesian model to infer the black hole occupation fraction assuming a broken power law Eddington ratio distribution function. Our approach accounts for non-detections, incompleteness, and contamination from star-forming-related emission. We apply this model to galaxies with X-ray data from the Chandra Source Catalog at distances $&lt;50$ Mpc, radio data from the VLA Sky Survey at $&lt; 50$ Mpc, and optical variability data from the Palomar Transient Factory at $z&lt;0.055$. We find a black hole occupation fraction of at least $90$ percent at stellar masses of $M_{\star}=10^8~M_{\odot}$ and at least $39$ percent at $M_{\star} = 10^7~M_{\odot}$ (95\% confidence intervals). We show the resulting black hole mass function. These constraints on the IMBH population have implications for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) mission and for cosmological models of black hole seeding and growth. We also constrain the extremely low luminosity end ($L_{\rm{bol}}\lesssim10^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$) of the AGN luminosity functions at $z=0$. Our AGN luminosity functions are broadly consistent with an extrapolation of the shallow slope of the AGN luminosity functions from previous work.</description>

      <title>Black hole spectroscopy and nonlinear echoes in Einstein-Maxwell-scalar theory</title>

Abstract: In the context of Einstein-Maxwell-scalar theory with a nonminimal coupling between the electromagnetic and scalar field, we study linear (non)radial perturbations and nonlinear radial dynamics of spherically symmetric black holes. In a certain region of the parameter space, this theory admits hairy black holes with a stable photon sphere. This has a counterpart in the effective potential of linear perturbations, featuring multiple maxima and minima. The corresponding quasinormal mode spectrum contains long-lived modes trapped in the potential cavity and the time-domain linear response displays echoes, as previously observed for horizonless compact objects. Interestingly, the black-hole dynamics in this theory can be studied at the nonlinear level. By performing fully-fledged 1+1 simulations, we show that echoes are present even when the nonlinearities are significant. To our knowledge, this is the first example of echoes appearing in a consistent theory beyond a linearized analysis. In a follow-up work we will study whether this feature is also present in the post-merger signal from black hole collisions in this theory.</description>
