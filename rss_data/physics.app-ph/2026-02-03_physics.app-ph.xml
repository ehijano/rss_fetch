      <title>Principles of Use of Tensile J-Curve Materials in Antagonistic Arrangements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Natural ligaments are soft connective tissues that must simultaneously provide high stretchability to enable dexterous flexibility and high stiffness to protect the musculoskeletal system. These two functions cannot be independently tuned in conventional engineering materials with linear or hyperelasticity. Ligaments achieve this balance through a highly nonlinear tensile response characterized by a J-shaped curve, featuring an extended "toe region" of low force up to intermediate strains followed by an inflection, called the "heel region" which marks the onset of nonlinear stiffening. Here, we present a framework for characterizing the defining features of J-curve behavior. Based on these features, we define measures for protectiveness and mobility to quantitatively describe the effective stiffness and the level of nonlinearity, thereby elucidating how the J-curve enables decoupled fine-tuning of flexibility and damage protection. A simplified mathematical model, supported by experimental validation, reveals the performance advantages of J-curve materials in antagonistic arrangements and highlights their unique design space compared with linear elastic systems. Furthermore, we develop synthetic J-curve materials capable of self-strain sensing via piezoresistive transduction, enabling their integration into practical devices. Collectively, these materials, models, and insights advance the understanding of nonlinear mechanical mechanisms in natural systems and provide a foundation for harnessing J-curve behavior in engineering applications such as bio-inspired robots.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.00406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a carbon nanotube (CNT) based single-ion detector is proposed and its performance is evaluated with atomistic quantum transport models. The sensor can detect any ion type without molecule-specific functionalization and allows for continuous real-time ion monitoring. A single ion temporarily changes the operating principle of the sensor's CNT field-effect transistor into a resonant tunneling diode. The concrete device example of this paper showed a source-drain current increase of 5 orders of magnitude induced by a single ion.</description>

      <title>Spin splitting torque enabled artificial neuron with self-reset via synthetic antiferromagnetic coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spintronic artificial neurons are intriguing building blocks for energy efficient Neuromorphic Computing (NC). Nevertheless, most contemporary implementations rely on symmetry breaking external in plane magnetic fields (H_X) for neuron operation, which limits scalability and hardware practicality. We experimentally demonstrate an altermagnet/Synthetic Antiferromagnetic Coupling (SAF) based spintronic neuron that uses out of plane spin ({\sigma}_Z) polarized spin-splitting torque to eliminate the necessity of an external H_X. The neuron device also features intrinsic self-reset function facilitated by built-in exchange coupling. Furthermore, the proposed device is validated for Spiking Neural Network (SNN) applications by achieving test accuracies of 95.99% and 94.36% on the MNIST and N-MNIST datasets, respectively. These results demonstrate the hardware feasibility and compatibility of the proposed spintronic neuron, highlighting its potential for compact, scalable and energy-efficient neuromorphic computing systems.</description>

      <title>Effects of PLGA coating on biological and mechanical behaviors of tissue engineering scaffolds</title>

Abstract: Scaffolds have a key role in the clinical success of tissue engineering for the regeneration of damaged tissues. Their bio-performance is often described as the extent to which they can provide an extracellular matrix-like environment for cells embedded where their function and growth can effectively continue. For this purpose, tissue engineering scaffolds should exhibit biodegradability, biocompatibility, bioactivity, delivery, and mechanical performance. The use of polymer coatings, especially poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), on tissue engineering scaffolds has been found to be one of the most effective methods to improve the scaffold properties. This paper reviews the techniques used to coat tissue engineering scaffolds with PLGA and its effects on the mechanical characteristics, biodegradability, biocompatibility, Molecular delivery, and osteointegration of the scaffolds. It is concluded that apart from apatite-formation ability, all bio-functionalities can be tuned through PLGA coatings. This reflects the great potential of this modification approach to be used in tissue regeneration and therapeutic delivery applications.</description>

      <title>A Novel Differential Pathlength Factor Model for Near-Infrared Diffuse Optical Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Near infrared diffuse optical imaging can be performed in reflectance and transmission mode and relies on physical models along with measurements to extract information on changes in chromophore concentration. Continuous-wave near-infrared diffuse optical imaging relies on accurate differential pathlength factors (DPFs) for quantitative chromophore estimation. Existing DPF definitions inherit formulation-dependent limitations that can introduce large errors in modified Beer--Lambert law analyses. These errors are significantly higher at smaller source-detector separations in a reflectance mode of measurement. This minimizes their applicability in situations where large area detection is used and also when signal depth is varying. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we derive two distance- and property-dependent DPF models one ideal and one experimentally practical and benchmark them against standard formulations. The proposed models achieve errors below 10 percent across broad optical conditions, whereas conventional DPFs can exceed 100 percent error. The theoretical predictions are further validated using controlled phantom experiments, demonstrating improved quantitative accuracy in CW-NIR imaging.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Imaging Depth and Sensitivity in Reflectance Mode Near Infrared Optical Imaging with Scatter Reducing Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the role of scatter reducing agents in a continuous wave (CW) near infrared (NIR)reflectance mode imaging setting. We use food-grade dye Tartrazine as a scatter reducing agent to enhance depth sensitivity and weak-absorber detectability in CW diffuse reflectance measurements. We found that reflectance signal was enhanced when the dye was applied on chicken breast phantom. However, we saw reduced reflectance sensitivity when the dye was uniformly dissolved in intralipid phantom which is a commonly used for NIR imaging studies. This shows that the gradient of refractive index modulation created as the dye diffuses from the top layer allows increased reflectance signal sensitivity of optical photons. However, when the scatter reduction is uniform throughout the phantom (like in intralipid phantom), the improved reflectance sensitivity was not observed. Our study points to significant redistribution of photons with scatter modulation with Tartrazine dye. We show significant improvement in sensitivity to signals with reflectance imaging. To elucidate the underlying mechanism of dye induced scatter reduction in tissue, analytical diffusion models and Monte Carlo simulations were employed. Modeling results show the impact of refractive index gradient created due to dye diffusion in enhancing reflectance sensitivity. These findings demonstrate that dye induced scatter reduction provides a practical, low-complexity approach to improving depth sensitivity in CW diffuse reflectance measurements and extend the functional capabilities of CW-NIRS systems for deep-tissue sensing applications. Our preliminary studies shows up to five fold enhancement in signal sensitivity for signals between two and three cm depth.</description>

      <title>Fidelity and quantum geometry approach to Dirac exceptional points in diamond nitrogen-vacancy centers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dirac exceptional points (EPs) represent a novel class of non-Hermitian singularities that, unlike conventional EPs, reside entirely within the parity-time unbroken phase and exhibit linear energy dispersion. Here, we theoretically investigate the quantum geometry of Dirac EPs realized in nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond, utilizing fidelity susceptibility as a probe. We demonstrate that despite the absence of a symmetry-breaking phase transition, the Dirac EP induces a pronounced geometric singularity, confirming the validity of fidelity in characterizing non-Hermitian EPs. Specifically, the real part of the fidelity susceptibility diverges to negative infinity, which serves as a signature of non-Hermitian criticality. Crucially, however, we reveal that this divergence exhibits a distinct anisotropy, diverging along the non-reciprocal coupling direction while remaining finite along the detuning axis. This behavior stands in stark contrast to the omnidirectional divergence observed in conventional EPs. Our findings provide a comprehensive picture of the fidelity probe near the Dirac EP, highlighting the critical role of parameter directionality in exploiting Dirac EPs for quantum control and sensing applications.</description>

      <title>An Open-Source Framework for Measurement and Analysis of Nanoscale Ionic Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nanofluidic systems exploit nanometre-scale confinement in channels and pores to regulate ionic transport, enabling functionalities such as osmotic energy harvesting and neuromorphic ionic memory. Studying such confined transport requires both precise electrical instrumentation and careful data analysis, yet, in practice, measurements are still often taken with vendor software, exported as files, and processed later in separate environments. In this work, we bring these steps together in a unified Python-based framework built around three interoperable graphical user interfaces (GUIs) for nanochannel, nanopore and memristor experiments. The framework is organised into two functional parts, measurement and analysis. On the measurement side, two GUIs drive Keithley Source Meters to run continuous voltage sweeps and user-defined memristive pulse sequences, while providing live plots, configuration management and controlled shutdown routines. On the analysis side, a dedicated nanochannel and nanopore GUI reads raw I-V datasets, applies unit-consistent processing, extracts conductance and ion mobility, evaluates selectivity and osmotic power, and is complemented by a web-based calculator that performs the same mobility analysis without a local Python installation. All three GUIs are implemented in Python/Tkinter with modular plotting and logging layers so that flexible control sequences and physics-based post-processing share a common data format, improving reproducibility, timing stability and day-to-day efficiency in nanofluidic and electronic device studies.</description>

      <title>Meta-optical processors for broadband complex-field image operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: All-optical image processing provides a fast and energy-efficient alternative to conventional electronic systems by directly manipulating optical wavefronts. However, metasurface-based optical processors reported to date are often limited in functionality, operating bandwidth, or input modality, which restricts their adaptability across different image processing tasks. Here, we demonstrate a broadband metasurface platform capable of performing diverse analog image processing operations on both amplitude- and phase-encoded inputs. This platform is realized using a single-layer dielectric metasurface designed through an end-to-end, task-driven inverse design framework. By tailoring the spatial-frequency components of incident image wavefronts, the metasurface implements analog operations such as edge detection and pattern recognition across a 200nm wavelength bandwidth in the visible spectrum. Furthermore, we develop a compact processor architecture that integrates imaging and computation within a reduced optical footprint. These results establish a flexible and compact metasurface-based optical processor with strong potential for integration into practical imaging and optical computing systems.</description>

      <title>SoMA: A Real-to-Sim Neural Simulator for Robotic Soft-body Manipulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.02402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulating deformable objects under rich interactions remains a fundamental challenge for real-to-sim robot manipulation, with dynamics jointly driven by environmental effects and robot actions. Existing simulators rely on predefined physics or data-driven dynamics without robot-conditioned control, limiting accuracy, stability, and generalization. This paper presents SoMA, a 3D Gaussian Splat simulator for soft-body manipulation. SoMA couples deformable dynamics, environmental forces, and robot joint actions in a unified latent neural space for end-to-end real-to-sim simulation. Modeling interactions over learned Gaussian splats enables controllable, stable long-horizon manipulation and generalization beyond observed trajectories without predefined physical models. SoMA improves resimulation accuracy and generalization on real-world robot manipulation by 20%, enabling stable simulation of complex tasks such as long-horizon cloth folding.</description>

Abstract: Interpreting the impedance response of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is challenging due to the complex coupling of ionic and electronic motion. While drift-diffusion (DD) modelling is a reliable method, its mathematical complexity makes directly extracting physical parameters from experimental data infeasible. This work uses DD modelling to generate a large synthetic dataset of impedance spectra for a standard TiO2/MAPI/spiro configuration. This dataset trains machine learning (ML) models to predict recombination and ionic parameters from impedance measurements. A Gradient Boosting Regressor, using features from a generalized equivalent circuit, showed the best performance. Interpretative analysis indicates that open-circuit impedance experiments best probe recombination losses, while short-circuit conditions are more adequate for extracting ionic features like concentrations and mobilities. The trained ML models were tested on experimental spectra, confirming the inferred physical parameters could reproduce the data. For the studied configuration, predicted ion concentrations were (1.3-3.3)e17 cm-3, ion mobilities were (5-7)e-11 cm2V-1s-1, and surface recombination velocities were 7-9 and 23-40 m/s. This approach provides insights into the physical information extractable from impedance measurements and paves the way for ML models to unambiguously derive efficiency-determining parameters for solar cells.</description>

      <title>Depletion-limited Effective Hall mobility in Micrometer-Scale High-Purity Germanium Crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.20842v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electrostatic effects can strongly constrain charge transport in thinned high-purity germanium (HPGe), with direct implications for radiation detectors and Ge-based electronic and quantum devices. We report a systematic experimental characterization of the thickness-dependent effective Hall mobility in bulk-grown, detector-grade HPGe at room temperature using Hall-effect measurements on n- and p-type samples sequentially thinned from 2.7~mm to 7~\textmu m. The intrinsic bulk carrier mobility remains thickness independent in this regime; the observed reduction in Hall-extracted mobility arises from electrostatic surface depletion that reduces the electrically active conducting thickness. The thickness-dependent data are accurately parameterized by an empirical extended-exponential relation, $\mu(t)=\mu_{0}[1-\exp(-(t/\tau)^{\beta})]$, where $\tau$ is a characteristic electrostatic length scale. Comparison with boundary-scattering and depletion-based models shows that Fuchs--Sondheimer scattering is negligible, while electrostatic depletion dominates the transport behavior. The hierarchy $\lambda_{D}&lt;\tau\lesssim W_{0}$ directly links the apparent mobility reduction to long-range screening and near-surface electric fields. These results yield a simple design guideline: maintaining thicknesses $t\gtrsim 3\tau$ preserves near-bulk transport, whereas thinner structures operate in a depletion-controlled regime with strongly reduced effective conductivity.</description>

      <title>Steady-State Exceptional Point Degeneracy and Sensitivity of Nonlinear Saturable Coupled Oscillators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13638v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A coupled oscillator system displays enhanced sensitivity of its saturated steady-state (SS) oscillation frequency to small parameter perturbations near an exceptional point degeneracy (EPD), a property that can be used to realize EPD-based sensors. Linear $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric systems, consisting of two coupled resonators, exhibit EPDs around which square-root sensitivity is observed. However, linear models are insufficient for realistic systems that rely on nonlinear, saturable gain elements, particularly when $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry is broken. Thus, we study the SS of a general system of two coupled oscillators featuring EPDs and saturable nonlinear gain, using coupled-mode theory. We do this by synthesizing and extending prior SS analyses of the system's stability, and its square-root and cubic-root oscillation frequency sensitivity at a unique third-order SS-EPD. We include an SS analysis of the saturated gain values, energy, and the oscillation frequency's sensitivity in the vicinity of the third-order SS-EPD, providing a comprehensive analysis of the system's various SS regimes. We determine that the stable and bistable regions in parameter space directly depend on the saturated gain values; that the dynamic range of high sensitivity around degenerate conditions is extended by increasing losses, consequently reducing the system's stored energy; and that, to exploit the cubic-root-like sensitivity associated to the third-order SS-EPD, the suggested working regime is best confined to operation within the weakly coupled regime and not exactly at the third order SS-EPD. Finally, we apply the model to two electronic circuits that exhibit cubic-root sensitivity, demonstrating the application and limitations of this analysis.</description>

Abstract: Phase change process plays a critical role in thermal management systems, yet quantitative characterization of multiphase heat transfer remains limited by the challenges of measuring temperature fields in chaotic, rapidly evolving flow regimes. While computational methods offer temperature data at a high spatiotemporal resolution in ideal cases, replicating complex experimental conditions remains prohibitively difficult. In this paper, we present a deep learning framework that can generate temperature field data at simulation resolution from segmented high-speed recordings and pointwise thermocouple readings which are typically available in a canonical pool boiling experimental configuration without requiring advanced techniques. This framework leverages a conditional generative adversarial network trained only on simulation data. To ensure direct applicability of the model to experimental data, our framework also introduces a preprocessing pipeline that aligns high resolution simulation data with experimental measurements through both conventional image processing and image segmentation with pretrained convolutional neural network. We further show that standard data augmentation strategies are effective in enhancing the physical plausibility of the inference when precise physical constraints are not applicable. Our results highlight the potential of deep generative models to bridge the gap between observable multiphase phenomena and underlying thermal transport, offering a powerful approach to augment and interpret experimental measurements in complex two-phase systems.</description>

      <title>Disorder-Engineered Hybrid Plasmonic Cavities for Emission Control of Defects in hBN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14517v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Defect-based quantum emitters in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) are promising building blocks for scalable quantum photonics due to their stable single-photon emission at room temperature. However, enhancing their emission intensity and controlling the decay dynamics remain significant challenges. This study demonstrates a low-cost, scalable fabrication approach to integrate plasmonic nanocavities with defect-based quantum emitters in hBN nanoflakes. Using the thermal dewetting process, we realize two distinct configurations: stochastic Ag nanoparticles (AgNPs) on hBN flakes and hybrid plasmonic nanocavities formed by AgNPs on top of hBN flakes supported on gold/silicon dioxide (Au/SiO2) substrates. While AgNPs on bare hBN yield up to a two-fold photoluminescence (PL) enhancement with reduced emitter lifetimes, the hybrid nanocavity architecture provides a dramatic, up to 100-fold PL enhancement and improved uniformity across multiple. emitters, all without requiring deterministic positioning. Finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations and time-resolved PL measurements confirm size-dependent control over decay dynamics and cavity-emitter interactions. Our versatile solution overcomes key quantum photonic device development challenges, including material integration, emission intensity optimization, and spectral multiplexity. Future work will explore potential applications in integrated photonic circuits hosting on-chip quantum systems and hBN-based label-free single-molecule detection through such quantum nanoantennas.</description>

      <title>Spatial QUBO: Convolutional Formulation of Large-Scale Binary Optimization with Dense Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.24008v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The spatial photonic Ising machine (SPIM) is a promising optical hardware solver for large-scale combinatorial optimization problems with dense interactions. As the SPIM can represent Ising problems with rank-one coupling matrices, multiplexed versions have been proposed to enhance the applicability to higher-rank interactions. However, the multiplexing cost reduces the implementation efficiency, and even without multiplexing, the SPIM is known to represent coupling matrices beyond rank-one. In this paper, to clarify the intrinsic representation power of the original SPIM, we propose spatial QUBO (spQUBO), a formulation of Ising problems with spatially convolutional structures. We prove that any spQUBO reduces to a two-dimensional spQUBO, with the convolutional structure preserved, and that any two-dimensional spQUBO can be efficiently implemented on the SPIM without multiplexing. We further demonstrate its practical applicability to distance-based combinatorial optimization, such as placement problems and clustering problems. These results advance our understanding of the class of optimization problems where SPIMs exhibit superior efficiency and scalability. Furthermore, spQUBO's efficiency is not limited to the SPIM architecture; we show that its convolutional structure allows efficient computation using Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT).</description>

      <title>Frequency domain laser ultrasound for inertial confinement fusion target wall thickness measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15997v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In inertial confinement fusion experiments hollow, spherical mm-sized capsules are used as a container for nuclear fuel. To achieve maximum implosion efficiency, a perfect capsule geometry is required. This paper presents a wall thickness measurement method based on zero-group velocity guided elastic wave resonances. They are measured with a non-destructive, contactless frequency domain laser ultrasound microscopy system. Wall thickness measurements along the equator of a high-density carbon capsule with a diameter of around 2 mm and a wall thickness of around 80 $\unicode{x00B5}$m excellently agree with infrared interferometry reference measurements. In addition, the multi-resonant nature of a spherical shell is studied by complementing experimental observations with plate dispersion calculations and finite element wave propagation simulations. The presented method is scalable and can be applied to a broad range of target materials, including metals, or metal-doped targets.</description>

      <title>Verification and experimental validation of neutral atom beam source produced by L-PBF</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.11364v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report validation tests of a calcium atomic-beam source fabricated via Laser Powder Bed Fusion (L-PBF). The surface quality and elemental composition of the printed component were quantitatively assessed, allowing us to establish reference parameters for reliable operation in an ultra-high-vacuum environment. Safe operating conditions of the atomic oven were determined through a combination of simulations and experimental measurements. The ability of the device to deliver an atomic beam to the main experimental region -- the electron/ion trap -- was verified using atomic fluorescence imaging. Fluorescence spectroscopy was further employed to characterize the beam divergence, yielding an emission-cone half-angle of approximately 19 degrees for atoms near the beam axis. A current of atoms on the order of $10^8$ s$^{-1}$ was estimated in the electron-trapping region, which is more than sufficient for anticipated electron-trapping and ion-trapping experiments.</description>

      <title>Quantitative mobile gamma-ray spectrometry through Bayesian inference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18769v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate quantitative mapping of gamma-ray sources is critical for applications ranging from radiological emergency response and environmental monitoring to nuclear security and deep space exploration. Here, we show that integrating high-fidelity, platform-dynamic Monte Carlo simulations and Bayesian inference with mobile gamma-ray spectrometry enables rapid and accurate quantification of distributed and point-like gamma-ray sources. Validated against laboratory and field assays, our framework quantifies natural and anthropogenic gamma-ray sources that conventional methods cannot resolve in $1\,$s with $\sim\!\!1\,\%$ error. The developed method marks a critical advance in quantitative gamma-ray sensing, enabling improved radiological situational awareness, enhanced terrestrial geophysical and geochemical mapping, as well as more robust constraints on radionuclide abundances on extraterrestrial bodies across the Solar System.</description>

      <title>Broadband silicon polarization beam splitter based on Floquet engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11955v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A broadband silicon polarization beam splitter (PBS) is proposed and experimentally demonstrated based on Floquet-engineered directional couplers. The total length of the coupling structure is 20 um . By periodically modulating the waveguide width of the directional couplers, the power exchange between the two waveguides for the transverse-electric (TE) mode is suppressed, whereas the power coupling for the transverse-magnetic (TM) mode is enhanced. The fabricated PBS exhibits polarization extinction ratios (PERs) &gt; 20 dB for both polarizations over a broad wavelength range of 1483 nm-1620 nm. Additionally, the measured insertion losses (ILs) are 0.15 dB and 1.2 dB at 1550 nm for TE and TM polarizations, respectively.</description>

      <title>Metal Halide Perovskites for Violet and Ultraviolet Light Emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21270v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Emissive metal halide perovskites (MHPs) have emerged as excellent candidates for next-generation optoelectronics due to their sharp color purity, inexpensive processing, and bandgap tunability. However, the development of violet and ultraviolet light-emitting MHPs has lagged behind due to challenges related to material and device stability, charge carrier transport, tunability into the ultraviolet spectrum, toxicity, and scalability. Here, we review the progress of both violet and ultraviolet MHP nanomaterials and light-emitting diodes, including materials synthesis and device fabrication across various crystal structures and dimensions (e.g., bulk thin films, 2D thin films, nanoplatelets, colloidal nanocrystals, and more) as well as lead-free platforms (e.g., rare-earth metal halide perovskites). By highlighting several pathways to continue the development of violet and ultraviolet light-emitting MHPs while also proposing tactics to overcome their outstanding challenges, we demonstrate the potential of state-of-the-art violet and ultraviolet MHP materials and devices for important applications in public health, 3D printing, nanofabrication, and more.</description>
