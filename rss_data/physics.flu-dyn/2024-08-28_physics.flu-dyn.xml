      <title>Inferring the shape of a solid inside a draining tank from its liquid level dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In engineering, we often encounter an open-top, liquid-holding tank draining via gravity-driven flow through a small orifice in its side. Torricelli's law and a mass balance give a differential equation model governing the dynamics of the liquid level in such a draining tank. Herein, we leverage this forward model to tackle an inverse problem of reconstruction: infer the shape of an exogenous, heavy solid inside a draining tank from measurements of its liquid level over time. To quantify uncertainty, we employ Bayesian statistical inversion to obtain a posterior distribution over the solid's cross-sectional area as a function of height. (Because the solid displaces liquid, the rate of decrease of the liquid level provides information about the cross-sectional area of the solid at that height; as the liquid level drops, it "scans" the area of the solid as a function of height.)
  In our experimental setup, a tank drains of water through a small orifice in its side while a liquid level sensor collects time series data of the water level. First, we calibrate and test a forward model of the water level dynamics using data from two tank drainage experiments without an exogenous solid. Second, we conduct a drainage experiment with the tank containing an exogenous solid, then leverage the calibrated forward model and data to infer (i.e., obtain a posterior distribution for) the area of the solid inside the tank as a function of height. Our approach may be practically useful to infer the shape of an unknown solid, or the porosity of packed solid particles, inside of an opaque tank.</description>

      <title>An improved model of height profile for Drop-on-demand print of UV curable ink</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes an improved model of height profile for drop-on-demand printing of UV curable ink. Unlike previous model, the proposed model propagates volume and covered area based on height difference between adjacent drops. Height profile is then calculated from the propagated volume and area. Measurements of 2-drop and 3-drop patterns are used to experimentally compute model parameters. The parameters are used to predict and validate height profiles of 4 and more drops in a straight line. Using the same root mean square (RMS) error as benchmark, this model achieves 5.9% RMS height profile error on 4-drop lines. This represents more than 60% reduction from graph-based model and an improvement from our previous effort.</description>

      <title>Modeling height profile for Drop-on-demand print of UV curable ink</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a height profile model for drop-on-demand printing of UV curable ink. Existing models includesuperposition of single drops, numerical models, and graphic-based model. They are either too complicated or over simplified.Graphic model intends to find a sweet spot in between, however, accuracy is marginally improved from superposition modelwhile it demands more computation. The proposed model aimsto achieve the same as graphic model by introducing volumeand area propagation matrices to reflect the localized ink flowfrom higher location to the lower, while avoiding the detailedphysics behind it. This model assumes a constant volume andarea propagation of subsequent drop due to height profile difference. It is validated with experiments on single drop, 2-drop and 3-drop line printing. Stability of this model is analyzed.. Usingroot mean square (RMS) error as benchmark, proposed modelachieves 6.6% along the center row and 7.4% overall, better thanexisting models.</description>

      <title>Internal gravity waves in flow past a bluff body under different levels of stratification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The flow field of a bluff body, a circular disk, that moves horizontally in a stratified environment is studied using large eddy simulations (LES). Five levels of stratification (body Froude numbers of Fr = 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2 and 5) are simulated at Reynolds number of Re = 5000 and Prandtl number of Pr = 1. A higher Re = 50, 000 database at Fr = 2, 10 and Pr = 1 is also examined for comparison. The wavelength and amplitude of steady lee waves are compared with a linear-theory analysis. Excellent agreement is found over the entire range of Fr if an equivalent body that includes the separation region is employed for the linear theory. For asymptotically large distance, the velocity amplitude varies theoretically as Fr raised to negative 1 but a correction owing to dependence of the separation zone on Fr is needed. The wake waves propagate in a narrow band of angles with the vertical and have a wavelength that increases with increasing Fr. The envelope of wake waves, demarcated using buoyancy variance, exhibits self-similar behavior. The higher Re results are consistent with the buoyancy effects exhibited at the lower Re. The wake wave energy is larger at Re = 50000. Nevertheless, independent of Fr and Re, the ratio of the wake wave potential energy to the wake turbulent energy increases to approximately 0.6 to 0.7 in the nonequilibrium (NEQ) stage showing their energetic importance besides suggesting universality in this statistic. There is a crossover of energetic dominance of lee waves at Fr less than 2 to wake-wave dominance at Fr approximately equal to 5.</description>

      <title>Model-Based Reinforcement Learning for Control of Strongly-Disturbed Unsteady Aerodynamic Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The intrinsic high dimension of fluid dynamics is an inherent challenge to control of aerodynamic flows, and this is further complicated by a flow's nonlinear response to strong disturbances. Deep reinforcement learning, which takes advantage of the exploratory aspects of reinforcement learning (RL) and the rich nonlinearity of a deep neural network, provides a promising approach to discover feasible control strategies. However, the typical model-free approach to reinforcement learning requires a significant amount of interaction between the flow environment and the RL agent during training, and this high training cost impedes its development and application. In this work, we propose a model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) approach by incorporating a novel reduced-order model as a surrogate for the full environment. The model consists of a physics-augmented autoencoder, which compresses high-dimensional CFD flow field snaphsots into a three-dimensional latent space, and a latent dynamics model that is trained to accurately predict the long-time dynamics of trajectories in the latent space in response to action sequences. The robustness and generalizability of the model is demonstrated in two distinct flow environments, a pitching airfoil in a highly disturbed environment and a vertical-axis wind turbine in a disturbance-free environment. Based on the trained model in the first problem, we realize an MBRL strategy to mitigate lift variation during gust-airfoil encounters. We demonstrate that the policy learned in the reduced-order environment translates to an effective control strategy in the full CFD environment.</description>

      <title>Shock Wave Interaction with a Naturally Generated Vortex Ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The vortex ring is usually analytically modelled in computational studies involving vortex ring and shock wave interaction. However, incompressibility assumptions of the isolated vortex ring model mostly limits its applicability to the lower Mach number regime. To overcome this limitation, a compressible vortex ring is generated using a pulse jet exiting a circular nozzle, and its interaction with a shock wave is analysed. The shock vortex interaction and resulting sound wave generation is simulated by solving the compressible axisymmetric Navier-Stokes equations. A characteristics-based filter is used to isolate acoustic and hydrodynamic disturbances in the flow-field. A reconfigured computational domain is used to negate the after-effects of the nozzle on the flow field. The strong interaction of compressible vortex rings at higher Mach numbers with different shock wave Mach numbers in the flow field is studied including resultant acoustic wave generation.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic data-driven turbulence closure modeling by assimilating statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A framework for deriving probabilistic data-driven closure models is proposed for coarse-grained numerical simulations of turbulence in statistically stationary state. The approach unites the ideal large-eddy simulation model and data assimilation methods. The method requires a posteriori measured data to define stochastic flow perturbations, which are combined with a Bayesian statistical correction enforcing user-specified statistics extracted from high-fidelity flow snapshots. Thus, it enables computationally cheap ensemble simulations by combining knowledge of the local integration error and knowledge of desired flow statistics. A model example is given for two-dimensional Rayleigh-B\'enard convection at Rayleigh number $\mathit{Ra}=10^{10}$, incorporating stochastic perturbations and an ensemble Kalman filtering step in a non-intrusive way. Physical flow dynamics are obtained, whilst kinetic energy spectra and heat flux are accurately reproduced in long-time ensemble forecasts on coarse grids. The model is shown to produce accurate results with as few as 20 high-fidelity flow snapshots as input data.</description>

      <title>Influence of Cavity Geometry on the Bubble Dynamics of Nucleate Pool Boiling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nucleate pool boiling is known for its exceptional heat transfer coefficients, with the use of cavities further improving bubble nucleation and heat transfer rate. To promote this heat transfer enhancement technique, a thorough understanding of the influence of cavity geometry on single bubble dynamics is required. The influence of depth and radius of cylindrical and conical cavities on the bubble dynamics of nucleate pool boiling of R1234yf were numerically investigated. The cavity radius was varied between 50 {\mu}m and 400 {\mu}m and the cavity depth between 100 {\mu}m and 1000 {\mu}m at a fixed heat flux of 28 kW/m$^2$. It was found that the maximum equivalent diameter prior to departure was constant for cavities with radii smaller than 120 {\mu}m, while it increased linearly when increasing the cavity radius further. Cylindrical cavities exhibited high stability regardless of cavity radius or depth whereas conical cavities showed a decrease in vapour retention with increasing cavity angle. During the necking phase, the bubble interface became pinned at the cavity edge, depending on conical cavity angle, implying that smaller radii allowed for enhanced surface rewetting. Conical cavities could be considered as cylindrical cavities when the cavity angle was less than a quarter of the interface contact angle. When translating the single cavity findings to cavity array design, cylindrical cavities were recommended as they allowed for stable bubble behaviour. For increased nucleation zones and rewetting, a sub-critical radius was recommended. Wider cavities were recommended for high superheat conditions as larger bubbles could enhance bubble growth.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of the sound absorption of closed-cell mineral foams by perforations: Manufacturing process and model-supported adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thin low-frequency acoustic absorbers that are economical to produce in large quantities are scarce, and their efficiency is often limited to a narrow frequency range. In this paper, we present opportunities to use highly porous mineral foams, in particular optimally designed gypsum foams, to achieve high absorption levels for layers of less than 1/10 of a wavelength thick. To reach this goal, we perforate a fraction of the initially closed pores using thin needles. Finite element simulations of the fluid flow in a representative volume element show how the combination of foam properties (cell size and wall thickness) and perforation pattern (hole diameter and perforation distance) can be chosen such that sub-wavelength absorption is obtained. In particular two transport parameters used in the approximate but robust Johnson-Champoux-Allard model for porous media have to be optimized: the flow resistivity and high-frequency tortuosity. The fluid flow modeling results are successfully compared with sound absorption measurements, showing indeed that the proposed material, once appropriately perforated, yields a remarkable low-frequency sound absorption peak. On a more fundamental level, this paper shows how the multiporosity, the presence of microcracks, and the material's surface roughness can be exploited to enhance its acoustic absorption at very low frequencies.</description>

      <title>Glacierware: Hotspot-aware Microfluidic Cooling for High TDP Chips using Topology Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The continuous increase in computational power of GPUs, essential for advancements in areas like artificial intelligence and data processing, is driving the adoption of liquid cooling in data centers. Skived copper cold plates featuring parallel straight channels are a mature technology, but they lack design freedom due to manufacturing limitations. As chips become increasingly complex in their design with the transition towards heterogeneous integration, these parallel straight channels are not able to address critical areas of concentrated high heat flux (hotspots) on a chip. A single hotspot exceeding the upper temperature limit can cause the full chip to throttle and hence limit performance. In addition, this would require a reduction in coolant inlet temperature in the data center, causing an increase in electricity and water consumption. Ideally, areas of the cold plate in contact with hotspots of the chip need smaller channels to increase convective heat transfer, whereas areas with low heat flux may benefit from larger channels to compensate for the increased pressure drop. However, manual optimization of such a cooling design is challenging due to the nonlinearity of the problem. In this paper, we explore the usage of topology optimization as a method to tailor microfluidic cooling design to the power distribution of a chip to address the hotspot temperatures in high-power chips, using a platform called Glacierware. We compare the hotspot-aware, topology-optimized microfluidic design to straight channels of various widths to benchmark its performance. Evaluations of this optimized design show a 13% lower temperature rise or a 55% lower pressure than the best-performing straight channels, indicating highly competitive performance in industrial settings where both pressure and flow rate are constrained.</description>

      <title>On the settling and clustering behavior of polydisperse gas-solid flows with application to pyroclastic density currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sedimenting flows occur in a range of society-critical systems, such as circulating fluidized bed reactors and pyroclastic density currents (PDCs), the most hazardous volcanic process. In these systems, mass loading is sufficiently high ($\gg\mathcal{O}(1)$) and momentum coupling between the phases gives rise to mesoscale behavior, such as formation of coherent structures. This heterogeneity has been demonstrated to generate and sustain turbulence in the carrier phase and directly impact large-scale quantities of interest, such as settling time. While contemporary work has explored the physical processes underpinning these multiphase phenomenon for monodisperse assemblies of particles, polydispersity flow behavior has been largely understudied. Since all real-world flows are polydisperse, understanding the role of polydispersity in gas-solid systems is critical for informing closures that are accurate and robust. This work characterizes the sedimentation behavior of two polydispersed gas-solid flows, with statistical and physical properties of the particulate phase sampled from historical PDC ejecta. Highly resolved data for both polydisperse distributions of particles at two volume fractions (1% and 10%) is collected using an Euler-Lagrange framework and is compared with monodisperse configurations of particles with diameters equivalent to the arithmetic mean of the polydisperse configurations. From this data, we find that polydispersity has an important impact on cluster formation and structure and that this is most pronounced for more dilute flows. At higher volume fraction, the effect of polydispersity is less pronounced. We also propose a new metric for predicting the degree of clustering, termed `surface loading', and a model for the coefficient of drag that produces accurate predictions for settling velocity given the high-fidelity data presented.</description>

      <title>Energy spectrum of two-dimensional isotropic rapidly rotating turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a two-dimensional isotropic rotating system and obtain both theoretically and numerically a $K^{-2}$ energy spectrum under the rapidly rotating condition ($Ro\ll 1$), which was initially obtained by Zeman (1994) and Zhou (1995). In rotating turbulence, the $K^{-2}$ energy spectrum was proposed under the assumption of isotropy, however, the direction selectivity of rotation breaks isotropy, making this $K^{-2}$ spectrum not easily observable. To fill the gap between theoretical assumptions and realizability, we study the turbulence of inertial waves in an artificial two-dimensional isotropic rotating turbulence system. In the limit of a small Rossby number, we asymptotically derive a nonlinear amplitude equation for inertial waves, which gives the $K^{-2}$ spectrum using a strong turbulence argument. This scaling is justified by numerical simulations of both the amplitude equation and the original system.</description>

      <title>A novel numerical framework for three-dimensional fully resolved simulation of freely falling particles of arbitrary shape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article introduces a novel numerical framework designed to model the interplay between free-falling particles and their surrounding fluid in situations of high particle to fluid density ratio, typically exhibited by atmospheric particles. This method is designed to complement experimental studies in vertical wind tunnels to improve the understanding of the aerodynamic behavior of small atmospheric particles, such as the transport and sedimentation of volcanic particles, cloud ice crystals and other application areas. The solver is based on the lattice Boltzmann method and it addresses the numerical challenges, including the high density ratio and moderate to high Reynolds number, by using an immersed-boundary approach and a recursive-regularized collision model. A predictor-corrector scheme is applied for the robust time integration of the six-degrees-of-freedom (6DOF) rigid-body motion. Finally, the multi-scale nature arising from the long free-fall distances of a particle is addressed through a dynamic memory allocation scheme allowing for a virtually infinite falling distance. This tool allows for the simulation of particles of arbitrary shape represented by a triangularized surface. The framework is validated against the analytical and experimental data for falling spheres and ellipsoids, and is then applied to the case of an actual volcanic particle geometry, the shape of which is obtained from a 3D surface-contour scanning process. The physics of the free-fall of this particle is investigated and described, and its terminal velocity is compared against the experimental data measured with the 3D printed exemplars of the same particle.</description>

Abstract: Bogoliubov waves emerge when the system is perturbed from its ground state in a Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC). These waves can interact nonlinearly, leading to turbulent cascades. In the present work, the turbulence of random weakly nonlinear Bogoliubov waves on the background of a uniform condensate is considered theoretically, within the Wave Turbulence approach, and numerically, via numerical simulations of the 3-dimensional (3D) Gross-Pitaevskii model and the associated wave-kinetic equations. A new Kolmogorov-like stationary spectrum is found for the short Bogoliubov waves. An exact prefactor constant was found for the previously known Zakharov-Sagdeev spectrum of long (acoustic) Bogoliubov waves. The results are used to explain the BEC equation of state experimentally obtained in [Dora et al. Nature 620,521 (2023)], and to suggest new settings for future experiments.</description>

      <title>Chaotic measures as an alternative to spectral measures for analysing turbulent flow</title>

Abstract: Turbulence has associated chaotic features. In the past couple of decades there has been growing interest in the study of these features as an alternative means of understanding turbulent systems. Our own input to this effort has been in contributing to the initial studies of chaos in Eulerian flow using direct numerical simulation (DNS). In this review we discuss the progress achieved in the turbulence community in understanding chaotic measures including our own work. A central relation between turbulence and chaos is one by Ruelle that connects the maximum Lyapunov exponent and the Reynolds number. The first DNS studies, ours amongst them, in obtaining this relation has shown the viability of chaotic simulation studies of Eulerian flow. Such chaotic measures and associated simulation methodology provides an alternative means to probe turbulent flow. Building on this, we have analyzed the finite time Lyapunov exponent (FTLE) and studied its fluctuations, and found that chaotic measures could be quantified accurately even at small simulation box sizes where for comparative sizes spectral measures would be inconclusive. We further highlight applications of chaotic measures in analyzing phase transition behavior in turbulent flow and two dimensional thin layer turbulent systems. This work has shown chaotic measures are an excellent tool that can be used alongside spectral measures in studying turbulent flow.</description>

      <title>Modelling two-dimensional droplet rebound off deep fluid baths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16750v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In order for a droplet to rebound rather than coalesce from a liquid surface, there must be a layer of air persisting throughout the impact. This air layer acts as a lubricant to the system and permits a pressure transfer between the two liquid bodies. Through considering the bath, air, and drop regions of fluid, we introduce a fully coupled reduced dynamic model of two-dimensional droplets rebounding off liquid baths, which incorporates a evolving lubricating air layer. Numerical solutions of the lubrication-mediated model are compared to widely used direct numerical simulation (DNS) of the Navier-Stokes equations. The reduced model captures rebounding dynamics well in the regime where it is most relevant: for low speed impacts of small droplets, where capillary forces are important. Numerically, the reduced model is efficient, allowing for the computation of multiple rebounds and of long time dynamics of droplets rebounding on a vibrating bath. Furthermore, the lubrication-mediated model is able to provide detailed information within the air layer such as pressure and lubrication-layer geometry, which is often omitted from reduced models, and typically obtained by higher resolution but higher cost DNS methods.</description>

      <title>Wind-farm power prediction using a turbulence-optimized Gaussian wake model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09220v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we present an improved formulation for the wake-added turbulence to enhance the accuracy of intra-farm and farm-to-farm wake modeling through analytical frameworks. Our goal is to address the tendency of a commonly used formulation to overestimate turbulence intensity within wind farms and to overcome its limitations in predicting the streamwise evolution of turbulence intensity beyond them. To this end, we utilize high-fidelity data and adopt an optimization technique to derive an optimized functional form of the wake-added turbulence. We then integrate the achieved formulation with a widely used Gaussian wake model to study various intra-farm and farm-to-farm scenarios. The outcomes reveal that the new methodology effectively addresses the overestimation of power in both standalone wind farms and those impacted by upstream counterparts. Our new approach meets the need for accurate and lightweight models, ensuring the effective coexistence of wind farms within clusters as the wind-energy capacity rapidly expands.</description>

      <title>Reemergence of Trampolining in a Leidenfrost Droplet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02335v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The levitating Leidenfrost (LF) state of a droplet on a heated substrate is often accompanied by fascinating behaviors such as star-shaped deformations, self-propulsion, bouncing, and trampolining. These behaviors arise due to the vapor flow instabilities at the liquid-vapor interface beneath the droplet at sizes typically comparable to the capillary length scale of the liquid. Here, we report on the spontaneous bouncing, trampolining, and hovering behavior of an unconstrained LF water droplet. We observe that a droplet exhibits intermittent increase in bouncing height at specific radii and subsequent reduction in the height of bounce leading to a quiescent LF state. The reemergence of the trampolining behavior from the quiescent hovering state without any external forcing is observed at sizes as low as 0.1 times the capillary length. We attribute the droplet bouncing behavior to the dynamics of vapor flow beneath the LF droplet. We propose that the trampolining behavior of the droplet at specific radii is triggered by subharmonic and harmonic excitation of the liquid-vapor interface. We attribute the intermittent trampolining events to the change in the natural frequency of the droplet and the vapor layer due to evaporative mass loss. This proposed mechanism of resonance-driven trampolining of LF droplets is observed to be applicable for different liquids irrespective of the initial volume and substrate temperatures, thus indicating a universality of the behavior.</description>

      <title>Considerations on free-surface detachment and bed entrainment of fluvial plastics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03081v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over the last decade, fluvial plastics have been identified as major threat to aquatic environments and human health. In order to develop adequate mitigation strategies for plastic pollution, a fundamental process understanding of riverine plastic transport is of significant importance. In this context, the implementation of research findings into numerical simulation environments is anticipated to enhance modelling capabilities and to support a rigorous decision making. Recent experimental research has focused on the incipient motion of plastic particles, as well as on the effects of surface tension on plastic concentration profiles. While these investigations have advanced the state-of-the-art knowledge, current literature still displays a lack of basic insights into layer-specific plastic transport physics. In this study, first principles are applied to advance knowledge on free-surface detachment and bed entrainment of fluvial plastics. A novel relationship for the critical surface detachment velocity is derived, followed by the development of a framework that allows to relate plastic Shields parameters to those of natural sediments. Overall, it is anticipated that these developments will trigger new research within the plastics community, and it is hoped that present findings will be implemented into Lagrangian particle tracking software.</description>

      <title>A domain decomposition-based autoregressive deep learning model for unsteady and nonlinear partial differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14461v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a domain-decomposition-based deep learning (DL) framework, named transient-CoMLSim, for accurately modeling unsteady and nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). The framework consists of two key components: (a) a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based autoencoder architecture and (b) an autoregressive model composed of fully connected layers. Unlike existing state-of-the-art methods that operate on the entire computational domain, our CNN-based autoencoder computes a lower-dimensional basis for solution and condition fields represented on subdomains. Timestepping is performed entirely in the latent space, generating embeddings of the solution variables from the time history of embeddings of solution and condition variables. This approach not only reduces computational complexity but also enhances scalability, making it well-suited for large-scale simulations. Furthermore, to improve the stability of our rollouts, we employ a curriculum learning (CL) approach during the training of the autoregressive model. The domain-decomposition strategy enables scaling to out-of-distribution domain sizes while maintaining the accuracy of predictions -- a feature not easily integrated into popular DL-based approaches for physics simulations. We benchmark our model against two widely-used DL architectures, Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) and U-Net, and demonstrate that our framework outperforms them in terms of accuracy, extrapolation to unseen timesteps, and stability for a wide range of use cases.</description>
