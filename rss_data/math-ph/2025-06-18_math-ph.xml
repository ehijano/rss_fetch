      <title>Anomalous diffusion for mass transport phenomena I: Analytic solutions to time fractional diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mass transport problems are ubiquitous in diverse fields of physics and engineering. With the development of fractional calculus, many have taken to studying problems of fractional mass transport either through numerical simulations or through complex mathematical structures (e.g. Fox-H functions). Here, we present a set of analytic solutions to common time fractional diffusion problems, written in terms of Mittag-Leffler and M-Wright functions, as well as generalized fractional error and complementary error functions derived within. We additionally show how time fractional diffusion is a generalization of a two-parameter stretched-time fractional diffusion process. Finally we present a procedure to take canonical solutions to mass transport problems with Fickian diffusion and extend these to systems with anomalous diffusion.</description>

      <title>A shape optimisation of mutual inductances among coils</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a shape optimisation framework for achieving desired mutual inductances (MIs) among coils in 3D space. Utilising a wire modelling approach, the coils are discretised using B-spline curves, with control points (CPs) serving as design variables. The key contribution is the derivation of the shape derivative of the objective function in terms of MIs, enabling the use of gradient-based quasi-Newton optimisation methods. A coil length constraint is also incorporated. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of the framework through numerical examples, validating the theoretical and numerical developments. This approach addresses the largely unexplored area of magnetostatic MI optimisation within the wire modelling framework, offering a computationally efficient alternative to finite element methods etc.</description>

      <title>Coordinate-energy transformation and the one-point function for the Heisenberg-Ising XXZ spin-1/2 chain on the ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a basis transformation that inverts the coordinate Bethe Ansatz. It is widely believed that the Bethe Ansatz is complete, based on numerical evidence and combinatorial arguments. We present a constructive and comprehensive approach to show that the Bethe Ansatz is complete. The transformation formula is verified numerically with excellent accuracy for non-zero anisotropy parameters and rings of odd length. Additionally, assuming the Bethe Ansatz is complete, we derive a novel exact formula for the one-point function systems through special identities for the Izergin-Korepin determinant.</description>

      <title>Detecting local topology with the spectral localizer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spectral localizer is a predictive framework for the computation of topological invariants of natural and artificial materials. Here, three crucial improvements on the criterion for the validity of the framework are reported: first, merely a properly defined local spectral gap of the Hamiltonian is required, second, only relative bounds on the Hamiltonian and its noncommutative derivative are relevant, and, third, the numerical constant in a tapering estimate is improved. These developments further stress the local nature of the spectral localizer framework, enabling more precise predictions in heterostructures, aperiodic, and disordered systems. Moreover, these results strengthen the bounds on the spectral localizer's spectral flow when crossing topological phase boundaries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the angular momentum distribution of neutral atoms, in the sense of occupation numbers, follows the Thomas-Fermi angular momentum distribution in the limit of large atomic number. In particular, we show that the angular momentum distribution of large atoms deviates from the well-known Madelung rule.</description>

      <title>A general framework for the asymptotic analysis of moist atmospheric flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We deal with asymptotic analysis for the derivation of partial differential equation models for geophysical flows in the earth's atmosphere with moist process closures, and we study their mathematical properties. Starting with the Navier-Stokes equations for dry air, we put the seminal papers of Klein, Majda et al. in a unified context and then discuss the appropriate extension to moist air. In particular, we deal with the scale-independent distinguished limit for the universal parameters of atmospheric motion for moist air, with the Clausius-Clapeyron relation that links saturation vapor pressure and air temperature, and with the mathematical formulation of phase changes associated with cloud formation and rain production. We conclude with a discussion of the precipitating quasigeostrophic (PQG) models introduced by Smith &amp; Stechmann. Our intent is, on the one hand, to convey the problems arising at the modeling stage to mathematicians; on the other hand, we want to present the relevant mathematical methods and results to meteorologists.</description>

      <title>First-passage time to capture for diffusion in a 3D harmonic potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We determine the survival probability and first-passage time (FPT) to capture for a harmonically trapped particle, diffusing outside an absorbing spherical boundary by directly solving the differential equation for the survival probability. This solution, obtained as an infinite sum over the relevant eigenfunctions, corrects previously published results [D. S. Grebenkov, J. Phys. A 48, 013001 (2014)]. To verify our calculations, we perform simulations of the survival probability, that accurately reproduce the analytic solutions for a range of parameter values. We then obtain the corresponding FPT distribution as the negative time derivative of the survival probability. Finally, we derive an expression for mean first-passage time (MFPT), also as a sum over eigenfunctions. Numerical evaluation of the first twenty-five terms in this sum closely matches the MFPT obtained by a different method in D. S. Grebenkov, J. Phys. A 48, 013001 (2014). We also find that, in the limit of vanishing trap stiffness, the amplitude of the first term in our infinite-sum solution for the survival probability matches the theoretical escape probability for the potential-free diffusion-to-capture process.</description>

      <title>Dense Phenomena for Ergodic Schr\"odinger Operators: I. Spectrum, Integrated Density of States, and Lyapunov Exponent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider Schr\"odinger operators in $\ell^2(\Z)$ whose potentials are defined via continuous sampling along the orbits of a homeomorphism on a compact metric space. We show that for each non-atomic ergodic measure $\mu$, there is a dense set of sampling functions such that the associated almost sure spectrum has finitely many gaps, the integrated density is smooth, and the Lyapunov exponent is smooth and positive. As a byproduct we answer a question of Walters about the existence of non-uniform $\SL(2,\R)$ cocycles in the affirmative.</description>

      <title>Higher-Oder Splitting Schemes for Fluids with Variable Viscosity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article investigates matrix-free higher-order discontinuous Galerkin (DG) discretizations of the Navier-Stokes equations for incompressible flows with variable viscosity. The viscosity field may be prescribed analytically or governed by a rheological law, as often found in biomedical or industrial applications. We compare several linearized variants of saddle point block systems and projection-based splitting time integration schemes in terms of their computational performance. Compared to the velocity-pressure block-system for the former, the splitting scheme allows solving a sequence of simple problems such as mass, convection-diffusion and Poisson equations. We investigate under which conditions the improved temporal stability of fully implicit schemes and resulting expensive nonlinear solves outperform the splitting schemes and linearized variants that are stable under hyperbolic time step restrictions.
  The key aspects of this work are i) the extension of the dual splitting method originally proposed by G.E. Karniadakis et al. (J. Comput. Phys. 97, 414-443, 1991) towards non-constant viscosity, ii) a higher-order DG method for incompressible flows with variable viscosity, iii) accelerated nonlinear solver variants and suitable linearizations adopting a matrix-free $hp$-multigrid solver, and iv) a detailed comparison of the monolithic and projection-based solvers in terms of their (non-)linear solver performance.
  The presented schemes are evaluated in a series of numerical examples verifying their spatial and temporal accuracy, and the preconditioner performance under increasing viscosity contrasts, while their efficiency is showcased in the backward-facing step benchmark.</description>

      <title>Partition function of 2D Coulomb gases with radially symmetric potentials and a hard wall</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The large $N$ asymptotic expansion of the partition function for the normal matrix model is predicted to have special features inherited from its interpretation as a two-dimensional Coulomb gas. However for the latter, it is most natural to include a hard wall at the boundary of the droplet. We probe how this affects the asymptotic expansion in the solvable case that the potential is radially symmetric and the droplet is a disk or an annulus. We allow too for the hard wall to be strictly inside the boundary of the droplet. It is observed the term of order $\log N$, has then a different rational number prefactor to that when the hard wall is at the droplet boundary. Also found are certain universal (potential independent) numerical constants given by definite integrals, both at order $\sqrt{N}$, and in the constant term.</description>

Abstract: We prove that at all positive temperatures in the bulk of a classical two-dimensional one-component plasma (also called Coulomb or log-gas, or jellium) the variance of the number of particles in large disks grows (strictly) more slowly than the area. In other words the system is hyperuniform.</description>

      <title>Random matrix ensembles and integrable differential identities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11296v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrable differential identities, together with ensemble-specific initial conditions, provide an effective approach for the characterisation of relevant observables and state functions in random matrix theory. We develop this approach for the unitary and orthogonal ensembles. In particular, we focus on a reduction where the probability measure is induced by a Hamiltonian expressed as a formal series of even interaction terms. We show that the order parameters for the unitary ensemble, that is associated with the Volterra lattice, provide a solution of the modified KP equation. The analogous reduction for the orthogonal ensemble, associated with the Pfaff lattice, leads to a new integrable chain. A key step for the calculation of order parameters for the orthogonal ensemble is the evaluation of the initial condition by using a map from orthogonal to skew-orthogonal polynomials. The thermodynamic limit leads to an integrable system (a chain for the orthogonal ensemble)of hydrodynamic type. Intriguingly, we find that the solution to the initial value problem for both the discrete system and its continuum limit are given by the very same semi-discrete dynamical chain.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2108.12664v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The (elliptic) stochastic quantization equation for the (massive) $\cosh(\beta \varphi)_2$ model, for the charged parameter in the $L^2$ regime (i.e. $\beta^2 &lt; 4 \pi$), is studied. We prove the existence, uniqueness and the properties of the invariant measure of the solution to this equation. The proof is obtained through a priori estimates and a lattice approximation of the equation. For implementing this strategy we generalize some properties of Besov spaces in the continuum to analogous results for Besov spaces on the lattice. As a final result we show how to use the stochastic quantization equation to verify the Osterwalder-Schrader axioms for the $\cosh (\beta \varphi)_2$ quantum field theory, including the exponential decay of correlation functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.14344v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss a scenario of bipartite steering with local subsystems of the parties modeled by certain operator algebras. In particular, we formalize the notion of quantum assemblages in a commuting observables paradigm and focus on equivalent descriptions of such objects providing a systematic analysis of previously scattered approaches. We provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the equivalence of quantum commuting and tensor models that is stable under extensions of the trusted subsystem by arbitrary finite-dimensional ancillae. As a result, we show that the gap between two models of bipartite steering can be observed in an arbitrary scenario with two measurement settings ($m = 2$) and more than two outcomes ($k &gt; 2$). Finally, we provide no-go results concerning the possibility of post-quantum steering in this most general bipartite paradigm and discuss related corollaries regarding free probability and operator system approach as well as a link to Tsirelson's problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.03489v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss a variational approach to the length functional and its relation to sub-Hamiltonian equations on sub-Finsler manifolds. Then, we introduce the notion of the nonholonomic sub-Finslerian structure and prove that the distributions are geodesically invariant concerning the Barthel non-linear connection. We provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of the curves that are abnormal extremals; likewise, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for normal extremals to be the motion of a free nonholonomic mechanical system, and vice versa. Moreover, we show that a coordinate-free approach for a free particle is a comparison between the solutions of the nonholonomic mechanical problem and the solutions of the Vakonomic dynamical problem for the nonholonomic sub-Finslerian structure. In addition, we provide an example of the nonholonomic sub-Finslerian structure. Finally, we show that the sub-Laplacian measures the curvature of the nonholonomic sub-Finslerian structure.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Definition of the Schwarzian Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17068v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide mathematical foundations for the Schwarzian Field Theory as a finite Borel measure on $\mathrm{Diff}^1(\mathbb{T})/\mathrm{PSL}(2,\mathbb{R})$, a quotient of the space of circle reparametrisations. The measure is defined by a natural change of variables formula, which we show uniquely characterises it. We further compute its partition function (total mass) from this change of variable formula. The existence of the measure then follows from an explicit construction involving a nonlinear transformation of a Brownian Bridge, proposed by Belokurov--Shavgulidze. In two companion papers by Losev, the predicted exact cross-ratio correlation functions for non-crossing Wilson lines and the large deviations are derived from this measure.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Correlation Functions of the Schwarzian Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17071v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study correlation functions of the probabilistic Schwarzian Field Theory. We compute cross-ratio correlation functions exactly in the case when the corresponding Wilson lines do not intersect, confirming predictions made in the physics literature via limit of the conformal bootstrap and the DOZZ formula. Moreover, we prove that these correlation functions characterise the measure uniquely. We use them to define and compute the stress-energy tensor correlation functions, and demonstrate, in particular, that these agree with the results obtained earlier by formal differentiation of the partition function.</description>

      <title>Quantum entanglement as an ambiguity of classical dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21949v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study consequences of applying formalism of symplectic geometry to quantum mechanics. We propose a physical interpretation of a symplectic indicator of entanglement, introduced in [1], given by the degeneracy of the symplectic form on manifolds of locally unitary equivalent states. We show that this degeneracy can be understood as an ambiguity of some classical dynamic.</description>

      <title>Stability of a Riemann Shock in a Physical Class: From Brenner-Navier-Stokes-Fourier to Euler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03613v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The stability of an irreversible singularity, such as a Riemann shock to the full Euler system, in the absence of any technical conditions on perturbations, remains a major open problem even within mono-dimensional framework. A natural approach to justify such stability is to consider vanishing dissipation (or viscosity) limits of physical viscous flows. We prove the existence of vanishing dissipation limits, on which a Riemann shock of small amplitude is stable (up to a time-dependent shift) and unique. Thus, a Riemann weak shock is rigid (not turbulent) under physical disturbances. We adopt the Brenner-Navier-Stokes-Fourier system, based on the bi-velocity theory, as a physical viscous model. The key ingredient of the proof is the uniform stability of the viscous shock with respect to the viscosity strength. The uniformity is ensured by contraction estimates of any large perturbations around the shock. The absence of any restrictions on size of initial perturbations forces us to handle extreme values of density and temperature, which constitutes the most challenging part of our analysis. We use the method of a-contraction with shifts, but we improve it by introducing a more delicate analysis of the localizing effect given by viscous shock derivatives. This improvement possesses a degree of robustness that renders it applicable to a wide range of models. This is the first resolution for the challenging open problem on the "unconditional" stability and uniqueness of Riemann shock solutions to the full Euler system in a class of vanishing physical dissipation limits.</description>

      <title>When are dynamical systems learned from time series data statistically accurate?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06311v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conventional notions of generalization often fail to describe the ability of learned models to capture meaningful information from dynamical data. A neural network that learns complex dynamics with a small test error may still fail to reproduce its \emph{physical} behavior, including associated statistical moments and Lyapunov exponents. To address this gap, we propose an ergodic theoretic approach to generalization of complex dynamical models learned from time series data. Our main contribution is to define and analyze generalization of a broad suite of neural representations of classes of ergodic systems, including chaotic systems, in a way that captures emulating underlying invariant, physical measures. Our results provide theoretical justification for why regression methods for generators of dynamical systems (Neural ODEs) fail to generalize, and why their statistical accuracy improves upon adding Jacobian information during training. We verify our results on a number of ergodic chaotic systems and neural network parameterizations, including MLPs, ResNets, Fourier Neural layers, and RNNs.</description>

      <title>A comparative analysis for different finite element types in strain-gradient elasticity simulations performed on Firedrake and FEniCS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12043v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The layer-upon-layer approach in additive manufacturing, open or closed cells in polymeric or metallic foams involve an intrinsic microstructure tailored to the underlying applications. Homogenization of such architectured materials creates metamaterials modeled by higher-gradient models, specifically when the microstructure's characteristic length is comparable to the length scale of the structure. In this study, we conduct a comparative analysis of various finite elements methods for solving problems in strain-gradient elasticity. We employ open-source packages from Firedrake and FEniCS. Different finite element formulations are tested: we implement Lagrange, Argyris, Hermite elements, a Hu--Washizu type (mixed) formulation, as well as isogeometric analysis with Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines (NURBS). For the numerical study, we investigate one- and two-dimensional problems discussed in the literature of strain-gradient modeling. All developed codes are open-access to encourage research in Finite Element Method (FEM) based computation of generalized continua.</description>

      <title>Optimal estimation of three parallel spins with genuine and restricted collective measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03383v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Collective measurements on identical and independent quantum systems can offer advantages in information extraction compared with individual measurements. However, little is known about the distinction between restricted collective measurements and genuine collective measurements in the multipartite setting. In this work we establish a rigorous performance gap based on a simple and old estimation problem, the estimation of a random spin state given three parallel spins. Notably, we derive an analytical formula for the maximum estimation fidelity of biseparable measurements and clarify its fidelity gap from genuine collective measurements. Moreover, we clarify the structure of optimal biseparable measurements. It turns out that the maximum estimation fidelity can be achieved by two- and one-copy measurements assisted by one-way communication in one direction, but not the other way. Our work reveals a rich landscape of multipartite nonclassicality in quantum measurements instead of quantum states and is expected to trigger further studies.</description>

      <title>Real-analyticity of 2-dimensional superintegrable metrics and solution of two Bolsinov-Kozlov-Fomenko conjectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18485v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study two-dimensional Riemannian metrics which are superintegrable in the class of polynomial in momenta integrals. The study is based on our main technical result, Theorem 3, which states that the Poisson bracket of two polynomial in momenta integrals is an algebraic function of
  the integrals and of the Hamiltonian. We conjecture that two-dimensional superintegrable Riemannian metrics are necessary real-analytic in isothermal coordinate systems, and give arguments supporting this conjecture. Small modification of the arguments, discussed in the paper, provides a methods to construct new superintegrable systems. We prove a special case of the above conjecture which is sufficient to show that
  the metrics constructed by K. Kiyohara in 2001, which admit irreducible polynomial in momenta integrals of arbitrary high degree $k$, are not superintegrable and in particular do not admit nontrivial polynomial in momenta integral of degree less than $k$. This result solves Conjectures (b) and (c) explicitly formulated in Bolsinov, KOzlov and Fomenko in 1995.</description>

      <title>Regularization of Functional Determinants of Radial Operators via Heat Kernel Coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10099v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an efficient regularization method for functional determinants of radial operators using heat kernel coefficients. Our key finding is a systematic way to identify heat kernel coefficients in the angular momentum space. We explicitly obtain the formulas up to sixth order in the heat kernel expansion, which suffice to regularize functional determinants in up to 13 dimensions. We find that the heat kernel coefficients accurately approximate the large angular momentum dependence of functional determinants, and make numerical computations more efficient. In the limit of a large angular momentum, our formulas reduce to the WKB formulas in previous studies, but extended to higher orders. All the results are available in both the zeta function regularization and the dimensional regularization.</description>

      <title>Beyond Robertson-Schr\"odinger: A General Uncertainty Relation Unveiling Hidden Noncommutative Trade-offs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20404v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report a universal strengthening of the Robertson-Schr\''odinger uncertainty relation, revealing a previously overlooked trade-off of genuinely quantum origin, particularly as the state becomes more mixed. Remarkably, this generalized bound supplements the standard commutator term and the covariance term with an additional positive contribution that depends on the commutator of observables. The relation also rigorously proves and extends a conjectured uncertainty relation previously proposed in [Phys. Rev. A 110, 062215 (2024)]. For two-level quantum systems, the inequality becomes an exact equality for any state and any pair of observables, establishing that the bound is tight in the strongest possible sense.</description>

      <title>Harmonic analysis of multiplicative chaos Part II: a unified approach to Fourier dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03298v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a unified approach for studying the polynomial Fourier decay of classical multiplicative chaos measures. As consequences, we obtain the precise Fourier dimensions for multiplicative chaos measures arising from the following key models: the sub-critical 1D and 2D GMC (which in particular resolves the Garban-Vargas conjecture); the sub-critical $d$-dimensional GMC with $d \ge 3$ when the parameter $\gamma$ is near the critical value; the canonical Mandelbrot random coverings; the canonical Mandelbrot cascades. For various other models, we establish the non-trivial lower bounds of the Fourier dimensions and in various cases we conjecture that they are all optimal and provide the exact values of Fourier dimensions.</description>
