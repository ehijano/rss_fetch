      <title>The second Delannoy category</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent work, Harman and Snowden constructed a symmetric tensor category associated to an oligomorphic group equipped with a measure. The oligomorphic group $\mathbb{G}$ of order preserving automorphisms of the real line admits exactly four measures. The category $\mathcal{C}$ associated to the first measure is called the (first) Delannoy category; it is semi-simple and pre-Tannakian, with numerous special properties.
  In this paper, we study the (non-abelian) category $\mathcal{A}$ associated to the second measure, which we call the second Delannoy category. We construct a new pre-Tannakian category $\mathcal{D}$ together with a fully faithful tensor functor $\Psi \colon \mathcal{A} \to \mathcal{D}$. The category $\mathcal{D}$ is the correct ``abelian version'' of the second Delannoy category. Like $\mathcal{C}$, it has remarkable properties: for instance, it is non-semi-simple, but behaves uniformly in the coefficient field (e.g., it has the same Grothendieck ring and $\mathrm{Ext}^1$ quiver over any field).
  Additionally, we completely solve the problem of understanding how $\mathcal{A}$ relates to general pre-Tannakian categories. We show that $\mathcal{A}$ admits exactly two local abelian envelopes: the functor $\Psi$, and a previously constructed functor $\Phi \colon \mathcal{A} \to \mathcal{C}$. This is the first case where the local envelopes of a category have been completely determined, outside of cases where there is at most one envelope. This work opens the door to constructing abelian versions of other oligomorphic tensor categories that do not admit a unique envelope.</description>

      <title>Geometric wavefront sets of genuine Iwahori-spherical representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For Iwahori-spherical genuine representations of central covers with positive real Satake parameters, we prove the upper bound inequality for their geometric wavefront sets, formulated for general genuine representations in an earlier work by Gao--Liu--Lo--Shahidi. Meanwhile, we show the equality is attained for covers of type A groups and for some representations of covers of the exceptional groups. We also verify the equality for certain Iwahori-spherical representations occurring in regular unramified principal series; this uses and generalizes the earlier work of Karasiewicz--Okada--Wang on theta representations. Lastly, we determine the leading coefficients in the Harish-Chandra character expansion of a theta representation when its geometric wavefront set is of a special type.</description>

      <title>Rankin--Cohen brackets in Representation Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Rankin--Cohen brackets provide a basic example of ``non-elementary" differential symmetry breaking operators. They can be interpreted as bi-differential operators remarkable for reflecting the structure of fusion rules for holomorphic discrete series representations of the Lie group $SL(2,\mathbb R)$ and are intimately connected to classical special polynomials.
  In this introductory article, we explore the combinatorial structure of these operators and discuss a general framework for constructing their higher-dimensional analogues from the representation-theoretic perspective on branching problems. The exposition is based on lectures delivered by the authors during the thematic semester ``Representation Theory and Noncommutative Geometry", held in Spring 2025 at the Henri Poincar\'e Institute in Paris.</description>

      <title>Primes and The Field of Values of Characters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.15987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $p$ be a prime. For $p=2$, the fields of values of the complex irreducible characters of finite groups whose degrees are not divisible by $p$ have been classified; for odd primes $p$, a conjectural classification has been proposed. In this work, we extend this conjecture to characters whose degrees are divisible by arbitrary powers of $p$, and we provide some evidence supporting its validity.</description>

      <title>Monoidal adjunctions and abelian envelopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show how monoidal adjunctions can be used to prove the existence of monoidal abelian envelopes of pseudo-tensor categories, in particular, those admitting a combinatorial description with certain properties. We derive concrete general criteria that we demonstrate by giving relatively simple combinatorial proofs of the existence of new abelian envelopes for interpolation categories of the hyperoctahedral and of the modified symmetric groups.</description>

      <title>Modular Weil representation and compatibility of cuspidals with congruences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $F$ be a non-archimedean local field of characteristic different from $2$ and of residual characteristic $p$. We generalise the theory of the Weil representation over $F$ with complex coefficients to $\ell$-modular representations \textit{i.e.} when the complex coefficients are replaced by a coefficient field $R$ of characteristic $\ell \neq p$. We obtain along the way a generalisation of the Stone-von Neumann theorem to the $\ell$-modular setting, together with the Weil representation with coefficients in $R$ on the $R$-metaplectic group. Surprisingly enough, the latter $R$-metaplectic group happens to be split over the symplectic group if $\ell = 2$. The theory also makes sense when $F$ is a finite field of odd characteristic. We also establish the irreducibility of the theta lift in the cuspidal case as long as $\ell$ does not divide the pro-orders of the groups at stake and we provide a compatibility to congruences in this setting via an integral version of the theta lift.</description>

      <title>On the rationality of the Weil Representation and the local theta correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the Weil representation over a non-archimedean local field can be realised with coefficients in a number field. We give an explicit descent argument to describe precisely which number field the Weil representation descends to. Our methods also apply over more general coefficient fields, such as $\ell$-modular coefficient fields, as well as coefficient rings such as rings of integers i.e. in families. We also prove that the theta correspondence over a perfect field is valid if and only if it is valid over the algebraic closure of this perfect field. These two results together show that the classical local theta correspondence is rational.</description>

      <title>On mode transition algebras for $\mathbb{Z}$-graded vertex algebras and applications to bosonic ghosts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the mode transition algebras and Zhu algebras in the setting of $\mathbb{Z}$-graded vertex algebras, with particular focus on the Weyl vertex algebra at central charge 2 (also known as bosonic ghosts or the $\beta\gamma$-system). We show that the mode transition algebras of the Weyl vertex algebra at central charge 2 admit unity elements that form a family of strong unities in the sense of Damiolini-Gibney-Krashen. The existence of unities for the mode transition algebra of the Weyl vertex algebra at central charge 2 allows us to explicitly construct all higher level Zhu algebras of the Weyl vertex algebra at central charge 2. We further analyze weak modules of the Weyl vertex algebra at central charge 2 induced from Zhu algebras, proving that every such module is already induced from the level-zero Zhu algebra. We then prove that all indecomposable reducible weight modules induced from a Zhu algebra are not weakly interlocked, and hence not strongly interlocked in the sense of Barron-Batistelli-Orosz Hunziker-Yamskulna. More generally, we show that the property of being weakly interlocked is preserved under the action of an invertible Li's $\mathbf{\Delta}$ operator. As an application, we prove that all indecomposable reducible weight modules of the Weyl vertex algebra at central charge 2 obtained via spectral flow of Zhu-induced modules are likewise not weakly interlocked. These results clarify the role of being weakly interlocked in the modularity properties of bosonic ghost modules previously studied by Ridout-Wood and Allen-Wood.</description>

Abstract: We describe a connected component of the space of conjugacy classes of representations of the modular group $\mathrm{PSL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$ into the isometry group of the symmetric space $\mathrm{SL}_3(\mathbb{R})/\mathrm{SO}(3)$. This connected component contains the family of representations constructed by Schwartz via Pappus' theorem, as well as their Anosov deformations studied by Barbot, Lee, and Val\'erio. We show that certain representations in this component (far from the Schwartz representations) are Anosov.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.15920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a precise definition of mutation of skew symmetrizable matrices over group rings and relate it to folding and mutation of quivers with symmetries. These matrices can have non-zero diagonal entries and we explain a mutation rule in some of these cases as well. This new rule comes from a notion of a generalized mutation of an entire quiver or sub-quiver.</description>

      <title>Gauge Theory and Skein Modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study skein modules of 3-manifolds by embedding them into the Hilbert spaces of 4d ${\cal N}=4$ super-Yang-Mills theories. When the 3-manifold has reduced holonomy, we present an algorithm to determine the dimension and the list of generators of the skein module with a general gauge group. The analysis uses a deformation preserving ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetry to express the dimension as a sum over nilpotent orbits. We find that the dimensions often differ between Langlands-dual pairs beyond the A-series, for which we provide a physical explanation involving chiral symmetry breaking and 't Hooft operators. We also relate our results to the structure of $\mathbb{C}^*$-fixed loci in the moduli space of Higgs bundles. This approach helps to clarify the relation between the gauge-theoretic framework of Kapustin and Witten with other versions of the geometric Langlands program, explains why the dimensions of skein modules do not exhibit a TQFT-like behavior, and provides a physical interpretation of the skein-valued curve counting of Ekholm and Shende.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.10278v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the algebra $D_\hbar(SL_n/U)$ of differential operators on the base affine space of $SL_n$ is the quantized Coulomb branch of a certain 3d $\mathcal{N} = 4$ quiver gauge theory. In the semiclassical limit this proves a conjecture of Dancer-Hanany-Kirwan about the universal hyperk\"ahler implosion of $SL_n$. We also formulate and prove a generalization identifying the Hamiltonian reduction of $T^* SL_n$ with respect to an arbitrary unipotent character as a Coulomb branch. As an application of our results, we provide a new interpretation of the Gelfand-Graev symmetric group action on $D_\hbar(SL_n/U)$.</description>

      <title>On rationality for $C_2$-cofinite vertex operator algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.01898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.01898v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $V$ be an $\mathbb{N}$-graded, simple, self-contragredient, $C_2$-cofinite vertex operator algebra. We show that if the $S$-transformation of the character of $V$ is a linear combination of characters of $V$-modules, then the category $\mathcal{C}$ of grading-restricted generalized $V$-modules is a rigid tensor category. We further show, without any assumption on the character of $V$ but assuming that $\mathcal{C}$ is rigid, that $\mathcal{C}$ is a factorizable finite ribbon category, that is, a not-necessarily-semisimple modular tensor category. As a consequence, we show that if the Zhu algebra of $V$ is semisimple, then $\mathcal{C}$ is semisimple and thus $V$ is rational. The proofs of these theorems use techniques and results from tensor categories together with the method of Moore-Seiberg and Huang for deriving identities of two-point genus-one correlation functions associated to $V$. We give two main applications. First, we prove the conjecture of Kac-Wakimoto and Arakawa that $C_2$-cofinite affine $W$-algebras obtained via quantum Drinfeld-Sokolov reduction of admissible-level affine vertex algebras are strongly rational. The proof uses the recent result of Arakawa and van Ekeren that such $W$-algebras have semisimple (Ramond twisted) Zhu algebras. Second, we use our rigidity results to reduce the "coset rationality problem" to the problem of $C_2$-cofiniteness for the coset. That is, given a vertex operator algebra inclusion $U\otimes V\hookrightarrow A$ with $A$, $U$ strongly rational and $U$, $V$ a pair of mutual commutant subalgebras in $A$, we show that $V$ is also strongly rational provided it is $C_2$-cofinite.</description>

      <title>A combinatorial interpretation of the Bernstein degree of unitary highest weight modules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18766v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider the $(\mathfrak{g}, K)$-modules $L_{\lambda}$ for unitary highest weight representations of the real reductive group $G_{\mathbb{R}} = \operatorname{U}(p,q)$, $\operatorname{Mp}(2n, \mathbb{R})$, or $\operatorname{O}^*(2n)$, where $\operatorname{Mp}(2n,\mathbb{R})$ denotes the metaplectic double cover of $\operatorname{Sp}(2n,\mathbb{R})$. Let $k$ be a positive integer. Corresponding to $G_{\mathbb{R}}$ via Howe duality is the compact group $\operatorname{U}(k)$, $\operatorname{O}(k)$, or $\operatorname{Sp}(k)$, respectively, for which every irreducible representation $\sigma$ corresponds to a unique $L_{\lambda} = L_{\lambda(\sigma)}$. Nishiyama-Ochiai-Taniguchi (2001) expressed the Bernstein degree $\operatorname{Deg} L_{\lambda(\sigma)}$ as the product of $\dim \sigma$ and the degree of the associated variety of $L_{\lambda(\sigma)}$; this result is valid when $k \leq r :=$ the real rank of $G_{\mathbb{R}}$. In this paper, for arbitrary $k$, we give a new combinatorial interpretation $\operatorname{Deg} L_{\lambda(\sigma)} = \#(\mathcal{Q}_k(\sigma) \times \mathcal{P}_k)$, where $\mathcal{Q}_k(\sigma)$ is a certain set of semistandard tableaux, whose cardinality (for $k \geq r$) interpolates between $\dim \sigma$ and the dimension of the simple $K$-module with highest weight $\lambda(\sigma)$. The set $\mathcal{P}_k$ consists of certain plane partitions that encode the Hilbert series of the associated variety. We exhibit analogous sets $\mathcal{P}_k$ of plane partitions for all real reductive groups of Hermitian type, including the exceptional groups.</description>

      <title>Counting points on generic character varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04735v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We count points on character varieties associated with punctured surfaces and regular semisimple generic conjugacy classes in reductive groups. We find that the number of points are palindromic polynomials. This suggests a $P=W$ conjecture for these varieties. We also count points on the corresponding additive character varieties and find that the number of points are also polynomials, which we conjecture have non-negative coefficients. These polynomials can be considered as the reductive analogues of the Kac polynomials of comet-shaped quivers.</description>

      <title>$N=1$ super Virasoro tensor categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18127v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the category of $C_1$-cofinite modules for the universal $N=1$ super Virasoro vertex operator superalgebra $\mathcal{S}(c,0)$ at any central charge $c$ is locally finite and admits the vertex algebraic braided tensor category structure of Huang-Lepowsky-Zhang. For central charges $c^{\mathfrak{ns}}(t)=\frac{15}{2}-3(t+t^{-1})$ with $t\notin\mathbb{Q}$, we show that this tensor category is semisimple, rigid, and slightly degenerate, and we determine its fusion rules. For central charge $c^{\mathfrak{ns}}(1)=\frac{3}{2}$, we show that this tensor category is rigid and that its simple modules have the same fusion rules as $\mathrm{Rep}\,\mathfrak{osp}(1\vert 2)$, in agreement with earlier fusion rule calculations of Milas. Finally, for the remaining central charges $c^{\mathfrak{ns}}(t)$ with $t\in \mathbb{Q}^\times$, we show that the simple $\mathcal{S}(c^{\mathfrak{ns}}(t),0)$-module $\mathcal{S}_{2,2}$ of lowest conformal weight $h^{\mathfrak{ns}}_{2,2}(t)=\frac{3(t-1)^2}{8t}$ is rigid and self-dual, except possibly when $t^{\pm 1}$ is a negative integer or when $c^{\mathfrak{ns}}(t)$ is the central charge of a rational $N=1$ superconformal minimal model.
  As $\mathcal{S}_{2,2}$ is expected to generate the category of $C_1$-cofinite $\mathcal{S}(c^{\mathfrak{ns}}(t),0)$-modules under fusion, rigidity of $\mathcal{S}_{2,2}$ is the first key step to proving rigidity of this category for general $t\in\mathbb{Q}^\times$.</description>

Abstract: Based on the formalism of rigid-analytic motives of Ayoub--Gallauer--Vezzani, we extend our previous work with Fargues from $\ell$-adic sheaves to motivic sheaves. In particular, we prove independence of $\ell$ of the $L$-parameters constructed there.</description>

      <title>The approach of cluster symmetry to Diophantine equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02005v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper aims to employ a cluster-theoretic approach to provide a class of Diophantine equations whose solutions can be obtained by starting from initial solutions through mutations. We establish a novel framework bridging cluster theory and Diophantine equations through the lens of cluster symmetry. On the one hand, we give the necessary and sufficient condition for Laurent polynomials to remain invariant under a given cluster symmetric map. On the other hand, we construct a discriminant algorithm to determine whether a given Laurent polynomial has cluster symmetry and whether it can be realized in a generalized cluster algebra. As applications, we solve Markov-cluster equations, describe some invariant Laurent polynomial rings, and resolve the questions posed by Gyoda and Matsushita.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07288v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note we give formulas for cup product in Tate cohomology in terms of inhomogeneous cochains. Using one of these formulas, for a torus T defined over a non-archimedean local field K and splitting over a cyclic extension of K, we compute explicit cocycles representing all cohomology classes in H^1(K,T).</description>

      <title>Some generalizations of Camina pairs and orders of elements in cosets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13056v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate certain generalizations of Camina pairs. Let $H$ be a nontrivial proper subgroup of a finite group $G$. We first show that every nontrivial irreducible complex character of $H$ induces homogeneously to $G$ if and only if for every $x\in G\setminus H$, the element $x$ is conjugate to $xh$ for all $h\in H$. Furthermore we prove that if $xh$ is conjugate to either $x$ or $x^{-1}$ for all $h\in H$ and all $x\in G\setminus H$, then the normal closure $N$ of $H$ in $G$ also satisfies the same condition, and $N$ is nilpotent. Finally, we determine the structure of $H$ under the assumption that for every element $x\in G\setminus H$ of odd order, the coset $xH$ consists entirely of elements of odd order.</description>

      <title>Generalized Symmetries From Fusion Actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13063v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $A$ be a condensable algebra in a modular tensor category $\mathcal{C}$. We define an action of the fusion category $\mathcal{C}_A$ of $A$-modules in $\mathcal{C}$ on the morphism space $\mbox{Hom}_{\mathcal{C}}(x,A)$ for any $x$ in $\mathcal{C}$, whose characters are generalized Frobenius-Schur indicators. This fusion action can be considered on $A$, and we prove a categorical generalization of the Schur-Weyl duality for this action. For any fusion subcategory $\mathcal{B}$ of $\mathcal{C}_A$ containing all the local $A$-modules, we prove the invariant subobject $B=A^\mathcal{B}$ is a condensable subalgebra of $A$. The assignment of $\mathcal{B}$ to $A^\mathcal{B}$ defines a Galois correspondence between this kind of fusion subcategories of $\mathcal{C}_A$ and the condensable subalgebras of $A$. In the context of VOAs, we prove for any nice VOAs $U \subset A$, $U=A^{\mathcal{C}_A}$ where $\mathcal{C}=\mathcal{M}_U$ is the category of $U$-modules. In particular, if $U = A^G$ for some finite automorphism group $G$ of $A,$ the fusion action of $\mathcal{C}_A$ on $A$ is equivalent to the $G$-action on $A.$</description>
