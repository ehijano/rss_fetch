      <title>Facets of Disparate Impact: Evaluating Legally Consistent Bias in Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Leveraging current legal standards, we define bias through the lens of marginal benefits and objective testing with the novel metric "Objective Fairness Index". This index combines the contextual nuances of objective testing with metric stability, providing a legally consistent and reliable measure. Utilizing the Objective Fairness Index, we provide fresh insights into sensitive machine learning applications, such as COMPAS (recidivism prediction), highlighting the metric's practical and theoretical significance. The Objective Fairness Index allows one to differentiate between discriminatory tests and systemic disparities.</description>

      <title>A Proposal for Evaluating the Operational Risk for ChatBots based on Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergence of Generative AI (Gen AI) and Large Language Models (LLMs) has enabled more advanced chatbots capable of human-like interactions. However, these conversational agents introduce a broader set of operational risks that extend beyond traditional cybersecurity considerations. In this work, we propose a novel, instrumented risk-assessment metric that simultaneously evaluates potential threats to three key stakeholders: the service-providing organization, end users, and third parties. Our approach incorporates the technical complexity required to induce erroneous behaviors in the chatbot--ranging from non-induced failures to advanced prompt-injection attacks--as well as contextual factors such as the target industry, user age range, and vulnerability severity. To validate our metric, we leverage Garak, an open-source framework for LLM vulnerability testing. We further enhance Garak to capture a variety of threat vectors (e.g., misinformation, code hallucinations, social engineering, and malicious code generation). Our methodology is demonstrated in a scenario involving chatbots that employ retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), showing how the aggregated risk scores guide both short-term mitigation and longer-term improvements in model design and deployment. The results underscore the importance of multi-dimensional risk assessments in operationalizing secure, reliable AI-driven conversational systems.</description>

      <title>CRAFT: Cultural Russian-Oriented Dataset Adaptation for Focused Text-to-Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the fact that popular text-to-image generation models cope well with international and general cultural queries, they have a significant knowledge gap regarding individual cultures. This is due to the content of existing large training datasets collected on the Internet, which are predominantly based on Western European or American popular culture. Meanwhile, the lack of cultural adaptation of the model can lead to incorrect results, a decrease in the generation quality, and the spread of stereotypes and offensive content. In an effort to address this issue, we examine the concept of cultural code and recognize the critical importance of its understanding by modern image generation models, an issue that has not been sufficiently addressed in the research community to date. We propose the methodology for collecting and processing the data necessary to form a dataset based on the cultural code, in particular the Russian one. We explore how the collected data affects the quality of generations in the national domain and analyze the effectiveness of our approach using the Kandinsky 3.1 text-to-image model. Human evaluation results demonstrate an increase in the level of awareness of Russian culture in the model.</description>

      <title>Position: The AI Conference Peer Review Crisis Demands Author Feedback and Reviewer Rewards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The peer review process in major artificial intelligence (AI) conferences faces unprecedented challenges with the surge of paper submissions (exceeding 10,000 submissions per venue), accompanied by growing concerns over review quality and reviewer responsibility. This position paper argues for the need to transform the traditional one-way review system into a bi-directional feedback loop where authors evaluate review quality and reviewers earn formal accreditation, creating an accountability framework that promotes a sustainable, high-quality peer review system. The current review system can be viewed as an interaction between three parties: the authors, reviewers, and system (i.e., conference), where we posit that all three parties share responsibility for the current problems. However, issues with authors can only be addressed through policy enforcement and detection tools, and ethical concerns can only be corrected through self-reflection. As such, this paper focuses on reforming reviewer accountability with systematic rewards through two key mechanisms: (1) a two-stage bi-directional review system that allows authors to evaluate reviews while minimizing retaliatory behavior, (2)a systematic reviewer reward system that incentivizes quality reviewing. We ask for the community's strong interest in these problems and the reforms that are needed to enhance the peer review process.</description>

      <title>Societal and technological progress as sewing an ever-growing, ever-changing, patchy, and polychrome quilt</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems are increasingly placed in positions where their decisions have real consequences, e.g., moderating online spaces, conducting research, and advising on policy. Ensuring they operate in a safe and ethically acceptable fashion is thus critical. However, most solutions have been a form of one-size-fits-all "alignment". We are worried that such systems, which overlook enduring moral diversity, will spark resistance, erode trust, and destabilize our institutions. This paper traces the underlying problem to an often-unstated Axiom of Rational Convergence: the idea that under ideal conditions, rational agents will converge in the limit of conversation on a single ethics. Treating that premise as both optional and doubtful, we propose what we call the appropriateness framework: an alternative approach grounded in conflict theory, cultural evolution, multi-agent systems, and institutional economics. The appropriateness framework treats persistent disagreement as the normal case and designs for it by applying four principles: (1) contextual grounding, (2) community customization, (3) continual adaptation, and (4) polycentric governance. We argue here that adopting these design principles is a good way to shift the main alignment metaphor from moral unification to a more productive metaphor of conflict management, and that taking this step is both desirable and urgent.</description>

      <title>Mapping User Trust in Vision Language Models: Research Landscape, Challenges, and Prospects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid adoption of Vision Language Models (VLMs), pre-trained on large image-text and video-text datasets, calls for protecting and informing users about when to trust these systems. This survey reviews studies on trust dynamics in user-VLM interactions, through a multi-disciplinary taxonomy encompassing different cognitive science capabilities, collaboration modes, and agent behaviours. Literature insights and findings from a workshop with prospective VLM users inform preliminary requirements for future VLM trust studies.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Risk Propensities of Large Language Models: Ethical Focus and Bias Detection through Role-Play</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08884v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become more prevalent, concerns about their safety, ethics, and potential biases have risen. Systematically evaluating LLMs' risk decision-making tendencies and attitudes, particularly in the ethical domain, has become crucial. This study innovatively applies the Domain-Specific Risk-Taking (DOSPERT) scale from cognitive science to LLMs and proposes a novel Ethical Decision-Making Risk Attitude Scale (EDRAS) to assess LLMs' ethical risk attitudes in depth. We further propose a novel approach integrating risk scales and role-playing to quantitatively evaluate systematic biases in LLMs. Through systematic evaluation and analysis of multiple mainstream LLMs, we assessed the "risk personalities" of LLMs across multiple domains, with a particular focus on the ethical domain, and revealed and quantified LLMs' systematic biases towards different groups. This research helps understand LLMs' risk decision-making and ensure their safe and reliable application. Our approach provides a tool for identifying and mitigating biases, contributing to fairer and more trustworthy AI systems. The code and data are available.</description>

      <title>The Right to AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17899v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a Right to AI, which asserts that individuals and communities should meaningfully participate in the development and governance of the AI systems that shape their lives. Motivated by the increasing deployment of AI in critical domains and inspired by Henri Lefebvre's concept of the Right to the City, we reconceptualize AI as a societal infrastructure, rather than merely a product of expert design. In this paper, we critically evaluate how generative agents, large-scale data extraction, and diverse cultural values bring new complexities to AI oversight. The paper proposes that grassroots participatory methodologies can mitigate biased outcomes and enhance social responsiveness. It asserts that data is socially produced and should be managed and owned collectively. Drawing on Sherry Arnstein's Ladder of Citizen Participation and analyzing nine case studies, the paper develops a four-tier model for the Right to AI that situates the current paradigm and envisions an aspirational future. It proposes recommendations for inclusive data ownership, transparent design processes, and stakeholder-driven oversight. We also discuss market-led and state-centric alternatives and argue that participatory approaches offer a better balance between technical efficiency and democratic legitimacy.</description>

      <title>RouterKT: Mixture-of-Experts for Knowledge Tracing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08989v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Knowledge Tracing (KT) is a fundamental task in Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS), which aims to model the dynamic knowledge states of students based on their interaction histories. However, existing KT models often rely on a global forgetting decay mechanism for capturing learning patterns, assuming that students' performance is predominantly influenced by their most recent interactions. Such approaches fail to account for the diverse and complex learning patterns arising from individual differences and varying learning stages. To address this limitation, we propose RouterKT, a novel Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture designed to capture heterogeneous learning patterns by enabling experts to specialize in different patterns without any handcrafted learning pattern bias such as forgetting decay. Specifically, RouterKT introduces a \textbf{person-wise routing mechanism} to effectively model individual-specific learning behaviors and employs \textbf{multi-heads as experts} to enhance the modeling of complex and diverse patterns. Comprehensive experiments on ten benchmark datasets demonstrate that RouterKT exhibits significant flexibility and improves the performance of various KT backbone models, with a maximum average AUC improvement of 3.29\% across different backbones and datasets, outperforming other state-of-the-art models. Moreover, RouterKT demonstrates consistently superior inference efficiency compared to existing approaches based on handcrafted learning pattern bias, highlighting its usability for real-world educational applications.

      <title>Imagining and building wise machines: The centrality of AI metacognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02478v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although AI has become increasingly smart, its wisdom has not kept pace. In this article, we examine what is known about human wisdom and sketch a vision of its AI counterpart. We analyze human wisdom as a set of strategies for solving intractable problems-those outside the scope of analytic techniques-including both object-level strategies like heuristics [for managing problems] and metacognitive strategies like intellectual humility, perspective-taking, or context-adaptability [for managing object-level strategies]. We argue that AI systems particularly struggle with metacognition; improved metacognition would lead to AI more robust to novel environments, explainable to users, cooperative with others, and safer in risking fewer misaligned goals with human users. We discuss how wise AI might be benchmarked, trained, and implemented.</description>

      <title>Negotiative Alignment: Embracing Disagreement to Achieve Fairer Outcomes -- Insights from Urban Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12613v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cities are not monolithic; they are arenas of negotiation among groups that hold varying needs, values, and experiences. Conventional methods of urban assessment -- from standardized surveys to AI-driven evaluations -- frequently rely on a single consensus metric (e.g., an average measure of inclusivity or safety). Although such aggregations simplify design decisions, they risk obscuring the distinct perspectives of marginalized populations. In this paper, we present findings from a community-centered study in Montreal involving 35 residents with diverse demographic and social identities, particularly wheelchair users, seniors, and LGBTQIA2+ individuals. Using rating and ranking tasks on 20 urban sites, we observe that disagreements are systematic rather than random, reflecting structural inequalities, differing cultural values, and personal experiences of safety and accessibility.
  Based on these empirical insights, we propose negotiative alignment, an AI framework that treats disagreement as an essential input to be preserved, analyzed, and addressed. Negotiative alignment builds on pluralistic models by dynamically updating stakeholder preferences through multi-agent negotiation mechanisms, ensuring no single perspective is marginalized. We outline how this framework can be integrated into urban analytics -- and other decision-making contexts -- to retain minority viewpoints, adapt to changing stakeholder concerns, and enhance fairness and accountability. The study demonstrates that preserving and engaging with disagreement, rather than striving for an artificial consensus, can produce more equitable and responsive AI-driven outcomes in urban design.</description>
