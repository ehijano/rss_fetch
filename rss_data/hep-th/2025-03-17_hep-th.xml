      <title>T-duality and background-dependence in genus corrections to effective actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classical effective action of string theory is background-independent and remains invariant under Buscher transformations, including their higher-derivative corrections, when dimensionally reduced on a circle of arbitrary radius, encoding classical T-duality. In this work, we extend this symmetry to include higher-genus contributions, thereby constraining the structure of quantum corrections governed by T-duality. We propose that the dimensional reduction of the effective Lagrangian density on a circle of arbitrary radius retains invariance under higher-genus and higher-derivative corrections to the Buscher rules.
  For a self-dual circle, this constraint fixes the Lagrangian density at each order of \(\alpha'\) to match its classical counterpart. However, a small number of unfixed parameters at each order of \(\alpha'\) must be determined using loop-level S-matrix methods. Notably, the one-loop \(\alpha'^3\) corrections induced by T-duality in this setup differ from those derived via the S-matrix method in globally flat 10-dimensional spacetime. This discrepancy underscores the inherently background-dependent nature of quantum corrections in string theory, highlighting how the underlying geometry shapes the structure and behavior of quantum effects.</description>

      <title>Ordinary wormholes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Euclidean wormholes have played a key role in the recent ``disorder averaged" approaches to quantum gravity and holography, but are typically only considered in somewhat special theories of gravity, such as theories in low dimensions or theories with exotic matter content (such as axions). These exotic theories have advantage that both the matter and gravitational sectors can be treated completely classically. However, once this constraint is relaxed we find that Euclidean wormholes arise generically, with no special constraints on the matter content. The key point is that there is a self-consistent approximation where the metric is treated classically but matter is treated quantum mechanically. The resulting wormholes are {\it ordinary} in the sense that they rely on the usual approximations used in, for example, the construction of star or FRW solutions in general relativity. Indeed, these are the Euclidean continuations of ordinary FRW solutions with big bang/crunch singularities. We describe several examples of these ordinary wormholes and discuss the relation to existing constructions and the holographic interpretation in terms of a dual CFT.</description>

      <title>Matter Couplings in Supergravity. The first 10 years</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following the initial construction of pure supergravity in 1976, various methods were developed to couple supergravity with supersymmetric matter. This contribution to 'Half a century of supergravity' provides a personal perspective on the key steps, techniques and results developed in the first decade. These developments form the foundation for numerous applications in phenomenology, cosmology and string theories, while also revealing intriguing mathematical structures.</description>

      <title>Bras and Kets in Euclidean Path Integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum mechanics requires a hermitian inner product &lt;~,~&gt; -- linear in one variable, antilinear in the other -- while the inner product (~,~) that comes most naturally from Euclidean path integrals is linear in each variable. Here we discuss the relation between the two inner products. In a theory with no time-reversal or reflection symmetry, they differ by an operator that complex conjugates the wavefunction and reverses the orientation of space; in the presence of reflection and time-reversal symmetry, space is unoriented so such an operator cannot be defined, but the time-reversal symmetry T is available instead and plays the same role.</description>

      <title>Topological invariant for holographic Weyl-$\boldmath Z_2$ semimetal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The occurrence of a topological phase transition can be demonstrated by a direct observation of a change in the topological invariant. For holographic topological semimetals, a topological Hamiltonian method needs to be employed to calculate the topological invariants due to the strong coupling nature of the system. We calculate the topological invariants for the holographic Weyl semimetal and the holographic Weyl-$\boldmath Z_2$ semimetal, which correspond to the chiral charge and the spin-Chern number, respectively. This is achieved by probing fermions within the system and deriving the topological Hamiltonian from the zero-frequency Green's function. In both cases, we have identified an effective band structure characterized by an infinite number of Weyl or $\boldmath Z_2$ nodes, a distinctive feature of holographic systems different from weakly coupled systems. The topological invariants of these nodes are computed numerically and found to be nonzero, thereby confirming the topologically nontrivial nature of these nodes.</description>

      <title>Hot Casimir wormholes in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the thermal effects on Casimir wormholes in the context of higher-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity. Motivated by the fundamental role of EGB gravity in describing a wide range of gravitational phenomena, we investigate how thermal fluctuations affect the quantum vacuum energy density associated with the Casimir effect and its impact on the global structure of traversable wormholes. By deriving the shape function from the EGB field equations with thermally corrected Casimir energy, we verify that all necessary conditions for wormhole formation are satisfied, including asymptotic flatness and throat stability. Our results indicate that thermal corrections modify of the wormhole geometry, increasing spatial curvature in the throat region and influencing its traversability. Furthermore, we analyze gravitational Casimir effects and discuss their possible role in modified gravity theories. Expanding on the approach of reference \cite{M. Zubair1, Mushayydha, Mushayydha2}, we adopt here the appropriate formulation for Casimir wormholes in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity, taking into account the Casimir energy density in higher dimensions. This approach allows us to obtain more accurate results compared to the simplified approximation previously used.</description>

      <title>Neutrino Decoherence in \texorpdfstring{\(\kappa\)}{kappa}-Minkowski Quantum Spacetime: An Open Quantum Systems Paradigm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate neutrino decoherence within the framework of quantum spacetime, focusing on the $\kappa$-Minkowski model. We show that stochastic fluctuations in quantum spacetime induce an energy-dependent decoherence effect, where the decoherence rate scales as $E^{-4}$. This result aligns with recent IceCube observations, indicating that quantum gravity does not induce significant decoherence for high-energy neutrinos. Additionally, we establish conditions under which quantum spacetime effects could influence relic neutrinos, such as those in the cosmic neutrino background ($C\nu B$). Our results shed light on how quantum spacetime fluctuations impact neutrino oscillation physics.</description>

      <title>Standard Model Symmetries and K(E_10)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We clarify and extend our earlier work (K.A.Meissner and H.Nicolai, Phys. Rev. D91 (2015) 065029 and Phys. Rev. Lett. 121 (2018) 091601) where it was shown how to amend a scheme originally proposed by M. Gell-Mann to identify the three families of quarks and leptons of the Standard Model with the 48 spin 1/2 fermions of N=8 supergravity that remain after absorption of eight Goldstinos, a scheme that in its original form is dynamically realized at the SU(3)xU(1) stationary point of gauged N=8 supergravity. We explain how to deform and enlarge this symmetry at the kinematical level to the full Standard Model symmetry group SU(3)_c x SU(2)_w x U(1)_Y, with the correct charge and chiral assignments for all fermions. The framework also leaves room for an extra U(1)_(B-L) symmetry. This symmetry enhancement is achieved by embedding the Standard Model symmetries into (a quotient group of) K(E_10), the `maximal compact subgroup' of the maximal rank hyperbolic Kac-Moody symmetry E_10, and an infinite prolongation of the SU(8) R-symmetry of N=8 supergravity. This scheme, which is also supposed to encompass quantum gravity, cannot be realized within the framework of space-time based (quantum) field theory, but requires space-time and related geometrical concepts to be `emergent'. We critically review the main hypotheses underlying this construction.</description>

      <title>Half-wormholes in a complex SYK model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the half-wormhole contribution in a complex SYK model with one time point. When the chemical potential is zero, the result is similar to two decoupled Majorana SYK models. There's a disk contribution in a single copy of the model, which is a bit subdominant to the unlinked half-wormhole. After removing out the disk we find out the linked half-wormhole which restores the factorization in the two copies of the complex SYK model. When the chemical potential is small, the disk gets more enhancement than the wormhole and the half-wormhole. When the chemical potential is finite comparing to the random coupling, thd disk dominates so that there's no wormhole and half-wormhole.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the soft decomposition of tree level gluon amplitudes of split-helicity configuration. First, we show how any split-helicity amplitude can be fully fixed from inverse soft limit using BCFW calculation. We show how the double and triple soft theorem can manifest beyond perturbative calculation from split-helicity decomposition. Next, we obtain a compact formula for the corresponding soft operators which is a simple combination of individual single soft operators. Then we generate the leading and sub-leading soft factors using soft momentum expansion, to compare with results derived from standard calculation.</description>

      <title>Generalized scalar field models in the presence of impurities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study generalized scalar field models coupled to impurities in Minkowski spacetime with arbitrary dimensions. The investigation concerns a class of models that depends explicitly on the spacetime coordinates and also, it reveals the presence of a second-order tensor that can have null divergence if a first-order equation and a constraint are satisfied. We obtain the conditions to get compatibility between the equation of motion and the first-order equation, within a framework that is also used in the static case, to show that the introduction of an auxiliary function may allow to describe the energy density of the solution as a divergence. Stability of the solution under rescale of argument, translation in the space and small fluctuations are also fully investigated. We further illustrate the procedure considering the canonical model and also, the $k$-field and Born-Infeld-like models. The results show that stable solutions can be obtained in arbitrary dimensions, and the stability seems to be related to the first-order equation that emerges from imposing null divergence of the aforementioned tensor.</description>

      <title>Can Yang-Baxter imply Lie algebra?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum knot invariants (like colored HOMFLY-PT or Kauffman polynomials) are a distinguished class of non-perturbative topological invariants. Any known way to construct them (via Chern-Simons theory or quantum R-matrix) starts with a finite simple Lie algebra. Another set of knot invariants - of finite type - is related to quantum invariants via a perturbative expansion. However can all finite type invariants be obtained in this way? Investigating this problem, P. Vogel discovered a way to polynomially parameterize the expansion coefficients with three parameters so that, at different specific values, this reproduces the answers for all simple Lie (super)algebras. Then it is easy to construct a polynomial $P_{alg}$ that vanishes for all simple Lie algebras, and the corresponding Vassiliev invariant would thus be absent from the perturbative expansion.
  We review these Vogel claims pointing out at least two interesting implications of his construction. First, we discuss whether infinite-dimensional Lie algebras might enlarge Chern-Simons theory. Second, Vogel's construction implies an alternative axiomatization of simple Lie algebras - when we start from knot invariants and arrive at Lie algebras and their classification, which is opposite to conventional logic that we mentioned at the beginning.</description>

      <title>Direction-dependent linear response for gapped nodal-line semimetals in planar-Hall configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the magnetoelectric conductivity for ideal nodal-line semimetals (NLSMs), with a finite but tiny mass-gap, in distinct planar-Hall set-ups. Each differing configuration results from the relative orientation of the nodal-ring's plane with respect to the plane spanned by the electric and magnetic fields. Our results feature the signatures of the inherent topology of a gapped NLSM, revealed through nonzero values of the Berry curvature and the orbital magnetic moment. In particular, we show that both of these vector fields, arising in the momentum space, give rise to terms of comparable magnitudes in the resulting response. Our explicit theoretical expressions will help identify unique signatures of NLSMs in contemporary experiments.</description>

      <title>Bounded Dark Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent cosmological observations suggest that the dark energy equation of state may have changed in the latter stages of cosmic history. We introduce a quintessence scenario, termed bounded dark energy, capable of explaining this feature in a technically natural way. Our approach is motivated from a bottom-up perspective, based on the concept of mirage cut-off, where we demonstrate the stability of the quintessence potential against large quantum corrections. At the same time, the bounded dark energy framework aligns well with top-down considerations motivated from quantum gravity arguments. We employ both human-driven insights and machine learning techniques to identify explicit realizations of bounded dark energy models. We then perform an analysis based on Markov Chain Monte-Carlo to assess their predictions against CMB, galaxy surveys, and supernova data, showing that bounded dark energy provides a good fit to current observations. We also discuss how upcoming measurements can further test and refine our proposal.</description>

      <title>Electric potentials and field lines for uniformly-charged tube and cylinder expressed by Appell's hypergeometric function and integration of $Z(u|m) \mathrm{sc}(u|m)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The closed-form expressions of electric potentials and field lines for a uniformly-charged tube and cylinder are presented using elliptic integrals and Appell's hypergeometric functions, where field lines are depicted by introducing the concept of the field line potential in axisymmetric systems, whose contour lines represent electric field lines outside the charged region, thought of as an analog of the conjugate harmonic function in the presence of non-uniform metric. The field line potential for the tube shows a multi-valued behavior and enables us to define a topological charge. The integral of $Z(u|m)\operatorname{sc}(u|m)$, where $ Z $ and $ \operatorname{sc} $ are the Jacobi zeta and elliptic functions, is also expressed by Appell's hypergeometric function as a by-product, which was missing in classical tables of formulas.</description>

      <title>Factorization in deep inelastic scattering at Bj\"{o}rken limit: Reduction to (1+1)D integrable models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate structure functions in deep inelastic scattering processes (DIS) at Bj\"{o}rken limit and found that they are factorized into the longitudinal and transversal parts. We see that the longitudinal part can be linked to exact form factors calculated earlier in 1+1 dimensional integrable quantum field theories, such as sine-Gordon model. We extract asymptotic of Form-factors at small Bj\"{o}rken parameter $x$ and compare it with experimental data of HERA and ZEUS collaborations on Deep inelastic lepton-proton scattering. We observe the factorization of the structure functions $F_2(x,q^2)$ and find out its power behavior on scaling parameter $x$.</description>

      <title>Tomography of the Rho meson in the QCD Instanton Vacuum: Transverse Momentum Dependent Parton Distribution Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyse the rho meson unpolarized and polarized transverse momentum dependent parton distribution functions (TMDPDFs) in the instanton liquid model (ILM). The corresponding TMDs in ILM are approximated by a constituent quark beam function in the leading Fock state multiplied by a rapidity-dependent factor resulting from the staple-shaped Wilson lines, for fixed longitudinal momentum, transverse separation, and rapidity. At the resolution of the ILM, all of the rho meson TMDs are symmetric in parton x for fixed transverse momentum, and Gaussian-like in the transverse momentum for fixed parton x. The latter is a direct consequence of the profiling of the quark zero modes in the ILM. The evolved TMDs at higher rapidity using the Collins-Soper kernel, and higher resolution using the renormalization group (RG), show substantial skewness towards low parton x.</description>

      <title>The degeneration of Calabi-Yau 3-folds via 3-forms and the SYZ conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the geometries associated with 3-forms of various orbital types on a symplectic 6-manifold. We demonstrate that certain unstable 3-forms, which naturally emerge from specific degenerations of Calabi-Yau structures, exhibit remarkably rich geometric properties. This, in turn, offers a novel perspective on the SYZ conjecture.</description>

      <title>Photon spheres, gravitational lensing/mirroring, and greybody radiation in deformed AdS-Schwarzschild black holes with phantom global monopole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the geodesic structure, gravitational lensing/mirroring phenomena, and scalar perturbations of deformed AdS-Schwarzschild black holes with global monopoles, incorporating both ordinary and phantom configurations. We introduce a modified black hole metric characterized by a deformation parameter $\alpha$, a control parameter $\beta$, and a symmetry-breaking scale parameter $\eta$, which collectively influence the spacetime geometry. Through comprehensive geodesic analysis, we determine the photon sphere radius numerically for various parameter configurations, revealing significant differences between ordinary and phantom global monopoles. The stability of timelike circular orbits is assessed via the Lyapunov exponent, demonstrating how these parameters affect orbital dynamics. Our gravitational lensing analysis, employing the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, reveals a remarkable gravitational mirroring effect in phantom monopole spacetimes at high AdS curvature radii, where light rays experience negative deflection angles-being repelled rather than attracted by the gravitational field. Furthermore, we analyze massless scalar perturbations and derive the corresponding greybody factors, which characterize the transmission of Hawking radiation through the effective potential barrier surrounding the black hole. Our numerical results indicate that phantom global monopoles substantially modify both gravitational lensing/mirroring properties and the radiation spectrum compared to ordinary monopoles. The presence of the deformation parameter $\alpha$ introduces additional complexity to the system, leading to distinct thermodynamic behavior that deviates significantly from the standard AdS-Schwarzschild solution.</description>

      <title>Ultra-high frequency spikes of relic gravitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The maximal frequency domain of the cosmic gravitons falls in the THz region where, without conflicting with the existing phenomenological bounds, only few particles with opposite (comoving) three-momenta are produced. Although any reliable scrutiny of the ultra-high frequency spikes should include all the sources of late-time suppression at lower and intermediate frequencies, some relevant properties of the averaged multiplicities and of the spectral energy density can be derived within a reduced set of approximations that may become invalid as the frequency decreases well below the Hz. The accuracy of these concurrent approaches is assessed from the properties of the transition matrix that relates the late-time spectra to the values of the mode functions during an inflationary stage. In the obtained framework the bounds on the post-inflationary expansion rate are swiftly deduced and compare quite well with the ones including a more faithful numerical treatment. It also follows that the timeline of the post-inflationary expansion rate might be observationally accessible, in the years to come, provided the electromechanical detectors (like microwave cavities or waveguides) operating between the MHz and the THz shall eventually reach sensitivities in the chirp amplitudes which are (at least) twelve orders of magnitude smaller than the ones experimentally attainable in the audio band (i.e. between few Hz and the kHz).</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic properties and Joule-Thomson expansion of AdS black hole with Gaussian distribution in non-commutative geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The thermodynamics and Joule-Thomson expansion of anti-de Sitter black hole (AdS-BH) with Gaussian distribution in non-commutative geometry is systematically studied. The metric of Gaussian-distributed BH is obtained, showing a dS geometry at the core of BH. The research indicates that the BH characterized by a Gaussian distribution exhibit thermodynamic properties that are remarkably similar to those of BH with a Lorentzian distribution in non-commutative geometry. This similarity is specifically manifested in the small BH-large BH phase transition, the corrected first law of thermodynamics, critical phenomena, critical exponents, zeroth-order phase transition and the Joule-Thomson process. Notably, the critical ratio of Gaussian-distributed BH (0.46531) is significantly larger than those observed in Van der Waals fluids (0.375), and indeed, it is also substantially exceed those of Lorentzian-distributed BH (0.36671). Moreover, compared to the case of Lorentzian source, the zeroth-order phase transition effect in Gaussian-distributed BH is exceedingly subtle (accompanied by a relative increase in the Gibbs free energy on the order of $10^{-3}\!\sim\!\!10^{-2}$) and is difficult to detect distinctly.</description>

      <title>Semileptonic decays of $\Lambda^{+}_{c}$ in light-front quark model with nonvalence contributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the exclusive semilpetonic decays of $\Lambda^{+}_{c}\to (\Lambda/n) \ell^{+} \nu_{\ell}~(\ell=e,\mu)$ within the standard model by using the light-front quark model (LFQM). The form factor behaviors are obtained from the effective treatment of nonvalence contributions in addition to the valence ones in the Drell-Yan-West frame due to the Bethe-Salpeter formalism. Based on these form factors, we find that the decay branching ratios of $\Lambda^{+}_{c}\to (\Lambda e^{+} \nu_{e},\,\Lambda \mu^{+} \nu_{e} ,\, n e^{+} \nu_{e},\, n \mu^{+} \nu_{e})$ are about $ (3.39,\,3.21,\,0.36,\,0.35)\%$ with the non-valence contributions, which are consistent with the recent experimental measurements at BESIII. Furthermore, we use the experimental data to fit the $\beta$ parameters in the baryonic distribution amplitudes under the LFQM, resulting in ($\beta_{\Lambda_{c}},\beta_{\Lambda}, \beta_{n})= (0.58\pm0.08, 0.52\pm0.08,0.44\pm0.04)$.</description>

Abstract: We propose a simple model of family unification, which is a six dimensional $SO(20)$ gauge theory with a single fermion in the spinorial representation. After compactification to five dimensions, our model gives a five dimensional model where the Standard Model Higgs field is unified into the fifth component of the five dimensional gauge field as well as three generations of quarks and leptons are unified into a single spinor field.</description>

      <title>Gluon gravitational form factors of the proton in a light-front spectator model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculate the gluon gravitational form factors (GFFs) of the proton using a light-front spectator model based on soft-wall AdS/QCD, where the active parton is a gluon. The model parameters are determined by fitting the unpolarized gluon distribution function to the NNPDF3.0nlo dataset. Subsequently, we predict the polarized gluon distribution, finding consistency with global analyses. Our predictions for the gluon GFFs show good agreement with recent lattice QCD simulations and experimental extractions. Using these gluon GFFs, we compute the contribution of the gluon to the proton mass and mechanical radii. We also analyze the gluonic contribution to the two-dimensional Galilean densities, including energy density, radial and tangential pressure, isotropic pressure, and pressure anisotropy of the proton.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photon propagators for power-law inflation are constructed in two one-parameter families of noncovariant gauges, in an arbitrary number of spacetime dimensions. In both gauges photon propagators take relatively simple forms expressed in terms of scalar propagators and their derivatives. These are considerably simpler compared to their general covariant gauge counterpart. This makes feasible performing dimensionally regulated loop computations involving massless vector fields in inflation.</description>

      <title>Boundary Conditions for the Entanglement Cut in 2D Conformal Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The entanglement spectra for a subsystem in a spin chain fine-tuned to a quantum-critical point contains signatures of the underlying quantum field theory that governs its low-energy properties. For an open chain with given boundary conditions described by a 2D conformal field theory~(CFT), the entanglement spectrum of the left/right half of the system coincides with a boundary CFT spectrum, where one of the boundary conditions arise due to the `entanglement cut'. The latter has been argued to be conformal and has been numerically found to be the `free' boundary condition for Ising, Potts and free boson theories. For these models, the `free' boundary condition for the lattice degree of freedom has a counterpart in the continuum theory. However, this is not true in general. Here, this question is analyzed for the unitary minimal models of 2D CFTs using the density matrix renormalization group technique. The entanglement spectra are computed for blocks of spins in open chains of A-type restricted solid-on-solid models with identical boundary conditions at the ends. The imposed boundary conditions are realized exactly for these lattice models due to their integrable nature. The obtained entanglement spectra are in good agreement with certain boundary CFT spectra. The boundary condition for the entanglement cut is found to be conformal and to coincide with the one with the highest boundary entropy. This identification enables determination of the exponents governing the unusual corrections to the entanglement entropy from the CFT partition functions. These are compared with numerical results.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we investigate the shadow and energy emission rate of a charged AdS black hole in massive gravity. We develop a new prescription based on maximum frequencies of emission spectrum to probe the thermodynamics of black holes and get an accurate insight into its phase transition criticality. We establish a link between the thermodynamic behavior and the maximum emission frequency of the black hole for both the photons and massive bosonic modes. We show that the frequency maximizing the spectrum combined to the shadow radius can serve as a powerful physical tool to delve into the thermodynamics and phase structure of RN-AdS black holes in massive gravity.</description>

      <title>Gapless Phases in (2+1)d with Non-Invertible Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of gapless phases with categorical (or so-called non-invertible) symmetries is a formidable task, in particular in higher than two space-time dimensions. In this paper we build on previous works arXiv:2408.05266 and arXiv:2502.20440 on gapped phases in (2+1)d and provide a systematic framework to study phase transitions with categorical symmetries. The Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT) is, as often in these matters, the central tool. Applied to gapless theories, we need to consider the extension of the SymTFT to interfaces between topological orders, so-called ``club sandwiches", which realize generalizations of so-called Kennedy-Tasaki (KT) transformations. This requires an input phase transition for a smaller symmetry, such as the Ising transition for $\mathbb{Z}_2$, and the SymTFT constructs a transformation to a gapless phase with a larger categorical symmetry. We carry this out for categorical symmetries whose SymTFT is a (3+1)d Dijkgraaf-Witten (DW) theory for a finite group $G$ with twist -- so-called all bosonic fusion 2-categories. We classify such interfaces using a physically motivated picture of generalized gauging, as well as with a complementary analysis using (bi-)module 2-categories.This is exemplified in numerous abelian and non-abelian DW theories, giving rise to interesting gapless phases such as intrinsically gapless symmetry protected phases (igSPTs) and spontaneous symmetry breaking phases (igSSBs) from abelian, $S_3$, and $D_8$ DW theories.</description>

      <title>Renormalization of Schr\"odinger equation for potentials with inverse-square singularities: Generalized Trigonometric P\"oschl-Teller model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a renormalization procedure necessary for the complete description of the energy spectra of a one-dimensional stationary Schr\"odinger equation with a potential that exhibits inverse-square singularities. We apply and extend the methods introduced in our recent paper on the hyperbolic P\"oschl-Teller potential (with a single singularity) to its trigonometric version. This potential, defined between two singularities, is analyzed across the entire bidimensional coupling space. The fact that the trigonometric P\"oschl-Teller potential is supersymmetric and shape-invariant simplifies the analysis and eliminates the need for self-adjoint extensions in certain coupling regions. However, if at least one coupling is strongly attractive, the renormalization is essential to construct a discrete energy spectrum family of one or two parameters. We also investigate the features of a singular symmetric double well obtained by extending the range of the trigonometric P\"oschl-Teller potential. It has a non-degenerate energy spectrum and eigenstates with well-defined parity.</description>

      <title>Higher-form anomaly and long-range entanglement of mixed states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In open quantum systems, we directly relate anomalies of higher-form symmetries to the long-range entanglement of any mixed state with such symmetries. First, we define equivalence classes of long-range entanglement in mixed states via stochastic local channels (SLCs), which effectively ``mod out'' any classical correlations and thus distinguish phases by differences in long-range quantum correlations only. It is then shown that strong symmetries of a mixed state and their anomalies (non-trivial braiding and self-statistics) are intrinsic features of the entire phase of matter. For that, a general procedure of symmetry pullback for strong symmetries is introduced, whereby symmetries of the output state of an SLC are dressed into symmetries of the input state, with their anomaly relation preserved. This allows us to prove that states in (2+1)-D with anomalous strong 1-form symmetries exhibit long-range bipartite entanglement, and to establish a lower bound for their topological entanglement of formation, a mixed-state generalization of topological entanglement entropy. For concreteness, we apply this formalism to the toric code under Pauli-X and Z dephasing noise, as well as under ZX decoherence, which gives rise to the recently discovered intrinsically mixed-state topological order. Finally, we conjecture a connection between higher-form anomalies and long-range multipartite entanglement for mixed states in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Resurgence in the Universal Structures in B-model Topological String Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a systematic analysis of Alim-Yau-Zhou's double scaling limit and Couso-Santamar\'{i}a's large radius limit for the perturbative free energies in B-model topological string theory based on \'Ecalle's Resurgence Theory. Taking advantage of the known resurgent properties of the formal solutions to the Airy equation and of the stability of resurgent series under exponential/logarithm and nonlinear changes of variable, we show how to rigorously derive the non-perturbative information from the perturbative one by means of alien calculus in this context, spelling out the notions of formal integral and Bridge Equation, typical of the resurgent approach to ordinary differential equations. We also discuss the Borel-Laplace summation of the obtained resurgent transseries, including a study of real analyticity based on the connection formulas stemming from the resummation of the Bridge Equation.</description>

      <title>Regular black holes and their singular families</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Regular black holes without curvature singularity can arise in Einstein gravity with appropriate matter energy-momentum tensor. We show that these regular solutions represent only a special case of a much broader family of black holes with a free mass parameter. The regularity is achieved only at a specific mass value, and any deviation from the fine-tuned parameter inevitably results in curvature singularity. As a concrete example, we consider nonlinear electrodynamics (NLED) as matter sources. A new NLED theory is proposed that is a generalization of the Bardeen class and the Hayward class. New regular black holes and their singular counterparts are obtained. Significant distinctions between regular black holes and their singular counterparts are analyzed. These findings provide new insights into regular black holes.</description>

      <title>Scale-Dependent Suppression Functions and Functional Space Geometry in Renormalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the effects of a scale-dependent suppression function $\Omega(k, \Lambda)$ on the functional space geometry in renormalization theory. By introducing a dynamical cutoff scale $\Lambda$, the suppression function smoothly regulates high-momentum contributions without requiring a hard cutoff. We show that $\Omega(k, \Lambda)$ induces a modified metric on functional space, leading to a non-trivial Ricci curvature that becomes increasingly negative in the ultraviolet (UV) limit. This effect dynamically suppresses high-energy states, yielding a controlled deformation of the functional domain. Furthermore, we derive the renormalization group (RG) flow of $\Omega(k, \Lambda)$ and demonstrate its role in controlling the curvature flow of the functional space. The suppression function leads to spectral modifications that suggest an effective dimensional reduction at high energies, a feature relevant to functional space deformations and integral convergence in renormalization theory. Our findings provide a mathematical framework for studying regularization techniques and their role in the UV behavior of function spaces.</description>

      <title>On black holes in teleparallel torsion theories of gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We first present an overview of the Schwarzschild vacuum spacetime within general relativity, with particular emphasis on the role of scalar polynomial invariants and the null frame approach (and the related Cartan invariants), that justifies the conventional interpretation of the Schwarzschild geometry as a black hole spacetime admitting a horizon (at $r=2M$ in Schwarzschild coordinates) shielding a singular point at the origin. We then consider static spherical symmetric vacuum teleparallel spacetimes in which the torsion characterizes the geometry, and the scalar invariants of interest are those constructed from the torsion and its (covariant) derivatives. We investigate the Schwarzschild-like spacetime in the teleparallel equivalent of general relativity and find that the torsion scalar invariants (and, in particular, the scalar $T$) diverge at the putative ``Schwarzschild'' horizon. In this sense the resulting spacetime is {\em not} a black hole spacetime. We then briefly consider the Kerr-like solution in the teleparallel equivalent of general relativity and obtain a similar result. Finally, we investigate static spherically symmetric vacuum spacetimes within the more general $F(T)$ teleparallel gravity and show that if a such a geometry admits a horizon, then the torsion scalar $T$ necessarily diverges there; consequently in this sense such a geometry also does {\em not} represent a black hole.</description>

      <title>Boundary criticality for the Gross-Neveu-Yukawa models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the boundary criticality for the Gross-Neveu-Yukawa (GNY) models. Employing interacting Dirac fermions on a honeycomb lattice with armchair boundaries, we use mean-field theory to uncover rich boundary criticalities at the quantum phase transition to a charge-density-wave (CDW) insulator, including the ordinary, special, and extraordinary transitions. The Dirac fermions satisfy a Dirichlet boundary condition, while the boson field, representing the CDW order, obeys Dirichlet and Neumann conditions at the ordinary and special transitions, respectively, thereby enriching the critical GNY model. We develop a perturbative $4-\epsilon$ renormalization group approach to compute the boundary critical exponents. Our framework generalizes to other GNY universality class variants and provides theoretical predictions for experiments.</description>

      <title>Radiative corrections on vortical spin polarization in hot QCD matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the radiative corrections on spin polarization of relativistic fermions induced by vortical fields in thermal-equilibrium QCD matter at weak coupling. Such corrections stem from the self-energy gradients in quantum kinetic theory, which are further obtained by a more systematic and general approach through the Keldysh equation. By applying the hard-thermal-loop approximation, we obtain new corrections upon the spin-polarization spectrum and also the axial-charge current in connection to the axial/chiral vortical effect for massive quarks up to the leading order of the QCD coupling. Further influence on spin alignment of vector mesons from similar effects is also analyzed.</description>

      <title>Exploring Scalarized Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet Theories Through the Lens of Parametrized Post-Newtonian Formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore scalarized Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theories within the context of the Parameterized Post-Newtonian formalism, which serves as a robust framework for examining modifications to General Relativity that exhibit scalarization. This approach enables us to impose a variety of constraints on the parameter space, particularly focusing on the PPN parameters $\gamma$ and $\beta$. Our analysis reveals several significant bounds for each scalarized model, utilizing data from the Cassini mission, Lunar Laser Ranging, and the forthcoming BepiColombo mission, in conjunction with geodetic Very Long Baseline Interferometry measurements around the Sun. In particular, we conducted a combined analysis of the MESSENGER mission's precision measurements of Mercury's perihelion precession $\dot{\omega}$ alongside the Cassini constraints on $\gamma$, yielding intriguing limits for the Ricci-EGB model. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of the new post-Newtonian potential introduced by the Gauss-Bonnet term at fourth order, which necessitates an expanded formulation of the PPN parameters. This highlights that the parameter $\beta$ exhibits different effects when analyzing the Ricci-EGB model. Additional constraints are derived from this framework by estimating the $\gamma$ PPN parameter using data from strong-lensing galaxy systems.</description>

      <title>Exploring new variational quantum circuit ansatzes for solving $SU(2)$ matrix models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we explored and experimented with new forms of parameterized quantum circuits to be used as variational ansatzes for solving the bosonic and supersymmetric $SU(2)$ matrix models at different couplings using the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm. Working with IBM Qiskit quantum computing platform, we show that two types of quantum circuits named \texttt{TwoLocal} and \texttt{EvolvedOperatorAnsatz} can outperform the popular \texttt{EfficientSU2} circuits which have been routinely used in the recent quantum physics literature to run VQE. With their more customizable constructions that allow for more flexibility beyond choosing the types of parameterized rotation gates, both types of new circuit ansatzes used in this work have led to performances that are either better than or at least comparable to \texttt{EfficientSU2} in the setting of $SU(2)$ matrix models. In particular, in the strong coupling regimes of the bosonic model, both \texttt{TwoLocal} and \texttt{EvolvedOperatorAnsatz} circuits provided a better approximation to the exact ground states, while in the supersymmetric model, shallow \texttt{EvolvedOperatorAnsatz} circuits with small a number of parameters, attained a comparable albeit not as good performance as the much deeper \texttt{EfficientSU2} circuits with around 8 to 9 times more parameters. The results of this work demonstrate conclusively the potential of \texttt{TwoLocal} and \texttt{EvolvedOperatorAnsatz} quantum circuits as efficient new types of variational ansatzes that should be considered more frequently in future VQE studies of quantum physics systems.</description>

      <title>Spectral properties and spin alignment of $\phi$ meson in QCD Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the spin alignment of a vector meson is predicted to be correlated with its spectral properties, we study the spectral properties of the $\phi$ meson using two microscopic Lagrangians based either on chiral effective field theory or the quark-meson model. We calculate the self-energies and spectral functions of the $\phi$ meson for these two Lagrangians at the one-loop level within the Matsubara formalism of finite-temperature quantum field theory, employing various parameters to represent different physical scenarios. Using these spectral functions, transport coefficients related to the spin alignment and tensor polarization are obtained, connecting the spin alignment of the $\phi$ meson to hydrodynamic gradients. Using the standard freeze-out picture within the relativistic hydrodynamic model, we explore how the possible pattern of the spin alignment can be generated using these microscopically calculated spectral functions. We discover that, with certain assumptions, these simple microscopic model-based calculations can produce sizable spin alignments with a sign-flipping behavior in their $p_T$ and centrality dependence, similar to those observed in experiments.</description>

Abstract: The theory of particle scattering is concerned with transition amplitudes between states that belong to unitary representations of the Poincar\'e group. The latter acts as the isometry group of Minkowski spacetime $\mathbb{M}$, making natural the introduction of relativistic tensor fields encoding the particles of interest. Since the Poincar\'e group also acts as a group of conformal isometries of null infinity $\mathcal{I}$, massless particles can also be very naturally encoded into Carrollian conformal fields living on $\mathcal{I}$. In this work we classify the two- and three-point correlation functions such Carrollian conformal fields can have in any consistent quantum theory of massless particles and arbitrary dimension. We then show that bulk correlators of massless fields in $\mathbb{M}$ explicitly reduce to these Carrollian conformal correlators when evaluated on $\mathcal{I}$, although in the case of time-ordered bulk correlators this procedure appears singular at first sight. However we show that the Carrollian correlators of the descendant fields are perfectly regular and precisely carry the information about the corresponding S-matrix elements.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-Scalar Field as a Possible Candidate for Phantom Field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11598v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate the existence of a single pseudo-scalar (PS) field in the mathematically backed and parity preserving modifications of the standard St${\ddot u}$ckelberg formalism (SSF) in the context of the Lagrangian formulation of the (i) two (1 + 1)-dimensional (2D) massive Abelian 1-form gauge theory, (ii) three (2 + 1)-dimensional (3D) massive Abelian 2-form gauge theory, and (iii) four (3 + 1)-dimensional (4D) massive Abelian 3-form gauge theory. This PS field always turns-up with the (i) negative kinetic term, and (ii) higher order derivative terms. The latter terms are rendered into the well-defined terms due to the imposition of the on-shell condition for the PS field which is derived from the properly gauge-fixed Lagrangian densities for the above theories. These Lagrangian densities incorporate into themselves the (i) PS field with the negative kinetic term, and (ii) pure scalar field with the positive kinetic term. However, both these fields satisfy the Klein-Gordon (KG) equation of motion. The PS field (having the negative kinetic term and a well-defined mass) is one of the possible candidates for the ``phantom'' field which plays a crucial role in the cyclic, bouncing and self-accelerated cosmological models of the Universe. The ``exotic'' PS field also satisfies one of the criteria for being a possible candidate for dark matter</description>

      <title>QCD Axion Dark Matter in String Theory: Haloscopes and Helioscopes as Probes of the Landscape</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07143v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Laboratory experiments have the capacity to detect the QCD axion in the next decade, and precisely measure its mass, if it composes the majority of the dark matter. In type IIB string theory on Calabi-Yau threefolds in the geometric regime, the QCD axion mass, $m_a$, is strongly correlated with the topological Hodge number $h^{1,1}$. We compute $m_a$ in a scan of $185{,}965$ compactifications of type IIB string theory on toric hypersurface Calabi-Yau threefolds. We compute the range of $h^{1,1}$ probed by different experiments under the condition that the QCD axion can provide the observed dark matter density with minimal fine-tuning. Taking the experiments DMRadio, ADMX, MADMAX, and BREAD as indicative on different mass ranges, the $h^{1,1}$ distributions peak near $h^{1,1}=24.9, \ 65.4, \ 196.8,$ and $310.9,$ respectively. We furthermore conclude that, without severe fine tuning, detection of the QCD axion as dark matter \emph{at any mass} disfavours 80% of models with $h^{1,1} =491$, which is thought to have the most known Calabi-Yau threefolds. Measurement of the solar axion mass with IAXO is the dominant probe of all models with $h^{1,1}\gtrsim 250$. This study demonstrates the immense importance of axion detection in experimentally constraining the string landscape.</description>

Abstract: We analyze the analytic structure of correlators in the field theory dual to the quantum Ba\~{n}ados-Teitelboim-Zanelli (qBTZ) black hole, a braneworld model incorporating exact backreaction from quantum conformal matter. We first compute the quasi-normal mode (QNM) spectrum of operators with dimension $\Delta$ and spin $s=0,\pm 1/2$. The leading QNMs and their overtones display qualitatively different behavior depending on the branch of qBTZ solution, which corresponds to distinct CFT states: branch 1 is a conical singularity dressed with a horizon while branch 2 is a quantum-corrected BTZ black hole. Consequently, the relaxation of probe matter effectively differentiates the CFT states and identifies the corresponding bulk descriptions. We then turn to pole-skipping locations where Green's functions are not unique. At these points, frequency is proportional to temperature, but momentum exhibits complex temperature dependence due to quantum effects. Under the assumption that the pole-skipping point closest to the origin reflects quantum chaos, we infer the likely behavior of the quantum Lyapunov exponent and butterfly velocity in the dual theory. Finally, we examine pole collisions in complex momentum space, showing that quantum corrections imprint a unique signature on the analytic structure of the poles in retarded Green's functions, resulting in level-crossing phenomena that differ notably from the level-touching phenomena in the uncorrected BTZ geometry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08287v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gauge PDEs generalise the AKSZ construction when dealing with generic local gauge theories. Despite being very flexible and invariant, these geometrical objects are usually infinite-dimensional and are difficult to define explicitly, just like standard infinitely-prolonged PDEs. We propose a notion of a weak gauge PDE in which the nilpotency of the BRST differential is relaxed in a controllable way. In this approach a nontopological local gauge theory can be described in terms of a finite-dimensional geometrical object. Moreover, among the equivalent weak gauge PDEs describing a given system, a minimal one can usually be found and is unique in a certain sense. In the case of a Lagrangian system, the respective weak gauge PDE naturally arises from its weak presymplectic formulation. We prove that any weak gauge PDE determines the standard jet-bundle Batalin-Vilkovisky formulation of the underlying gauge theory, giving an unambiguous physical interpretation of these objects. The formalism is illustrated by a few examples, including the non-Lagrangian self-dual Yang-Mills theory and a finite jet-bundle. We also discuss possible applications of the approach to the characterisation of those infinite-dimensional gauge PDEs that correspond to local theories.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we study higher-derivative supersymmetric effective field theories focusing on the systematic procedure for the elimination of ghosts from the spectrum. Particular attention is paid to the auxiliary fields, for which the higher-derivative terms induce non-algebraic equations of motion. By employing field redefinitions or the reduction of order procedure (both in component and superfield language) we show that the auxiliary fields remain non-dynamical in the EFT and that on shell they give rise to both derivative and non-derivative corrections to the scalar action. These methods are applied to the search for a SUSY embedding of the DBI action and to the dimensional reduction of HD terms for the K\"ahler moduli in type IIB string compactifications.</description>

      <title>Dissipative dynamics of an open quantum battery in the BTZ spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09259v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider how charging performances of a quantum battery, modeled as a two-level system, are influenced by the presence of vacuum fluctuations of a quantum field satisfying the Dirichlet, transparent, and Neumann boundary conditions in the BTZ spacetime. The quantum battery is subjected to an external static driving which works as a charger. Meanwhile, the quantum field is assumed to be coupled to both longitudinal and transverse spin components of the quantum battery including decoherence and pure dephasing mechanisms. Charging and discharging dynamics of the quantum battery are derived by extending the previous open quantum system approach in the relativistic framework to this more general scenario including both the driving and multiple coupling. Analytic expressions for the time evolution of the energy stored are presented. We find that when the driving amplitude is stronger/weaker than the energy-level spacing of the quantum battery the pure dephasing dissipative coupling results in better/worse charging performances than the decoherence dissipative coupling case. We also find that higher Hawking temperature helps to improve the charging performance under certain conditions compared with the closed quantum buttery case, implying the feasibility of energy extraction from vacuum fluctuations in curved spacetime via dissipation in charging protocol. Different boundary conditions for quantum field may lead to different charging performance. Furthermore, we also address the charging stability by monitoring the energy behaviour after the charging protocol has been switched off. Our study presents a general framework to investigate relaxation effects in curved spacetime, and reveals how spacetime properties and field boundary condition affect the charging process, which in turn may shed light on the exploration of the spacetime properties and thermodynamics via the charging protocol.</description>

      <title>Complex D($2,1;\zeta $) and spin chain solutions from Chern-Simons theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14862v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using properties of OSp(4|2) and PSL(2|2), we investigate the super geometry of the parametric D($2,1;\zeta $) labeled by variable $\zeta $ belonging to $\mathbb{C}\backslash \{-1,0\}$ and we give applications in the study of integrable superspin chains. This $9|8$ dimensional Lie supergroup has three orthogonal isospins in its even part SL($2,\mathbb{C}$)$^{\otimes 3}$ assembled by the tri-fundamental $2^{\otimes 3}$ with odd parity. It undergoes contractions at $\zeta =-1,0$ where an SL($2,\mathbb{C}$) gets decompactified into commutative $\mathbb{C}^{3}$ interpreted in terms of three central extensions. By help of the obtained characteristic features of D($2,1;\zeta $) and their local structures at the special points $\zeta =\pm 1$, we calculate the Lax operator $\mathcal{L}_{\mathfrak{d}(2,1;\zeta )}^{(\mathfrak{\eta})}$ solving the RLL equation describing the integrability of the superspin chain $\mathfrak{d}$($2,1;\zeta $). We also complete missing results regarding the calculation of $\mathcal{L}_{psl(2|2)}^{(\mathfrak{\mu })}$ and $\mathcal{L}_{osp(4|2)}^{(\mathfrak{\mu})}$. Other features of the four super Dynkin diagrams $S\mathfrak{DD}_{\mathfrak{d}(2,1;\zeta )}^{(\mathfrak{\eta})}$ and weight graphs of $\mathfrak{d}$($2,1;\zeta $) as well as discrete automorphisms are also given.</description>

Abstract: We consider the massless Rarita-Schwinger (RS) LV QED. In this theory, we introduce the gauge fixing to obtain the propagator for the RS field, and calculate the Carroll-Field-Jackiw term, which turns out to be finite and ambiguous, and only in one calculation scheme, based on the nonlinear gauge framework, the gauge independence of the result is achieved.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07580v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: New rotating dilaton black hole and black string solutions in three spacetime dimensions are obtained. The background spacetime interpolates between Anti-de Sitter and a (an asymptotically) flat spacetime. The new black strings are characterized by their masses, angular momenta and axion charges. The uncharged black string solutions have only a single horizon. They contain a curvature singularity enclosed inside their horizons. Thus, they are also black hole solutions of Einstein-scalar gravity. On the other hand, the charged black string solutions have two horizons. They may or may not contain a curvature singularity depending on the ratio of their inner and outer horizons radii. When they contain a singularity, the singularity is either at or enclosed inside their inner horizons. We also obtain, in addition to the uncharged black strings, other new black hole solutions of Einstein-scalar gravity by applying duality transformation on the new charged black strings. The new black holes are described by their masses and angular momenta. We show that their angular momenta do not depend on their horizons radii. We also find that the masses of a class of the black holes can be made negative by adjusting, using the gauge ambiguity, the asymptotic value of the (independent component of the) Kalb-Ramond field in the dual black strings. We also discuss black hole and black string solutions with a curvature singularity at or beyond their outer or event horizons.</description>

      <title>Quantum Groups as Global Symmetries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.24142v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study quantum field theories which have quantum groups as global internal symmetries. We show that in such theories operators are generically non-local, and should be thought as living at the ends of topological lines. We describe the general constraints of the quantum group symmetry, given by Ward identities, that correlation functions of the theory should satisfy. We also show that generators of the symmetry can be represented by topological lines with some novel properties. We then discuss a particular example of $U_q(sl_2)$ symmetric CFT, which we solve using the bootstrap techniques and relying on the symmetry. We finally show strong evidence that for a special value of $q$ a subsector of this theory reproduces the fermionic formulation of the Ising model. This suggests that a quantum group can act on local operators as well, however, it generically transforms them into non-local ones.</description>

      <title>Background ambiguity and the G\"odel double copy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04207v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the assumptions regarding spacetime backgrounds underlying the classical double copy. We argue (contrary to the norm) that single-copy fields naturally constructed on the original curved background metric are only interpretable on a flat metric when such a well-defined limit exists, for which Kerr--Schild coordinates offer a natural choice. As an explicit example where such a distinction matters, we initiate an exploration of single-copies for the G\"odel universe. This metric lacks a (geodesic) Kerr--Schild representation yet is Petrov type-D, meaning the technology of the ``Weyl double copy" may be utilized. The Weyl derived single copy has many desirable features, including matching the defining properties of the spacetime, and being sourced by the mixed Ricci tensor just as Kerr--Schild single copies are. To compare, we propose a sourced flat-space single-copy interpretation for the G\"odel metric by leveraging its symmetries, and find that this proposal lacks the defining properties of the spacetime, and is not consistent with the flat limit of our curved-space single copy. Notably, this inconsistency does not occur in Kerr--Schild metrics. Our curved-space single copy also lead to the same electromagnetic analogue of the G\"odel universe found separately through tidal force analogies, opening a new avenue of exploration between the double copy and gravitoelectromagnetism programs.</description>

      <title>Ensembles of center vortices and chains: Insights from a natural lattice framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04325v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A scenario to understand the asymptotic properties of confinement between quark probes, based on a 4D mixed ensemble of percolating center-vortex worldsurfaces and chains, was initially proposed by one of us in a non-Abelian setting. More recently, the same physics was reobtained by means of a Schr\"odinger wavefunctional peaked at Abelian-projected configurations, which deals with center-vortex lines and pointlike monopoles in real space. In this work, we formulate the Abelian-projected ensemble and reassess the non-Abelian one within the Weingarten lattice representation for the sum over surfaces. In the phase where worldsurfaces are stabilized by contact interactions and percolate, lattice gauge fields emerge. This generalizes the Goldstone modes in an Abelian loop condensate to the case where non-Abelian degrees of freedom are present. In this language, the different natural matching properties of elementary center-vortex worldsurfaces and monopole worldlines can be easily characterized. In the lattice, the Abelian setting also implements the original idea that the mixed ensemble reconciles $N$-ality with the formation of a confining flux tube. In this picture, center vortices and chains explain why Abelian-projected variables capture this property at asymptotic distances while simultaneously allowing for a 'dual superconductor' description of the fundamental string. Common features, differences in the continuum, and perspectives will also be addressed.</description>

      <title>Cryptographic tests of the python's lunch conjecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10527v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the AdS/CFT correspondence, a subregion of the CFT allows for the recovery of a corresponding subregion of the bulk known as its entanglement wedge. In some cases, an entanglement wedge contains a locally but not globally minimal surface homologous to the CFT subregion, in which case it is said to contain a python's lunch. It has been proposed that python's lunch geometries should be modelled by tensor networks that feature projective operations where the wedge narrows. This model leads to the python's lunch (PL) conjecture, which asserts that reconstructing information from past the locally minimal surface is computationally difficult. In this work, we use cryptographic tools related to a primitive known as the Conditional Disclosure of Secrets (CDS) to develop consequences of the projective tensor network model that can be checked directly in AdS/CFT. We argue from the tensor network picture that the mutual information between appropriate CFT subregions is lower bounded linearly by an area difference associated with the geometry of the lunch. Recalling that the mutual information is also computed by bulk extremal surfaces, this gives a checkable geometrical consequence of the tensor network model. We prove weakened versions of this geometrical statement in asymptotically AdS$_{2+1}$ spacetimes satisfying the null energy condition, and confirm it in some example geometries, supporting the tensor network model and by proxy the PL conjecture.</description>

      <title>SymTFT Approach to 2D Orbifold Groupoids: `t Hooft Anomalies, Gauging, and Partition Functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18056v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use the 3D SymTFT approach to study the generalized symmetries and partition functions of 2D CFTs in various orbifolded and fermionic phases. These phases can be realized by the sandwich construction in the associated 3D SymTFTs with different gaped boundaries that encode the data of symmetries in the 2D CFTs. We demonstrate that the gaped boundaries can all be identified with the (fermionic) Lagrangian algebra in the 3D SymTFT, and thus use them to establish webs of dualities of the boundary CFTs in different phases on the level of partition functions. In addition, we introduce the concept of ``para-fermionic Lagrangian algebra" which enables us to construct the partition functions of para-fermionized CFTs on the 2D boundary. Finally, we provide many important examples, including a 3D SymTFT viewpoint on gauging non-invertible symmetries in 2D CFTs.</description>

Abstract: Consider a renormalization group flow preserving a pre-modular fusion category $\mathcal S_1$. If it flows to a rational conformal field theory, the surviving symmetry $\mathcal S_1$ flows to a pre-modular fusion category $\mathcal S_2$ with monoidal functor $F:\mathcal S_1\to\mathcal S_2$. By clarifying mathematical (especially category theoretical) meaning of renormalization group domain wall/interface or boundary condition, we find the hidden extended vertex operator (super)algebra gives a unique (up to braided equivalence) completely $(\mathcal S_1\boxtimes\mathcal S_2)'$-anisotropic representative of the Witt equivalence class $[\mathcal S_1\boxtimes\mathcal S_2]$. The mathematical conjecture is supported physically, and passes various tests in concrete examples including non/unitary minimal models, and Wess-Zumino-Witten models. In particular, the conjecture holds beyond diagonal cosets.
  The picture also establishes the conjectured half-integer condition, which fixes infrared conformal dimensions mod $\frac12$. It further leads to the double braiding relation, namely braiding structures jump at conformal fixed points. As an application, we solve the flow from the $E$-type minimal model $(A_{10},E_6)\to M(4,3)$.</description>

      <title>QG from SymQRG: AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$ Correspondence as Topological Symmetry-Preserving Quantum RG Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12045v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By analyzing the non-perturbative RG flows that explicitly preserve given symmetries, we demonstrate that they can be expressed as quantum path integrals of the $\textit{SymTFT}$ in one higher dimension. When the symmetries involved include Virasoro defect lines, such as in the case of $T\bar{T}$ deformations, the RG flow corresponds to the 3D quantum gravitational path integral. For each 2D CFT, we identify a corresponding ground state of the SymTFT, from which the Wheeler-DeWitt equation naturally emerges as a non-perturbative constraint. These observations are summarized in the slogan: $\textbf{SymQRG = QG}$. The recently proposed exact discrete formulation of Liouville theory in [1] allows us to identify a universal SymQRG kernel, constructed from quantum $6j$ symbols associated with $U_q(SL(2,\mathbb{R}))$. This kernel is directly related to the quantum path integral of the Virasoro TQFT, and manifests itself as an exact and analytical 3D background-independent MERA-type holographic tensor network. Many aspects of the AdS/CFT correspondence, including the factorization puzzle, admit a natural interpretation within this framework. This provides the first evidence suggesting that there is a universal holographic principle encompassing AdS/CFT and topological holography. We propose that the non-perturbative AdS/CFT correspondence is a $\textit{maximal}$ form of topological holography.</description>

Abstract: We prove a conjectured relation between the energy-momentum and the displacement norm of superconformal defects. The proof completes earlier results, and shows that supersymmetry identifies two natural notions of brane tension in Anti-de Sitter gravity. As a byproduct we show that a modification of the energy-momentum tensor that removes the stress of static superconformal defects, ensures also that the radiation these emit obeys the Null Energy Condition. This sheds new light on the radiation-reaction problem for moving charges.</description>

We consider two types of $T^7/Z_2^3$ orbifolds which, with appropriate flux choices, yield integer dual dimensions for the operators corresponding to the closed string scalar fields in the dual CFT. As with all other known examples, the dual conformal dimensions are only parametrically close to integer values.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08986v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a mechanism of symmetry breaking or restoration that can occur in the middle of inflation due to the coupling of the Gauss-Bonnet term to a charged scalar. The Gauss-Bonnet coupling results in an inflaton-dependent effective squared mass of the charged scalar, which can change its sign (around the symmetric point) during inflation. This can lead to spontaneous breaking of the symmetry, or to its restoration, if it is initially broken. We show the conditions under which the backreaction of the Gauss-Bonnet coupling on the inflationary background is negligible, such that the predictions of a given inflationary model are unaffected by the symmetry breaking/restoration process.</description>

Abstract: By taking large mass and charge limit of a black hole in string theory we can create arbitrarily large regions where the space-time is approximately flat, but the moduli fields take values different from their asymptotic values. In this paper we describe a special case of this where black hole solutions in a four dimensional string theory, in the large mass and charge limit, can have an arbitrarily large region outside the horizon where a local observer will experience type IIA string theory in flat ten dimensional space-time. The curvature and other field strengths remain small everywhere between the asymptotic four dimensional observer and the ten dimensional region. By going to a different region of space, we can also get a large region where a local observer experiences M-theory in flat eleven dimensional space-time. By taking another solution in the same theory, one can create an arbitrarily large region where a local observer will experience type IIB string theory in flat ten dimensional space-time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04892v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explicitly compute correlation functions with the insertion of a continuous symmetry defect in bosonic field theories. To recover the expected action, the definition of the defect must be modified to include a specific contact term. This can be regarded as a singular background gauge field for the global symmetry. It can be traced to the definition of the generating functional for current correlators, where the source is akin to a background gauge field for the symmetry. For holographic theories, it has been proposed that continuous symmetry defects are realized in terms of non-BPS $D(q-1)$ branes. We argue that these can be regarded as $Dq/\overline{Dq}$ system and show its application to the case of the baryonic symmetry in the Klebanov-Witten theory. The $Dq/\overline{Dq}$ can be regarded as a particular regularization of the defect, holographically realizing the field theory discussion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07040v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the Yang-Baxter (YB) deformed backgrounds of the Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) model based on the $H_{_{4}}$ Lie group can be considered as solutions of the generalized supergravity equations (GSEs). Then, by applying the Poisson-Lie T-duality in the presence of spectator fields, we obtain the non-Abelian target space duals of those models. It is shown that all dual models (except for one model) are integrable and most interestingly, they satisfy the GSEs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10469v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel machine learning based framework for discovering integrable models. Our approach first employs a synchronized ensemble of neural networks to find high-precision numerical solution to the Yang-Baxter equation within a specified class. Then, using an auxiliary system of algebraic equations, [Q_2, Q_3] = 0, and the numerical value of the Hamiltonian obtained via deep learning as a seed, we reconstruct the entire Hamiltonian family, forming an algebraic variety. We illustrate our presentation with three- and four-dimensional spin chains of difference form with local interactions. Remarkably, all discovered Hamiltonian families form rational varieties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08093v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Anomaly analysis has been an important and powerful tool in studying nonperturbative physics for decades. The anomaly inflow mechanism provides an intuitive interpretation of the bulk-boundary correspondence in topological systems. In this work, we study global anomalies of nonlocal effective theories that supposedly describe symmetry-preserving Luttinger surfaces, i.e. the manifolds of fermionic Green's function zeros in the momentum space at zero energy. We view the nonlocal effective theories including the simplest Lagrangian and its two-pole variant associated with a gapless Dirac zero as a result of integrating out some low energy states. Assuming that the states integrated out do not make extra contributions to the anomaly, we discuss the global anomaly, the bulk-boundary correspondence, and the constraint on possible phases, such as non-Fermi liquids and emergent gapless quasiparticles on Luttinger surfaces. We also provide some perspectives on why the nonlocal fermionic effective theory studied by Golterman and Shamir (arXiv: 2311.12790) is not a suitable starting point for a symmetrically gapped phase.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09610v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Real 3-manifold triangulations can be uniquely represented by isomorphism signatures. Databases of these isomorphism signatures are generated for a variety of 3-manifolds and knot complements, using SnapPy and Regina, then these language-like inputs are used to train various machine learning architectures to differentiate the manifolds, as well as their Dehn surgeries, via their triangulations. Gradient saliency analysis then extracts key parts of this language-like encoding scheme from the trained models. The isomorphism signature databases are taken from the 3-manifolds' Pachner graphs, which are also generated in bulk for some selected manifolds of focus and for the subset of the SnapPy orientable cusped census with $&lt;8$ initial tetrahedra. These Pachner graphs are further analysed through the lens of network science to identify new structure in the triangulation representation; in particular for the hyperbolic case, a relation between the length of the shortest geodesic (systole) and the size of the Pachner graph's ball is observed.</description>

      <title>Obtaining the Radiated Gravitational Wave Energy via Relativistic Kinetic Theory: A Kinetic Gas Model of an Idealized Coalescing Binary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13917v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The final pulse of gravitational wave emission is released in the chirp phase of binary coalescence. This proposes that the radiated energy of the GW is proportional to the chirp mass $\mathcal{M}$, with detection reports revealing the approximate scaling of $E_{\mathrm{GW}}\approx\mathcal{M}/10$. While this scaling is evident in numerical relativity, there lacks an analytical expression supporting the relation. This study utilizes a heuristic application of relativistic kinetic theory and massless Bose-Einstein statistics for a Brownian graviton gas to GW formation throughout binary coalescence. This approach to GW formation obtains an expression of an effective thermal energy as the radiated GW energy, which extracts the nearly one-tenth scaling of the chirp mass, namely at the chirp phase. Furthermore, it agrees well with the detected energies with 1:1 ratio values ranging from 0.932 for GW150914 to 0.998 for one of three waveform models of GW190521, with 0.851 as an outlier for GW170104. Establishing a quantum-classical correspondence in this regard enables discussion of equilibrium noise analysis on the graviton gas as well as its kinetic characteristics during and after coalescence. The latter topic includes, but is not limited to, GW/graviton wave-particle duality, a calculation of the high-energy graviton-graviton total cross section at peak wave emission as 1.16\% of the chirp mass surface area $A=16\pi G^2\mathcal{M}^2$, and humoring the thought experiment of black hole gravitons.</description>

      <title>The Gravitational Form Factors of Hadrons from CFT in Momentum Space and the Dilaton in Perturbative QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05609v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the hard scattering amplitude of the gravitational form factors (GFFs) of hadrons at one-loop, in relation to their conformal field theory (CFT) description, within the framework of QCD factorization for hard exclusive processes at large momentum transfers. These form factors play an essential role in studying the quark and gluon angular momentum of the hadrons due to their relation to the Mellin moments of the Deeply Virtual Compton Scattering (DVCS) invariant amplitudes. Our analysis is performed using a diffeomorphism invariant approach, applying the formalism of the gravitational effective action and conformal symmetry in momentum space for the discussion of the quark and gluon contributions. The interpolating correlator in the hard scattering of any GFF is the non-Abelian $TJJ$ (stress-energy/gluon/gluon) 3-point function at $O(\alpha_s^2)$, revealing an effective dilaton interaction in the $t$-channel due to the trace anomaly, in the form of a massless anomaly pole in the QCD hard scattering. We investigate the role of quarks, gauge-fixing and ghost contributions in the reconstruction of the hard scattering amplitude mediated by this interaction, performed in terms of its transverse traceless, longitudinal, and trace decomposition, as identified from CFT in momentum space (CFT$_p$). We present a convenient parameterization of the hard scattering amplitude relevant for future experimental investigations of the DVCS/GFF amplitudes at the Electron-Ion Collider at BNL.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11896v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The geodesics of Kerr's metric are described by the four-dimensional Hamiltonian dynamics integrable in the Arnold-Liouville sense. It can be reduced to two-dimensional one by the use of Fermat's principle. The resulting Hamiltonian is, however, rather complicated. We show how one can apply the coupling constant metamorphosis to simplify the Hamiltonian to the one quadratic in momenta and depending on the initial "energy" as parameter. It describes a simple dynamics of two non-linear oscillators and can be integrated directly or evaluated in the framework of perturbation theory by adopting the elegant Lindstedt--Poincar\'e algorithm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03094v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the linear response of a near-equilibrium charged relativistic gas in the presence of electromagnetic and gravitational field in a generic stationary spacetime up to the second order of relaxation time and calculate the tensorial kinetic coefficients introduced by the presence of the strong electromagnetic and/or gravitational field. Using the covariant transfer equations thus developed, a covariant heat equation governing the relativistic heat conduction is derived, which, in Minkowski spacetime, reduces into a form which is remarkably similar to the well-known Cattaneo equation but with a different sign in front of the second-order time derivative term. We also perform a comparative analysis on the different behaviors of our heat equation and the Cattaneo equation in Minkowski spacetime. Furthermore, the effect of gravity on the heat conduction predicted by our heat equation is illustrated around Schwarzschild black hole, which makes a sharp contrast to the Minkowski case.</description>

      <title>Nonsingular black holes and spherically symmetric objects in nonlinear electrodynamics with a scalar field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04754v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In general relativity with vector and scalar fields given by the Lagrangian ${\cal L}(F,\phi,X)$, where $F$ is a Maxwell term and $X$ is a kinetic term of the scalar field $\phi$, we study the linear stability of static and spherically symmetric objects without curvature singularities at their centers. We show that the background solutions are generally described by either purely electrically or magnetically charged objects with a nontrivial scalar-field profile. In theories with the Lagrangian $\tilde{{\cal L}}(F)+K(\phi, X)$, which correspond to nonlinear electrodynamics with a k-essence scalar field, angular Laplacian instabilities induced by vector-field perturbations exclude all the regular spherically symmetric solutions including nonsingular black holes. In theories described by the Lagrangian ${\cal L}=X+\mu(\phi)F^n$, where $\mu$ is a function of $\phi$ and $n$ is a constant, the absence of angular Laplacian instabilities of spherically symmetric objects requires that $n&gt;1/2$, under which nonsingular black holes with apparent horizons are not present. However, for some particular ranges of $n$, there are horizonless compact objects with neither ghosts nor Laplacian instabilities in the small-scale limit. In theories given by ${\cal L}=X \kappa (F)$, where $\kappa$ is a function of $F$, regular spherically symmetric objects are prone to Laplacian instabilities either around the center or at spatial infinity. Thus, in our theoretical framework, we do not find any example of linearly stable nonsingular black holes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15180v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the Page curve and resolving the black hole information puzzle in terms of the entanglement dynamics of black holes has been a key question in fundamental physics. In principle, the current quantum computing can provide insights into the entanglement dynamics of black holes within some simplified models. In this regard, we utilize quantum computers to investigate the entropy of Hawking radiation using the qubit transport model, a toy qubit model of black hole evaporation. Specifically, we implement the quantum simulation of the scrambling dynamics in black holes using an efficient random unitary circuit. Furthermore, we employ the swap-based many-body interference protocol for the first time and the randomized measurement protocol to measure the entanglement entropy of Hawking radiation qubits in IBM's superconducting quantum computers. Our findings indicate that while both entanglement entropy measurement protocols accurately estimate the R\'enyi entropy in numerical simulation, the randomized measurement protocol has a particular advantage over the swap-based many-body interference protocol in IBM's superconducting quantum computers. Finally, by incorporating quantum error mitigation techniques, we establish that the current quantum computers are robust tools for measuring the entanglement entropy of complex quantum systems and can probe black hole dynamics within simplified toy qubit models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20474v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the analogy between graviton emission and absorption in a thermal radiation environment and the laser mechanism, in which photons of the same momentum and polarization are amplified. Using interaction-picture perturbation theory, we analyze the time evolution of the graviton number operator and its expectation value in a squeezed vacuum state, which characterizes the inflationary graviton state. First, we examine this effect in a thermal bath in a Minkowski background and find that emission or absorption occurs depending on the initial squeezing parameters. As a thought experiment, we consider LIGO/Virgo-like detectors immersed in a radiation environment at temperatures of ${O}(0.1)$ GeV. In this scenario, graviton numbers at frequencies of ${O}(100)$ Hz could be enhanced, suggesting a possible mechanism for amplifying gravitational wave signals. While this setup is beyond current experimental capabilities, it highlights potential advancements in gravitational wave detection. The significant effect observed in a flat background implies a backreaction of the thermal bath on spacetime. Thus, understanding this effect in an expanding universe is essential. During the radiation-dominated era of the early universe, gravitons within the horizon at reheating undergo stimulated absorption. We find a secular logarithmic growth for the superhorizon mode, leading to the breakdown of perturbative analysis, which requires further investigation in future.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the universal thermodynamic topological classes of a family of black holes in a perfect fluid dark matter (PFDM) background. Recent research on black hole thermodynamics suggests that all black holes can be classified into four universal thermodynamic classes, denoted by $W^{1-}$, $W^{0+}$, $W^{0-}$, and $W^{1+}$. Our study reveals that the Schwarzschild black hole in PFDM belongs to the $W^{1-}$ class, and independence of black hole size thermodynamically unstable at both low- and high-temperature limits. The Reissner-Nordstr\"om, Kerr, and Kerr-Newman black holes in the PFDM background belong to the same universal thermodynamic class, $W^{0+}$, which represents small, stable black holes and large, unstable black holes at low-temperature limits, whereas no black hole state exists at high temperatures. The AdS black holes behave differently compared to their counterparts in PFDM. The Schwarzschild-AdS black hole belongs to the $W^{0-}$ class, indicating no black hole state at low temperatures, but small, unstable and large, stable black hole states at high temperatures. Furthermore, the Kerr-AdS black hole belongs to the $W^{1+}$ class, characterized by small, stable black holes at low temperatures, large, stable black holes at high temperatures, and unstable, intermediate-sized black holes at both low and high temperatures. These findings uncover the universal topological classifications underlying black hole thermodynamics, offering profound insights into the fundamental principles of quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>$\mathbb{Z}_2$-gauging and self-dualities of the $XX$ model and its cousins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01831v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the one-dimensional $XX$ lattice model and its cousins through the lens of momentum and winding $U(1)$ symmetries. We distinguish two closely related $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetries based on their relation to the $U(1)$ symmetries, and establish a web of $\mathbb{Z}_2$-gauging relations among these models, rooted in two fundamental seeds: the $ XY \pm YX$ models. These two seeds, each self-dual under gauging of the respective $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetries, possess manifestly symmetric conserved charges, making transparent the connection between the noninvertible symmetries and the Kramers-Wannier duality. By leveraging the self-dualities of these two seed models, we derive the self-dualities of their cousins, including the $XX$ model and the Levin-Gu model, through appropriate gauging procedures. Moreover, under these gauging schemes, the lattice T-duality matrices take the form of the identity matrix. Finally, we unify the mapping structures of local conserved charges across these models, providing a comprehensive framework for understanding their symmetries and dualities.</description>

      <title>Inverse bubbles from broken supersymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01951v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Building upon the recent findings regarding inverse phase transitions in the early universe, we present the first natural realisation of this phenomenon within a supersymmetry-breaking sector. We demonstrate that inverse hydrodynamics, which is characterized by the fluid being aspirated by the bubble wall rather than being pushed or dragged, is actually not limited to a phase of (re)heating but can also occur within the standard cooling cosmology. Through a numerical analysis of the phase transition, we establish a simple and generic criterion to determine its hydrodynamics based on the generalised pseudo-trace. Our results provide a proof of principle highlighting the need to account for these new fluid solutions when considering cosmological phase transitions and their phenomenological implications.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative asymptotics of the eigenvalues of the spheroidal equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06780v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: New non-perturbative results on the eigenvalues of the spheroidal equation are presented. The results, found using an all orders WKB analysis, include a perturbative/non-perturbative (P/NP) relation as well as the first exponential correction to the perturbative series which is valid in certain regions of parameters. The quantum periods are also computed.</description>

      <title>Basis light-front quantization for the $\Lambda_b$ and $\Sigma_b$ baryons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10026v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Within the basis light-front quantization framework, we compute the masses and light-front wave functions of the $\Lambda_b$ baryon and its isospin triplet counterparts $\Sigma_b^+$, $\Sigma_b^0$, and $\Sigma_b^-$ using a light-front effective Hamiltonian in the leading Fock sector. These wave functions are obtained as eigenstates of the effective Hamiltonian, which incorporates the one-gluon exchange interaction with fixed coupling and a three-dimensional confinement potential. With the quark masses and the couplings as adjustable parameters, the computed masses are set within the experimental range. The resulting predictions for their electromagnetic properties align well with other theoretical calculations. Additionally, the parton distribution functions (PDFs) of these baryons are obtained for the first time, with gluon and sea quark distributions dynamically generated through QCD evolution of the valence quark PDFs.</description>
