      <title>Model Theory of General von Neumann Algebras I: Generalized Ocneanu Ultraproducts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper collates, presents, and expands upon technology and results obtained as part of the author's PhD thesis. We generalize work done in the $\sigma$-finite setting by the author, Goldbring, Hart, and Sinclair by producing a language and axiomatization of full left Hilbert algebras. To improve the accessibility of using this axiomatization, we examine the metric structure ultraproduct associated to this axiomatization. In doing so, we generalize results of Ando-Haagerup and Masuda-Tomatsu. This examination leads us to multiple operator-algebraic characterizations of the ultraproduct which closely resemble known characterizations of the Ocneanu ultraproduct. One of these is closely related to the notion of continuous elements of an ultraproduct with respect to an action. In the spirit of results of the author, Goldbring, and Hart, we prove various undecidable universal theory results for von Neumann algebras with unbounded weights. Notably, we prove that the hyperfinite II$_\infty$ factor together with its canonical tracial weight has an undecidable theory. This result was expected by experts, but could not be made precise until now. We also study the strengthenings of the negative solution to CEP that this result implies.</description>

      <title>The action of an inverse semigroup on its Stone-\v{C}ech compactification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We initiate the study of the Stone-\v{C}ech transformation groupoid $\mathcal{G} = \mathcal{S}\ltimes\beta\mathcal{S}$ of an inverse semigroup $\mathcal{S}$. This groupoid occurs as a model for the inverse semigroup Roe algebra $\mathcal{R}_{\mathcal{S}}$ of Lledo and Martinez; in particular, the action of $\mathcal{S}$ on $\beta\mathcal{S}$ is amenable in the sense of Exel and Starling if and only if the reduced C$^*$-algebra $\text{C}^*_r(\mathcal{S})$ is exact. We prove that the properties of being Hausdorff, principal, and effective are all equivalent for $\mathcal{G}$, and give an algebraic condition on $\mathcal{S}$ equivalent to the Hausdorffness of $\mathcal{G}$. Finally, we show that the Hausdorffness of Exel's tight groupoid $\mathcal{G}_{\text{tight}}(\mathcal{S})$ is necessary for the Hausdorffness of $\mathcal{G}$.</description>

      <title>Consonant inverse semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study necessary and sufficient conditions for two inverse semigroups to possess identical tight groupoids from the point of view of their algebraic, topological, and spectral order structures. The spectral order is a partial order relation that presents itself very naturally on the tight groupoid of an inverse semigroup and is related to the subtle difference between tight filters and ultra-filters. Up to a small glitch, the spectral order makes tight groupoids into ordered groupoids in Ehresmann's sense.
  We introduce the notions of tight injectivity and tight surjectivity for inverse semigroup homomorphisms and show that, together, they provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the induced map to be an isomorphism of ordered topological groupoids. A homomorphism is then called a consonance provided these conditions are met.
  A consonance is not necessarily injective or surjective, so it is likely not an invertible map. Due to this fact, the existence of a consonance between inverse semigroups does not define an equivalence relation, so we consider instead the equivalence relation it generates. When it applies to a pair of inverse semigroups we say that they are consonant.
  The first main result of the paper shows that two inverse semigroups $S_1$ and $S_2$ are consonant if and only if their tight groupoids are isomorphic as ordered topological groupoids, if and only if there exists another inverse semigroup $T$ and consonances from each $S_i$ to $T$.
  We also prove that, given an inverse semigroup $S$, there exists a largest inverse semigroup consonant to $S$, denoted $S^\tau$, and called the tight envelope of $S$. In a nutshell, $S^\tau$ is the inverse semigroup formed by the compact up-slices (i.e.~slices that are up-sets relative to the spectral order) in the tight groupoid of $S$. Among other thi ...

      <title>Weak relative Dixmier property and Popa's intertwining technique for type III subfactors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let \( A \subset M \) be an inclusion of von Neumann algebras equipped with a faithful normal semifinite operator valued weight \( E \colon M \to A \). We prove that every positive element \( x \in M \) with \( E(x) &lt; \infty \) satisfies the weak Dixmier property relative to \( A \): the \( \sigma \)-weak closure of the convex hull of its unitary orbit under \( \mathcal{U}(A) \) intersects the relative commutant \( A' \cap M \). This extends Marrakchi's result for the case of conditional expectations. We apply this result to obtain new structural theorems for type III factors, including a reformulation of Popa's intertwining criterion without tracial assumptions, an extension of Ozawa's relative solidity theorem to the type III setting, and a Galois-type correspondence for crossed products by totally disconnected groups. The last result resolves a question posed by Boutonnet and Brothier regarding the structure of intermediate subfactors.</description>

      <title>Comment on 'Gauge networks in noncommutative geometry'</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The article (Gauge networks in noncommutative geometry, J. Geom. Phys. 75 : 71--91, 2014) that motivates this comment provides, in particular, one answer to the following natural question: what is noncommutative geometry on a lattice? In the context of spectral triples, Marcolli and van Suijlekom define in op. cit. a Dirac operator on the lattice and identify the corresponding Spectral Action with the lattice Yang-Mills--Higgs system. In this comment we show that the continuum limit of this theory is the Yang-Mills action functional, without a Higgs scalar.
  R\'esum\'e: Qu'est-ce que la g\'eom\'etrie non-commutative sur r\'eseau ? \`A cette question l'article ici comment\'e (Gauge networks in noncommutative geometry, J. Geom. Phys. 75 : 71--91, 2014) apporte une des r\'eponses possibles. Marcolli et van Suijlekom, travaillant dans le contexte des triplets spectraux, y construisent un op\'erateur de type Dirac pour le r\'eseau et d\'erivent une th\'eorie sur r\'eseau de type Yang-Mills--Higgs \`a partir de l'Action Spectrale. Ce commentaire montre que la limite continue de ce mod\`ele est la th\'eorie pure de Yang-Mills (sans aucun Higgs).</description>

      <title>Interfaces of discrete systems - spectral and index properties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a general mathematical framework to study mixtures of different physical systems brought together on a discrete interface. Adapting work by M\u{a}ntoiu et al., we use an operator algebraic framework such that the bulk systems at infinity of the mixture are recovered via the spatial asymptotics of the operators on the interface. Fixing an asymptotics and interface algebra, we show how the essential spectrum and topological properties can be inferred from the bulk systems at infinity. By working with Hilbert $C^*$-modules, we can further refine these results with respect to an ambient algebra of observables.</description>

      <title>Hilbert transforms on Coxeter groups and groups acting on buildings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study Hilbert transforms and their boundedness on $L_p$-spaces associated with Coxeter groups and groups acting on buildings. We establish new models for Hilbert transforms on these groups through the geometric objects they act on, and we show that these Hilbert transforms satisfy a Cotlar identity which was developed in earlier work of Mei and Ricard, and that of Gonz\'alez-P\'erez, Parcet and the second named author, thus conclude the $L_p$-boundedness. We manage to solve the problem firstly for the case when the Coxeter group satisfies a certain nested condition, and then extend it to any finitely generated Coxeter groups and groups that admit actions on buildings satisfying the nested condition. Our results give the first example of groups with property (F$\mathbb{R}$) on which $L_p$-bounded Hilbert transforms can be defined, and generalize the work of Gonz\'alez-P\'erez, Parcet and the second named author for groups acting on simplicial trees.</description>

      <title>Brown measure of the sum of an elliptic operator and a free random variable in a finite von Neumann algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.09844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.09844v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given an $n\times n$ random matrix $X_n$ with i.i.d. entries of unit variance, the circular law says that the empirical spectral distribution (ESD) of $X_n/\sqrt{n}$ converges to the uniform measure on the unit disk. Let $M_n$ be a deterministic matrix that converges in $*$-moments to an operator ${x}$. It is known from the work by \'{S}niady and Tao--Vu that the ESD of $X_n/\sqrt{n}+M_n$ converges to the Brown measure of ${x}+c$, where $c$ is Voiculescu's circular operator. We obtain a formula for the Brown measure of ${x}+c$ which provides a description of the limit distribution. This answers a question of Biane--Lehner for arbitrary operator ${x}$.
  Generalizing the case of circular and semi-circular operators, we also consider a family of twisted elliptic operators that are $*$-free from ${x}$. For an arbitrary twisted elliptic operator $g$, possible degeneracy then prevents a direct calculation of the Brown measure of ${x}+g$. We instead show that the whole family of Brown measures are the push-forward measures of the Brown measure of ${x}+c$ under a family of self-maps of the plane, which could possibly be singular. We calculate explicit formula for the case ${x}$ is self-adjoint. In addition, we prove that the Brown measure of the sum of an $R$-diagonal operator and a twisted elliptic element is supported in a deformed ring where the inner boundary is a circle and the outer boundary is an ellipse.
  These results generalize some known results about free additive Brownian motions where the free random variable ${x}$ is assumed to be self-adjoint. The approach is based on a Hermitian reduction and subordination functions.</description>

      <title>K-theory of C*-algebras arising from commuting Hilbert bimodules and invariant ideals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00377v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the K-theory of the Cuntz-Nica-Pimsner C*-algebra of a rank-two product system that is an extension determined by an invariant ideal of the coefficient algebra. We use a construction of Deaconu and Fletcher that describes the Cuntz-Nica-Pimsner C*-algebra of the product system in terms of two iterations of Pimsner's original construction of a C*-algebra from a right-Hilbert bimodule. We apply our results to the product system built from two commuting surjective local homeomorphisms of a totally disconnected space, where the Cuntz-Nica-Pimsner C*-algebra is isomorphic to the C*-algebra of the associated rank-two Deaconu--Renault groupoid. We then apply a theorem of Spielberg about stable finiteness of an extension to obtain sufficient conditions for stable finiteness of the C*-algebra of the Deaconu-Renault groupoid.</description>

      <title>Covariant decomposable maps on C*-algebras and quantum dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01176v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We characterize covariant positive decomposable maps between unital C*-algebras in terms of a dilation theorem, which generalizes a seminal result by H. Scutaru from Rep. Math. Phys. 16 (1):79-87, 1979. As a case study, we provide a certain characterization of the operator sum representation of maps on $\mathbb{M}_n (\mathbb{C})$, covariant with respect to the maximal commutative subgroup of $\mathrm{U}(n)$. A connection to quantum dynamics is established by specifying sufficient and necessary conditions for covariance of D-divisible (decomposably divisible) quantum evolution families, recently introduced in J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 56 (2023) 485202.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18446v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For an extension $1\rightarrow N \rightarrow \Gamma \xrightarrow{q} \Gamma / N \rightarrow 1$ of discrete countable groups, it is known that the Baum-Connes conjecture with coefficients holds for $\Gamma$ if it holds for $\Gamma / N$ and $q^{-1}(F)$ for any finite subgroup $F$ of $\Gamma / N$. In this paper, we employ a localization algebra approach to prove this result.</description>
