      <title>Spatially Resolved Plasma Composition Evolution in a Solar Flare -- The Effect of Reconnection Outflow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar flares exhibit complex variations in elemental abundances compared to photospheric values. We examine the spatial and temporal evolution of coronal abundances in the X8.2 flare on 2017 September 10, aiming to interpret the often observed high first ionization potential (FIP) bias at loop tops and provide insights into differences between spatially resolved and Sun-as-a-star flare composition measurements. We analyze 12 Hinode/EIS raster scans spanning 3.5 hours, employing Ca XIV 193.87 A/Ar XIV 194.40 A and Fe XVI 262.98 A/S XIII 256.69 A composition diagnostics to derive FIP bias values. Both diagnostics consistently show that flare loop tops maintain high FIP bias values of &gt;2-6, with peak phase values exceeding 4, over the extended duration, while footpoints exhibit photospheric FIP bias of ~1.
  We propose that this variation arises from a combination of two distinct processes: high FIP bias plasma downflows from the plasma sheet confined to loop tops, and chromospheric evaporation filling the loop footpoints with low FIP bias plasma. Mixing between these two sources produces the observed gradient. Our observations show that the localized high FIP bias signature at loop tops is likely diluted by the bright footpoint emission in spatially averaged measurements. The spatially resolved spectroscopic observations enabled by EIS prove critical for revealing this complex abundance variation in loops. Furthermore, our observations show clear evidence that the origin of hot flare plasma in flaring loops consists of a combination of both directly heated plasma in the corona and from ablated chromospheric material; and our results provide valuable insights into the formation and composition of loop top brightenings, also known as EUV knots, which are a common feature at the tops of flare loops.</description>

      <title>An Eccentric Binary with a Misaligned Circumbinary Disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present spectroscopic and photometric observations of Bernhard-2, which was previously identified as a candidate system to host a misaligned circumbinary disk. Our spectroscopic measurements confirm that Bernhard-2 indeed contains an eccentric ($e=0.69 \pm 0.08$) binary and thus that the periodic variability in the photometric light curve is best explained by the occultation by the misaligned circumbinary disk. By modeling the spectral energy distributions at different phases, we infer the system age to be $\sim 20\,$Myr and the masses of the two binary components to be $\sim 1.1\,M_\odot$ and $\sim 0.9\,M_\odot$, respectively. Our new photometric observations show clear deviations from the model prediction based on the archival data, suggesting ongoing precession of the circumbinary disk. The H$\alpha$ line of Bernhard-2 also shows an inverse P-Cygni profile at epochs close to the pericenter passage, which could be attributed to the pulsed accretion around the pericenter. Bernhard-2 therefore closely resembles the well studied KH 15D system. Further detailed observations and studies of such rare systems can provide useful information about disk physics and evolution.</description>

      <title>Demography of stellar radio population within 500 pc: A VLASS-Gaia DR3 study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we have carried out a systematic analysis of the VLASS quick look catalogs together with \textit{Gaia DR3} to identify the optical counterparts of 3~GHz radio emitters within 500~pc to obtain a homogeneous statistical sample of stellar radio sources. We have identified distinct populations of 3 GHz emitters across the \textit{Gaia DR3} color-magnitude diagram. We also present candidate sources (transient, highly variable or background artifacts) which can be confirmed by follow-up observations. A majority of the detected sources constitute main sequence G, K and M-type stars including ultra-cool dwarfs. Pinning down the origin of radio emission from these populations can help us gain further insights into the origin of stellar and planetary magnetic fields. By analyzing the variation of brightness temperature of the sources with their spectral type, we have tentatively associated possible emission mechanisms with different object types. We inspected the correlation between quiescent radio and X-ray emission for our sample that can provide crucial insights into the current understanding of the Gudel-Benz relationship, which is essential for modeling steady radio emission and coronal heating. This VLASS-\textit{\textit{Gaia DR3}} analysis acts as a pilot study for follow-up observations at multiple wavelengths to better understand stellar structure, model flaring activities and detect radio emission caused by star-planet interactions.</description>

      <title>The progenitors of Be-stars paired with O-subdwarfs: the spin-up of a Be star at the stage of conservative mass exchange</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spinning-up of the accreting component in the process of conservative mass exchange is considered in binary systems - progenitors of systems consisting of a main sequence Be-star and an O-subdwarf. During the mass exchange, the meridional circulation transfers 80-85\% of the angular momentum that entered the accretor together with the accreted matter to the accretor surface. This angular momentum is removed from the accretor by the disk. When the mass exchange finishes, the accretor has a rotation typical of classical Be-type stars.</description>

      <title>Heavy Elements Abundances Inferred from the First Adiabatic Exponent in the Solar Envelope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first adiabatic exponent profile, noted $\Gamma_1$, computed along adiabatic coordinats $(T, \rho)$ is in the focus of our study. Under conditions of almost fully ionized hydrogen and helium, the $\Gamma_1$ profile is quite sensitive to heavy elements ionization. $\Gamma_1$ decreases in regions where an element is partially ionized. The recent helioseismic structural inversion is obtained with an accuracy better than $10^{-4}$ in the most of the adiabatic convective zone that allows to study ionization variations. The aim is to determine the major heavy elements content in the solar convective zone. The method of our research is synthesis of the $\Gamma_1$ profile which is based on a linear combination of the contributions of individual heavy elements. The idea of the approach was proposed and justified by Baturin et al. (Astron. Astrophys., 660, A125, 2022). We find the best approximation of the inverted profile $\Gamma_1$ adjusting the abundances of major elements (C, N, O, Ne), meanwhile the abundances of elements heavier than neon are fixed. We synthesize the theoretical $\Gamma_1$ profile using the SAHA-S equation of state, and are able to reproduce the inverted profiles with an accuracy of $(1-2)\cdot 10^{-5}$. Total mass fraction of heavy elements found by this method is $Z=0.0148\pm 0.0004$. The oxygen logarithmic abundance is $8.70\pm 0.03$, carbon $8.44\pm 0.04$, nitrogen $8.12\pm 0.08$, and neon $8.17\pm 0.09$. The obtained estimations of oxygen and carbon agree with spectroscopic abundances by Asplund et al. (Astron. Astrophys., 653, A141, 2021).</description>

      <title>The extremely strong non-neutralized electric currents of the unique solar active region NOAA 13664</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In May 2024, the extremely complex active region National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) 13664 produced the strongest geomagnetic storm since 2003. The aim of this study is to explore the development of the extreme magnetic complexity of NOAA 13664 in terms of its photospheric electric current. The non-neutralized electric current is derived from photospheric vector magnetograms, provided by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imaged onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory. The calculation method is based on image processing, thresholding and error analysis. The spatial and temporal evolution of the non-neutralized electric current of the region as well as its constituent sub-regions is examined. For context, a comparison with other complex, flare-prolific active regions is provided. Active region NOAA 13664 was formed by the emergence and interaction of three sub-regions, two of which were of notable individual complexity. It consisted of numerous persistent, current-carrying magnetic partitions that exhibited periods of conspicuous motions and strongly increasing electric current at many locations within the region. These periods were followed by intense and repeated flaring. The total unsigned non-neutralized electric currents and average injection rates reached $5.95 \cdot 10^{13}$ A and $1.5 \cdot 10^{13}$ A/day, and were the strongest observed so far, significantly surpassing other super-active regions of Solar Cycle 24 and 25. Active region NOAA 13664 presents a unique case of complexity. Further scrutiny of the spatial and temporal variation of the net electric currents during the emergence and development of super-active regions is paramount to understand the origin of complex regions and adverse space weather.</description>

      <title>Non-conventional Approach for Deriving the Radial Sizes of Coronal Mass Ejections at Different Instances: Discrepancies in the Estimates Between Remote and In Situ Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the evolution of radial sizes and instantaneous expansion speeds of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) is crucial for assessing their impact duration on Earth's environment. We introduce a non-conventional approach to derive the CME's radial sizes and expansion speeds at different instances during its passage over a single-point in situ spacecraft. We also estimate the CME's radial sizes and expansion speeds during its journey from the Sun to 1 AU using the 3D kinematics of different CME features, including the leading edge (LE), center, and trailing edge (TE). The continuous 3D kinematics of the CME is estimated by employing the GCS and SSSE reconstruction methods on multi-point observations from coronagraphs and heliospheric imagers combined with the drag-based model. We choose the 2010 April 3 CME as a suitable case for our study, promising a more accurate comparison of its remote and in situ observations. We show that the introduced non-conventional approach can provide better accuracy in estimating radial sizes and instantaneous expansion speeds of CMEs at different instances. We examine the aspect ratio of the CME, which influences its expansion behavior and shows the discrepancy between its value in the corona and interplanetary medium. Our study highlights significant inconsistencies in the arrival time, radial size, and expansion speed estimates obtained from remote and in situ observations. We advocate for future studies leveraging multi-spacecraft in situ observations and our non-conventional approach to analyze them to improve the comprehension of CME dynamics in the solar wind.</description>

      <title>The core collapse of a 16.5 M$_{\odot}$ star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the 1D stellar evolution of a 16.5 M$_{\odot}$ zero-age main-sequence star having different initial rotations. Starting from the pre-main-sequence, the models evolve up to the onset of the core collapse stage. The collapse of such a massive star can result in several kinds of energetic transients, such as Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs), Supernovae, etc. Using the simulation parameters, we calculate their free-fall timescales when the models reach the stage of the onset of core collapse. Estimating the free-fall timescale is crucial for understanding the duration for which the central engine can be fueled, allowing us to compare the free-fall timescale with the T$_{\rm 90}$ duration of GRBs. Our results indicate that, given the constraints of the parameters and initial conditions in our models, rapidly rotating massive stars might serve as potential progenitors of Ultra-Long GRBs (T$_{\rm 90}$ $&gt;&gt;$ 500 sec). In contrast, the non-rotating or slowly rotating models are more prone to explode as hydrogen-rich Type IIP-like core-collapse supernovae.</description>

      <title>A Broadband X-ray Investigation of Fast-Spinning Intermediate Polar CTCV J2056-3014</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on XMM-Newton, NuSTAR, and NICER X-ray observations of CTCV J2056-3014, a cataclysmic variable (CV) with one of the fastest-spinning white dwarfs (WDs) at P = 29.6 s. While previously classified as an intermediate polar (IP), CJ2056 also exhibits the properties of WZ-Sge-type CVs, such as dwarf novae and superoutbursts. With XMM-Newton and NICER, we detected the spin period up to approximately 2 keV with 7-$\sigma$ significance. We constrained its derivative to |$\dot{P}$| &lt; 1.8e-12 s/s after correcting for binary orbital motion. The pulsed profile is characterized by a single broad peak with approximately 25% modulation. NuSTAR detected a four-fold increase in unabsorbed X-ray flux coincident with an optical flare in November 2022. The XMM-Newton and NICER X-ray spectra in 0.3-10 keV are best characterized by an absorbed optically-thin three-temperature thermal plasma model (kT = 0.3, 1.0, and 4.9 keV), while the NuSTAR spectra in 3-30 keV are best fit by a single-temperature thermal plasma model (kT = 8.4 keV), both with Fe abundance $Z_{Fe}/Z_\odot$ = 0.3. CJ2056 exhibits similarities to other fast-spinning CVs, such as low plasma temperatures, and no significant X-ray absorption at low energies. As the WD's magnetic field strength is unknown, we applied both non-magnetic and magnetic CV spectral models (MKCFLOW and MCVSPEC) to determine the WD mass. The derived WD mass range (M = 0.7-1.0 $M_\odot$) is above the centrifugal break-up mass limit of 0.56 $M_\odot$ and consistent with the mean WD mass of local CVs (M $\approx$ 0.8-0.9 $M_\odot$).</description>

      <title>Local interstellar spectra and solar modulation of cosmic ray proton and Helium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The galactic cosmic rays (GCR) suffer from solar modulation when they propagate through the heliosphere.
  The transfer of the local interstellar spectrum (LIS) to the top-of-atmosphere spectra (TOA) is influenced by solar wind convection, diffusion on the heliospheric magnetic field (HMF), among other factors.
  In this work, we derive the LIS of proton (p) and helium (He) covering energies from a few MeV/n to TeV/n, using a non-parameterization method. The study utilizes monthly AMS-02 data on proton and helium fluxes and their ratio to examine the evolution of solar modulation from May 2011 to May 2017. To improve the fitting, the force-field approximation is modified by assigning different solar modulation potentials for high ( $\phi_h$ ) and low ($\phi_l$ ) energy ranges. A sigmoid function is employed to describe the transition between these energy ranges. The analysis reveals that the break in proton and helium fluxes occurs at the same rigidity value, with a mean of approximately 6 GV and this break is more pronounced during the heliospheric magnetic field reversal period. The $\phi_l$ is close to the result of Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) while the $\phi_h$ is close to the result of neutron monitor (NM) data. Furthermore, the long-term behavior of the p/He ratio is found to naturally arise from the model when considering different Z/A values and the LISs for proton and helium.</description>

      <title>uGMRT Survey of EXoplanets Around M-dwarfs (GS-EXAM): Radio observations of GJ 1151</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coherent radio emission with properties similar to planetary auroral signals has been reported from GJ 1151, a quiescent, slow-rotating mid-M star, by the LOFAR Two-metre (120-170 MHz) Sky Survey (LoTSS). The observed {LOFAR} emission is fairly bright at 0.89 mJy with 64% circular polarization, and the emission characteristics are consistent with the interaction between an Earth-sized planet with an orbital period of 1-5 days and the magnetic field of the host star. However, no short-period planet has been detected around GJ 1151. To confirm the reported radio emission caused by the putative planet around GJ 1151 and to investigate the nature of this emission, we carried out uGMRT observations of GJ 1151 at 150, 218, and 400 MHz over 33 hours across ten epochs. No emission was detected at any frequency. While at 150 MHz and 218 MHz, non-detection could be due to the low sensitivity of our observations, at 400 MHz, the rms sensitivities achieved were sufficient to detect the emission observed with LOFAR at $\sim$ 20$\sigma$ level. Our findings suggest that the radio emission is highly time-variable, likely influenced by the star-planet system's phase and the host star's magnetic field. Additional observations below 170 MHz, at more frequent epochs (as the periodicity of the emission is unknown), especially during periods of high stellar magnetic field strength, are needed to confirm the emission.</description>

      <title>Giant planets population around B stars from the first part of the BEAST survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exoplanets form from circumstellar protoplanetary discs whose fundamental properties (notably their extent, composition, mass, temperature and lifetime) depend on the host star properties, such as their mass and luminosity. B-stars are among the most massive stars and their protoplanetary discs test extreme conditions for exoplanet formation. This paper investigates the frequency of giant planet companions around young B-stars (median age of 16 Myr) in the Scorpius-Centaurus association, the closest association containing a large population of B-stars. We systematically search for massive exoplanets with the high-contrast direct imaging instrument SPHERE using the data from the BEAST survey, that targets an homogeneous sample of young B-stars from the wide Sco-Cen association. We derive accurate detection limits in case of non-detections. We found evidence in previous papers for two substellar companions around 42 stars. The masses of these companions are straddling the ~13 Jupiter mass deuterium burning limit but their mass ratio with respect to their host star is close to that of Jupiter. We derive a frequency of such massive planetary mass companions around B stars of 11-5+7%, accounting for the survey sensitivity. The discoveries of substellar companions bcen b and mu2sco B happened after only few stars in the survey had been observed, raising the possibility that massive Jovian planets might be common around B-stars. However our statistical analysis show that the occurrence rate of such planets is similar around B-stars and around solar-type stars of similar age, while B-star companions exhibit low mass ratios and larger semi-major axis.</description>

      <title>Solar flare observations with the Radio Neutrino Observatory Greenland (RNO-G)</title>

Abstract: The Radio Neutrino Observatory - Greenland (RNO-G) seeks discovery of ultra-high energy neutrinos from the cosmos through their interactions in ice. The science program extends beyond particle astrophysics to include radioglaciology and, as we show herein, solar observations, as well. Currently seven of 35 planned radio-receiver stations (24 antennas/station) are operational. These stations are sensitive to impulsive radio signals with frequencies between 80 and 700 MHz and feature a neutrino trigger threshold for recording data close to the thermal floor. RNO-G can also trigger on elevated signals from the Sun, resulting in nanosecond resolution time-domain flare data; such temporal resolution is significantly shorter than from most dedicated solar observatories. In addition to possible RNO-G solar flare polarization measurements, the Sun also represents an extremely useful above-surface calibration source.
  Using RNO-G data recorded during the summers of 2022 and 2023, we find signal excesses during solar flares reported by the solar-observing Callisto network and also in coincidence with $\sim$2/3 of the brightest excesses recorded by the SWAVES satellite. These observed flares are characterized by significant time-domain impulsivity. Using the known position of the Sun, the flare sample is used to calibrate the RNO-G absolute pointing on the radio signal arrival direction to sub-degree resolution. We thus establish the Sun as a regularly observed astronomical calibration source to provide the accurate absolute pointing required for neutrino astronomy.</description>

      <title>Transferring spectroscopic stellar labels to 217 million Gaia DR3 XP stars with SHBoost</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06963v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the feasibility of using machine learning regression as a method of extracting basic stellar parameters and line-of-sight extinctions from spectro-photometric data. We built a stable gradient-boosted random-forest regressor (xgboost), trained on spectroscopic data, capable of producing output parameters with reliable uncertainties from Gaia DR3 data (most notably the low-resolution XP spectra), without ground-based spectroscopic observations. Using Shapley additive explanations, we interpret how the predictions for each star are influenced by each data feature. For the training and testing of the network, we used high-quality parameters obtained from the StarHorse code for a sample of around eight million stars observed by major spectroscopic stellar surveys, complemented by curated samples of hot stars, very metal-poor stars, white dwarfs, and hot sub-dwarfs. The training data cover the whole sky, all Galactic components, and almost the full magnitude range of the Gaia DR3 XP sample of more than 217 million objects that also have reported parallaxes. We have achieved median uncertainties of 0.20 mag in V-band extinction, 0.01 dex in logarithmic effective temperature, 0.20 dex in surface gravity, 0.18 dex in metallicity, and $12\%$ in mass (over the full Gaia DR3 XP sample, with considerable variations in precision as a function of magnitude and stellar type). We succeeded in predicting competitive results based on Gaia DR3 XP spectra compared to classical isochrone or spectral-energy distribution fitting methods we employed in earlier works, especially for parameters $A_V$ and $T_{\rm eff}$, along with the metallicity values. Finally, we showcase some potential applications of this new catalogue, including extinction maps, metallicity trends in the Milky Way, and extended maps of young massive stars, metal-poor stars, and metal-rich stars).

      <title>Constraints on Acoustic Wave Energy Fluxes and Radiative Losses in the Solar Chromosphere from Non-LTE Inversions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15908v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurately assessing the balance between acoustic wave energy fluxes and radiative losses is critical for understanding how the solar chromosphere is thermally regulated. We investigate the energy balance in the chromosphere by comparing deposited acoustic flux and radiative losses under quiet and active solar conditions using non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) inversions with the Stockholm Inversion Code (STiC). To achieve this, we utilize spectroscopic observations from the Interferometric BIdimensional Spectrometer (IBIS) in the Na I 5896 \r{A} and Ca II 8542 \r{A} lines and from the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) in the Mg II h and k lines to self-consistently derive spatially resolved velocity power spectra and cooling rates across different heights in the atmosphere. Additionally, we use snapshots of a three-dimensional radiative-magnetohydrodynamics simulation to investigate the systematic effects of the inversion approach, particularly the attenuation effect on the velocity power spectra and the determination of the cooling rates. The results indicate that inversions potentially underestimate acoustic fluxes at all chromospheric heights while slightly overestimating the radiative losses when fitting these spectral lines. However, even after accounting for these biases, the ratio of acoustic flux to radiative losses remains below unity in most observed regions, particularly in the higher layers of the chromosphere. We also observe a correlation between the magnetic field inclination in the photosphere and radiative losses in the low chromosphere in plage, which is evidence that the field topology plays a role in the chromospheric losses.</description>

Abstract: The rareness of nearby supernovae ensures particular value to the historic records for determination of their light curves. We provide the translation of 13th century Armenian chronicle of Hetum, which by its unexpected association to Cronaca Rampona and other chronicles can influence the debates whether there are reliable European records of the supernova of 1054 AD, as well as the analysis of the records vs the conjunction with the Moon and their role in assigning of the Type I or II to that supernova.</description>

      <title>The ESO SupJup Survey II: The 12C/13C ratios of three young brown dwarfs with CRIRES$^+$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07678v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Young brown dwarfs exhibit atmospheric characteristics similar to those of super-Jupiters, providing a unique opportunity to study planetary atmospheres. The ESO SupJup Survey, utilizing CRIRES$^+$ on the Very Large Telescope, aims to assess the role of $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C as a formation tracer. We present observations of three young brown dwarfs: 2MASS J12003792-7845082, TWA 28, and 2MASS J08561384-1342242, with the goal of constraining their chemical compositions, thermal profiles, surface gravities, spin rotations, and $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C. Atmospheric retrievals of CRIRES$^+$ K-band spectra were conducted using the radiative transfer code petitRADTRANS coupled with the Bayesian inference algorithm MultiNest, resulting in a detailed characterization of the atmospheres of these objects. We report the volume mixing ratios of main molecular and atomic species, including the novel detection of hydrogen fluoride (HF) in a brown dwarf's atmosphere, and determine $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C values of $81^{+28}_{-19}$ and $79^{+20}_{-14}$ in the atmospheres of TWA 28 and J0856, respectively, with strong significance ($&gt;3\sigma$). Tentative evidence ($\sim 2\sigma$) of $^{13}$C in J1200 was found, with $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C = $114^{+69}_{-33}$, along with $^{18}$O detected at moderate significance in J0856 (3.3$\sigma$) and TWA 28 (2.1$\sigma$). The retrieved thermal profiles indicate hot atmospheres (2300-2600 K) with low surface gravities and slow spins, consistent with young objects. The consistent carbon isotope ratios among the three objects, showing no significant deviation from the local ISM, suggest a fragmentation-based formation mechanism similar to star formation. The tentative detection of $^{18}$O in two objects highlights the potential of high-resolution spectroscopy to probe additional isotope ratios, such as $^{16}$O/$^{18}$O, in the atmospheres of brown dwarfs and super-Jupiters.</description>

      <title>First measurement of the weak mixing angle in direct detection experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04385v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current ton-scale dark matter direct detection experiments have reached an important milestone with the detection of solar neutrinos. In this paper, we show that these data can be used to determine a critical parameter of the Standard Model in particle physics, across an energy regime that has never been probed before. In particular, we show that the value of the weak mixing angle ($\theta_W$) which relates the mass of the $W$ and $Z$ bosons can be derived from 1) the recent measurements of coherent neutrino-nucleus scattering by PandaX-4T and XENONnT in the sub-GeV energy range -- a regime which is usually only probed by low energy neutrino experiments -- and from 2) XENONnT electron recoil data through neutrino-electron scattering at energy scale $\simeq 0.1 ~ \rm{ MeV}$, corresponding to a momentum transfer region over an order of magnitude smaller than that explored by atomic parity violation experiments. Future observation of neutrinos in the next generation of dark matter direct detection experiments have therefore the potential to provide accurate tests of the Standard Model weak interactions in the keV-MeV regime.</description>

      <title>Searching for substellar companion candidates with Gaia. I. Introducing the GaiaPMEX tool</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16992v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Gaia mission is expected to yield the detection of several thousands of exoplanets, perhaps at least doubling the number of known exoplanets. Although the harvest is expected to occur when the astrometric time series will be published with DR4 at the eve of 2026, the DR3 is already a precious database to search for exoplanet beyond 1 au. With this objective, we characterized multiple systems by exploiting two astrometric signatures derived from the DR3 astrometric solution of bright sources (G&lt;16). We have the proper motion anomaly, or PMa, for sources also observed with Hipparcos, and the excess of residuals in the RUWE and the astrometric excess noise (AEN). Those astrometric signatures give an accurate measurement of the astrometric motion of a source seen with Gaia, even in the presence of calibration and measurement noises. We found that they can allow identifying stellar binaries and hint to companions with a mass in the planetary domain. We introduce a tool called GaiaPMEX, that is able, for a given source, to model its astrometric signatures, by a photocenter orbit due to a companion with certain mass and semi-major axis (sma). Comparing to their actual measurements from the DR3 and Hipparcos, GaiaPMEX calculates a confidence map of the possible companion's mass and sma. The constraints on mass are, as expected, degenerate, but when allowed, coupling the use of PMa and RUWE, may significantly narrow the space of solutions. Thanks to combining Gaia and Hipparcos, planets are expected to be most frequently found within 1-10 au from their star, at the scale of Earth-to-Saturn orbits. In this range, exoplanets with mass down to 0.1 MJup are more favorably detected around M-dwarfs closer than 10 pc. Some fraction, if not all, of companions identified with GaiaPMEX may be characterized in the future using the astrometric time series that will be published with the DR4.</description>

      <title>Searching for substellar companion candidates with Gaia. II. A catalog of 9,698 planet candidate solar-type hosts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16993v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a previous paper, we introduced a new tool called GaiaPMEX. It characterizes the mass and semi-major axis relative to the central star (sma) of a possible companion around any source observed with Gaia. It uses the value of RUWE, or, with both Gaia and Hipparcos, the value of proper motion anomaly (PMa), alone or combined with the RUWE. Our goal is to exploit the large volume of sources in Gaia's DR3 and find new exoplanet candidates. We wish to create a new input catalog of planet-candidate hosting systems to the disposal of future follow-up projects. Beyond G=14, this catalog would prepare the arrival of powerful instruments on the ELTs, that could include RV follow-up of faint stars and direct imaging of planets around main sequence Gyr-old stars. We used the mass-sma degenerate set of solutions obtained by GaiaPMEX from any value of RUWE to select a sample of bright (G&lt;16) Gaia sources whose companions could be planetary, with a mass &lt;13.5 MJup. It led us to identify a sample of 9,698 planet candidate hosting sources, whose companion may have a mass &lt;13.5 MJup in the range of 1-3-au sma. We identified 19 systems that are also reported in the Nasa exoplanet archive. We detected 8 substellar companions with a 1-3-au sma, initially discovered and characterised with RV and astrometry. Moreover, we found 6 transiting-planet systems and 2 wide-orbit systems for whom we predict the existence of supplementary companions. Focusing on the subsample of sources observed with Hipparcos, combining RUWE and PMa, we confirmed the identification of 4 new planetary candidate systems HD 187129, HD 81697, CD-42 883, and HD 105330. Given the degeneracy of mass-sma, many of the candidates in this 9,698 sources catalog might have a larger mass, in the brown-dwarf and stellar domain, if their sma departs from the 1-3-au range. The vetting of this large catalog will be the subject of future studies.</description>
