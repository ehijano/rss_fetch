      <title>Epistemic-aware Vision-Language Foundation Model for Fetal Ultrasound Interpretation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent medical vision-language models have shown promise on tasks such as VQA, report generation, and anomaly detection. However, most are adapted to structured adult imaging and underperform in fetal ultrasound, which poses challenges of multi-view image reasoning, numerous diseases, and image diversity. To bridge this gap, we introduce FetalMind, a medical AI system tailored to fetal ultrasound for both report generation and diagnosis. Guided by clinical workflow, we propose Salient Epistemic Disentanglement (SED), which injects an expert-curated bipartite graph into the model to decouple view-disease associations and to steer preference selection along clinically faithful steps via reinforcement learning. This design mitigates variability across diseases and heterogeneity across views, reducing learning bottlenecks while aligning the model's inference with obstetric practice. To train FetalMind at scale, we curate FetalSigma-1M dataset, the first large-scale fetal ultrasound report corpus, comprising 20K reports from twelve medical centers, addressing the scarcity of domain data. Extensive experiments show that FetalMind outperforms open- and closed-source baselines across all gestational stages, achieving +14% average gains and +61.2% higher accuracy on critical conditions while remaining efficient, stable, and scalable.

      <title>OS-HGAdapter: Open Semantic Hypergraph Adapter for Large Language Models Assisted Entropy-Enhanced Image-Text Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text-image alignment constitutes a foundational challenge in multimedia content understanding, where effective modeling of cross-modal semantic correspondences critically enhances retrieval system performance through joint embedding space optimization. Given the inherent difference in information entropy between texts and images, conventional approaches often show an imbalance in the mutual retrieval of these two modalities. To address this particular challenge, we propose to use the open semantic knowledge of Large Language Model (LLM) to fill for the entropy gap and reproduce the alignment ability of humans in these tasks. Our entropy-enhancing alignment is achieved through a two-step process: 1) a new prompt template that does not rely on explicit knowledge in the task domain is designed to use LLM to enhance the polysemy description of the text modality. By analogy, the information entropy of the text modality relative to the visual modality is increased; 2) A hypergraph adapter is used to construct multilateral connections between the text and image modalities, which can correct the positive and negative matching errors for synonymous semantics in the same fixed embedding space, whilst reducing the noise caused by open semantic entropy by mapping the reduced dimensions back to the original dimensions. Comprehensive evaluations on the Flickr30K and MS-COCO benchmarks validate the superiority of our Open Semantic Hypergraph Adapter (OS-HGAdapter), showcasing 16.8\% (text-to-image) and 40.1\% (image-to-text) cross-modal retrieval gains over existing methods while establishing new state-of-the-art performance in semantic alignment tasks.</description>

      <title>MotionBeat: Motion-Aligned Music Representation via Embodied Contrastive Learning and Bar-Equivariant Contact-Aware Encoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Music is both an auditory and an embodied phenomenon, closely linked to human motion and naturally expressed through dance. However, most existing audio representations neglect this embodied dimension, limiting their ability to capture rhythmic and structural cues that drive movement. We propose MotionBeat, a framework for motion-aligned music representation learning. MotionBeat is trained with two newly proposed objectives: the Embodied Contrastive Loss (ECL), an enhanced InfoNCE formulation with tempo-aware and beat-jitter negatives to achieve fine-grained rhythmic discrimination, and the Structural Rhythm Alignment Loss (SRAL), which ensures rhythm consistency by aligning music accents with corresponding motion events. Architecturally, MotionBeat introduces bar-equivariant phase rotations to capture cyclic rhythmic patterns and contact-guided attention to emphasize motion events synchronized with musical accents. Experiments show that MotionBeat outperforms state-of-the-art audio encoders in music-to-dance generation and transfers effectively to beat tracking, music tagging, genre and instrument classification, emotion recognition, and audio-visual retrieval.

      <title>DIGITWISE: Digital Twin-based Modeling of Adaptive Video Streaming Engagement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the popularity of video streaming entertainment continues to grow, understanding how users engage with the content and react to its changes becomes a critical success factor for every stakeholder. User engagement, i.e., the percentage of video the user watches before quitting, is central to customer loyalty, content personalization, ad relevance, and A/B testing. This paper presents DIGITWISE, a digital twin-based approach for modeling adaptive video streaming engagement. Traditional adaptive bitrate (ABR) algorithms assume that all users react similarly to video streaming artifacts and network issues, neglecting individual user sensitivities. DIGITWISE leverages the concept of a digital twin, a digital replica of a physical entity, to model user engagement based on past viewing sessions. The digital twin receives input about streaming events and utilizes supervised machine learning to predict user engagement for a given session. The system model consists of a data processing pipeline, machine learning models acting as digital twins, and a unified model to predict engagement. DIGITWISE employs the XGBoost model in both digital twins and unified models. The proposed architecture demonstrates the importance of personal user sensitivities, reducing user engagement prediction error by up to 5.8% compared to non-user-aware models. Furthermore, DIGITWISE can optimize content provisioning and delivery by identifying the features that maximize engagement, providing an average engagement increase of up to 8.6%.</description>

Abstract: Holographic video communication is considered a paradigm shift in visual communications, becoming increasingly popular for its ability to offer immersive experiences. This article provides an overview of holographic video communication and outlines the requirements of a holographic video communication system. Particularly, following a brief review of semantic com- munication, an architecture for a semantic-enabled holographic video communication system is presented. Key technologies, including semantic sampling, joint semantic-channel coding, and semantic-aware transmission, are designed based on the proposed architecture. Two related use cases are presented to demonstrate the performance gain of the proposed methods. Finally, potential research topics are discussed to pave the way for the realization of semantic-enabled holographic video communications.</description>

      <title>NExT-OMNI: Towards Any-to-Any Omnimodal Foundation Models with Discrete Flow Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13721v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Next-generation multimodal foundation models capable of any-to-any cross-modal generation and multi-turn interaction will serve as core components of artificial general intelligence systems, playing a pivotal role in human-machine interaction. However, most existing multimodal models remain constrained by autoregressive architectures, whose inherent limitations prevent a balanced integration of understanding and generation capabilities. Although hybrid and decoupling strategies have been explored to address these tasks within unified frameworks separately, their redundant, non-integrated designs limit their applicability to broader scenarios, such as cross-modal retrieval. In this work, we introduce NExT-OMNI, an open-source omnimodal foundation model that achieves unified modeling through discrete flow paradigms. By leveraging metric-induced probability paths and kinetic optimal velocities, NExT-OMNI natively supports any-to-any understanding and generation with enhanced response efficiency, while enabling broader application scenarios through concise unified representations rather than task-decoupled designs. Trained on large-scale interleaved text, image, video, and audio data, NExT-OMNI delivers competitive performance on multimodal generation and understanding benchmarks, while outperforming prior unified models in multi-turn multimodal interaction and cross-modal retrieval, highlighting its architectural advantages as a next-generation multimodal foundation model. To advance further research, we release training details, data protocols, and open-source both the code and model checkpoints.</description>

      <title>ESG-Net: Event-Aware Semantic Guided Network for Dense Audio-Visual Event Localization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09945v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dense audio-visual event localization (DAVE) aims to identify event categories and locate the temporal boundaries in untrimmed videos. Most studies only employ event-related semantic constraints on the final outputs, lacking cross-modal semantic bridging in intermediate layers. This causes modality semantic gap for further fusion, making it difficult to distinguish between event-related content and irrelevant background content. Moreover, they rarely consider the correlations between events, which limits the model to infer concurrent events among complex scenarios. In this paper, we incorporate multi-stage semantic guidance and multi-event relationship modeling, which respectively enable hierarchical semantic understanding of audio-visual events and adaptive extraction of event dependencies, thereby better focusing on event-related information. Specifically, our eventaware semantic guided network (ESG-Net) includes a early semantics interaction (ESI) module and a mixture of dependency experts (MoDE) module. ESI applys multi-stage semantic guidance to explicitly constrain the model in learning semantic information through multi-modal early fusion and several classification loss functions, ensuring hierarchical understanding of event-related content. MoDE promotes the extraction of multi-event dependencies through multiple serial mixture of experts with adaptive weight allocation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly surpasses the state-of-the-art methods, while greatly reducing parameters and computational load. Our code will be released on https://github.com/uchiha99999/ESG-Net.</description>

      <title>Extreme Compression of Adaptive Neural Images</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16807v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) and Neural Fields are a novel paradigm for signal representation, from images and audio to 3D scenes and videos. The fundamental idea is to represent a signal as a continuous and differentiable neural network. This new approach poses new theoretical questions and challenges. Considering a neural image as a 2D image represented as a neural network, we aim to explore novel neural image compression. In this work, we present a novel analysis on compressing neural fields, with focus on images and introduce Adaptive Neural Images (ANI), an efficient neural representation that enables adaptation to different inference or transmission requirements. Our proposed method allows us to reduce the bits-per-pixel (bpp) of the neural image by 8 times, without losing sensitive details or harming fidelity. Our work offers a new framework for developing compressed neural fields. We achieve a new state-of-the-art in terms of PSNR/bpp trade-off thanks to our successful implementation of 4-bit neural representations.</description>

      <title>MERIT: Multilingual Semantic Retrieval with Interleaved Multi-Condition Query</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03144v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Semantic retrieval is crucial for modern applications yet remains underexplored in current research. Existing datasets are limited to single languages, single images, or singular retrieval conditions, often failing to fully exploit the expressive capacity of visual information as evidenced by maintained performance when images are replaced with captions. However, practical retrieval scenarios frequently involve interleaved multi-condition queries with multiple images. Hence, this paper introduces MERIT, the first multilingual dataset for interleaved multi-condition semantic retrieval, comprising 320,000 queries with 135,000 products in 5 languages, covering 7 distinct product categories. Extensive experiments on MERIT identify existing models's limitation: focusing solely on global semantic information while neglecting specific conditional elements in queries. Consequently, we propose Coral, a novel fine-tuning framework that adapts pre-trained MLLMs by integrating embedding reconstruction to preserve fine-grained conditional elements and contrastive learning to extract comprehensive global semantics. Experiments demonstrate that Coral achieves a 45.9% performance improvement over conventional approaches on MERIT, with strong generalization capabilities validated across 8 established retrieval benchmarks. Collectively, our contributions - a novel dataset, identification of critical limitations in existing approaches, and an innovative fine-tuning framework - establish a foundation for future research in interleaved multi-condition semantic retrieval.</description>

      <title>MEGC2025: Micro-Expression Grand Challenge on Spot Then Recognize and Visual Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15298v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Facial micro-expressions (MEs) are involuntary movements of the face that occur spontaneously when a person experiences an emotion but attempts to suppress or repress the facial expression, typically found in a high-stakes environment. In recent years, substantial advancements have been made in the areas of ME recognition, spotting, and generation. However, conventional approaches that treat spotting and recognition as separate tasks are suboptimal, particularly for analyzing long-duration videos in realistic settings. Concurrently, the emergence of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and large vision-language models (LVLMs) offers promising new avenues for enhancing ME analysis through their powerful multimodal reasoning capabilities. The ME grand challenge (MEGC) 2025 introduces two tasks that reflect these evolving research directions: (1) ME spot-then-recognize (ME-STR), which integrates ME spotting and subsequent recognition in a unified sequential pipeline; and (2) ME visual question answering (ME-VQA), which explores ME understanding through visual question answering, leveraging MLLMs or LVLMs to address diverse question types related to MEs. All participating algorithms are required to run on this test set and submit their results on a leaderboard. More details are available at https://megc2025.github.io.</description>

      <title>I$^3$-MRec: Invariant Learning with Information Bottleneck for Incomplete Modality Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04247v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal recommender systems (MRS) improve recommendation performance by integrating complementary semantic information from multiple modalities. However, the assumption of complete multimodality rarely holds in practice due to missing images and incomplete descriptions, hindering model robustness and generalization. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel method called \textbf{I$^3$-MRec}, which uses \textbf{I}nvariant learning with \textbf{I}nformation bottleneck principle for \textbf{I}ncomplete \textbf{M}odality \textbf{Rec}ommendation. To achieve robust performance in missing modality scenarios, I$^3$-MRec enforces two pivotal properties: (i) cross-modal preference invariance, ensuring consistent user preference modeling across varying modality environments, and (ii) compact yet effective multimodal representation, as modality information becomes unreliable in such scenarios, reducing the dependence on modality-specific information is particularly important. By treating each modality as a distinct semantic environment, I$^3$-MRec employs invariant risk minimization (IRM) to learn preference-oriented representations. In parallel, a missing-aware fusion module is developed to explicitly simulate modality-missing scenarios. Built upon the Information Bottleneck (IB) principle, the module aims to preserve essential user preference signals across these scenarios while effectively compressing modality-specific information. Extensive experiments conducted on three real-world datasets demonstrate that I$^3$-MRec consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art MRS methods across various modality-missing scenarios, highlighting its effectiveness and robustness in practical applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19330v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: EEG-based multimodal emotion recognition(EMER) has gained significant attention and witnessed notable advancements, the inherent complexity of human neural systems has motivated substantial efforts toward multimodal approaches. However, this field currently suffers from three critical limitations: (i) the absence of open-source implementations. (ii) the lack of standardized and transparent benchmarks for fair performance analysis. (iii) in-depth discussion regarding main challenges and promising research directions is a notable scarcity. To address these challenges, we introduce LibEMER, a unified evaluation framework that provides fully reproducible PyTorch implementations of curated deep learning methods alongside standardized protocols for data preprocessing, model realization, and experimental setups. This framework enables unbiased performance assessment on three widely-used public datasets across two learning tasks. The open-source library is publicly accessible at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/2025ULUIUBUEUMUEUR485384</description>
