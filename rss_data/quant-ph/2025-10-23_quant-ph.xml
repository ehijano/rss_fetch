      <title>Two Quantum Algorithms for Nonlinear Reaction-Diffusion Equation using Chebyshev Approximation Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present two new quantum algorithms for reaction-diffusion equations that employ the truncated Chebyshev polynomial approximation. This method is employed to numerically solve the ordinary differential equation emerging from the linearization of the associated nonlinear differential equation. In the first algorithm, we use the matrix exponentiation method (Patel et al., 2018), while in the second algorithm, we repurpose the quantum spectral method (Childs et al., 2020). Our main technical contribution is to derive the sufficient conditions for the diagonalization of the Carleman embedding matrix, which is indispensable for designing both quantum algorithms. We supplement this with an efficient iterative algorithm to diagonalize the Carleman matrix.
  Our first algorithm has gate complexity of O(d$\cdot$log(d)+T$\cdot$polylog(T/$\varepsilon$)). Here $d$ is the size of the Carleman matrix, $T$ is the simulation time, and $\varepsilon$ is the approximation error. The second algorithm is polynomial in $log(d)$, $T$, and $log(1/\varepsilon)$ - the gate complexity scales as O(polylog(d)$\cdot$T$\cdot$polylog(T/$\varepsilon$)). In terms of $T$ and $\varepsilon$, this is comparable to the speedup gained by the current best known quantum algorithm for this problem, the truncated Taylor series method (Costa et.al., 2025).
  Our approach has two shortcomings. First, we have not provided an upper bound, in terms of d, on the condition number of the Carleman matrix. Second, the success of the diagonalization is based on a conjecture that a specific trigonometric equation has no integral solution. However, we provide strategies to mitigate these shortcomings in most practical cases.</description>

      <title>Mind the gaps: The fraught road to quantum advantage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing is advancing rapidly, yet substantial gaps separate today's noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices from tomorrow's fault-tolerant application-scale (FASQ) machines. We identify four related hurdles along the road ahead: (i) from error mitigation to active error detection and correction, (ii) from rudimentary error correction to scalable fault tolerance, (iii) from early heuristics to mature, verifiable algorithms, and (iv) from exploratory simulators to credible advantage in quantum simulation. Targeting these transitions will accelerate progress toward broadly useful quantum computing.</description>

We refute the misconceptions appearing in this paper and confirm that the quantum features are necessary in the gravitational field if it can lead to entanglement by local propagation between distant masses.</description>

      <title>Morphological computational capacity of Physarum polycephalum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While computational capacity limits of the universe and carbon-based life have been estimated, a stricter bound for aneural organisms has not been established. Physarum polycephalum, a unicellular, multinucleated amoeba, is capable of complex problem-solving despite lacking neurons. By analyzing growth dynamics in two distinct Physarum strains under diverse biological conditions, we map morphological evolution to information processing. As the Margolus-Levitin theorem constrains maximum computation rates by accessible energies, we analyze high-throughput time-series data of Physarum's morphology--quantified through area, perimeter, circularity, and fractal dimension-to determine upper bounds on the number of logical operations achievable through its hydromechanical, chemical, kinetic, and quantum-optical degrees of freedom. Based on spatial distribution of ATP and explored areas, Physarum can perform up to ~$10^{36}$ logical operations in 24 hours, scaling linearly in the non-equilibrium steady state. This framework enables comparison of the computational capacities of life, exploiting either classical or quantum degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>A transmon qubit realized by exploiting the superconductor-insulator transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting qubits are among the most promising platforms for realizing practical quantum computers. One requirement to create a quantum processor is nonlinearity, which in superconducting circuits is typically achieved by sandwiching a layer of aluminum oxide between two aluminum electrodes to form a Josephson junction. These junctions, however, face several limitations that hinder their scalability: the small superconducting gap of aluminum necessitates millikelvin operating temperatures, the material interfaces lead to dissipation, and the sandwich geometry adds unwelcome capacitance for high-frequency applications. In this work, we address all three limitations using a novel superconducting weak link based on the superconductor-insulator transition. By locally thinning a single film of niobium nitride, we exploit its thickness-driven superconductor-insulator transition to form a weak link employing only atomic layer deposition and atomic layer etching. We utilize our weak links to produce a transmon qubit, '$planaron$', with a measured anharmonicity of $\alpha/2\pi = 235$ MHz; at present, the linewidth is $\kappa/2\pi = 15 \mathrm{\: MHz}$. The high superconducting gap of niobium nitride can enable operation at elevated temperatures in future devices, and the fully planar geometry of the weak link eliminates superfluous material interfaces and capacitances. The investigation of small patches of material near the SIT can shed new light on the nature of the transition, including the role of dissipation and finite-size effects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The issue of separating Schr\"odinger-type quantum time evolution into a product of holonomic and dynamical parts in the non-adiabatic non-Abelian case is addressed. Contrary to the recent claim in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 131, 200202 (2023)], we establish that such separation is generally invalid.</description>

      <title>Reduced State Embedding for Error Correction in Quantum Cryptography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Encoding in a high-dimensional Hilbert space improves noise resilience in quantum information processing. However, such an approach may result in cross-mode coupling and detection complexities, thereby reducing quantum cryptography performance. This fundamental trade-off between correctness and secrecy motivates the search for new error-correction approaches to better exploit the advantages of high-dimensional encoding. Here, we introduce the method of reduced state embeddings to quantum key distribution (QKD): a k-dimensional signal set embedded in a d-dimensional Hilbert space, where k&lt;d. In the framework of quantum error correction, our reduced-state embedding realizes an explicit erasure-type error-correction within the quantum channel. We demonstrate the advantage of our scheme in realistic quantum channels, producing a higher secure key rate. We validate our approach using a d=25 QKD experimental data, derive closed-form expressions for the key rate and threshold, and determine the optimal key rate at k=5. These findings advance high-dimensional QKD and pave the way to error correction and modulation for quantum cryptography.</description>

      <title>Quantum Nonlinear Response of Emitter Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the emergence of quantum nonlinearities in the optical response of lattices of two-level quantum emitters coherently driven by a laser. For subwavelength lattice periods, where the system behaves as a quantum metasurface, we find that a resonant incident plane wave can populate excitonic Bloch states with parallel wavevectors different from the incident field, including those lying outside the light cone. Closely related to resonance fluorescence, the far-field emission from the system in the strong-driving regime is dominated by a broadband background of photons spanning a wide range of frequencies and wavevectors. Moreover, we show that, for periods approaching the driving wavelength, the emitter lattice enters in a bistable regime due to the renormalization of the driving rate, in striking contrast with its classical (bosonic) analog. This bistable behavior enables the selective activation and deactivation of the optical quantum nonlinearities of the system.</description>

      <title>On Encoding Matrices using Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over a decade ago, it was demonstrated that quantum computing has the potential to revolutionize numerical linear algebra by enabling algorithms with complexity superior to what is classically achievable, e.g., the seminal HHL algorithm for solving linear systems. Efficient execution of such algorithms critically depends on representing inputs (matrices and vectors) as quantum circuits that encode or implement these inputs. For that task, two common circuit representations emerged in the literature: block encodings and state preparation circuits. In this paper, we systematically study encodings matrices in the form of block encodings and state preparation circuits. We examine methods for constructing these representations from matrices given in classical form, as well as quantum two-way conversions between circuit representations. Two key results we establish (among others) are: (a) a general method for efficiently constructing a block encoding of an arbitrary matrix given in classical form (entries stored in classical random access memory); and (b) low-overhead, bidirectional conversion algorithms between block encodings and state preparation circuits, showing that these models are essentially equivalent. From a technical perspective, two central components of our constructions are: (i) a special constant-depth multiplexer that simultaneously multiplexes all higher-order Pauli matrices of a given size, and (ii) an algorithm for performing a quantum conversion between a matrix's expansion in the standard basis and its expansion in the basis of higher-order Pauli matrices.</description>

      <title>Exact State Evolution and Energy Spectrum in Solvable Bosonic Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solvable bosonic models provide a fundamental framework for describing light propagation in nonlinear media, including optical down-conversion processes that generate squeezed states of light and their higher-order generalizations. In quantum optics a central objective is to determine the time evolution of a given initial state. Exact analytic solution to the state-evolution problem is presented, applicable to a broad class of solvable bosonic models and arbitrary initial states. Moreover, the characteristic equation governing the energy spectrum is derived and the eigenstates are found in the form of continued fractions and as principal minors of the associated Jacobi matrix. The results provide a solid analytical framework for discussion of exactly solvable bosonic models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We second quantize the standard electromagnetic Lagrangian with a subsiduary Lorenz gauge constraint to obtain a covariant theory of the discrete excitations of the classical EM field that can properly be called photons. The longitudinal photon number is zero due to cancellation of Gupta-Bleuler like terms. Physical photons are described by a real number density whose spatial integral is unity so it can be interpreted as the probability density to find a photon at position x'. Energy density is not separated into is positive and negative frequency parts so the nonlocal frequency operator is not required.</description>

      <title>All-Gaussian State Discrimination Beyond the Coherent Helstrom Bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A core problem in communications is the optimal discrimination of binary-phase-shift-keyed (BPSK) signals. A longstanding goal has been to reach the fundamental quantum limit, known as the Helstrom bound, for BPSK signals encoded in coherent states. However, due to technical constraints, proposals for reaching the bound remain impractical. In this letter we take an alternative approach: using only Gaussian optics - displaced squeezed states and homodyne detection - we achieve discrimination of BPSK signals with error rates below what can be achieved using coherent states and any quantum measurement.</description>

      <title>Variational quantum simulation of many-body dissipative dynamics on a superconducting quantum processor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open quantum systems host a wide range of intriguing phenomena, yet their simulation on well-controlled quantum devices is challenging, owing to the exponential growth of the Hilbert space and the inherently non-unitary nature of the dynamics. Here we propose and experimentally demonstrate a variational quantum algorithm capable of scalable simulation of non-unitary many-body dissipative dynamics. The algorithm builds on the framework of linear combination of Hamiltonian simulation, which converts non-unitary dynamics into a weighted sum of unitary evolutions. With the further introduction of a simplified quantum circuit for loss-function evaluation, our scheme is suitable for near-term quantum hardware, with the circuit depth independent of the simulation time. We illustrate our scheme by simulating the collective dynamics of a dissipative transverse Ising model, as well as an interacting Hatano-Nelson model, on the superconducting quantum processor Wukong. Our work underlines the capability of noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices in simulating dissipative many-body dynamics and represents a step forward in exploiting their potential for solving outstanding physical problems.</description>

      <title>Electronically-controlled one- and two-qubit gates for transmon quasicharge qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting protected qubits aim to achieve sufficiently low error rates so as to allow realization of error-corrected, utility-scale quantum computers. A recent proposal encodes a protected qubit in the quasicharge degree of freedom of the conventional transmon device, here referred to as the `quasicharge qubit'. Operating such a protected qubit requires implementing new strategies. Here we show that an electronically-controllable tunnel junction formed by two topological superconductors can be used to implement single- and two-qubit gates on quasicharge qubits. Schemes for both these gates are based on dynamical $4\pi$-periodic Josephson effect and therefore have gate speeds of the same order. The simulation of the dynamics of a topological Josephson junction in a parameter regime with non-negligible charging energy is the key novelty of this work. We also characterize the robustness of such gate operations against charge noise using Fermi's golden rule. Our results point to a compelling strategy for implementation of quasicharge qubit gates based on junctions of minimal Kitaev chains of quantum dots.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Years ago, Itamar Pitowski asked two relevant questions: Why microphysical (quantum) phenomena and classical phenomena differ in the way they do? and, what kind of explanation could qualify as a reasonable one? I argue that both questions can be answered by the comparison of quantum phenomena with some features of vectors in real space. In particular, I show how violation of Bell's inequalities, Teleportation, Kochen-Specker and Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger theorems can be understood in terms of vectors. This does not mean that the difference between quantum and classical phenomena is illusory. This means that vectors are stranger objects that they may seem to be at first sight.</description>

      <title>Efficient Floating-Point Arithmetic on Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel floating-point encoding scheme that builds on prior work involving fixed-point encodings. We encode floating-point numbers using Two's Complement fixed-point mantissas and Two's Complement integral exponents. We used our proposed approach to develop quantum algorithms for fundamental arithmetic operations, such as bit-shifting, reciprocation, multiplication, and addition. We prototyped and investigated the performance of the floating-point encoding scheme on quantum computer simulations by performing reciprocation on randomly drawn inputs and by solving first-order ordinary differential equations, while varying the number of qubits in the encoding. We observed rapid convergence to the exact solutions as we increased the number of qubits and a significant reduction in the number of ancilla qubits required for reciprocation when compared with similar approaches.</description>

      <title>Unveiling non-Hermitian band structures with non-Bloch supercells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-valued band structures are foundational to analyzing periodic systems within the Hermitian description and have been experimentally well-established over recent decades. In contrast, non-Hermitian systems exhibit complex band structures where both energy and momentum have imaginary parts, underpinning phenomena like the non-Hermitian skin effect and anomalous bulk-boundary correspondence that defy conventional Bloch theory. Experimentally mapping these complex bands-relating complex momentum to complex energy-and identifying their associated eigenstates is crucial for understanding these systems but remains a significant challenge. Here, we introduce a non-Bloch supercell framework designed to overcome this challenge by decoupling Bloch phase control from the imaginary part of momentum. Our method combines an exponent-flattening protocol with twisted boundary conditions, enabling system-size-independent control of imaginary momentum while preserving high-resolution Bloch phase sampling. Implemented in programmable one- and two-dimensional acoustic crystals, our approach acquires momentum-resolved complex energy surfaces and biorthogonal eigenmodes by Green's function measurements.Data obtained using this framework accurately predict open-boundary spectra and eigenstates, findings we verify through separate open-geometry experiments. Our work provides a broadly applicable experimental toolkit for exploring non-Hermitian band geometry and topology in diverse engineered classical and quantum platforms.</description>

      <title>Parametric Phase Modulation in Superconducting Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parametric modulation is widely employed in superconducting circuits for quantum simulations and high-fidelity two-qubit gates, valued for its versatility. Conventionally, the qubit coupling strength is determined by the amplitude of the parametric flux pulse, which affects qubit parameters dramatically. In this article, we propose and implement a phase modulation scheme to tune the interaction strength via adjusting the relative phase between the parametric flux pulses applied to two coupled qubits. We characterize this modulation for sideband couplings, at both sweet and offsweet spots, achieving a broad range of coupling strengths as confirmed by both population dynamics and spectroscopy methods. This approach enables phase-controlled modulation of coupling strength, providing a promising candidate for parametrically driven quantum simulations and gate operations.</description>

      <title>Non-Markovianity in Quantum Information Processing: Interplay with Quantum Error Mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Markovian dynamics are typically present in the dynamics of open quantum systems. Despite the rich structure of non-Markovian dynamics, their relevance to quantum information processing (QIP) has been rarely discussed. In this work, we demonstrate that the negativity of the dynamics, a characteristic of non-Markovian dynamics, naturally arises in quantum error correction (QEC) and quantum teleportation. The negativity in open quantum systems is naturally attributed to the information backflow from the environment. We partition the whole Hilbert space into the logical subsystem and the gauge subsystem. The logical subsystem stores the quantum information for QIP, while the gauge subsystem stores the information for recovery of the logical information, i.e., the syndrome measurement outcomes for quantum error correction and Bell measurement outcomes for successful teleportation. We then show that the negativity in quantum information processing appears as a consequence of the feedback operation based on the measurement outcomes of the gauge subsystem. Finally, we show that the negativity of non-Markovianity in QIP reduces the sampling cost of quantum error mitigation (QEM), shedding light on the importance of combination strategies of QEC and QEM in a practical QIP.</description>

      <title>Factorizability of optimal quantum sequence discrimination under maximum-confidence measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the discrimination of quantum sequences under maximum-confidence measurements and show that the optimal discrimination of a quantum sequence ensemble can always be factorized into that of each individual ensemble. In other words, the optimal quantum sequence discrimination under maximum-confidence measurements can be achieved just by performing a maximum-confidence discrimination independently at each step of the quantum sequence. We also show that the maximum confidence of identifying a quantum sequence is to achieve the maximum confidence of identifying each state comprising the quantum sequence. We further provide a necessary and sufficient condition for the optimal quantum state discrimination under maximum-confidence measurements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a thermodynamic work extraction task that describes the energy storage enhancement of quantum systems, which is naturally related to quantum battery's charging process. This task induces majorisation-like conditions that provide a necessary and sufficient characterisation of state conversions in general quantum resource theories. When applied to specific resources, these conditions reduce to the majorisation conditions under unital channels and provide a thermodynamic version of Nielsen's theorem in entanglement theory. We show how this result establishes the first universal resource certification class based on thermodynamics, and how it can be employed to quantify general quantum resources based on work extraction.</description>

      <title>Restoring Quantum Superiority of Noisy Quantum Illumination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum illumination uses quantum entanglement as a resource to enable higher-resolution detection of low-reflectivity targets than is possible with classical techniques. This revolutionary technology could transform modern radar. However, it is widely believed that the decoherence induced by the ubiquitous quantum noise destroys the superiority of quantum illumination, severely constraining its performance and application in our present noisy intermediate-scale quantum era. Here, we propose a method to restore the quantum superiority of the quantum illumination in the presence of quantum noises. Going beyond the widely used Born-Markov approximation, we discover that the resolution of noisy quantum illumination is highly sensitive to the energy spectrum of the composite system formed by each of the two light modes and its local quantum noise. When a bound state is present in the energy spectrum, the resolution asymptotically approaches its ideal form. Our result establishes a physical principle to preserve the quantum superiority and paves the way for the realization of high-resolution quantum illumination in noisy situations.</description>

      <title>Multiplexed ion-ion entanglement over $1.2$ kilometer fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum networks and quantum repeaters represent the promising avenues for building large-scale quantum information systems, serving as foundational infrastructure for distributed quantum computing, long-distance quantum communication, and networked quantum sensing. A critical step in realizing a functional quantum network is the efficient and high-fidelity establishment of heralded entanglement between remote quantum nodes. Multiplexing offers a powerful strategy to accelerate remote entanglement distribution, particularly over long optical fibers. Here, we demonstrate the first multiplexing-enhanced heralded entanglement between two trapped-ion quantum network nodes. By multiplexing $10$ temporal photonic modes, we achieve a 4.59-fold speedup in ion-ion entanglement generation and attain an entanglement fidelity of $95.9\pm1.5\%$ over $1.2$ km of fiber. Employing a dual-type architecture, our system is readily scalable to multiple nodes, thereby establishing a key building block for future large-scale quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Robust GHz-range AC Magnetometry with an ensemble of NV Centers in Diamond using Concatenated Continuous Dynamical Decoupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sub-picotesla level magnetometry has been demonstrated using negatively-charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond by increasing the number of spins simultaneously used for sensing in an NV ensemble. However, such scale-up often introduces spatial inhomogeneities in detuning and control field amplitudes, which degrade sensitivity. Although several techniques have been utilized to overcome these challenges, including pulsed dynamical decoupling or shaped pulses, these are not generally compatible with the current state-of-the-art techniques for GHz-range AC magnetometry with NV ensembles, which are typically based on Rabi oscillations. In this work we experimentally demonstrate GHz-range AC magnetometry using a large ensemble of NV centers under spatially inhomogeneous drive fields by employing concatenated continuous dynamical decoupling, which is designed for robustness against such imperfections. We compare its performance with the conventional direct Rabi method and show that the robust dressed states in our method extend significantly the measuring range to weaker signals in GHz-range AC magnetometry.</description>

      <title>Realization of Trapped Ion Dynamics in the Strong-Field Regime and Non-Markovianity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Probing quantum dynamics in the strong-field regime is critical for advancing our understanding of controlled quantum systems and developing robust quantum technologies. In this work, we experimentally investigate the dynamics of a trapped ion where the Rabi frequency (Omega) approaches the vibrational mode frequency (nu), pushing the system beyond the weak-field regime, where non-trivial quantum correlations emerge. We begin by setting the detuning (delta) - the frequency offset between the qubit transition and the driving field - to zero and varying Omega from low to high values, eventually reaching the vibrational frequency. Using quantum state tomography, we reconstruct the density matrix and track its evolution to assess non-Markovianity, revealing significant memory effects governed by the interplay between internal and motional degrees of freedom. Furthermore, by exploring the dynamics across various parameter pairs (Omega, delta), we find that non-Markovianity does not always increase monotonically with Omega for a fixed delta. Strikingly, when the condition delta squared plus Omega squared equals nu squared is met, the non-Markovianity exhibits a circular pattern of maxima. At this parameter combination, the system's Hamiltonian takes a form similar to the Jaynes-Cummings model, enabling the possibility of analytical insights into the observed dynamics. These results go beyond the conventional carrier and sideband regimes, uncovering novel features of strong-field quantum dynamics. Our findings establish a pathway for using trapped-ion platforms to investigate non-Markovianity, coherent control, and the fundamental behavior of open quantum systems in extreme regimes.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Coherent Errors through a Decoherence-Resistant Variational Framework employing Stabilizer State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stabilizer states are a central resource in quantum information processing, underpinning a wide range of applications. While they can be efficiently generated via Clifford circuits, the presence of coherent errors, such as small-angle miscalibrations in native gate implementations, can significantly impact their quality. In this work, we introduce Variational Coherent Error Mitigation (VCEM), a method that employs the stabilizer formalism to suppress coherent errors through variational optimization of native gates parameters. VCEM demonstrates robust performance, remaining largely unaffected by incoherent noise, enabling pre-compensation of coherent errors prior to the application of standard incoherent error mitigation techniques. We demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of VCEM through numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Phenomenological Noise Models and Optimal Thresholds of the 3D Toric Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) topological codes offer the advantage of supporting fault-tolerant implementations of non-Clifford gates, yet their performance against realistic noise remains largely unexplored. In this work, we focus on the paradigmatic 3D toric code and investigate its fault-tolerance thresholds in the presence of both Pauli and measurement errors. Two randomly coupled lattice gauge models that describe the code's correctability are derived, including a random 2-form $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory. By exploiting a generalized duality technique, we show that the 3D toric code exhibits optimal thresholds of $p^{X,M}_{th} \approx 11\%$ and $p^{Z,M}_{th} \approx 2\%$ against bit-flip and phase-flip errors, respectively. These threshold values show modest reductions compared to the case of perfect measurements, establishing the robustness of the 3D toric code against measurement errors. Our results constitute a substantial advance towards assessing the practical performance of 3D topological codes. This contribution is timely and in high demand, as rapid hardware advancements are bringing complex codes into experimental reach. Moreover, our work highlights the interdisciplinary nature of fault-tolerant quantum computation and holds significant interest for quantum information science, high-energy physics, and condensed matter physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically analyze the feasibility of entanglement-based quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols considering widely used spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) and novel quantum dot (QD) sources. We account for multiphoton emission in SPDC sources and fine-structure splitting (FSS) in QD. In addition, we incorporate imperfect detection, including dark counts and limited efficiency. For SPDC sources, we confirm that the presence of vacuum and multiphoton pairs renders them unsuitable for secure device-independent (DI) QKD implementations under standard detection strategies. Conversely, in the case of QD sources, accounting for the effects of FSS, results in reduced performance of protocols. Our findings are crucial for the practical implementation of entanglement-based QKD protocols using realistic sources and detectors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In higher-order quantum computing (HOQC), one typically considers the universal transformation of unknown quantum operations, treated as blackboxes. It is also implicitly assumed that the resulting operation must act on arbitrary, and thus unknown, input states. In this work, we explore a variant of this framework in which the operation remains unknown, but the input state is fixed and known. We argue that this assumption is well-motivated in certain practical contexts, such as unitary programming, and show that classical knowledge of the input state can significantly enhance performance. Moreover, this assumption allows us to distinguish between protocols designed for pure, bipartite, and mixed states, which enables us to identify the class of mixed states for which deterministic and exact implementation becomes possible.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, quantum simulators of topological models have been extensively studied across a variety of platforms and regimes. A new promising research direction makes use of meta-atoms with multiple intrinsic degrees of freedom, which to date have been predominantly studied in the classical regime. Here, we propose a superconducting quantum simulator to study an extension of the well-known "Zig-Zag" model with long-range cross-polarization couplings using polarization transmons hosting degenerate dipole orbitals. We map the phase transitions of the extended "Zig-Zag" model both numerically and analytically using inverse participation ratios and topological invariants. We demonstrate the existence of in-gap localized trivial and Tamm edge states. With linearized meta-atoms, we show via electromagnetic modeling that the proposed arrangement closely reproduces the extended "Zig-Zag" model. This work paves the way towards experimental investigation of the previously inaccessible topological quantum many-body phenomena.</description>

      <title>Measuring weak microwave signals via current-biased Josephson Junctions II: Arriving at single-photon detection sensitivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that the current-biased Josephson junction (CBJJ) can serve as a Josephson threshold detector (JTD) for the sensitive detection of weak microwave signals. Based on the recent work (PRB {\bf 111}, 024501 (2025)) on the detection sensitive limit of the usual equilibrium JTD, here we numerically demonstrate that a non-equilibrium JTD can be alternatively utilized to implement the higher sensitive detection of a weak microwave signal, arriving at its energy quantum limit. In the presence of thermal noise, we numerically simulate the phase dynamics for the CBJJ in the JTD with the different sweep rates of the biased currents, and find that the SCDs of the JTD with and without the microwave signal input show different behaviors. It is demonstrated that, depending on how high the sweep rate of the biased current being applied, the JTD can be operated in either the equilibrium- or the non-equilibrium state. Specifically, under the rapidly non-adiabatic driving, the SCDs of the JTD are obviously insensitive to the thermal noises, which means that the non-equilibrium JTD can possess a higher achievable detection sensitivity, compared with its equilibrium state counterpart. Consequently, the non-equilibrium JTD can be utilized to implement the desired single microwave-photon detection. Also, some of the achievable performance indexes, such as the dynamic range, detection bandwidth, and the photon-number resolvability, etc., of the non-equilibrium JTD have been estimated, when it serves as a wideband microwave single-photon detector.</description>

      <title>Phase Transitions and Virtual Exceptional Points in Quantum Emitters Coupled to Dissipative Baths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling atom-photon interactions in engineered environments is central to quantum optics and emerging quantum technologies. Non-Hermitian (NH) photonic baths, where dissipation fundamentally reshapes spectral and dynamical properties, provide versatile platforms for such control. Here we investigate the relaxation dynamics of a single two-level quantum emitter coupled to the edge of a semi-infinite dissipative bosonic lattice with uniform loss. Despite the simplicity of this bath, we uncover rich dynamical phase transitions, i.e. qualitative changes in spontaneous emission decay as system parameters are varied. In particular, we establish the existence of an optimal dissipative environment for accelerated spontaneous emission. The phase transitions are traced to spectral restructuring of the resolvent, in some cases governed by the coalescence of resonance states on the second Riemann sheet. We identify these coalescences as virtual exceptional points (EPs) of resonance origin, providing a conceptual bridge with EP physics while highlighting distinctive features of infinite-dimensional NH systems. More broadly, our results illustrate how the specific nature of dissipation -- whether uniform losses, staggered losses, or dephasing -- can profoundly impact emitter relaxation, pointing to dissipation engineering as a versatile tool for quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Generating pseudo-random unitaries with a Floquet driven chaotic quantum system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore using an ergodic Floquet quantum system on a torus to generate pseudo-random unitary operators. We choose a regime of the perturbed Harper model with strong perturbations and perturbation frequency exceeding the libration frequency to ensure that the system has an ergodic region that covers phase space and lacks resonant substructure. We generate a sample of unitary operators in a finite dimensional space by computing Floquet propagators from a distribution of its control parameters. To compare the distribution of unitaries to that of a Haar-random distribution, we compute k-frame potentials from samples of numerically generated unitaries. We find that uniform distributions of 4 control parameters can generate an approximate 3-design. Distributions of fewer control parameters are required to create an approximate 3-design if the Floquet system parameters drift.</description>

      <title>Gravitationally mediated entanglement of fermionic qubits: from static to dynamical limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ the quantum Boltzmann equation to analyze the gravitationally generated entanglement between two remote qubits by considering two explicit microscopic models. A graviton propagator is employed as the mediator of the interactions, while the qubits are considered in a spatial superposition state. Such a setup, in the case of any entanglement generation, could potentially offer experimental evidence for the quantization of gravity. By treating the qubits as spin-1/2 particles in wave packets, we establish that the entanglement arises from forward scattering processes involving graviton exchanges. In our study, we consider both static and dynamical limits of the propagator and show that only in the dynamical limit such entangled states can be generated. We also show that for the microscopic model based on the fermion particles in the background of magnetic field, the amount of entanglement depends on the Larmor frequency of the qubits, rather than their masses. These effects are observed to diminish in both models as the wave packet size increases. Our findings sheds more light into the gravity mediated entanglement between two spin-1/2 particles.</description>

      <title>A Gateway to Quantum Computing for Industrial Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing is rapidly emerging as a new computing paradigm with the potential to improve decision-making, optimization, and simulation across industries. For industrial engineering (IE) and operations research (OR), this shift introduces both unprecedented opportunities and substantial challenges. The learning curve is high, and to help researchers navigate the emerging field of quantum operations research, we provide a road map of the current field of quantum operations research. We introduce the foundational principles of quantum computing, outline the current hardware and software landscape, and survey major algorithmic advances relevant to IE/OR, including quantum approaches to linear algebra, optimization, machine learning, and stochastic simulation. We then highlight applied research directions, including the importance of problem domains for driving long-term value of quantum computers and how existing classical OR models can be reformulated for quantum hardware. Recognizing the steep learning curve, we propose pathways for IE/OR researchers to develop technical fluency and engage in this interdisciplinary domain. By bridging theory with application, and emphasizing the interplay between hardware and research development, we argue that industrial engineers are uniquely positioned to shape the trajectory of quantum computing for practical problem-solving. Ultimately, we aim to lower the barrier to entry into quantum computing, motivate new collaborations, and chart future directions where quantum technologies may deliver tangible impact for industry and academia.</description>

      <title>Quantum Processing Unit (QPU) processing time Prediction with Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the application of machine learning (ML) techniques in predicting the QPU processing time of quantum jobs. By leveraging ML algorithms, this study introduces predictive models that are designed to enhance operational efficiency in quantum computing systems. Using a dataset of about 150,000 jobs that follow the IBM Quantum schema, we employ ML methods based on Gradient-Boosting (LightGBM) to predict the QPU processing times, incorporating data preprocessing methods to improve model accuracy. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of ML in forecasting quantum jobs. This improvement can have implications on improving resource management and scheduling within quantum computing frameworks. This research not only highlights the potential of ML in refining quantum job predictions but also sets a foundation for integrating AI-driven tools in advanced quantum computing operations.</description>

      <title>Computing time-dependent reduced models for classical and quantum dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel method for approximating the dynamics of a large autonomous system projected onto a fixed subspace. The core contribution is a novel recursive algorithm to construct an effective time-dependent generator that is polynomial in the time variable, ensuring accuracy for short time scales. The derivation is based on the Taylor expansion of the exponential map and a new result for computing the time-ordered exponential of polynomial generators. This work is motivated by the challenge of deriving time-convolutionless master equations in quantum physics and the proposed method offers an alternative to typical derivations based on expansions in the coupling strength. The resulting approximation is accurate for small times, does not require a weak-coupling assumption, performs better than a truncation of the exponential map at low orders, and crucially, guarantees a completely positive and trace-preserving map at the lowest orders. The proposed method is validated against several prototypical models: a dephasing spin-boson model, a central spin model, and an Ising spin chain.</description>

      <title>Classical Noise Inversion: A Practical and Optimal framework for Robust Quantum Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum error mitigation is a critical technology for extracting reliable computations from noisy quantum processors, proving itself essential not only in the near term but also as a valuable supplement to fully fault-tolerant systems in the future. However, its practical implementation is hampered by two major challenges: the expansive cost of sampling from quantum circuits and the reliance on unrealistic assumptions, such as gate-independent noise. Here, we introduce Classical Noise Inversion (CNI), a framework that fundamentally bypasses these crucial limitations and is well-suited for various quantum applications. CNI effectively inverts the accumulated noise entirely during classical post-processing, thereby eliminating the need for costly quantum circuit sampling and remaining effective under the realistic condition of gate-dependent noise. Apart from CNI, we introduce noise compression, which groups noise components with equivalent effects on measurement outcomes, achieving the optimal overhead for error mitigation. We integrate CNI with the framework of shadow estimation to create a robust protocol for learning quantum properties under general noise. Our analysis and numerical simulations demonstrate that this approach substantially reduces statistical variance while providing unbiased estimates in practical situations where previous methods fail. By transforming a key quantum overhead into a manageable classical cost, CNI opens a promising pathway towards scalable and practical quantum applications.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The energy shift of an oscillator in blackbody radiation is calculated based simply on the total energy of the interacting field-oscillator system as a function of the refractive index. For high temperatures T the energy and free-energy shifts are found to vary as -T^2 and +T^2, respectively, in agreement with the result originally obtained by Ford, Lewis, and O'Connell [Phys. Rev. Lett. 55, 2273 (1985)].</description>

      <title>Experimental differentiation and extremization with analog quantum circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solving and optimizing differential equations (DEs) is ubiquitous in both engineering and fundamental science. The promise of quantum architectures to accelerate scientific computing thus naturally involved interest towards how efficiently quantum algorithms can solve DEs. Differentiable quantum circuits (DQC) offer a viable route to compute DE solutions using a variational approach amenable to existing quantum computers, by producing a machine-learnable surrogate of the solution. Quantum extremal learning (QEL) complements such approach by finding extreme points in the output of learnable models of unknown (implicit) functions, offering a powerful tool to bypass a full DE solution, in cases where the crux consists in retrieving solution extrema. In this work, we provide the results from the first experimental demonstration of both DQC and QEL, displaying their performance on a synthetic usecase. Whilst both DQC and QEL are expected to require digital quantum hardware, we successfully challenge this assumption by running a closed-loop instance on a commercial analog quantum computer, based upon neutral atom technology.</description>

      <title>How typical is contextuality?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying when observed statistics cannot be explained by any reasonable classical model is a central problem in quantum foundations. A principled and universally applicable approach to defining and identifying nonclassicality is given by the notion of generalized noncontextuality. Here, we study the typicality of contextuality -- namely, the likelihood that randomly chosen quantum preparations and measurements produce nonclassical statistics. Using numerical linear programs to test for the existence of a generalized-noncontextual model, we find that contextuality is fairly common: even in experiments with only a modest number of random preparations and measurements, contextuality arises with probability over 99%. We also show that while typicality of contextuality decreases as the purity (sharpness) of the preparations (measurements) decreases, this dependence is not especially pronounced, so contextuality is fairly typical even in settings with realistic noise. Finally, we show that although nonzero contextuality is quite typical, quantitatively high degrees of contextuality are not as typical, and so large quantum advantages (like for parity-oblivious multiplexing, which we take as a case study) are not as typical. We provide an open-source toolbox that outputs the typicality of contextuality as a function of tunable parameters (such as lower and upper bounds on purity and other constraints on states and measurements). This toolbox can inform the design of experiments that achieve the desired typicality of contextuality for specified experimental constraints.</description>

      <title>Co-Designing Quantum Codes with Transversal Diagonal Gates via Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a multi-agent, human-in-the-loop workflow that co-designs quantum codes with prescribed transversal diagonal gates. It builds on the Subset-Sum Linear Programming (SSLP) framework (arXiv:2504.20847), which partitions basis strings by modular residues and enforces $Z$-marginal Knill-Laflamme (KL) equalities via small LPs. The workflow is powered by GPT-5 and implemented within TeXRA (https://texra.ai)-a multi-agent research assistant platform that supports an iterative tool-use loop agent and a derivation-then-edit workflow reasoning agent. We work in a LaTeX-Python environment where agents reason, edit documents, execute code, and synchronize their work to Git/Overleaf. Within this workspace, three roles collaborate: a Synthesis Agent formulates the problem; a Search Agent sweeps/screens candidates and exactifies numerics into rationals; and an Audit Agent independently checks all KL equalities and the induced logical action. As a first step we focus on distance $d=2$ with nondegenerate residues. For code dimension $K\in\{2,3,4\}$ and $n\le6$ qubits, systematic sweeps yield certificate-backed tables cataloging attainable cyclic logical groups-all realized by new codes-e.g., for $K=3$ we obtain order $16$ at $n=6$. From verified instances, Synthesis Agent abstracts recurring structures into closed-form families and proves they satisfy the KL equalities for all parameters. It further demonstrates that SSLP accommodates residue degeneracy by exhibiting a new $((6,4,2))$ code implementing the transversal controlled-phase $diag(1,1,1,i)$. Overall, the workflow recasts diagonal-transversal feasibility as an analytical pipeline executed at scale, combining systematic enumeration with exact analytical reconstruction. It yields reproducible code constructions, supports targeted extensions to larger $K$ and higher distances, and leads toward data-driven classification.</description>

      <title>Optimal constant-cost implementations of Clifford operations using global interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate quantum circuits built from arbitrary single-qubit operations combined with programmable all-to-all multiqubit entangling gates that are native to, among other systems, trapped-ion quantum computing platforms. We report a constant-cost of no more than four applications of such Clifford entangling multiqubit gates to realize any sequence of Clifford operations of any length, without ancillae, which is the theoretically optimal gate count cost. We do this by implementing any sequence of CNOT gates of any length with four applications of such gates, without ancillae, and show that the extension to general Clifford operations incurs no additional cost. We investigate the required qubit drive power that is associated with our implementation and show that it is lower than that of a standard approach. Our work introduces a practical and computationally efficient algorithm to realize these compilations.</description>

      <title>Quantum Sensing of Gravitational Frame-Dragging with a Superfluid $^4$He Gyrometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a laboratory-scale experiment to locally measure the general relativistic frame-dragging effect on Earth using the macroscopic quantum properties of a novel superfluid $^4$He single Josephson junction gyrometer. We derive the frame-dragging and related geodetic and Thomas effects in the superfluid gyrometer and present a procedure for their experimental measurement. We compute the expected thermal noise floor and find that very high sensitivity can be expected at millikelvin temperatures, where near-future Josephson junctions using nanoporous 2D materials are expected to operate. Assuming utilization of the lowest mechanical loss materials, we find a noise spectral density of $5\times 10^{-17}$ rads/s/$\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ at 10 mK, which is sufficient to resolve the frame-dragging rate to 0.2% within one second of measurement, giving a rotational sensitivity of 1 revolution in 4 Byrs. This extreme sensitivity to rotation corresponds to a measurement of proper time differences as small as $10^{-35}$ s.</description>

      <title>The complexity of perfect quantum state classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of quantum state classification asks how accurately one can identify an unknown quantum state that is promised to be drawn from a known set of pure states. In this work, we introduce the notion of $k$-learnability, which captures the ability to identify the correct state using at most $k$ guesses, with zero error. We show that deciding whether a given family of states is $k$-learnable can be solved via semidefinite programming. When there are $n$ states, we present polynomial-time (in $n$) algorithms for determining $k$-learnability for two cases: when $k$ is a fixed constant or the dimension of the states is a fixed constant. When both $k$ and the dimension of the states are part of the input, we prove that there exist succinct certificates placing the problem in NP, and we establish NP-hardness by a reduction from the classical $k$-clique problem. Together, our findings delineate the boundary between efficiently solvable and intractable instances of quantum state classification in the perfect (zero-error) regime.</description>

      <title>Analog Quantum Feature Selection with Neutral-Atom Quantum Processors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a quantum-native approach to quantum feature selection (QFS) based on analog quantum simulation with neutral atom arrays, adaptable to a variety of academic and industrial applications. In our method, feature relevance-measured via mutual information with the target-is encoded as local detuning amplitudes, while feature redundancy is embedded through distance-dependent van der Waals interactions, constrained by the Rydberg blockade radius. The system is evolved adiabatically toward low-energy configurations, and the resulting measurement bitstrings are used to extract physically consistent subsets of features. The protocol is evaluated through simulations on three benchmark binary classification datasets: Adult Income, Bank Marketing, and Telco Churn. Compared to classical methods such as mutual information ranking and Boruta, combined with XGBoost and Random Forest classifiers, our quantum-computing approach achieves competitive or superior performance. In particular, for compact subsets of 2-5 features, analog QFS improves mean AUC scores by 1.5-2.3% while reducing the number of features by 75-84%, offering interpretable, low-redundancy solutions. These results demonstrate that programmable Rydberg arrays offer a viable platform for intelligent feature selection with practical relevance in machine learning pipelines, capable of transforming computational quantum advantage into industrial quantum usefulness.</description>

      <title>A Quantum-Inspired Algorithm for Solving Sudoku Puzzles and the MaxCut Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose and evaluate a quantum-inspired algorithm for solving Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems, which are mathematically equivalent to finding ground states of Ising spin-glass Hamiltonians. The algorithm employs Matrix Product States (MPS) to compactly represent large superpositions of spin configurations and utilizes a discrete driving schedule to guide the MPS toward the ground state. At each step, a driver Hamiltonian -- incorporating a transverse magnetic field -- is combined with the problem Hamiltonian to enable spin flips and facilitate quantum tunneling. The MPS is updated using the standard Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) method, which iteratively minimizes the system's energy via multiple sweeps across the spin chain. Despite its heuristic nature, the algorithm reliably identifies global minima, not merely near-optimal solutions, across diverse QUBO instances. We first demonstrate its effectiveness on intermediate-level Sudoku puzzles from publicly available sources, involving over $200$ Ising spins with long-range couplings dictated by constraint satisfaction. We then apply the algorithm to MaxCut problems from the Biq Mac library, successfully solving instances with up to $251$ nodes and $3,265$ edges. We discuss the advantages of this quantum-inspired approach, including its scalability, generalizability, and suitability for industrial-scale QUBO applications.</description>

      <title>A unified picture of phonon anomalies in crystals and glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phonon spectra in solids often display anomalies that defy the simple Debye law, most prominently the van Hove singularity in crystals and the boson peak in glasses. Although traditionally regarded as distinct, both features are increasingly recognized as sharing a common physical origin. In a recent work, G. Ding et al. (Nat. Phys. 2025) propose a resonant-damping model that unifies these anomalies within a single framework. By coupling phonon damping to vibrational softening, their theory explains why some materials exhibit van Hove peaks, others boson peaks, and many show both. This advance extends earlier ideas and theories of Baggioli and Zaccone on the competition between phonon propagation and damping, while also connecting to microscopic mechanisms such as nonaffine motions in glasses. The resonant-damping paradigm thus offers a promising step toward a unified understanding of vibrational anomalies across ordered and disordered solids.</description>

      <title>Beyond Qubits: Multilevel Quantum Sensing for Dark Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum sensing with qubits has advanced fundamental physics searches, but higher dimensional systems offer untapped potential. We present a universal qutrit framework that yields a sequence-independent fourfold increase in quantum Fisher information and a twofold gain in sensitivity. In ultralight dark matter searches, spin-1 NV-center qutrits can enhance the axion-electron coupling reach by an order of magnitude beyond qubits. This principle applies broadly to multilevel quantum systems including superconducting, neutral atom and trapped-ion qutrits, establishing higher dimensional sensing as a powerful tool for probing new physics.</description>

      <title>Probing the Hierarchy of Genuine Multipartite Entanglement with Generalized Latent Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce generalization of the recently proposed Latent Entropy (L-entropy) [1] as a refined measure of genuine multipartite entanglement (GME) in pure states of $n$-party quantum systems. Generalized L-entropy satisfies the axioms required for a valid GME measure and provides a natural ordering among $k$-uniform states maximizing for absolutely maximally entangled states (AME), effectively capturing the hierarchical structure of multipartite entanglement. We analyze the behavior of this measure for $n$-party Haar-random states and demonstrate that, in the large local-dimension limit, the maximal L-entropy saturates its upper bound for odd $n$, while for even $n$ it approaches the bound asymptotically. Furthermore, we apply this framework to examine multipartite entanglement properties of quantum states in several variants of the Sachdev--Ye--Kitaev (SYK) model, including SYK$_4$, SYK$_2$, mass-deformed SYK, sparse SYK, and $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric SYK. The results demonstrate that the generalized L-entropy serves as a sensitive probe of multipartite entanglement, revealing how deformations influence quantum entanglement structure in such strongly interacting systems.</description>

      <title>Dimensionality-Changing Transition from a Non-Fermi Liquid to a Spin-Solid in a Multichannel Kondo Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A multichannel Kondo system, where a single quantum spin couples to multiple channels of an electronic bath, provides one of the simplest examples of a zero-dimensional non-Fermi liquid. It is natural to ask: what happens when an extensive number of such systems are coupled together? A simple renormalization group argument implies that in a chain of SU(N) multichannel quantum systems, where each spin is coupled to its own bath of K channels, the individual spins dynamically decouple at low energy when N&gt;K, resulting in a 'sliding' non-Fermi liquid. Using Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations, we find evidences of a continuous, 'dimensionality-changing' phase transition out of this non-Fermi liquid into a valence-bond solid phase as the intersite coupling is increased. Remarkably, at the critical point, correlations exhibit a power-law behavior even along the direction in which the spins are coupled, indicating the breakdown of dynamical decoupling at the transition. We also develop an RG scheme to understand the universal aspects of this transition.</description>

      <title>Fabrication and Structural Analysis of Trilayers for Tantalum Josephson Junctions with Ta$_2$O$_5$ Barriers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tantalum (Ta) has recently emerged as a promising low-loss material, enabling record coherence times in superconducting qubits. This enhanced performance is largely attributed to its stable native oxide, which is believed to host fewer two-level system (TLS) defects key $-$ contributors to decoherence in superconducting circuits. Nevertheless, aluminum oxide (AlO$_x$) remains the predominant choice for Josephson junction barriers in most qubit architectures. In this study, we systematically investigate various techniques for forming high-quality oxide layers on $\alpha$-phase tantalum ($\alpha$-Ta) thin films, aiming to develop effective Josephson junction barriers. We explore thermal oxidation in a tube furnace, rapid thermal annealing, as well as plasma oxidation of both room-temperature and heated Ta films, and propose a mechanistic picture of the underlying oxidation mechanisms. All methods yield Ta$_2$O$_5$, the same compound as tantalum's native oxide. Among these, plasma oxidation produces the smoothest and highest-quality oxide layers, making it particularly well-suited for Josephson junction fabrication. Furthermore, we demonstrate the successful epitaxial growth of $\alpha$-Ta atop oxidized $\alpha$-Ta films, paving the way for the realization of trilayer Ta/Ta-O/Ta Josephson junctions with clean, low-loss interfaces.</description>

      <title>Circuit-based cavity magnonics in the ultrastrong and deep-strong coupling regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically study nonperturbative strong-coupling phenomena in cavity magnonics systems in which the uniform magnetization dynamics (magnons) in a ferromagnet is coupled to the microwave magnetic field (photons) of a single LC resonator. Starting from an effective circuit model that accounts for the magnetization dynamics described by the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation, we show that a nontrivial frequency shift emerges in the ultrastrong and deep-strong coupling regimes, whose microscopic origin remains elusive within a purely classical framework. The circuit model is further quantized to derive a minimal quantum mechanical model for generic cavity magnonics, which corresponds to a two-mode version of the Hopfield Hamiltonian and explains the mechanism of the frequency shifts found in the {\it classical} circuit model. We also formulate the relation between the frequency shift and quantum quantities, such as the ground-state particle number, quantum fluctuations associated with the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, and entanglement entropy, providing a nondestructive means to experimentally access to these quantum resources. By utilizing soft magnons in an anisotropic ferromagnet, we further demonstrate that these quantum quantities diverge at the zeros of the magnon band edges as a function of the external magnetic field. This work paves the way for cavity magnonics beyond the conventional strong coupling regime.</description>

      <title>A Full Stack Framework for High Performance Quantum-Classical Computing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To address the growing needs for scalable High Performance Computing (HPC) and Quantum Computing (QC) integration, we present our HPC-QC full stack framework and its hybrid workload development capability with modular hardware/device-agnostic software integration approach. The latest development in extensible interfaces for quantum programming, dispatching, and compilation within existing mature HPC programming environment are demonstrated. Our HPC-QC full stack enables high-level, portable invocation of quantum kernels from commercial quantum SDKs within HPC meta-program in compiled languages (C/C++ and Fortran) as well as Python through a quantum programming interface library extension. An adaptive circuit knitting hypervisor is being developed to partition large quantum circuits into sub-circuits that fit on smaller noisy quantum devices and classical simulators. At the lower-level, we leverage Cray LLVM-based compilation framework to transform and consume LLVM IR and Quantum IR (QIR) from commercial quantum software frontends in a retargetable fashion to different hardware architectures. Several hybrid HPC-QC multi-node multi-CPU and GPU workloads (including solving linear system of equations, quantum optimization, and simulating quantum phase transitions) have been demonstrated on HPE EX supercomputers to illustrate functionality and execution viability for all three components developed so far. This work provides the framework for a unified quantum-classical programming environment built upon classical HPC software stack (compilers, libraries, parallel runtime and process scheduling).</description>

      <title>Kondo breakdown induced by the non-Hermitian complex hybridization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, a non-Hermitian Anderson impurity model with one-body loss has been studied in [Phys. Rev. B 111, 125157 (2025)}], and it has been demonstrated that the renormalization effect generated by strong correlations counterintuitively changes the nature of dissipation into an emergent many-body dissipation that causes a Kondo breakdown. In a closely related context, it is also known that two-body loss in a non-Hermitian Kondo model triggers the Kondo breakdown. To elucidate the essence of these phenomena, we study the Anderson impurity model with a non-Hermitian complex hybridization as an effective model that provides a simple understanding of the Kondo breakdown. Using the slave-boson mean-field theory, we show that this model can explain the Kondo breakdown with a single complex parameter. Furthermore, we provide the exact Bethe ansatz solutions that support the results obtained by the slave-boson mean-field theory. Finally, we point out that the Lehmann representation for the non-Hermitian Green function cannot be obtained by the analytic continuation to the complex energy upon the Kondo breakdown, where the analyticity of the non-Hermitian Green function in the half-complex-$\omega$ plane no longer holds.</description>

      <title>Emergent time and more from wavefunction collapse in general relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we further develop a recently proposed theory of time based on wavefunction collapse in general relativity. It is based on the postulations that quantum states, which violate the momentum and Hamiltonian constraints, represent instances of time, and stochastic fluctuations of the lapse and shift generate the time evolution under which an initial state gradually collapses toward a diffeomorphism-invariant state. Under the wavefunction collapse, the scale factor monotonically increases, thus acting as a clock. The scalar, vector, and tensor gravitons arise as physical excitations, and the arrow of time for their evolution is set by the initial state. In the long-time limit, the tensor gravitons exhibit emergent unitary dynamics. However, the extra modes are strongly damped due to the non-unitary dynamics that suppress the constraint-violating excitations. The vector mode is uniformly suppressed over all length scales, but the decay rate of the scalar is proportional to its wave vector. This makes the latter a viable candidate for dark matter; excitations with large wavelengths survive over long periods, contributing to long-range interactions, while the fast decay of short-wavelength modes renders them undetectable without sufficient temporal resolution. These are demonstrated for the cosmological constant-dominated universe through semi-classical and adiabatic approximations, which are controlled in the limit of large space dimension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Protecting qubits from perturbations is a central challenge in quantum computing. Topological superconductors with separated Majorana bound states (MBSs) provide a strong form of protection that only depends on the locality of perturbations. While the link between MBS separation, robust degeneracy, and protected braiding is well understood in non-interacting systems, recent experimental progress in short quantum-dot-based Kitaev chains highlights the need to establish these connections rigorously for interacting systems. We do this by defining MBSs from many-body ground states and show how their locality constrains their coupling to an environment. This, in turn, quantifies the protection of the energy degeneracy and the feasibility of non-abelian braiding.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use a braiding nonequilibrium fluctuation dissipation relation linking the DC noise to the response function inferred from the braiding constraint in the time-domain with a phase $\theta$ within the UNEPT (Unified Non equilibrium Perturbative Theory). By applying the Kramers-Kr\"onig relations, we obtain an integral equation connecting DC current and noise that involves $\theta$. By specifying to thermal states so that noise is Poissonian, we find an analytical solution for the DC current via the Wiener-Hopf technique. It reveals that the time-braiding phase is determined by the scaling dimension~$\delta$. This questions the universality of $\theta$ that can reflect the microscopic edge dynamics, in contrast to the topologically protected braiding phase in the space domain.</description>

Abstract: We establish a framework with reflection positivity as the first principle for constructing the boundary theory of topologically ordered quantum spin systems. Assuming reflection positivity, we prove the equivalence between the non-degeneracy of the ground state on the sphere and the local-indistinguishability of local ground states of a frustration-free Hamiltonian. We apply the Osterwalder-Schrader (OS) reconstruction to construct the local symmetric operator algebras, which characterize the emergent categorical symmetry in the ground states.</description>

      <title>Theta-term in Russian Doll Model: phase structure, quantum metric and BPS multifractality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the phase structure of the deterministic and disordered versions of the Russian Doll Model (RDM), which is a generalization of Richardson model of superconductivity in a finite system with time-reversal symmetry breaking parameter $\theta$. It is one of the simplest examples of the cyclic RG where $\log N$ plays the role of the RG time. The deterministic model is integrable and shares the same Bethe Ansatz (BA) equations with the inhomogeneous twisted XXX spin chain. We analyze the quantum metric, the Berry curvature, and the fractal dimension in the sector with a single Cooper pair. A rich phase structure in the $(\theta,\gamma)$ parameter plane is found, where $\gamma \log N$ quantifies the hopping term.
  For the deterministic RDM we clearly identify the extended domain of non-ergodic multifractal phase on the $(\theta,\gamma)$ parameter plane supporting the reentrance transitions between the localized, ergodic, and multifractal phases. We find the pattern of phase transitions in the global charge $Q(\theta,\gamma)$, which arises from the BA equation. In particular, in the multifractal phase in the deterministic model $Q(\gamma)$ exhibits the analogue of "charge concentration" and fortuity phenomena discussed in the context of black hole microstates at finite $N$. The BA equations in RDM exactly coincide with the equations defining the ground states in the theory on the worldvolume of the vortex strings in $N_F=2N_C$ ${\cal N}=2$ SQCD at a strong coupling point $\frac{1}{g_{YM}^2}=0$ with identification $\theta_{RDM}= \theta_{4D}-\pi$. We conjecture that the Hamiltonian of the RDM model describes the mixing in particular 2d-4d BPS sector of the Hilbert space. Our findings provide an example of the BPS multifractality regime for the probe operator in the sector of Hilbert space, and we comment on the possible application to dense QCD with $\theta$ term.</description>

      <title>Trapping, manipulating and probing ultracold atoms: a quantum technologies tutorial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Engineered ultracold atomic systems are a valuable platform for fundamental quantum mechanics studies and the development of quantum technologies. At near zero absolute temperature, atoms exhibit macroscopic phase coherence and collective quantum behavior, enabling their use in precision metrology, quantum simulation, and even information processing. This review provides an introductory overview of the key techniques used to trap, manipulate, and detect ultracold atoms, while highlighting the main applications of each method. We outline the principles of laser cooling, magnetic and optical trapping, and the most widely used techniques, including optical lattices and tweezers. Next, we discuss the manipulation methods of atomic internal and external degrees of freedom, and we present atom interferometry techniques and how to leverage and control interatomic interactions. Next, we review common ensemble detection strategies, including absorption and fluorescence imaging, state-selective readout, correlation and quantum non-demolition measurements and conclude with high-resolution approaches. This review aims to provide newcomers to the field with a broad understanding of the experimental toolkit that underpins research in ultracold atom physics and its applications across quantum science and technology.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Cavity-Magnon Optomechanics: Tailoring Bipartite and Tripartite Macroscopic Entanglement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15111v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cavity optomechanics, providing an inherently nonlinear interaction between photons and phonons, have shown enomerous potential in generating macroscopic quantum entanglement. Here we propose to realize diverse bipartite and tripartite entanglement in cavity-magnon optomechanics. By introducing magnons to standard cavity optomechanics, not only tunable optomechanical entanglement and magnon-magnon entanglement can be achieved, but also flexible tripartite entanglement including magnon-photon-phonon entanglement, magnon-magnon-photon and -phonon entanglement can be generated. Moreover, optimal bipartite and tripartite entanglement can be achieved by tuning parameters. We further show that all entanglement can be enhanced via engineering the magnon-photon coupling, and is proven to be robust against the bath temperature within the survival temperature. Besides, we find that the optomechanical entanglement can be protected or restored by bad magnons with large decay rate, while other entanglement is severely reduced. The results indicate that our proposal provides a novel avenue to explore and control tunable macroscopic quantum effects in hybrid cavity-magnon optomechanics.</description>

Abstract: Conditional displacement with a qubit ancilla is a critical component in continuous-variable error correction protocols. We present the generalized conditional displacement operator, conditioned on a qudit ancilla, and explore potential implementations.

      <title>Clustering of conditional mutual information and quantum Markov structure at arbitrary temperatures</title>

Abstract: Recent investigations have unveiled exotic quantum phases that elude characterization by simple bipartite correlation functions. In these phases, long-range entanglement arising from tripartite correlations plays a central role. Consequently, the study of multipartite correlations has become a focal point in modern physics. In these, Conditional Mutual Information (CMI) is one of the most well-established information-theoretic measures, adept at encapsulating the essence of various exotic phases, including topologically ordered ones. Within the realm of quantum many-body physics, it has been a long-sought goal to establish a quantum analog to the Hammersley--Clifford theorem that bridges the two concepts of the Gibbs state and the Markov network. This theorem posits that the correlation length of CMI remains short-range across all thermal equilibrium quantum phases. In this work, we demonstrate that CMI exhibits exponential decay with respect to distance, with its correlation length increasing polynomially with respect to the inverse temperature. While this clustering theorem has previously been believed to hold for high temperatures devoid of thermal phase transitions, it has remained elusive at low temperatures, where genuine long-range entanglement can exist due to the quantum topological order. Our findings unveil that, even at low temperatures, a broad class of tripartite entanglement cannot manifest in the long-range regime. To achieve the proof, we establish a comprehensive formalism for analyzing the locality of effective Hamiltonians on subsystems, commonly known as the entanglement Hamiltonian or Hamiltonian of mean force. As an outcome of our analyses, we improve the prior clustering theorem for bipartite entanglement. In essence, this means that we investigate genuine bipartite entanglement that extends beyond the limitations of the Positive Partial Transpose (PPT) class.</description>

      <title>Optimization by Decoded Quantum Interferometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08292v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Achieving superpolynomial speedups for optimization has long been a central goal for quantum algorithms. Here we introduce Decoded Quantum Interferometry (DQI), a quantum algorithm that uses the quantum Fourier transform to reduce optimization problems to decoding problems. For approximating optimal polynomial fits over finite fields, DQI achieves a superpolynomial speedup over known classical algorithms. The speedup arises because the problem's algebraic structure is reflected in the decoding problem, which can be solved efficiently. We then investigate whether this approach can achieve speedup for optimization problems that lack algebraic structure but have sparse clauses. These problems reduce to decoding LDPC codes, for which powerful decoders are known. To test this, we construct a max-XORSAT instance where DQI finds an approximate optimum significantly faster than general-purpose classical heuristics, such as simulated annealing. While a tailored classical solver can outperform DQI on this instance, our results establish that combining quantum Fourier transforms with powerful decoding primitives provides a promising new path toward quantum speedups for hard optimization problems.</description>

      <title>Comparing quantum and classical Monte Carlo algorithms for estimating Betti numbers of clique complexes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16934v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Several quantum and classical Monte Carlo algorithms for Betti Number Estimation (BNE) on clique complexes have recently been proposed, though it is unclear how their performances compare. We review these algorithms, emphasising their common Monte Carlo structure within a new modular framework. We derive upper bounds for the number of samples needed to reach a given level of precision, and use them to compare these algorithms. By recombining the different modules, we create a new quantum algorithm with an exponentially-improved dependence in the sample complexity. We run classical simulations to verify convergence within the theoretical bounds and observe the predicted exponential separation, even though empirical convergence occurs substantially earlier than the conservative theoretical bounds.</description>

      <title>Effective Distance of Higher Dimensional HGPs and Weight-Reduced Quantum LDPC Codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02193v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum error correction plays a prominent role in the realization of quantum computation, and quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes are believed to be practically useful stabilizer codes. While qLDPC codes are defined to have constant weight parity-checks, the weight of these parity checks could be large constants that make implementing these codes challenging. Large constants can also result in long syndrome extraction times and bad error propagation that can impact error correction performance. Hastings recently introduced weight reduction techniques for qLDPC codes that reduce the weight of the parity checks as well as the maximum number of checks that acts on any data qubit. However, the fault tolerance of these techniques remains an open question. In this paper, we analyze the effective distance of the weight-reduced code when single-ancilla syndrome extraction circuits are considered for error correction. We prove that there exists single-ancilla syndrome extraction circuits that largely preserve the effective distance of the weight-reduced qLDPC codes. In addition, we also show that the distance balancing technique introduced by Evra et al. preserves effective distance. As a corollary, our result shows that higher-dimensional hypergraph product (HGP) codes, also known as homological product codes corresponding to the product of 1-complexes, have no troublesome hook errors when using any single-ancilla syndrome extraction circuit.</description>

Abstract: Classical shadow tomography has become a powerful tool in learning about quantum states prepared on a quantum computer. Recent works have used classical shadows to variationally enforce N-representability conditions on the 2-particle reduced density matrix. In this paper, we build upon previous research by choice of an improved estimator within classical shadow tomography and rephrasing the optimisation constraints, resulting in an overall enhancement in performance under comparable measurement shot budgets. We further explore the specific regimes where these methods outperform the unbiased estimator of the standalone classical shadow protocol and quantify the potential savings in numerical studies.</description>

      <title>Estimating time in quantum chaotic systems and black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19885v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We characterize new universal features of the dynamics of chaotic quantum many-body systems, by considering a hypothetical task of "time estimation." Most macroscopic observables in a chaotic system equilibrate to nearly constant late-time values. Intuitively, it should become increasingly difficult to estimate the precise value of time by making measurements on the state. We use a quantity called the Fisher information from quantum metrology to quantify the minimum uncertainty in estimating time. Due to unitarity, the uncertainty in the time estimate does not grow with time if we have access to optimal measurements on the full system. Restricting the measurements to act on a small subsystem or to have low computational complexity leads to results expected from equilibration, where the time uncertainty becomes large at late times. With optimal measurements on a subsystem larger than half of the system, we regain the ability to estimate the time very precisely, even at late times.
  Hawking's calculation for the reduced density matrix of the black hole radiation in semiclassical gravity contradicts our general predictions for unitary quantum chaotic systems. Hawking's state always has a large uncertainty for attempts to estimate the time using the radiation, whereas our general results imply that the uncertainty should become small after the Page time. This gives a new version of the black hole information loss paradox in terms of the time estimation task. By restricting to simple measurements on the radiation, the time uncertainty becomes large. This indicates from a new perspective that the observations of computationally bounded agents are consistent with the semiclassical effective description of gravity.</description>

      <title>The surface code beyond Pauli channels: Logical noise coherence, information-theoretic measures, and errorfield-double phenomenology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.21055v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the surface code under errors featuring both coherent and incoherent components and study the coherence of the corresponding logical noise channel and how this impacts information-theoretic measures of code performance, namely coherent information and quantum relative entropy. Using numerical simulations and developing a phenomenological field theory, focusing on the most general single-qubit X-error channel, we show that, for any nonzero incoherent noise component, the coherence of the logical noise is exponentially suppressed with the code distance. We also find that the information-theoretic measures require this suppression to detect optimal thresholds for Pauli recovery; for this they thus require increasingly large distances for increasing error coherence and ultimately break down for fully coherent errors. To obtain our results, we develop a statistical mechanics mapping and a corresponding matrix-product-state algorithm for approximate syndrome sampling. These methods enable the large scale simulation of these non-Pauli errors, including their maximum-likelihood thresholds, away from the limits captured by previous approaches.</description>

      <title>Converse bounds for quantum hypothesis exclusion: A divergence-radius approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09712v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hypothesis exclusion is an information-theoretic task in which an experimenter aims at ruling out a false hypothesis from a finite set of known candidates, and an error occurs if and only if the hypothesis being ruled out is the ground truth. For the tasks of quantum state exclusion and quantum channel exclusion -- where hypotheses are represented by quantum states and quantum channels, respectively -- efficiently computable upper bounds on the asymptotic error exponents were established in a recent work of the current authors [Ji et al., arXiv:2407.13728 (2024)], where the derivation was based on nonasymptotic analysis. In this companion paper of our previous work, we provide alternative proofs for the same upper bounds on the asymptotic error exponents of quantum state and channel exclusion, but using a conceptually different approach from the one adopted in the previous work. Specifically, we apply strong converse results for asymmetric binary hypothesis testing to distinguishing an arbitrary ``dummy'' hypothesis from each of the concerned candidates. This leads to the desired upper bounds in terms of divergence radii via a geometrically inspired argument.</description>

Abstract: Squeezed vacuum, a fundamental resource for continuous-variable quantum information processing, has been used to demonstrate quantum advantages in sensing, communication, and computation. While most experiments use homodyne detection to characterize squeezing and are therefore limited to electronic bandwidths, recent experiments have shown optical parametric amplification (OPA) to be a viable measurement strategy. Here, we realize OPA-based quantum state tomography in integrated photonics and demonstrate the generation and all-optical Wigner tomography of squeezed vacuum in a nanophotonic circuit. We employ dispersion-engineering to enable the distortion-free propagation of femtosecond pulses and achieve ultrabroad operation bandwidths, effectively lifting the speed restrictions imposed by traditional electronics on quantum measurements with a theoretical maximum clock speed of 6.5 THz. We implement our circuit on thin-film lithium niobate, a platform compatible with a wide variety of active and passive photonic components. Our results chart a course for realizing all-optical ultrafast quantum information processing in an integrated room-temperature platform.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05094v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The mean of a random variable can be understood as a linear functional on the space of probability distributions. Quantum computing is known to provide a quadratic speedup over classical Monte Carlo methods for mean estimation. In this paper, we investigate whether a similar quadratic speedup is achievable for estimating non-linear functionals of probability distributions. We propose a quantum-inside-quantum Monte Carlo algorithm that achieves such a speedup for a broad class of non-linear estimation problems, including nested conditional expectations and stochastic optimization. Our algorithm improves upon the direct application of the quantum multilevel Monte Carlo algorithm introduced by An et al. (2021). The existing lower bound indicates that our algorithm is optimal up polylogarithmic factors. A key innovation of our approach is a new sequence of multilevel Monte Carlo approximations specifically designed for quantum computing, which is central to the algorithm's improved performance.</description>

      <title>Interference and Measurement: Changing amplitude phase information to amplitude magnitude information</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14793v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There are quantum procedures that encode the solutions to a problem in the phases of quantum amplitudes. This happens in some quantum optimization algorithms in which the value of a function to be maximized or minimized is represented by a phase. An example of this is the QAOA algorithm for the MaxCut problem in which one encodes the number of edges connecting the sets resulting from a partition of the vertices of a graph into phases of amplitudes of a quantum state. Another is the minimum vertex cover problem in which the number of edges included in the cover is encoded in phases. Here we want to see what can be done if we only use simple aspects of quantum mechanics, interference and measurement, to manipulate the magnitudes of the amplitudes whose phases encode the relevant information. The idea is to use constructive interference to enhance the amplitudes that contain useful information and destructive interference to suppress those that do not. We examine examples, both analytically and numerically. We also show how the results of sequences of measurements can be used to gain information about the landscape of solutions.</description>

Abstract: High-fidelity, meter-scale microwave interconnects between superconducting quantum processor modules are a key technology for extending system size beyond constraints imposed by device manufacturing equipment, yield, and signal delivery. Although tomographic experiments have been used in previous demonstrations for benchmarking remote state transfer between modules, they do not reliably separate State Preparation and Measurement (SPAM) error from the error per state transfer. Recent developments based on randomized benchmarking provide a compatible theory for separating these two errors. In this work, we present a module-to-module interconnect based on Tunable-Coupling Qubits (TCQs) and benchmark, in a SPAM-error-tolerant manner enabled by a frame-tracking technique, a remote state transfer fidelity of 0.988 across a 60cm-long coplanar waveguide (CPW). The state transfer is implemented via a superadiabatic transitionless driving method, which suppresses intermediate excitation in the internal modes of the CPW. We further propose and construct a remote CNOT gate between modules, composed of local CZ gates in each module and remote state transfers, and report a gate fidelity of 0.933 using the randomized benchmarking method. The remote CNOT construction and benchmarking we present provide a way to fully characterize the module-to-module link operation and standardize reporting fidelity, analogous to randomized benchmarking protocols for other quantum gates.</description>

      <title>Learning-Driven Annealing with Adaptive Hamiltonian Modification for Solving Large-Scale Problems on Quantum Devices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.21246v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present Learning-Driven Annealing (LDA), a framework that links individual quantum annealing evolutions into a global solution strategy to mitigate hardware constraints such as short annealing times and integrated control errors. Unlike other iterative methods, LDA does not tune the annealing procedure (e.g. annealing time or annealing schedule), but instead learns about the problem structure to adaptively modify the problem Hamiltonian. By deforming the instantaneous energy spectrum, LDA suppresses transitions into high-energy states and focuses the evolution into low-energy regions of the Hilbert space. We demonstrate the efficacy of LDA by developing a hybrid quantum-classical solver for large-scale spin glasses. The hybrid solver is based on a comprehensive study of the internal structure of spin glasses, outperforming other quantum and classical algorithms (e.g., reverse annealing, cyclic annealing, simulated annealing, Gurobi, Toshiba's SBM, VeloxQ and D-Wave hybrid) on 5580-qubit problem instances in both runtime and lowest energy. LDA is a step towards practical quantum computation that enables today's quantum devices to compete with classical solvers.</description>

      <title>SSR: A Swapping-Sweeping-and-Rewriting Optimizer for Quantum Circuit Transformation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03227v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum circuit transformation (QCT), necessary for adapting any quantum circuit to the qubit connectivity constraints of the NISQ device, often introduces numerous additional SWAP gates into the original circuit, increasing the circuit depth and thus reducing the success rate of computation. To minimize the depth of QCT circuits, we propose a Swapping-Sweeping-and-Rewriting optimizer. This optimizer rearranges the circuit based on generalized gate commutation rules via a genetic algorithm, extracts subcircuits consisting of CNOT gates using a circuit sweeping technique, and rewrites each subcircuit with a functionally equivalent and depth-optimal circuit generated by an SAT solver. The devised optimizer effectively captures the intrinsic patterns of the QCT circuits, and the experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm can significantly reduce the depth of QCT circuits, 26.68\% at most and 12.18\% on average, across all benchmark circuits.</description>

Abstract: Entanglement is a fundamental resource for many applications in quantum information processing. Here, we investigate how quantum transport in simple quantum graphs, modeled as controlled two-level quantum systems, can be utilized to generate entangled states through coherent control operations between two simple quantum graphs. A controlled operation is defined such that the scattering behavior of one quantum graph dynamically modifies the other. Our analysis reveals the precise conditions under which maximal entanglement or separability arises, including configurations that can be implemented via phase shifts in graph structures. Our findings demonstrate that the maximal entanglement in this system is closely related to recent results on randomized quantum graphs. These results provide new pathways for engineering entanglement using simple quantum graphs and suggest experimental feasibility using microwave networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15941v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a general framework for generating single- and multimode qubit-conditional operations by extending cross-resonant driving to a generalized multimode scheme. This includes single-mode conditional displacements and squeezing induced by one- and two-photon cross-resonant drives in the presence of one- and two-photon qubit-oscillator interactions, respectively. In the multimode setting, we derive multimode qubit-conditional joint displacement, beamsplitter and two-mode squeezing operations. This framework enables the realization of arbitrary multimode qubit-conditional operations, which are of great importance to bosonic quantum error correction, phase estimation and quantum simulations.</description>

      <title>Recoherence, adiabaticity, and Markovianity in Gaussian maps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18648v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent discovery of situations where cosmological fluctuations recohere during inflation, we investigate the relationship between quantum recoherence (late-time purification after a transient phase of decoherence), adiabaticity, and Markovianity. To that end, we study a simple setup of two linearly-coupled harmonic oscillators, and compute the purity of one oscillator when the interaction is switched off. We find that there exists a critical value for the coupling strength below which the purity oscillates and above which it decays exponentially. This decay cannot be captured by perturbation theory; hence, decoherence is always a non-perturbative phenomenon. When the interaction is turned off, the purity either freezes to its value prior to the turn-off, or it smoothly goes back to a value very close to one (recoherence). This depends on the rate at which the turn-off occurs. We thus develop a new adiabatic-expansion scheme and find complete recoherence at any finite order in the inverse turn-off time. Therefore, decoherence is always a non-adiabatic effect. The critical value of the turn-off time above which recoherence takes place is then expressed in terms of the other time scales of the problem. Finally, we show that the dynamics of the system is never Markovian, even when decoherence takes place. We introduce a new measure of Markovianity dubbed the Bures velocity and use it to optimise Markovian approximations.</description>

      <title>Quantum simulation of many-body dynamics with noise-robust Trotter decomposition based on symmetric structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04552v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Suzuki-Trotter decomposition, which digitalizes quantum time evolution, provides a promising framework for simulating quantum dynamics on quantum hardware and exploring quantum advantage over classical computation. However, conventional Trotter circuits require a large number of non-local gates, lowering their faithfulness to the ideal dynamics when implemented on current noisy quantum hardware. While most previous studies have focused on circuit optimization, we instead propose a new Trotter decomposition that is intrinsically circuit-efficient for simulating quantum dynamics on near-term devices. Our method substantially reduces the number of CNOT operations compared to conventional Trotter decompositions by exploiting the symmetry of the target model to construct an effective Hamiltonian with fewer two-qubit gates. We demonstrate the noise robustness of the proposed approach through numerical simulations of a nine-site Heisenberg model under realistic noise, and further validate its experimental practicality on the IBM superconducting device, achieving a state fidelity exceeding $0.98$ when combined with quantum error mitigation in the three-site case. The proposed circuit design is also compatible with existing circuit optimization techniques. Our results establish a practical route toward noise-resilient quantum simulation in many-body dynamics.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the Generalized Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen State and Extensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07412v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In their seminal paper, Einstein Podolsky and Rosen (EPR) had introduced a momentum entangled state for two particles. That state, referred to as the EPR state, has been widely used in studies on entangled particles with continuous degrees of freedom. Later that state was generalized to a form that allows varying degree of entanglement, known as the generalized EPR state. In a suitable limit it reduces to the EPR state. The generalized EPR state is theoretically analyzed here and its entanglement quantified in terms of a recently introduced generalized entanglement measure. This state can also be applied to entangled photons produced from spontaneous parametric down conversion (SPDC). The present analysis is then used in quantifying the entanglement of photons produced from the SPDC process, in terms of certain experimental parameters. A comparison is also made with the Schmidt number, which is normally used as an entanglement measure in such situations. A procedure for experimentally determining the entanglement of SPDC photons has also been described. Furthermore, an additional state exhibiting non-Gaussian entanglement has been examined, and its entanglement has been quantified.</description>

      <title>Bias-field-free operation of nitrogen-vacancy ensembles in diamond for accurate vector magnetometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.24574v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate measurement of vector magnetic fields is critical for applications including navigation, geoscience, and space exploration. Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center spin ensembles offer a promising solution for high-sensitivity vector magnetometry, as their different orientations in the diamond lattice measure different components of the magnetic field. However, the bias magnetic field typically used to separate signals from each NV orientation introduces inaccuracy from drifts in permanent magnets or coils. Here, we present a novel bias-field-free approach that labels the NV orientations via the direction of the microwave (MW) field in a variable-pulse-duration Ramsey sequence used to manipulate the spin ensemble. Numerical simulations demonstrate the possibility to isolate each orientation's signal with sub-nT accuracy in most terrestrial fields, even without precise MW field calibration, at only a moderate cost to sensitivity. We also provide proof-of-principle experimental validation, observing relevant features that evolve as expected with applied magnetic field. Looking forward, by removing a key source of drift, the proposed protocol lays the groundwork for future deployment of NV magnetometers in high-accuracy or long-duration missions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04300v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: No experimental test to date has provided conclusive evidence on the quantum nature of gravity. Recent proposals, such as the BMV experiment, suggest that generating entanglement could serve as a direct test. Motivated by these proposals, we study a system of three-harmonic oscillator system, with the mediator oscillator operating in two distinct parameter regimes: a heavy mediator regime and a light mediator regime. These regimes induce qualitatively different entanglement dynamics between the terminal oscillators. Crucially, distinguishing these regimes experimentally remains challenging when relying solely on entanglement measures. We demonstrate that the dynamical fidelity susceptibility offers a viable and sensitive probe to contrast the regimes in practice. Our results provide testable signatures for optomechanical and trapped-ion platforms simulating gravitational interactions, and provide new avenues to characterize quantum-gravity-inspired systems beyond entanglement-based protocols.</description>

Abstract: Quantum resources are certain features of the quantum world that provide advantages in certain information-theoretic, thermodynamic, or any other useful operational tasks that are outside the realm of what classical theories can achieve. Quantum resource theories provide us with an elegant framework for studying these resources quantitatively and rigorously. While numerous state-based quantum resource theories have already been investigated, and to some extent, measurement-based resource theories have also been explored, instrument-based resource theories remain largely unexplored, with only a few notable exceptions. As quantum instruments are devices that provide both the classical outcomes of induced measurements and the post-measurement quantum states, they are quite important, especially for scenarios where multiple parties sequentially act on a quantum system. In this work, we study several instrument-based resource theories, namely (1) the resource theory of information preservability, (2) the resource theory of (strong) entanglement preservability, (3) the resource theory of (strong) incompatibility preservability, (4) the resource theory of traditional incompatibility, and (5) the resource theory of parallel incompatibility. Furthermore, we outline the hierarchies of these instrument-based resources and provide measures to quantify them. In short, we provide a detailed framework for several instrument-based quantum resource theories.</description>

Abstract: As quantum computing progresses, the need for scalable solutions to address large-scale computational problems has become critical. Quantum supercomputers are the next upcoming frontier by enabling multiple quantum processors to collaborate effectively to solve large-scale computational problems. The emergence of quantum supercomputers necessitates an efficient interface to manage the quantum communication protocols between quantum processors. In this paper, we propose the Quantum Network Processing Unit (QNPU), which enables quantum applications to efficiently scale beyond the capacity of individual quantum processors, serving as a critical building block for future quantum supercomputers. The QNPU works alongside the Quantum Processing Unit (QPU) in our decoupled processing units architecture, where the QPU handles local quantum operations while the QNPU manages quantum communication between nodes. We design a comprehensive instruction set architecture (ISA) for the QNPU with high-level communication protocol abstractions, implemented via micro-operations that manage EPR resources, quantum operations, and classical communication. To facilitate programming, we introduce DistQASM, which extends OpenQASM with distributed quantum operations. We then propose a microarchitecture featuring both scalar and superscalar QNPU designs to enhance performance for communication-intensive quantum workloads. Finally, we evaluate the performance of our proposed QNPU design with distributed quantum workloads and demonstrate that the QNPU significantly improves the efficiency of communication between quantum nodes, paving the way for quantum supercomputing.</description>

      <title>Spectral Small-Incremental-Entangling: Breaking Quasi-Polynomial Complexity Barriers in Long-Range Interacting Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12014v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: How the detailed structure of quantum complexity emerges from quantum dynamics remains a fundamental challenge highlighted by advances in quantum simulators and information processing. The celebrated Small-Incremental-Entangling (SIE) theorem provides a universal constraint on the rate of entanglement generation, yet it leaves open the problem of fully characterizing fine entanglement structures. Here we introduce the concept of Spectral-Entangling strength, which captures the structural entangling power of an operator, and establish a spectral SIE theorem: a universal speed limit for R'enyi entanglement growth at $\alpha \ge 1/2$, revealing a robust $1/s^2$ decay threshold in the entanglement spectrum. Remarkably, our bound at $\alpha=1/2$ is both qualitatively and quantitatively optimal, defining the universal threshold beyond which entanglement growth becomes unbounded. This exposes the detailed structure of Schmidt coefficients and enables rigorous truncation-based error control, linking entanglement structure to computational complexity. Building on this, we derive a generalized entanglement area law under an adiabatic-path condition, extending a central principle of quantum many-body physics to general interactions. As a concrete application, we show that one-dimensional long-range interacting systems admit polynomial bond-dimension approximations for ground, time-evolved, and thermal states, thereby closing the long-standing quasi-polynomial gap and demonstrating that such systems can be simulated efficiently with tensor-network methods. By explicitly controlling R'enyi entanglement, we obtain a rigorous, a priori error guarantee for the time-dependent density-matrix renormalization-group algorithm. Overall, our results extend the SIE theorem to the spectral domain and establish a unified framework that unveils the detailed and universal structure underlying quantum complexity.</description>

Abstract: Quantum coherence, is an exquisitely quantum phenomenon that depends on both probability amplitudes and relative phases. Standard coherence measures quantify superposition within density matrices but cannot distinguish ensembles that produce the same mixed state through different distributions of pure states. Building on the geometric formulation of quantum mechanics, we introduce the probability-phase mutual information $I(P;\Phi)$. We show that it characterizes quantum coherence at the ensemble level and that ensemble coherence systematically exceeds density-matrix coherence, thus quantifying the structure lost when averaging over pure states. Eventually, its relevance for quantum thermodynamics and deep thermalization in condensed matter physics is highlighted by explicit examples: canonical ensembles reveal temperature-dependent probability-phase correlations absent from thermal density matrices, while a non-vanishing $I(P;\Phi)$ signals the breakdown of deep thermalization.</description>

Abstract: Quantum phenomena offer the possibility of measuring physical quantities with precision beyond classical limits. However, current progress is constrained by scalability, environmental noise, and challenges in practical integration. This highlights the necessity for novel approaches. An emerging paradigm in this direction is critical quantum metrology -- which harnesses the enhanced susceptibility and nonclassical correlations naturally occurring near quantum phase transitions as resources for quantum-enhanced precision. This tutorial provides a pedagogical introduction to key concepts and a detailed overview of prominent quantum sensing strategies that exploit critical phenomena in metrology. Through examples of increasing complexity, the reader is guided through various critical quantum sensing protocols applied to different critical systems. Special emphasis is placed on the optimal scaling of estimation precision with respect to fundamental resources. Finally, we discuss how critical quantum metrology extends from idealized models to realistic open-system, dissipative regimes, and strongly correlated fermionic systems, outlining both the challenges and opportunities for future quantum technologies.</description>

Abstract: In thermodynamics, an agent's ability to extract work is fundamentally constrained by their environment. Traditional frameworks struggle to capture how strategic decision-making under uncertainty, particularly an agent's tolerance for risk, determines the trade-off between extractable work and probability of success in finite-scale experiments. Here, we develop a framework for nonequilibrium thermodynamics based on adversarial resource theories, in which work extraction is modeled as an adversarial game for an agent extracting work. Within this perspective, we consider a Szilard-type engine as a game isomorphic to Kelly gambling, an information-theoretic model of optimal betting under uncertainty -- but with a thermodynamic utility function. Extending the framework to finite-size regimes, we apply a risk-reward trade-off to find an interpretation of the Renyi divergences in terms of extractable work for a given failure probability. By incorporating risk sensitivity via utility functions, we show that the guaranteed amount of work a rational agent would accept instead of undertaking a risky protocol is given by a Renyi divergence. This provides a unified picture of thermodynamics and gambling, and highlights how generalized free energies emerge from an adversarial setup.</description>

      <title>Two-Photon Induced Coherence without Induced Emission</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.09392v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: At the heart of recent breakthroughs in quantum imaging and spectroscopy utilizing undetected photons lies the quantum optical effect known as induced coherence without induced emission. This fundamental quantum interference effect has unlocked new possibilities in accessing challenging wavelength regimes for advanced imaging and spectroscopic analysis. Despite these advancements, the full spectrum of quantum metrology's capabilities, particularly the enhanced phase sensitivity offered by quantum optical Fock states or N00N states, has yet to be realized. This is due to the fact that, until now, the exploration of induced coherence has been confined to phenomena involving single photons. In this study, we present the observation of two-photon induced coherence without induced emission. This advancement hinges on a two-photon Fock state that creates quantum coherence between pairs of two-photon spontaneous emission amplitudes. The result is a doubling of the interferometric phase modulation compared to what is observed with single photons. Specifically, we show that a phase change $\phi$ applied to undetected 1016 nm near-infrared photons leads to $2\phi$ modulation in the detection of the 632 nm visible photons, verifying two-photon induced coherence without induced emission. These findings pave the way for innovative high-resolution quantum metrological applications leveraging multi-photon induced coherence without induced emission.</description>

      <title>Offline Dedicated Quantum Attacks on Block Ciphers Based on Two Parallel Permutation-Based Pseudorandom Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14475v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum cryptanalysis is essential for evaluating the security of cryptographic systems against the threat of quantum computing. Recently, Shi {\it et al.} introduced the dedicated quantum attack on XOR-type function that greatly reduces the required resources (including circuit depth, width, and the number of gates) compared to the parallel Grover-meets-Simon algorithm. Here, our contribution is in two aspects. On the one hand, we discover new cryptographic structures amenable to this attack: PolyMAC and block ciphers based on two parallel permutation-based pseudorandom functions (TPP-PRFs), including XopEM, SoEM22, SUMPIP, and DS-SoEM, partially answering Shi {\it et al.}'s open question. On the other hand, for block ciphers based on TPP-PRFs, we break the obstacle that this attack rely on online query by constructing decoupled XOR-type function, then propose an offline quantum attack on them that retains the tunable truncation parameter, $t$, a positive integer. Compared to previous results, our offline attack exhibits significantly reduced query complexity. Specifically, we reduce the number of queries to the encryption oracle from $\tilde O(2^{(n+t)/2})$ to $ O(2^{t})$ with the same time complexity in the quantum query model, and enable its implementation in the classical query model, optimizing both the classical query complexity and time complexity from $\tilde O(2^{2n/3})$ to $\tilde O(2^{(2n-t)/3})$.</description>

      <title>Generation of multipartite photonic entanglement using a trapped-ion quantum processing node</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.15693v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ability to establish entanglement between the nodes of future quantum networks is essential for enabling a wide range of new applications in science and technology. A promising approach involves the use of a powerful central node capable of deterministically preparing arbitrary multipartite entangled states of its matter-based qubits and efficiently distributing these states to surrounding end nodes via flying photons. This central node, referred to as a ``factory node", serves as a hub for the production and distribution of multipartite entanglement. In this work, we demonstrate key functionalities of a factory node using a cavity-integrated trapped-ion quantum processor. Specifically, we program the system to generate genuinely multipartite entangled Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states of three path-switchable photons and verify them using custom-designed entanglement witnesses. These photons can, in the future, be used to establish stored multipartite entanglement between remote matter-based nodes. Our results demonstrate that the well-established techniques for the deterministic preparation of entangled states of co-trapped ion qubits can be used to prepare the same states of traveling photons, paving the way for multipartite entanglement distribution in quantum local area networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18186v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a frequency-tunable, two-dimensional non-Abelian control of operation order constructed from the reduced Burau representation of the braid group $B_3$, specialised at $t=e^{i\omega}$ and unitarized by Squier's Hermitian form. Coupled to two non-commuting qubit unitaries $A,B$, the resulting switch admits a closed expression for the single-shot Helstrom success probability and a fixed-order ceiling $p_{\mathrm{fixed}}$, defining the analytic witness gap $\Delta(\omega)=p_{\mathrm{switch}}(\omega)-p_{\mathrm{fixed}}$. The sign change of $\Delta(\omega)$ across the Squier positivity window reveals alternating constructive and destructive interference of causal orders, a hallmark of non-Abelian control, while $\Delta(\omega)&gt;0$ certifies algebraic causal non-separability. Numerical simulations confirm both enhancement and suppression regimes, establishing a minimal $B_3$ braid control that reproduces the characteristic interference pattern expected from a Gedankenexperiment in anyonic statistics.</description>

Abstract: Abrikosov vortices, where the superconducting gap is completely suppressed in the core, are dissipative, semi-classical entities that impact applications from high-current-density wires to superconducting quantum devices. In contrast, we present evidence that vortices trapped in granular superconducting films can behave as two-level systems, exhibiting microsecond-range quantum coherence and energy relaxation times that reach fractions of a millisecond. These findings support recent theoretical modeling of superconductors with granularity on the scale of the coherence length as tunnel junction networks, resulting in gapped vortices. Using the tools of circuit quantum electrodynamics, we perform coherent manipulation and quantum non-demolition readout of vortex states in granular aluminum microwave resonators, heralding new directions for quantum information processing, materials characterization, and sensing.</description>

      <title>Near optimal sample complexity for matrix and tensor normal models via geodesic convexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.07583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.07583v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The matrix normal model, i.e., the family of Gaussian matrix-variate distributions whose covariance matrices are the Kronecker product of two lower dimensional factors, is frequently used to model matrix-variate data. The tensor normal model generalizes this family to Kronecker products of three or more factors. We study the estimation of the Kronecker factors of the covariance matrix in the matrix and tensor normal models.
  For the above models, we show that the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) achieves nearly optimal nonasymptotic sample complexity and nearly tight error rates in the Fisher-Rao and Thompson metrics. In contrast to prior work, our results do not rely on the factors being well-conditioned or sparse, nor do we need to assume an accurate enough initial guess. For the matrix normal model, all our bounds are minimax optimal up to logarithmic factors, and for the tensor normal model our bounds for the largest factor and for overall covariance matrix are minimax optimal up to constant factors provided there are enough samples for any estimator to obtain constant Frobenius error. In the same regimes as our sample complexity bounds, we show that the flip-flop algorithm, a practical and widely used iterative procedure to compute the MLE, converges linearly with high probability.
  Our main technical insight is that, given enough samples, the negative log-likelihood function is strongly geodesically convex in the geometry on positive-definite matrices induced by the Fisher information metric. This strong convexity is determined by the expansion of certain random quantum channels.</description>

      <title>Time-cost-error trade-off relation in thermodynamics: The third law and beyond</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04576v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Elucidating fundamental limitations inherent in physical systems is a central subject in physics. For important thermodynamic operations such as information erasure, cooling, and copying, resources like time and energetic cost must be expended to achieve the desired outcome within a predetermined error margin. In the context of cooling, the unattainability principle of the third law of thermodynamics asserts that infinite "resources" are needed to reach absolute zero. However, the precise identification of relevant resources and how they jointly constrain achievable error remains unclear within the frameworks of stochastic and quantum thermodynamics. In this work, we introduce the concept of separated states, which consist of fully unoccupied and occupied states, and formulate the corresponding thermokinetic cost and error, thereby establishing a unifying framework for a broad class of thermodynamic operations. We then uncover a three-way trade-off relation between time, cost, and error for thermodynamic operations aimed at creating separated states, simply expressed as $\tau\mathcal{C}\varepsilon_{\tau}\ge 1-\eta$. This fundamental relation is applicable to diverse thermodynamic operations, including information erasure, cooling, and copying. It provides a profound quantification of the unattainability principle in the third law of thermodynamics in a general form. Building upon this relation, we explore the quantitative limitations governing cooling operations, the preparation of separated states, and a no-go theorem for exact classical copying. Furthermore, we extend these findings to the quantum regime, encompassing both Markovian and non-Markovian dynamics. Specifically, within Lindblad dynamics, we derive a similar three-way trade-off relation that quantifies the cost of achieving a pure state with a given error.</description>

      <title>The category of anyon sectors for non-abelian quantum double models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15611v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study Kitaev's quantum double model for arbitrary finite gauge group in infinite volume, using an operator-algebraic approach. The quantum double model hosts anyonic excitations which can be identified with equivalence classes of `localized and transportable endomorphisms', which produce anyonic excitations from the ground state. Following the Doplicher--Haag--Roberts (DHR) sector theory from AQFT, we organize these endomorphisms into a braided monoidal category capturing the fusion and braiding properties of the anyons. We show that this category is equivalent to $\mathrm{Rep}_f \mathcal{D}(G)$, the representation category of the quantum double of $G$. This establishes for the first time the full DHR structure for a class of 2d quantum lattice models with non-abelian anyons.</description>

Abstract: We propose a multisetting protocol for the detection of two-body Bell correlations, and apply it to spin-nematic squeezed states realized in $f$ pairs of SU(2) subsystems within spin-$f$ atomic Bose-Einstein condensates. Experimental data for $f=1$, alongside with numerical simulations using the truncated Wigner method for $f=1,\,2,\,3$, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed protocol. Our findings extend the reach of multisetting Bell tests in ultracold atomic system, paving the way for extended quantum information processing in high-spin ensemble platforms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17096v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a general framework for engineering two-dimensional (2D) sub-wavelength topological optical lattices using spatially dependent atomic dark states in a $\Lambda$-type configuration of the atom-light coupling. By properly designing the spatial profiles of the laser fields inducing coupling between the atomic internal states, we show how to generate sub-wavelength Kronig-Penney-like geometric scalar potential accompanied by narrow and strong patches of the synthetic magnetic field localized in the same areas as the scalar potential. These sharply peaked magnetic fluxes are compensated by a smooth background magnetic field of opposite sign, resulting in zero net flux per unit cell while still enabling topologically nontrivial band structures. Specifically, for sufficiently narrow peaks, their influence is minimum, and the behavior of the system in a remaining smooth background magnetic field resembles the Landau problem, allowing for the formation of nearly flat energy bands with unit Chern numbers. Numerical analysis confirms the existence of ideal Chern bands and the robustness of the topological phases against non-adiabatic effects and losses. This makes the scheme well-suited for simulating quantum Hall systems and fractional Chern insulators in ultracold atomic gases, offering a new platform for exploring strongly correlated topological phases with high tunability.</description>

      <title>Wilson Line and Disorder Invariants of Topological One-Dimensional Multiband Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01846v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological invariants, such as the winding number, the Chern number, and the Zak phase, characterize the topological phases of bulk materials. Through the bulk-boundary correspondence, these topological phases have a one-to-one correspondence to topological edge states, which are robust to certain classes of disorder. For simple models like the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model, the computation of the winding number and Zak phase are straightforward, however, in multiband systems, this is no longer the case. In this work, we introduce the unwrapped Wilson line across the Brillouin zone to compute the bulk topological invariant. This method can efficiently be implemented numerically to evaluate multiband SSH-type models, including models that have a large number of distinct topological phases. This approach accurately captures all topological edge states, including those overlooked by traditional invariants, such as the winding number and Zak phase. To make a connection to experiments, we determine the sign of the topological invariant by considering a Hall-like configuration. We further introduce different classes of disorder that leave certain edge states protected, while suppressing other edge states, depending on their symmetry properties. Our approach is illustrated using different one-dimensional models, providing a robust framework for understanding topological properties in one-dimensional systems.</description>

Abstract: Tensor networks are not only numerical tools for describing ground states of quantum many-body systems, but also conceptual aids for understanding their entanglement structures. The proper way to understand tensor networks themselves is through explicit examples of solvable ground states that they represent exactly. In fact, this has historically been how tensor networks for gapped ground states, such as the matrix product state (MPS) and the projected entangled paired state (PEPS), emerged as an elegant analytical framework from numerical techniques like the density matrix renormalization group. However, for gapless ground states, generically described by the multiscale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA), a corresponding exactly solvable model has so far been missing. This is because the hierarchical structure of MERA intrinsically breaks the translational invariance. We identify a condition for MERA to be compatible with translational invariance by examining equivalent networks of rank-3 tensors. The condition is satisfied by the previously constructed hierarchical tensor network for the Motzkin and Fredkin chains, which can be considered a non-unitary generalization to the MERA. The hierarchical TN description is complemented by a translationally invariant MPS alternative, which is used to derive the power-law decay of the correlation function and critical exponents of a $q$-deformation phase transition.</description>

Abstract: Magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) exhibits remarkable electronic properties under external magnetic fields, notably the emergence of flat Landau levels. In this study, we present a comprehensive analysis of MATBG's operational phase diagram under three distinct quantum thermodynamic cycles, i.e., Quantum Otto Cycle (QOC), Quantum Carnot Cycle (QCC), and Quantum Stirling Cycle (QSC). Employing the continuum eight-band model, we evaluate the thermodynamic performance of MATBG across multiple operational modes: heat engine, refrigerator, cold pump, and Joule pump, and benchmark it against other graphene systems such as monolayer graphene, AB-Bernal stacked bilayer graphene, and non-magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene. Our findings reveal that MATBG demonstrates superior heat engine performance in QSC, while achieving high efficiency albeit with reduced work output in QOC. Even though the performance of MATBG as a cold pump or refrigerator is modest in QOC and QSC, it shows notable improvement as a refrigerator in QCC. Additionally, we identify a highly reversible Joule pump mode in both QSC and QOC under strict adiabaticity, underscoring the unique thermodynamic behavior of MATBG.</description>

      <title>Electric-field metrology of a terahertz frequency comb using Rydberg atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20698v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Terahertz radiation finds an increasing number of applications, yet efficient generation and detection remain a challenge and an active area of research. In particular, the precise detection of weak and narrowband terahertz signals is notoriously difficult. Here, we employ a novel type of single-photon detector based on Rydberg atoms to both detect and calibrate a terahertz frequency comb over an octave-spanning range, yet with a MHz-level selectivity. We calibrate the intensity of the electric field of the comb against the fundamental atomic properties, while achieving the intensity (power) sensitivity down to 45.2 $\mathrm{fW\ cm^{-2}\ Hz^{-0.5}}$ (1.84 $\mathrm{fW\ Hz^{-0.5}}$) within a single mode of the frequency comb, all in a room-temperature operated setup. Our results elucidate the transition of terahertz frequency combs into the quantum regime, enabling high-precision and high-sensitivity spectroscopy. This breakthrough allows terahertz science to better leverage revolutionary techniques developed for optical frequency combs.</description>

      <title>Integrability from a Single Conservation Law in Quantum Spin Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20713v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that for quantum spin chains with finite-range interactions, the existence of a specific conservation law known as the Reshetikhin condition implies the presence of infinitely many local conserved quantities, i.e., integrability. This shows that the entire hierarchy of conservation laws associated with solutions of the Yang--Baxter equation is already encoded in the lowest nontrivial conservation law. Combined with recent rigorous results on nonintegrability, our theorem strongly restricts the possibility of partially integrable systems that admit only a finite but large number of local conserved quantities. Our work establishes a rigorous foundation for the systematic identification of new integrable models and deepens the algebraic understanding of conservation-law structures in quantum spin chains.</description>

      <title>Exact Quench Dynamics from Thermal Pure Quantum States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05346v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an exact solution for the real-time dynamics following a quench from a thermal pure quantum (TPQ) state in an integrable system. Although equilibration is expected in this setting because the TPQ state already encodes the thermal expectation values of all conserved quantities, the approach to equilibrium shows highly nontrivial coherent dynamics. In the spin-1/2 XX chain, local observables become stationary at their thermal values after dephasing, while the entanglement entropy exhibits a characteristic double-plateau structure. We obtain this behavior exactly using three complementary approaches: two-dimensional (2D) conformal field theory (CFT) on the Klein bottle, an exact numerical evolution based on the matrix Riccati equation, and an asymptotically exact quasiparticle picture. These results demonstrate that the non-monotonic entanglement evolution is a macroscopic manifestation of the coherent dephasing of anomalous pairing correlations in the initial TPQ state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13894v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although quantum systems are generally described by quantum state vectors, we show that in certain cases their measurement processes can be reformulated as probabilistic equations expressed in terms of probabilistic state vectors. These probabilistic representations can, in turn, be approximated by the neural network dynamics of the Tensor Brain (TB) model.
  The Tensor Brain is a recently proposed framework for modeling perception and memory in the brain, providing a biologically inspired mechanism for efficiently integrating generated symbolic representations into reasoning processes.</description>

      <title>Born series for s-wave scattering length and some exact results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16212v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In these notes the Born series for the $s$-wave scattering $a_0$ is calculated for a class of central potentials $V(r)$ up to sixth order in a dimensionless coupling strength $g$. Examples of exponentially decaying potentials as well truncated potentials involving a single length-scale $a$ are considered. In certain favorable cases the exact result for the $g$-dependent $s$-wave scattering length $a_0=A_0(g) a$ can be given in terms of special functions. The poles of $A_0(g)$ at increasing positive values of $g$ correspond to the thresholds, where $s$-wave bound-states occur successively. A scattering problem, where $A_0(g)$ is solvable in terms of elementary functions, is also presented.</description>
