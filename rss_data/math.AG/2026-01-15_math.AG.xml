      <title>Geometric Manin's conjecture in characteristic $p$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geometric Manin's conjecture for complex Fano varieties describes the structure of the moduli space of curves. We propose a version of this conjecture in characteristic $p$ and describe its connection to the Batyrev--Manin--Peyre--Tschinkel conjecture over global fields. This is a survey paper written for a volume of the Summer Research Institute in Algebraic Geometry held at Colorado State University in 2025.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate birational toric morphisms between quantum toric stacks -- namely, toric (analytic) stacks associated with fans whose cones may be irrational -- focusing on two primary classes of examples: weighted blow-ups with arbitrary weights, and morphisms induced by cobordisms.</description>

      <title>Inverse Eigenvalue Problems, Floquet Isospectrality and the Hilbert--Chow Morphism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When can one change the diagonal of a matrix without changing its spectrum? We completely answer this question over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero or larger than the size of the matrix: An $n \times n$ matrix $A$ admits a nonzero diagonal matrix $D$ such that $A$ and $A+D$ have the same spectrum if and only if, for some size $k$, the $k \times k$ principal minors of $A$ are not all equal. This relates to the classical additive inverse eigenvalue problem in numerical analysis and has implications for existence and rigidity results in the theory of Floquet isospectrality of discrete periodic operators in solid state physics. The proof employs new techniques involving Hilbert schemes of points and the infinitesimal structure of the Hilbert--Chow morphism.</description>

      <title>Classification of real hyperplane singularities by real log canonical thresholds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13392v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The log canonical threshold (lct) is a fundamental invariant in birational geometry, essential for understanding the complexity of singularities in algebraic varieties. Its real counterpart, the real log canonical threshold (rlct), also known as the learning coefficient, has become increasingly relevant in statistics and machine learning, where it plays a critical role in model selection and error estimation for singular statistical models. In this paper, we investigate the rlct and its multiplicity for real (not necessarily reduced) hyperplane arrangements. We derive explicit combinatorial formulas for these invariants, generalizing earlier results that were limited to specific examples. Moreover, we provide a general algebraic theory for real log canonical thresholds, and present a SageMath implementation for efficiently computing the rlct and its multiplicity in the case or real hyperplane arrangements. Applications to examples are given, illustrating how the formulas can also be used to analyze the asymptotic behavior of high-dimensional volume integrals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17031v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study Cynk-Szemberg octic hyperplane arrangements from the perspective of homological properties of their derivation modules. In particular, we define the notion of the type of hyperplane arrangements that will be used in our characterization of rigid Cynk-Szemberg octic hyperplane arrangements. Moreover, we deliver a combinatorial non-freeness criterion for essential hyperplane arrangements in $\mathbb{C}^{4}$.</description>

      <title>Real and bi-Lipschitz versions of the Theorem of Nobile</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20631v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The renowned Theorem of Nobile, proved by Nobile in 1975, states that a pure dimensional complex analytic set $X$ is analytically smooth if and only if its Nash transformation $\eta: \mathcal{N}(X) \to X$ is an analytic isomorphism. While the Theorem of Nobile was fundamental in complex geometry, it remained an open question for 50 years whether the theorem held for real analytic sets, even more so for cases that demand only $C^{k}$ smoothness. This paper presents a proof for the real version of the Theorem of Nobile, even under $C^{k}$ smoothness conditions. Specifically, we prove that for a pure dimensional real analytic set $X$ the following statements are equivalent:
  (1) $X$ is a real analytic (resp. $C^{k+1,1}$) submanifold;
  (2) the mapping $\eta\colon\mathcal{N}(X)\to X$ is a real analytic (resp. $C^{k,1}$) diffeomorphism;
  (3) the mapping $\eta\colon\mathcal{N}(X)\to X$ is a $C^{\infty}$ (resp. $C^{k,1}$) diffeomorphism;
  (4) $X$ is a $C^{\infty}$ (resp. $C^{k+1,1}$) submanifold.
  Consequently, we prove the bi-Lipschitz version of the Theorem of Nobile, demonstrating that a complex analytic set $X$ is analytically smooth if and only if its Nash transformation $\eta\colon \mathcal{N}(X)\to X$ is a homeomorphism that is locally bi-Lipschitz. A sharp version of this theorem, which holds in the much more general setting of locally definable sets in an o-minimal structure, is also presented here.</description>

      <title>Hochschild-Kostant-Rosenberg isomorphism for derived Deligne-Mumford stacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00501v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a Hochschild--Konstant--Rosenberg (HKR) theorem for arbitrary derived Deligne--Mumford (DM) stacks, extending the results of Arinkin-C\u{a}ld\u{a}raru-Hablicsek in the smooth, global quotient case, although with different methods. To formulate our result, we introduce the notion of orbifold inertia stack of a derived DM stack; this supplies a finely tuned derived enhancement of the classical inertia stack, which does not always coincide with the classical truncation of the free loop space. We show that, in characteristic 0, given a derived DM stack, the shifted tangent bundle of its orbifold inertia stack is equivalent to its free loop space. This yields a canonical HKR isomorphism of algebras between the Hochschild homology of a derived DM stack and the cohomology of differential forms on its orbifold inertia stack. Moreover, this isomorphism intertwines the natural circle action and the de Rham differential. Similarly, HKR theorems for derived DM stacks are established for Hochschild cohomology, cyclic homology, negative cyclic homology, and periodic cyclic homology. As applications, we provide a rich supply of computations of Hochschild homology and Hochschild cohomology for interesting derived DM stacks, such as weighted projective lines, root stacks, quotients by algebraic groups, and mapping stacks, among others.</description>

      <title>Stability Conditions and Moduli Spaces on Kuznetsov Component of Cubic Fivefolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21454v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Kuznetsov component of cubic fivefolds via their quadric fibration model, and construct a family of Serre-invariant Bridgeland stability conditions on it. For every primitive numerical class, we prove that the associated Bridgeland moduli space contains a non-empty smooth locus, on which the restriction to a general hyperplane section preserves stability. As a consequence, we obtain Lagrangian immersions into hyper-K\"ahler varieties arising as moduli spaces on the Kuznetsov component of cubic fourfolds, generalizing a geometric construction of Illiev-Manivel, which realizes the Fano surface of planes of the cubic fivefold as a Lagrangian subvariety in a hyper-K\"ahler fourfold.</description>

      <title>Graded Betti numbers of the Jacobian algebra and total Tjurina numbers of plane curves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08583v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we compute an explicit closed formula for the total Tjurina number $\tau(C)$ of a reduced projective plane curve $C$ in terms of the graded Betti numbers of the corresponding Jacobian algebra. This formula allows a completely new view point on the classical upper bounds for the total Tjurina number $\tau(C)$ of a plane curve $C$ given by A. du Plessis and C. T. C. Wall. This approach yields in particular a new necessary condition for a set of positive integers to be the graded Betti numbers of the Jacobian algebra of a reduced plane curve.</description>

      <title>Coleman-Gross Heights and $p$-adic N\'eron Functions on Jacobians of Genus $2$ Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.15049v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a theory of $p$-adic N\'eron functions on abelian varieties, depending on various auxiliary choices, and show that the global $p$-adic height functions constructed by Mazur and Tate can be decomposed into a sum of $p$-adic N\'eron functions if the same auxiliary choices are made. We also consider a decomposition of the $p$-adic height constructed by Coleman and Gross for good reduction, and extended to arbitrary reduction by Colmez and Besser, into a sum of certain local height functions for Jacobians of odd degree genus~$2$ curves. We show that this local height function is equal to the $p$-adic N\'eron function with the same auxiliary choices, regardless of the reduction type of the curve. This extends work of Balakrishnan and Besser for elliptic curves. When the curve has semistable reduction and the reduction of the Jacobian is ordinary, we also describe the $p$-adic N\'eron function that arises from the canonical Mazur--Tate splitting explicitly in terms of a generalisation of the $p$-adic sigma function constructed by Blakestad.</description>

      <title>Rational torsion on hyperelliptic jacobian varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14454v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It was conjectured by Flynn that there exists a constant $\kappa$ such that, for any integer $g \ge 2$, any $m \le \kappa g$, there exists a hyperelliptic curve of genus $g$ over $\mathbb Q$ with a rational $m$-torsion point on its Jacobian. Lepr\'{e}vost proved this conjecture with $\kappa=3$. In this work we prove that given an integer $N$ in the interval $[3g,4g+1]$, $g\ge 3$, satisfying certain partition conditions, there exist parametric families of hyperelliptic Jacobian varieties with a rational torsion point of order $N$. In particular, we establish the existence of such varieties for $N=4g+1$ when $g$ is odd and for $N=4g-1$ when $g$ is even. A few explicit applications of this result produce the first known infinite examples of torsion $13$ when $g=3$, torsion $15$ when $g=4$, and torsion $17,18,21$ when $g=5$. In fact, we show that infinitely many of the latter abelian varieties are absolutely simple.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.20456v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use sign-reversing involutions to solve two computational problems that arise naturally in the geometry of moduli spaces of curves. In particular, we give an explicit combinatorial formula for arbitrary $\psi$ class intersection products on the genus zero multicolored spaces $\overline{M}_{0,[r_1,\ldots,r_m]}$ using a novel sign reversing involution on decorated diagrams. As an application, we give a necessary and sufficient condition for when these intersection products are nonzero in terms of matchings on graphs.
  We also calculate the analog of the tropical Euler characteristic for the graphical moduli spaces $\overline{M}_{0,\Gamma}$ for graphs with two dominant vertices $P, Q$, by constructing two new sign-reversing involutions to simplify the sum. We show that (up to sign) it is the number of acyclic orientations of $\Gamma \smallsetminus \{P, Q\}$.</description>
