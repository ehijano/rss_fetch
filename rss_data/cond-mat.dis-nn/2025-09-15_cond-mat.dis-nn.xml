      <title>Spectral distribution of sparse Gaussian Ensembles of Real Asymmetric Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21002v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Theoretical analysis of biological and artificial neural networks e.g. modelling of synaptic or weight matrices necessitate consideration of the generic real-asymmetric matrix ensembles, those with varying order of matrix elements e.g. a sparse structure or a banded structure. We pursue the complexity parameter approach to analyze the spectral statistics of the multiparametric Gaussian ensembles of real asymmetric matrices and derive the ensemble averaged spectral densities for real as well as complex eigenvalues. Considerations of the matrix elements with arbitrary choice of mean and variances render us the freedom to model the desired sparsity in the ensemble. Our formulation provides a common mathematical formulation of the spectral statistics for a wide range of sparse real-asymmetric ensembles and also
  reveals, thereby, a deep rooted universality among them.</description>

      <title>Hierarchy of percolation patterns in a kinetic replication model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16786v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The model of a one-dimensional kinetic contact process with parallel update is studied by the Monte Carlo simulations and finite-size scaling. The goal was to reveal the structure of the hidden percolative patterns (order parameters) in the active phase and the nature of transitions those patterns emerge through. Our results corroborate the earlier conjecture that in general the active (percolating) phases possess the hierarchical structure (tower of percolation patterns), where more complicated patterns emerge on the top of coexistent patterns of lesser complexity. Plethora of different patterns emerge via cascades of continuous transitions. We detect five phases with distinct patterns of percolation within the active phase of the model. All transitions on the phase diagram belong to the directed percolation universality class, as confirmed by the scaling analysis. To accommodate the case of multiple percolating phases the extension of the Janssen-Grassberger conjecture is proposed.</description>

      <title>Nanoscale photonic neuron with biological signal processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06696v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computational hardware designed to mimic biological neural networks holds the promise to resolve the drastically growing global energy demand of artificial intelligence. A wide variety of hardware concepts have been proposed, and among these, photonic approaches offer immense strengths in terms of power efficiency, speed and synaptic connectivity. However, existing solutions have large circuit footprints limiting scaling potential and they miss key biological functions, like inhibition. We demonstrate an artificial nano-optoelectronic neuron with a circuit footprint size reduced by at least a factor of 100 compared to existing technologies and operating powers in the picowatt regime. The neuron can deterministically receive both exciting and inhibiting signals that can be summed and treated with a non-linear function. It demonstrates several biological relevant responses and memory timescales, as well as weighting of input channels. The neuron is compatible with commercial silicon technology, operates at multiple wavelengths and can be used for both computing and optical sensing. This work paves the way for two important research paths: photonic neuromorphic computing with nanosized footprints and low power consumption, and adaptive optical sensing, using the same architecture as a compact, modular front end</description>
