      <title>Delta Vectors Unify the Computation for Linear Model Treatment Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The science of cause and effect is extremely sophisticated and extremely hard to scale. Using a controlled experiment, scientists get rich insights by analyzing global effects, effects in different segments, and trends in effects over time. They use propensity scores to project external validity. To support the analysis of relative effects, scientists derive challenging ratio distributions. While the analytical capabilities in experimentation are advancing, we require new innovation within engineering and computational causal inference to enable an experimentation platform to make analyses performant and scalable. Of significant importance: we must unify the computing strategy for these models so that they can be consistently applied across experiments. In doing so, the industry can make significant progress towards developing a flywheel that unifies and accelerates the evaluation and roll out of experiments. In order to support unified computation, this paper introduces baseline vectors and delta vectors as common structure for estimating treatment effects. This common structure allows many statistics to be subsumed into a single API. The nature of its algebraic formulation allows linear algebra libraries to vectorize and optimize its performance, creating a single and efficient tool to support the many innovations in experimentation.</description>

      <title>Controlling the asymptotic bias of the unadjusted (Microcanonical) Hamiltonian and Langevin Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hamiltonian and Langevin Monte Carlo (HMC and LMC) and their Microcanonical counterparts (MCHMC and MCLMC) are current state of the art algorithms for sampling in high dimensions. Their numerical discretization errors are typically corrected by the Metropolis-Hastings (MH) accept/reject step. However, as the dimensionality of the problem increases, the stepsize (and therefore efficiency) needs to decrease as $d^{-1/4}$ for second order integrators in order to maintain reasonable acceptance rate. The MH unadjusted methods, on the other hand, do not suffer from this scaling, but the difficulty of controlling the asymptotic bias has hindered the widespread adoption of these algorithms. For Gaussian targets, we show that the asymptotic bias is upper bounded by the energy error variance per dimension (EEVPD), independently of the dimensionality and of the parameters of the Gaussian. We numerically extend the analysis to the non-Gaussian benchmark problems and demonstrate that most of these problems abide by the same bias bound as the Gaussian targets. Controlling EEVPD, which is easy to do, ensures control over the asymptotic bias. We propose an efficient algorithm for tuning the stepsize, given the desired asymptotic bias, which enables usage of unadjusted methods in a tuning-free way.</description>

      <title>Fully Bayesian Wideband Direction-of-Arrival Estimation and Detection via RJMCMC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a fully Bayesian approach to wideband, or broadband, direction-of-arrival (DoA) estimation and signal detection. Unlike previous works in wideband DoA estimation and detection, where the signals were modeled in the time-frequency domain, we directly model the time-domain representation and treat the non-causal part of the source signal as latent variables. Furthermore, our Bayesian model allows for closed-form marginalization of the latent source signals by leveraging conjugacy. To further speed up computation, we exploit the sparse ``stripe matrix structure'' of the considered system, which stems from the circulant matrix representation of linear time-invariant (LTI) systems. This drastically reduces the time complexity of computing the likelihood from $\mathcal{O}(N^3 k^3)$ to $\mathcal{O}(N k^3)$, where $N$ is the number of samples received by the array and $k$ is the number of sources. These computational improvements allow for efficient posterior inference through reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC). We use the non-reversible extension of RJMCMC (NRJMCMC), which often achieves lower autocorrelation and faster convergence than the conventional reversible variant. Detection, estimation, and reconstruction of the latent source signals can then all be performed in a fully Bayesian manner through the samples drawn using NRJMCMC. We evaluate the detection performance of the procedure by comparing against generalized likelihood ratio testing (GLRT) and information criteria.</description>

      <title>Quantile Fourier Transform, Quantile Series, and Nonparametric Estimation of Quantile Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.05844v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A nonparametric method is proposed for estimating the quantile spectra and cross-spectra introduced in Li (2012; 2014) as bivariate functions of frequency and quantile level. The method is based on the quantile discrete Fourier transform (QDFT) defined by trigonometric quantile regression and the quantile series (QSER) defined by the inverse Fourier transform of the QDFT. A nonparametric spectral estimator is constructed from the autocovariance function of the QSER using the lag-window (LW) approach. Smoothing techniques are also employed to reduce the statistical variability of the LW estimator across quantiles when the underlying spectrum varies smoothly with respect to the quantile level. The performance of the proposed estimation method is evaluated through a simulation study.</description>

      <title>Annealing Flow Generative Model Towards Sampling High-Dimensional and Multi-Modal Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20547v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sampling from high dimensional, multimodal distributions remains a fundamental challenge across domains such as statistical Bayesian inference and physics based machine learning. In this paper, we propose Annealing Flow, a continuous normalizing flow based approach designed to sample from high dimensional and multimodal distributions. The key idea is to learn a continuous normalizing flow based transport map, guided by annealing, to transition samples from an easy to sample distribution to the target distribution, facilitating effective exploration of modes in high dimensional spaces. Unlike many existing methods, AF training does not rely on samples from the target distribution. AF ensures effective and balanced mode exploration, achieves linear complexity in sample size and dimensions, and circumvents inefficient mixing times. We demonstrate the superior performance of AF compared to state of the art methods through extensive experiments on various challenging distributions and real world datasets, particularly in high-dimensional and multimodal settings. We also highlight the potential of AF for sampling the least favorable distributions.</description>
