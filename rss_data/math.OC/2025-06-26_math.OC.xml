      <title>Control and optimization for Neural Partial Differential Equations in Supervised Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although there is a substantial body of literature on control and optimization problems for parabolic and hyperbolic systems, the specific problem of controlling and optimizing the coefficients of the associated operators within such systems has not yet been thoroughly explored. In this work, we aim to initiate a line of research in control theory focused on optimizing and controlling the coefficients of these operators-a problem that naturally arises in the context of neural networks and supervised learning.
  In supervised learning, the primary objective is to transport initial data toward target data through the layers of a neural network. We propose a novel perspective: neural networks can be interpreted as partial differential equations (PDEs). From this viewpoint, the control problem traditionally studied in the context of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) is reformulated as a control problem for PDEs, specifically targeting the optimization and control of coefficients in parabolic and hyperbolic operators. To the best of our knowledge, this specific problem has not yet been systematically addressed in the control theory of PDEs.
  To this end, we propose a dual system formulation for the control and optimization problem associated with parabolic PDEs, laying the groundwork for the development of efficient numerical schemes in future research. We also provide a theoretical proof showing that the control and optimization problem for parabolic PDEs admits minimizers. Finally, we investigate the control problem associated with hyperbolic PDEs and prove the existence of solutions for a corresponding approximated control problem.</description>

      <title>Robust and Flexible Microtransit Design: Chance-Constrained Dial-a-Ride Problem with Soft Time Windows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microtransit offers a promising blend of rideshare flexibility and public transit efficiency. In practice, it faces unanticipated but spatially aligned requests, passengers seeking to join ongoing schedules, leading to underutilized capacity and degraded service if not properly managed. At the same time, it must accommodate diverse passenger needs, from routine errands to time-sensitive trips such as medical appointments. To meet these expectations, incorporating time flexibility is essential. However, existing models seldom consider both spontaneous and heterogeneous demand, limiting their real-world applicability. We propose a robust and flexible microtransit framework that integrates time flexibility and demand uncertainty via a Chance-Constrained Dial-A-Ride Problem with Soft Time Windows (CCDARP-STW). Demand uncertainty is captured through nonlinear chance constraints with controllable violation probabilities, while time flexibility is modeled with soft time windows and penalized cost. We develop a bounded-support relaxation using limited statistical information to linearize the chance constraints and solve the model using a tailored Branch-and-Cut-and-Price (BCP) algorithm with a probabilistic dominance rule. This rule improves computational efficiency, reducing explored labels by 17.40% and CPU time by 22.27% in robust cases. A case study based on real-world Chicago data shows our framework yields 11.55 minutes and 11.13 miles of savings versus conventional microtransit, and achieves the highest service reliability (96.46%) among robust models.</description>

      <title>Faster Fixed-Point Methods for Multichain MDPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study value-iteration (VI) algorithms for solving general (a.k.a. multichain) Markov decision processes (MDPs) under the average-reward criterion, a fundamental but theoretically challenging setting. Beyond the difficulties inherent to all average-reward problems posed by the lack of contractivity and non-uniqueness of solutions to the Bellman operator, in the multichain setting an optimal policy must solve the navigation subproblem of steering towards the best connected component, in addition to optimizing long-run performance within each component. We develop algorithms which better solve this navigational subproblem in order to achieve faster convergence for multichain MDPs, obtaining improved rates of convergence and sharper measures of complexity relative to prior work. Many key components of our results are of potential independent interest, including novel connections between average-reward and discounted problems, optimal fixed-point methods for discounted VI which extend to general Banach spaces, new sublinear convergence rates for the discounted value error, and refined suboptimality decompositions for multichain MDPs. Overall our results yield faster convergence rates for discounted and average-reward problems and expand the theoretical foundations of VI approaches.</description>

      <title>Block Coordinate Descent Network Simplex for Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose the Block Coordinate Descent Network Simplex (BCDNS) method for solving large-scale discrete Optimal Transport (OT) problems. BCDNS integrates the Network Simplex (NS) algorithm with a block coordinate descent (BCD) strategy, decomposing the full problem into smaller subproblems per iteration and reusing basis variables to ensure feasibility. We prove that BCDNS terminates in a finite number of iterations with an exact optimal solution, and we characterize its per-iteration complexity as O(s N), where s is a user-defined parameter in (0,1) and N is the total number of variables. Numerical experiments demonstrate that BCDNS matches the classical NS method in solution accuracy, reduces memory footprint compared to the Sinkhorn algorithm, achieves speed-ups of up to tens of times over the classical NS method, and exhibits runtime comparable to a high-precision Sinkhorn implementation.</description>

      <title>Exact Time-Varying Turnpikes for Dynamic Operation of District Heating Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: District heating networks (DHNs) are crucial for decarbonizing the heating sector. Yet, their efficient and reliable operation requires the coordination of multiple heat producers and the consideration of future demands. Predictive and optimization-based control is commonly used to address this task, but existing results for DHNs do not account for time-varying problem aspects. Since the turnpike phenomenon can serve as a basis for model predictive control design and analysis, this paper examines its role in DHN optimization by analyzing the underlying optimal control problem with time-varying prices and demands. That is, we derive conditions for the existence of a unique time-varying singular arc, which constitutes the time varying turnpike, and we provide its closed-form expression. Additionally, we present converse turnpike results showing a exact time-varying case implies strict dissipativity of the optimal control problem. A numerical example illustrates our findings.</description>

      <title>Proximal aiming in weak KAM theory with nonsmooth Lagrangian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work extends weak KAM theory to the case of a nonsmooth Lagrangian satisfying a superlinear growth condition. Using the solution of a weak KAM equation that is a stationary Hamilton-Jacobi equation and the proximal aiming method, we construct a family of discontinuous feedback strategies that are nearly optimal for every time interval. This result leads to an analogue of the weak KAM theorem. Additionally, as in classical weak KAM theory, we demonstrate that the effective Hamiltonian (Ma\~{n}\'{e} critical value) can be determined by solving a linear programming problem in the class of probability measures.</description>

      <title>Linear and Second-order-cone Valid Inequalities for Problems with Storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Batteries are playing an increasingly central role as distributed energy resources in the shift toward power systems dominated by renewable energy sources. However, existing battery models must invariably rely on complementarity constraints to prevent simultaneous charging and discharging, rendering models of a disjunctive nature and NP-hard. In this paper, we analyze the disjunctive structure of the battery's feasible operational set and uncover a submodularity property in its extreme power trajectories. Leveraging this structure, we propose a systematic approach to derive linear valid inequalities that define facets of the convex hull of the battery's feasible operational set, including a distinguished family that generalizes and dominates existing formulations in the literature. To evaluate the practical utility of these inequalities, we conduct computational experiments on two representative problems whose continuous relaxations frequently result in simultaneous charge and discharge: energy arbitrage under negative prices and set-point tracking. For the latter, we further introduce second-order cone inequalities that remarkably and efficiently reduce simultaneous charging and discharging. Our results highlight the potential of structured relaxations to enhance the tractability and fidelity of battery models in optimization-based energy system tools.</description>

      <title>An equation-based batch distillation simulation to evaluate the effect of multiplicities in thermodynamic activity coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the influence of multiplicities in activity coefficients on batch distillation processes. In order to do so, we develop a rigorous simulation of batch distillation processes based on the MESH equations. In particular, we propose a novel index reduction method to transform the original index-$2$ system into a well-posed differential-algebraic system of index $1$. With the help of this simulation, we then explore whether the alternative NRTL parameters, which yield indistinguishable activity coefficients and VLE diagrams when compared to the reference data, can produce distinguishable profiles in dynamic simulations. As it turns out, this can happen in general and we explain the reasons behind the dynamic distinguishability.</description>

      <title>The final solution of the Hitchhiker's problem #5</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A recent survey, nicknamed "Hitchhiker's Guide", J.J. Arias-Garc{\i}a, R. Mesiar, and B. De Baets, A hitchhiker's guide to quasi-copulas, Fuzzy Sets and Systems 393 (2020) 1-28, has raised the rating of quasi-copula problems in the dependence modeling community in spite of the lack of statistical interpretation of quasi-copulas. In our previous work (arXiv:2410.19339, accepted in Fuzzy Sets and Systems), we addressed the question of extreme values of the mass distribution associated with multivariate quasi-copulas. Using a linear programming approach, we were able to solve Open Problem 5 of the "Guide" up to dimension d = 17 and disprove a recent conjecture on the solution to that problem. In this paper, we use an analytical approach to provide a complete answer to the original question.</description>

      <title>Optimal Single-Policy Sample Complexity and Transient Coverage for Average-Reward Offline RL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study offline reinforcement learning in average-reward MDPs, which presents increased challenges from the perspectives of distribution shift and non-uniform coverage, and has been relatively underexamined from a theoretical perspective. While previous work obtains performance guarantees under single-policy data coverage assumptions, such guarantees utilize additional complexity measures which are uniform over all policies, such as the uniform mixing time. We develop sharp guarantees depending only on the target policy, specifically the bias span and a novel policy hitting radius, yielding the first fully single-policy sample complexity bound for average-reward offline RL. We are also the first to handle general weakly communicating MDPs, contrasting restrictive structural assumptions made in prior work. To achieve this, we introduce an algorithm based on pessimistic discounted value iteration enhanced by a novel quantile clipping technique, which enables the use of a sharper empirical-span-based penalty function. Our algorithm also does not require any prior parameter knowledge for its implementation. Remarkably, we show via hard examples that learning under our conditions requires coverage assumptions beyond the stationary distribution of the target policy, distinguishing single-policy complexity measures from previously examined cases. We also develop lower bounds nearly matching our main result.</description>

      <title>Quantum Adaptive Search: A Hybrid Quantum-Classical Algorithm for Global Optimization of Multivariate Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents Quantum Adaptive Search (QAGS), a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for the global optimization of multivariate functions. The method employs an adaptive mechanism that dynamically narrows the search space based on a quantum-estimated probability distribution of the objective function. A quantum state encodes information about solution quality through an appropriate complex amplitude mapping, enabling the identification of the most promising regions, and thus progressively tightening the search bounds; then a classical optimizer performs local refinement of the solution. The analysis demonstrates that QAGS ensures a contraction of the search space toward global optima, with controlled computational complexity. The numerical results on the benchmark functions show that, compared to the classical methods, QAGS achieves higher accuracy while offering advantages in both time and space complexity.</description>

      <title>Towards an Optimal Control Perspective of ResNet Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a training formulation for ResNets reflecting an optimal control problem that is applicable for standard architectures and general loss functions. We suggest bridging both worlds via penalizing intermediate outputs of hidden states corresponding to stage cost terms in optimal control. For standard ResNets, we obtain intermediate outputs by propagating the state through the subsequent skip connections and the output layer. We demonstrate that our training dynamic biases the weights of the unnecessary deeper residual layers to vanish. This indicates the potential for a theory-grounded layer pruning strategy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18097v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solutions of an optimization problem are sensitive to changes caused by approximations or parametric perturbations, especially in the nonconvex setting. This paper shows that solutions of substitute problems, constructed from Rockafellian functions, can be less sensitive to such changes. Unlike classical stability analysis focused on local changes around (local) minimizers, we employ epi-convergence to examine whether approximating or perturbed problems suitably approach an actual (unperturbed) problem globally. \redrevvv{We demonstrate that solutions derived from the Rockafellian-based substitute problems converge to solutions of the actual optimization problem under suitable conditions, providing a rigorous alternative to potentially unstable direct approximations.} We quantify the rates of convergence that often lead to Lipschitz-kind stability properties for the substitute problems.</description>

      <title>On the Characteristics of the Conjugate Function Enabling Effective Dual Decomposition Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08933v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a novel characteristic of the conjugate function associated to a generic convex optimization problem, which can subsequently be leveraged for efficient dual decomposition methods. In particular, under mild assumptions, we show that there is a specific region in the domain of the conjugate function such that for any point in the region, there is always a ray originating from that point along which the gradients of the conjugate remain constant. We refer to this characteristic as a fixed gradient over rays (FGOR). We further show that this characteristic is inherited by the corresponding dual function. Then we provide a thorough exposition of the application of the FGOR characteristic to dual subgradient methods. More importantly, we leverage FGOR to devise a simple stepsize rule that can be prepended with state-of-the-art stepsize methods enabling them to be more efficient. Furthermore, we investigate how the FGOR characteristic is used when solving the global consensus problem, a prevalent formulation in diverse application domains. We show that FGOR can be exploited not only to expedite the convergence of the dual decomposition methods but also to reduce the communication overhead. Numerical experiments using quadratic objectives and a regularized least squares regression with a real dataset are conducted. The results show that FGOR can significantly improve the performance of existing stepsize methods and outperform the state-of-the-art splitting methods on average in terms of both convergence behavior and communication efficiency.</description>

      <title>Universal subgradient and proximal bundle methods for convex and strongly convex hybrid composite optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10073v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper develops two parameter-free methods for solving convex and strongly convex hybrid composite optimization problems, namely, a composite subgradient type method and a proximal bundle type method. Functional complexity bounds for the two methods are established in terms of the unknown strong convexity parameter. The two proposed methods are universal with respect to all problem parameters, including the strong convexity one, and require no knowledge of the optimal value. Moreover, in contrast to previous works, they do not restart nor use multiple threads.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04959v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents an integer programming-based optimization framework designed to effectively address the complex final exam scheduling challenges encountered at Cornell University. With high flexibility, the framework is specifically tailored to accommodate a variety of different constraints, including the front-loading of large courses and the exclusion of specific time slots during the exam period. By generating multiple scheduling model variants and incorporating heuristic approaches, our framework enables comprehensive comparisons of different schedules. This empowers the University Registrar to make informed decisions, considering trade-offs in terms of schedule comfort measured by different levels of exam conflicts. Our results demonstrate significant advantage over the historical lecture time-based approach, providing time and effort savings for the university administration while enhancing student and faculty satisfaction.</description>

      <title>Improving Stochastic Cubic Newton with Momentum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19644v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study stochastic second-order methods for solving general non-convex optimization problems. We propose using a special version of momentum to stabilize the stochastic gradient and Hessian estimates in Newton's method. We show that momentum provably improves the variance of stochastic estimates and allows the method to converge for any noise level. Using the cubic regularization technique, we prove a global convergence rate for our method on general non-convex problems to a second-order stationary point, even when using only a single stochastic data sample per iteration. This starkly contrasts with all existing stochastic second-order methods for non-convex problems, which typically require large batches. Therefore, we are the first to demonstrate global convergence for batches of arbitrary size in the non-convex case for the Stochastic Cubic Newton. Additionally, we show improved speed on convex stochastic problems for our regularized Newton methods with momentum.</description>

      <title>A Passivity Analysis for Nonlinear Consensus on Balanced Digraphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05933v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work deals with the output consensus problem for multiagent systems over balanced digraphs by passivity analysis. As the standard diffusive coupling structure only models the undirected interconnection, we propose a general approach capable of processing directed coupling and performing passivity analysis. To mitigate the complexity arising from the nonlinearity and directed interconnections, we reformulate the output consensus problem as a convergence analysis on a submanifold. We provide passivity analysis and establish a sufficient condition based on passivity for achieving output agreement in multi-agent systems over balanced digraphs. The results are supported by a numerical example.</description>

      <title>Split-Merge: A Difference-based Approach for Dominant Eigenvalue Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15131v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The computation of the dominant eigenvector of symmetric positive semidefinite matrices is a cornerstone operation in numerous optimization-driven applications. Traditional methods, typically based on the \textit{Quotient} formulation, often suffer from challenges related to computational efficiency and reliance on prior spectral knowledge. In this work, we leverage the alternative \textit{Difference} formulation to reinterpret the classical power method as a first-order optimization algorithm. This perspective allows for a novel convergence analysis and facilitates the development of accelerated variants with larger step-sizes, achieving faster convergence without additional computational cost. Building on this insight, we introduce a generalized family of Difference-based methods, with the power method as a special case. Within this family, we propose Split-Merge, an algorithm that attains accelerated convergence without requiring spectral knowledge and operates solely via matrix-vector products. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that Split-Merge consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both efficiency and scalability. In particular, it achieves more than a $\boldsymbol{10\times}$ speedup over the classical power method, underscoring its practical effectiveness for large-scale problems.</description>

      <title>Efficiently Escaping Saddle Points under Generalized Smoothness via Self-Bounding Regularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04712v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the optimization of non-convex functions that are not necessarily smooth (gradient and/or Hessian are Lipschitz) using first order methods. Smoothness is a restrictive assumption in machine learning in both theory and practice, motivating significant recent work on finding first order stationary points of functions satisfying generalizations of smoothness with first order methods. We develop a novel framework that lets us systematically study the convergence of a large class of first-order optimization algorithms (which we call decrease procedures) under generalizations of smoothness. We instantiate our framework to analyze the convergence of first order optimization algorithms to first and \textit{second} order stationary points under generalizations of smoothness. As a consequence, we establish the first convergence guarantees for first order methods to second order stationary points under generalizations of smoothness. We demonstrate that several canonical examples fall under our framework, and highlight practical implications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20510v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a finite-dimensional numerical approximation for a class of extended mean field control problems. Our algorithm learns the value function on the whole Wasserstein domain, as opposed to a fixed initial condition. We leverage the approximation of the mean field problem by a finite-player cooperative optimisation problem, due to the propagation of chaos, together with the usage of finite-dimensional solvers. This avoids the need to directly approximate functions on an infinite-dimensional domain, and allows for more efficient memory usage and faster computation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01431v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Discrete latent factor models (DLFMs) are widely used in various domains such as machine learning, economics, neuroscience, psychology, etc. Currently, fitting a DLFM to some dataset relies on a customized solver for individual models, which requires lots of effort to implement and is limited to the targeted specific instance of DLFMs. In this paper, we propose a generic framework based on CVXPY, which allows users to specify and solve the fitting problem of a wide range of DLFMs, including both regression and classification models, within a very short script. Our framework is flexible and inherently supports the integration of regularization terms and constraints on the DLFM parameters and latent factors, such that the users can easily prototype the DLFM structure according to their dataset and application scenario. We introduce our open-source Python implementation and illustrate the framework in several examples.</description>

Abstract: We propose a transformation algorithm for a class of Linear Parameter-Varying (LPV) systems with functional affine dependence on parameters, where the system matrices depend affinely on nonlinear functions of the scheduling varable, into Linear Fractional Transformation (LFT) systems. The transformation preserves input-output behavior and minimality, and the uncertainity block of the resulting LFT system is linear in the scheduling variables of the LPV system.</description>

      <title>Dual certificates of primal cone membership</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12256v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss easily verifiable cone membership certificates, that is, certificates proving relations of the form $b\in K$ for convex cones $K$, that consist of vectors in the dual cone $K^*$. Vectors in the dual cone are usually associated with separating hyperplanes, and so they are interpreted as certificates of non-membership in the standard theory of duality. Complementing this, we present constructive certification schemes through which members of the dual cone can be interpreted as primal membership certificates. Every vector in the interior of $K$ is assigned a full-dimensional cone of certificates, making the numerical computation of rigorous certificates easy, provided that the dual cone has an efficiently computable logarithmically homogeneous self-concordant barrier. Of particular interest are cones that are low-dimensional linear images of much higher dimensional cones. In the context of optimization (as opposed to feasibility) problems, these certificates can be used to easily compute, using a closed-form formula, exact primal feasible solutions from suitable dual feasible solutions, with the guarantee that the closer the dual solutions are to optimality, the closer to optimality are the computed primal solutions, too. We demonstrate that the new certification scheme is applicable to virtually every tractable subcone of nonnegative polynomials commonly used in polynomial optimization (such as SOS, SONC, SAGE and SDSOS polynomials, among others), facilitating the computation of rigorous nonnegativity certificates using numerical algorithms.</description>

      <title>Parallel Polyhedral Projection Method for the Convex Feasibility Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15895v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce and study the Parallel Polyhedral Projection Method (3PM) and the Approximate Parallel Polyhedral Projection Method (A3PM) for finding a point in the intersection of finitely many closed convex sets. Each iteration has two phases: parallel projections onto the target sets (exact in 3PM, approximate in A3PM), followed by an exact or approximate projection onto a polyhedron defined by supporting half-spaces. These strategies appear novel, as existing methods largely focus on parallel schemes like Cimmino's method. Numerical experiments demonstrate that A3PM often outperforms both classical and recent projection-based methods when the number of sets is greater than two. Theoretically, we establish global convergence for both 3PM and A3PM without regularity assumptions. Under a Slater condition or error bound, we prove linear convergence, even with inexact projections. Additionally, we show that 3PM achieves superlinear convergence under suitable geometric assumptions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19545v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes two primal-dual dynamical systems for solving linear equality constrained convex optimization problems: one with implicit Hessian damping only, and the other further incorporating Tikhonov regularization. We analyze the fast convergence properties of both dynamical systems and show that they achieve the same convergence rates. Moreover, we show that the trajectory generated by the dynamical system with Tikhonov regularization converges strongly to the minimum-norm solution of the underlying problem. Finally, numerical experiments are conducted to validate the theoretical findings. Interestingly, the trajectories exhibit smooth behavior even when the objective function is only continuously differentiable.</description>

      <title>Next-token prediction capacity: general upper bounds and a lower bound for transformers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13718v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a sequence of tokens, such as words, the task of next-token prediction is to predict the next-token conditional probability distribution. Decoder-only transformers have become effective models for this task, but their properties are still not fully understood. In particular, the largest number of distinct context sequences that a decoder-only transformer can interpolate next-token distributions for has not been established. To fill this gap, we prove upper and lower bounds on this number, which are equal up to a multiplicative constant. We prove these bounds in the general setting where next-token distributions can be arbitrary as well as the empirical setting where they are calculated from a finite number of document sequences. Our lower bounds are for one-layer multi-head decoder-only transformers and our proofs highlight an important injectivity property satisfied by self-attention. Furthermore, we provide numerical evidence that the minimal number of parameters for memorization is sufficient for being able to train the model to the entropy lower bound.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04591v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the online saddle point problem, which involves a sequence of two-player time-varying convex-concave games. Considering the nonstationarity of the environment, we adopt the duality gap and the dynamic Nash equilibrium regret as performance metrics for algorithm design. We present three variants of the proximal point method: the Online Proximal Point Method (OPPM), the Optimistic OPPM (OptOPPM), and the OptOPPM with multiple predictors. Each algorithm guarantees upper bounds for both the duality gap and dynamic Nash equilibrium regret, achieving near-optimality when measured against the duality gap. Specifically, in certain benign environments, such as sequences of stationary payoff functions, these algorithms maintain a nearly constant metric bound. Experimental results further validate the effectiveness of these algorithms. Lastly, this paper discusses potential reliability concerns associated with using dynamic Nash equilibrium regret as a performance metric. The technical appendix and code can be found at https://github.com/qingxin6174/PPM-for-OSP.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03698v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to settle the study of non-commutative optimal transport problems with convex regularization, in their static and finite-dimensional formulations. We consider both the balanced and unbalanced problem and show in both cases a duality result, characterizations of minimizers (for the primal) and maximizers (for the dual). An important tool we define is a non-commutative version of the classical $(c,\psi)$-transforms associated with a general convex regularization, which we employ to prove the convergence of Sinkhorn iterations in the balanced case. Finally, we show the convergence of the unbalanced transport problems towards the balanced one, as well as the convergence of transforms, as the marginal penalization parameters go to $+\infty$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18589v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Networked control systems enable real-time control and coordination of distributed systems, leveraging the low latency, high reliability, and massive connectivity offered by 5G and future 6G networks. Applications include autonomous vehicles, robotics, industrial automation, and smart grids. Despite networked control algorithms admitting nominal stability guarantees even in the presence of delays and packet dropouts, their practical performance still heavily depends on the specific characteristics and conditions of the underlying network. To achieve the desired performance while efficiently using communication resources, co-design of control and communication is pivotal. Although periodic schemes, where communication instances are fixed, can provide reliable control performance, unnecessary transmissions, when updates are not needed, result in inefficient usage of network resources. In this paper, we investigate the potential for co-design of model predictive control and network communication. To this end, we design and implement an event-triggered nonlinear model predictive controller for stabilizing a Furuta pendulum communicating over a tailored open radio access network 6G research platform. We analyze the control performance as well as network utilization under varying channel conditions and event-triggering criteria. Additionally, we analyze the network-induced delay pattern and its interaction with the event-triggered controller. Our results show that the event-triggered control scheme achieves similar performance to periodic control with reduced communication demand.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05217v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper deals with the large-scale behaviour of nonlinear minimum-cost flow problems on random graphs. In such problems, a random nonlinear cost functional is minimised among all flows (discrete vector-fields) with a prescribed net flux through each vertex. On a stationary random graph embedded in $\mathbb{R}^d$, our main result asserts that these problems converge, in the large-scale limit, to a continuous minimisation problem where an effective cost functional is minimised among all vector fields with prescribed divergence. Our main result is formulated using $\Gamma$-convergence and applies to multi-species problems. The proof employs the blow-up technique by Fonseca and M\"uller in a discrete setting. One of the main challenges overcome is the construction of the homogenised energy density on random graphs without a periodic structure.</description>

      <title>Lagrangian Index Policy for Restless Bandits with Average Reward</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12641v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the Lagrange Index Policy (LIP) for restless multi-armed bandits with long-run average reward. In particular, we compare the performance of LIP with the performance of the Whittle Index Policy (WIP), both heuristic policies known to be asymptotically optimal under certain natural conditions. Even though in most cases their performances are very similar, in the cases when WIP shows bad performance, LIP continues to perform very well. We then propose reinforcement learning algorithms, both tabular and NN-based, to obtain online learning schemes for LIP in the model-free setting. The proposed reinforcement learning schemes for LIP require significantly less memory than the analogous schemes for WIP. We calculate analytically the Lagrange index for the restart model, which applies to the optimal web crawling and the minimization of the weighted age of information. We also give a new proof of asymptotic optimality in case of homogeneous arms as the number of arms goes to infinity, based on exchangeability and de Finetti's theorem.</description>

      <title>Inverse Reinforcement Learning via Convex Optimization</title>

Abstract: We consider the inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) problem, where an unknown reward function of some Markov decision process is estimated based on observed expert demonstrations. In most existing approaches, IRL is formulated and solved as a nonconvex optimization problem, posing challenges in scenarios where robustness and reproducibility are critical. We discuss a convex formulation of the IRL problem (CIRL) initially proposed by Ng and Russel, and reformulate the problem such that the domain-specific language CVXPY can be applied directly to specify and solve the convex problem. We also extend the CIRL problem to scenarios where the expert policy is not given analytically but by trajectory as state-action pairs, which can be strongly inconsistent with optimality, by augmenting some of the constraints. Theoretical analysis and practical implementation for hyperparameter auto-selection are introduced. This note helps the users to easily apply CIRL for their problems, without background knowledge on convex optimization.</description>

      <title>Solving Inverse Problem for Multi-armed Bandits via Convex Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18945v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the inverse problem of multi-armed bandits (IMAB) that are widely used in neuroscience and psychology research for behavior modelling. We first show that the IMAB problem is not convex in general, but can be relaxed to a convex problem via variable transformation. Based on this result, we propose a two-step sequential heuristic for (approximately) solving the IMAB problem. We discuss a condition where our method provides global solution to the IMAB problem with certificate, as well as approximations to further save computing time. Numerical experiments indicate that our heuristic method is more robust than directly solving the IMAB problem via repeated local optimization, and can achieve the performance of Monte Carlo methods within a significantly decreased running time. We provide the implementation of our method based on CVXPY, which allows straightforward application by users not well versed in convex optimization.</description>
