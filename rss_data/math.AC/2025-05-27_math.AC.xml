      <title>An Early History of Toric Ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Toric ideals are everywhere. They have been in the commutative algebra lexicon since about 1990 when Bernd Sturmfels used the term. The early days of toric ideals and their Gr\"obner bases were full of new results and promising developments in their applications. Bernd has been consistently their biggest promoter through his own work and that of his collaborators and students. This article is a personal and subjective recalling of the first decade of toric ideals when Bernd played a central role.</description>

      <title>Betti numbers and almost complete intersection monomial ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $R=K[x_1,\ldots, x_n]$ be the polynomial ring in $n$ variables over a field $K$ and let $I$ be a monomial ideal of $R$. In this paper, we present an explicit formula for the Betti numbers of almost complete intersection monomial ideals, which enables a rapid construction of their minimal free resolutions. In addition, we characterize the Cohen-Macaulayness of these ideals and also we show the same result for dominant monomial ideals.</description>

      <title>S-r-$ideals in Commutative Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article introduces the notion of $S-r-$ideals in commutative ring $H$ as a generalization of $ r-$ideals. Let $S$ be a multiplicatively closed subset and $A$ an ideal of $H$ with $S\cap A= \emptyset$. $A$ is called $S-r-ideal$ if $ \exists s\in S$ such that for $w,z\in H,\; wz\in A$ and $Ann(w)=0$, then $sz\in A.$ Basic properties of $S-r-$ideals are given. It is shown that an $r-$ideal is always an $S-r-$ideal, and the converse is true under some conditions. Various characterizations of $S-r-$ideals are introduced. In addition, the $S-r-$ideal concept is examined under ring homomorphism, Cartesian product, amalgamation, and trivial extension. In conclusion, $S-r-$ideals are studied in polynomial rings and it is investigated that when $A[x]$ is an $S-r-$ideal of $H[x].$</description>

      <title>Squared Linear Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study statistical models that are parametrized by squares of linear forms. All critical points of the likelihood function are real and positive. There is one for each region of the projective hyperplane arrangement. We study the ideal and singular locus of the model, and we give a determinantal presentation for its likelihood correspondence. We characterize tropical degenerations of the MLE, and we describe log-normal polytopes.</description>

      <title>On Certain Problems in the Theory of Root Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We carry forward the work started by the author and Bhagwat in [1] and develop the Theory of root clusters further in this article. We establish the Inverse root capacity problem for number fields which is a generalization of Inverse cluster size problem for number fields proved in [1]. We give a field theoretic formulation for the concept of minimal generating sets of splitting fields which was introduced by the author and Vanchinathan in [4] and establish the existence of field extensions over number fields for given degree and given cardinality of minimal generating set of Galois closure dividing the degree. We improve on the inverse problems proved in [1] and this article by proving that there exist arbitrarily large finite families of pairwise non-isomorphic extensions having additional properties that satisfy the given conditions.</description>

      <title>Graded Betti numbers of a hyperedge ideal associated to join of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07308v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite simple graph on the vertex set $V(G)$ and let $r$ be a positive integer. We consider the hypergraph $\mathrm{Con}_r(G)$ whose vertices are the vertices of $G$ and the (hyper)edges are all $A\subseteq V(G)$ such that $|A|=r+1$ and the induced subgraph $G[A]$ is connected. The (hyper)edge ideal $I_r(G)$ of $\mathrm{Con}_r(G)$ is also the Stanley-Reisner ideal of a generalisation of the independence complex of $G$, called the $r$-independence complex $\mathrm{Ind}_r(G)$. In this article we make extensive use of the Mayer-Vietoris sequence to find the graded Betti numbers of $I_r(G_1*G_2)$ in terms of the graded Betti numbers of $I_r(G_1)$ and $I_r(G_2)$, where $G_1*G_2$ is the join of $G_1$ and $G_2$. Moreover, we find formulas for all the graded Betti numbers of $I_r(G)$, when $G$ is a complete graph, complete multipartite graph, cycle graph and the wheel graph.</description>

      <title>The entries of the Sinkhorn limit of an $m \times n$ matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02789v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use a variety of computational tools to obtain a degree-$\binom{m + n - 2}{m - 1}$ polynomial equation conjecturally satisfied by the top-left entry of the Sinkhorn limit of a positive $m \times n$ matrix. The degree of this equation has a combinatorial interpretation as the number of minors of an $(m - 1) \times (n - 1)$ matrix, and the coefficients involve a determinant formula that reflects new combinatorial structure on sets of minor specifications. The tools we use include Gr\"obner bases, which produce equations for small matrices; the PSLQ algorithm, which produces equations for larger matrices as part of an interpolation effort that required 1.5 years of CPU time; and ChatGPT o3-mini-high, which identified the signs of the off-diagonal entries in the determinant formula.</description>

      <title>Fedder-type criterion for quasi-$F^e$-splitting and quasi-$F$-regularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09015v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study quasi-$F^e$-split and quasi-$F$-regular singularities, which generalize Yobuko's quasi-$F$-splitting. We establish Fedder type criteria that characterize these properties for hypersurfaces. These criteria offer explicit tools for computation and verification. As an application, we construct a counterexample to the inversion of adjunction for quasi-$F$-regularity.</description>
