      <title>Facade Inspection: Design, Prototyping, and Testing of a Hybrid Cable-Driven Parallel Robot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the field of architecture, early detection of damage or degradation of building facades has become increasingly vital due to the need for continuous monitoring of structural integrity. Traditional methods, such as visual inspections, are being supplemented by technological advancements, especially in robotics, which offer innovative solutions for more efficient and precise inspections. This work focuses on the development of a five degree of freedom hybrid cable-driven parallel robot designed for vertical facade inspections. A detailed robot's design and CAD modeling, with a particular focus on a torque transmission mechanism that simplifies the motion of two cables using a single motor is presented. Two degrees of freedom are driven by cables, while the remaining three are driven by a Sarrus-type mechanism and a pan-tilt mechanism. The inverse kinematics models are also developed. A prototype is presented, involving additive manufacturing. A control system for tracking a zig-zag trajectory, commonly used in inspection tasks, was experimentally validated.</description>

      <title>Global statistical entropy and its implications for the main sequences of stars and galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a dissipative system such as star or a galaxy, the emitted photons are decoupled from matter particles and may therefore be considered as part of a closed system to which the Second Law of Thermodynamics applies. In the present paper, we define a global entropy using a statistical approach that accounts for the contributions of both matter particles and photons. The statistical contribution of radiation is described as a photon gas in the definition of this global entropy. The increase in global entropy can foster structure formation -- rather than disorder -- because structures such as stars and galaxies are efficient at dissipating energy in the form of photons, and thus at producing entropy. We show that stars generate a nearly equal amount of specific entropy, and therefore a comparable number of photons per unit mass, over their lifetime on the main sequence of the Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagram. This suggests that the main sequence of the HR diagram constitutes a locus of convergence toward a universal specific entropy production by stars. We then examine the implications of this approach for the star-formation main sequence in galaxies, and find a similar result. The emergence of organized structures in cosmic history reflects the second law, as organized matter is efficient at generating entropy through the slicing of energy into lower-frequency photons. This is also reflected in the dominant contribution of low-frequency photons to the extragalactic background light. Finally, we briefly discuss how this perspective may inform us on the possibility of the existence of life elsewhere in the universe.</description>

      <title>Universal Foundations of Thermodynamics: Entropy and Energy Beyond Equilibrium and Without Extensivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermodynamics is commonly presented as a theory of macroscopic systems in stable equilibrium, built upon assumptions of extensivity and scaling with system size. In this paper, we present a universal formulation of the elementary foundations of thermodynamics, in which entropy and energy are defined and employed beyond equilibrium and without assuming extensivity. The formulation applies to all systems -- large and small, with many or few particles -- and to all states, whether equilibrium or nonequilibrium, by relying on carefully stated operational definitions and existence principles rather than macroscopic idealizations. Key thermodynamic concepts, including adiabatic availability and available energy, are developed and illustrated using the energy-entropy diagram representation of nonequilibrium states, which provides geometric insight into irreversibility and the limits of work extraction for systems of any size. A substantial part of the paper is devoted to the analysis of entropy transfer in non-work interactions, leading to precise definitions of heat interactions and heat-and-diffusion interactions of central importance in mesoscopic continuum theories of nonequilibrium behavior in simple and complex solids and fluids. As a direct consequence of this analysis, Clausius inequalities and the Clausius statement of the second law are derived in forms explicitly extended to nonequilibrium processes. The resulting framework presents thermodynamics as a universal theory whose concepts apply uniformly to all systems, large and small, and provides a coherent foundation for both teaching and modern applications.</description>

      <title>The NHIM bifurcation scenario of a particle in an asymmetric binary system of dwarf galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11128v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the bifurcation scenario of a three-degree-of-freedom Hamiltonian system, a model based on the Lagrange restricted 3-body problem: a test particle moving in the gravitational field of a pair of interacting dwarf galaxies. The phase space of this system has 3 fundamental normally hyperbolic invariant manifolds (NHIMs) and their invariant stable and unstable manifolds form homoclinic/heteroclinic tangles. As the perturbation parameter increases, the NHIMs begin to lose normal hyperbolicity and their constituent KAM tori break, creating transient chaotic dynamics around them. We also observe a certain kind of coordination between the bifurcation scenarios of these NHIMs. We analyse this phenomenon using Poincar\'e maps and the delay time function.</description>
