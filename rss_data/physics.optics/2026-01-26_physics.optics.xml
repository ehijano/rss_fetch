      <title>Active learning for photonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active learning for photonic crystals explores the integration of analytic approximate Bayesian last layer neural networks (LL-BNNs) with uncertainty-driven sample selection to accelerate photonic band gap prediction. We employ an analytic LL-BNN formulation, corresponding to the infinite Monte Carlo sample limit, to obtain uncertainty estimates that are strongly correlated with the true predictive error on unlabeled candidate structures. These uncertainty scores drive an active learning strategy that prioritizes the most informative simulations during training. Applied to the task of predicting band gap sizes in two-dimensional, two-tone photonic crystals, our approach achieves up to a 2.6x reduction in required training data compared to a random sampling baseline while maintaining predictive accuracy. The efficiency gains arise from concentrating computational resources on high uncertainty regions of the design space rather than sampling uniformly. Given the substantial cost of full band structure simulations, especially in three dimensions, this data efficiency enables rapid and scalable surrogate modeling. Our results suggest that analytic LL-BNN based active learning can substantially accelerate topological optimization and inverse design workflows for photonic crystals, and more broadly, offers a general framework for data efficient regression across scientific machine learning domains.</description>

      <title>Single-View Holographic Volumetric 3D Printing with Coupled Differentiable Wave-Optical and Photochemical Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Volumetric additive manufacturing promises near-instantaneous fabrication of 3D objects, yet achieving high fidelity at the micro-scale remains challenging due to the complex interplay between optical diffraction and chemical effects. We present \emph{Single-View Holographic Volumetric Additive Manufacturing} (SHVAM), a mechanically static system that shapes volumetric dose distributions using time-multiplexed, phase-only holograms projected from a single optical axis. To achieve high resolution with SHVAM, we formulate hologram synthesis as a coupled inverse problem, integrating a differentiable wave-optical forward model with a simplified photochemical model that explicitly captures inhibitor diffusion and non-linear dose response. Optimizing hologram sequences under these coupled constraints allows us to pre-compensate for chemical blur, yielding higher print fidelity than optical-only optimization. We demonstrate the efficacy of SHVAM by fabricating simple 2D and 3D structures with lateral feature sizes of approximately \SI{10}{\micro\meter} within a $\SI{0.8}{\milli\meter} \times \SI{0.8}{\milli\meter} \times \SI{3}{\milli\meter}$ volume in seconds.</description>

      <title>Mode Conversion of Hyperbolic Phonon Polaritons in van der Waals terraces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electromagnetic hyperbolicity has driven key functionalities in nanophotonics, including super-resolution imaging, efficient energy control, and extreme light manipulation. Central to these advances are hyperbolic polaritons - nanometer-scale light-matter waves - spanning multiple energy-momentum dispersion orders with distinct mode profiles and incrementally high optical momenta. In this work, we report the mode conversion of hyperbolic polaritons across different dispersion orders by breaking the structure symmetry in engineered step-shape van der Waals (vdW) terraces. The mode conversion from the fundamental to high-order hyperbolic polaritons is imaged using scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscopy (s-SNOM) on both hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) and alpha-phase molybdenum trioxide (alpha-MoO3) vdW terraces. Our s-SNOM data, augmented with electromagnetic simulations, further demonstrate the alteration of polariton mode conversion by varying the step size of vdW terraces. The mode conversion reported here offers a practical approach toward integrating previously independent different-order hyperbolic polaritons with ultra-high momenta, paving the way for promising applications in nano-optical circuits, sensing, computation, information processing, and super-resolution imaging.</description>

      <title>Integrated Photonic Quantum Computing: From Silicon to Lithium Niobate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum technologies have surpassed classical systems by leveraging the unique properties of superposition and entanglement in photons and matter. Recent advancements in integrated quantum photonics, especially in silicon-based and lithium niobate platforms, are pushing the technology toward greater scalability and functionality. Silicon circuits have progressed from centimeter-scale, dual-photon systems to millimeter-scale, high-density devices that integrate thousands of components, enabling sophisticated programmable manipulation of multi-photon states. Meanwhile, lithium niobate, thanks to its wide optical transmission window, outstanding nonlinear and electro-optic coefficients, and chemical stability, has emerged as an optimal substrate for fully integrated photonic quantum chips. Devices made from this material exhibit high efficiency in in generating, manipulating, converting, storing, and detecting photon states, thereby establishing a basis for deterministic multi-photon generation and single-photon quantum interactions, as well as comprehensive frequency-state control. This review explores the development of integrated photonic quantum technologies based on both silicon and lithium niobate, highlighting invaluable insights gained from silicon-based systems that can assist the scaling of lithium niobate technologies. It examines the functional integration mechanisms of lithium niobate in electro-optic tuning and nonlinear energy conversion, showcasing its transformative impact throughout the photonic quantum computing process. Looking ahead, we speculate on the developmental pathways for lithium niobate platforms and their potential to revolutionize areas such as quantum communication, complex system simulation, quantum sampling, and optical quantum computing paradigms.</description>

      <title>Fast compression of pure-quartic solitons in nonlinear optical fibers via shortcuts to adiabaticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pure-quartic solitons (PQSs) supported by negative fourth-order dispersion have recently attracted considerable interest. In this work, we study both adiabatic and nonadiabatic compression of PQSs in nonlinear optical fibers with pure quartic dispersion in the presence of distributed gain and loss. Within a variational framework, we show that, for weak constant gain, the adiabatic compression dynamics can be mapped onto the motion of an effective particle in a slowly deformed potential, providing an intuitive physical picture. To overcome the long propagation distance required by conventional adiabatic condition, we exploit shortcuts to adiabaticity (STA) based on inverse engineering and derive analytical gain-loss profiles, with appropriate boundary conditions that realize a prescribed fast compression over a shorter propagation distance. Numerical simulations confirm the theoretical predictions and indicate a minimum propagation distance below which noticeable waveform distortion emerges. Compared with standard adiabatic references, the STA design significantly reduces the required compression distance while maintaining high-fidelity PQS evolution.</description>

      <title>Multi-wavelength UV Upconversion in Lanthanides assisted by Photonic Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Upconversion luminescence consists of the absorption of low-energies photons followed by the emission of a higher energy photon. The process has mainly been studied in lanthanides to upconvert monochromatic near-infrared excitation to near-infrared or visible light, and has been exploited only to a limited extent to upconvert broad excitations to ultra-violet. In addition, upconverting near-infrared and visible light to ultra-violet is crucial for applications such as solar-to-fuel conversion or environmental remediation. However, upconversion luminescence is limited by the low absorption cross-sections of lanthanides. In this work, we engineered Bloch modes in a photonic crystal to assist a multi-wavelength upconversion mechanism and demonstrated a 28-fold enhancement of ultra-violet upconversion luminescence of Yb3+-Tm3+ doped thin films. Materials were selected and optimized to design nanostructures without parasitic absorption losses. The geometric parameters of the photonic crystals were scanned to match a slow-light resonance with an excited-state transition of Tm3+ and thus enhance incident visible light absorption. Ultra-violet light extraction was also enhanced by photonic crystal Bloch modes. Each of these two contributions were quantified and the measured photonic band structures were well reproduced by electromagnetic simulations.</description>

      <title>Moderate-terahertz-induced plateau expansion of high-order harmonic generation to soft X-ray region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extending the high-harmonic cutoff with experimentally accessible fields is essential for advancing tabletop coherent extreme ultraviolet (EUV) and soft X-ray sources. Although terahertz (THz) assistance offers a promising route, cutoff extension at weak, laboratory-accessible THz strengths remain poorly understood. In this report, we comprehensively investigate THz-assisted high-order harmonic generation (HHG) using time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation simulations supported by classical trajectory analysis and Bohmian-based quantum dynamics. By mapping the plateau evolution versus THz strength, we show that even weak THz fields can extend the cutoff, producing a pronounced ``fish-fin'' structure whose prominent rays saturate near $I_p + 8 U_p$. We trace this extension to long electron excursions spanning several optical cycles before recombination, and provide a fully consistent explanation using both classical analysis and Bohmian trajectories flow. Our findings reveal that this cutoff-extension mechanism is remarkably robust, persisting across different atomic species and remaining insensitive to variations in the driving parameters. These results demonstrate that cutoff control is achievable with laboratory-scale THz fields, offering practical guidelines for engineering coherent high-energy HHG, and providing a robust pathway for tracking ultrafast electron motion in real time.</description>

      <title>Observation of polaritonic flat-band bound states in the continuum in a 2D magnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flat-band bound states in the continuum (BICs) are topological states with suppressed group velocity and robustness against radiation loss, offering a powerful platform for the exploration of non-Hermitian, nonlinear, topological phenomena and device applications. Van der Waals (vdW) metasurfaces have recently emerged as promising candidates for sustaining BICs and hybridizing with material transitions. However, the realization of flat-band BICs remains elusive. Here, we experimentally demonstrate polaritonic high-order BICs on a wide-angle flat band utilizing a subwavelength metasurface made of a vdW magnet CrSBr. The large oscillator strength of direct excitons in CrSBr enables near ultrastrong coupling with BICs, leading to strongly suppressed polaritonic angular dispersions. Remarkably, second-order polaritonic BICs become flat-band across a wide angular range, with corresponding Q factors exceeding 1500. Additionally, we find that these polaritonic BICs vanish in the transverse magnetic configuration, while leading to fascinating surface hyperbolic exciton-polaritons within the Reststrahlen band. Our findings underscore CrSBr as an exceptional platform for exploring flat-band photonics and polaritonics, paving the new avenue for advances in next-generation optical and quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Dipolar Electrostatic Modeling of Plasmonic Nanoparticles with Arbitrary Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate and fast calculations of localized surface plasmon resonances (LSPR) in metallic nanoparticles is essential for applications in sensing, nano-optics, and energy harvesting. Although full-wave numerical techniques such as the boundary element method (BEM) or the discrete dipole approximation (DDA) provide high accuracy, their computational cost often hinders rapid parametric studies. Here it is presented an ultrafast method that avoids solving large eigenproblems. Instead, only the dipolar component of the induced surface charge density \((\sigma_{dipolar})\) is retained through a expansion into Cartesion dipole basis, yielding a compact $3\times3$ geometric formulation that avoids full boundary-integral solves. The spectral response is obtained in a similar way, by projecting the Neumann--Poincar\'e surface operator onto the dipole subspace and evaluating a Rayleigh quotient, giving geometry-only eigenvalues again without an $N\times N$ eigenproblem. A major advantage of this method is that all geometry-dependent quantities are computed once per nanoparticle, while material dispersion and environmental changes enter only through simple algebraic expressions for the polarizability, enabling rapid evaluation across wavelengths. Retardation effects are incorporated through the modified long-wavelength approximation (MLWA), extending accuracy into the weakly retarded regime. The resulting framework provides a valuable tool for fast modelling and optimization of plasmonic nanoparticles at a significant lesser computational cost than BEM, DDA, and other standard tools.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive semi-automated fabrication system for quartz tuning fork AFM probe with real-time resonance frequency monitoring and Q-factor control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quartz tuning fork-based atomic force microscopy (QTF-AFM) has become a powerful tool for high-resolution imaging of both conductive and insulating samples, including semiconductor structures and metal-coated surfaces as well as soft matter under ambient conditions, while also enabling measurements in more demanding environments including ultrahigh vacuum and cryogenic conditions where conventional cantilever-based AFM often encounters limitations. However, the broader adoption of QTF-AFM has been constrained by the difficulty of attaching a cantilever tip to a quartz tuning fork (QTF) with the positional and angular precision required for repeatable and reproducible probe fabrication. For stable operation, the tip must be placed precisely at the midline of a single tine, aligned parallel to the prong axis, and rigidly secured. Even slight lateral offsets or angular deviations disrupt the intrinsic antisymmetric flexural mode, induce torsional coupling, and ultimately lead to systematic image distortions and reduced measurement integrity. In this work, we present a comprehensive, semi-automated QTF-tip fabrication system that integrates precision alignment, real-time frequency-sweep monitoring, and controlled Q-factor tuning within a single workflow. Experimental characterization demonstrates consistent probe preparation across multiple trials, preservation of sharp and well-defined resonance responses with deliberately adjustable damping, and high-fidelity, high-resolution imaging in practical scanning tests. This integrated approach provides a reproducible framework to QTF-based probe fabrication, lowering the technical barrier to QTF-AFM implementation and broadening its applicability across diverse sample types and operating environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.16322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report temperature-dependent switching between lower and upper polariton condensation in a GaAs/AlGaAs microcavity when both of these species have comparable populations in a mixture. Using angle-resolved photoluminescence, we observe that at low temperatures, condensation occurs in the lower polariton branch, while at elevated temperatures, the upper polariton branch can become favored. At an intermediate temperature, we observe instability in the condensate formation, characterized by metastable correlations of the fluctuations in intensity and linewidth of the lower and upper polariton branches.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Terahertz Photoresponse via Acoustic Plasmon Cavity Resonances in Scalable Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precise control and nanoscale confinement of terahertz (THz) fields are essential requirements for emerging applications in photonics, quantum technologies, wireless communications, and sensing. Here, we demonstrate a polaritonic cavity enhanced THz photoresponse in an antenna coupled device based on chemical vapor deposited (CVD) monolayer graphene. The dipole antenna lobes simultaneously serve as two gate electrodes, concentrate the impinging THz field, and efficiently launch acoustic graphene plasmons (AGPs), which drive a strong photo-thermoelectric (PTE) signal. Between 6 and 90 K, the photovoltage exhibits pronounced peaks, modulating the PTE response by up to 40\%, that we attribute to AGPs forming a Fabry P\'erot THz cavity in the full or half graphene channel. Combined full wave and transport thermal simulations accurately reproduce the gate controlled plasmon wavelength, spatial absorption profile, and the resulting nonuniform electron heating responsible for the PTE response. The lateral and vertical maximum confinement factors of the AGP wavelength relative to the incident wavelength are 165 and 4000, respectively, for frequencies from 1.83 to 2.52 THz. These results demonstrate that wafer scalable CVD graphene, without hBN encapsulation, can host coherent AGP resonances and exhibit an efficient polaritonic enhanced photoresponse under appropriate gating, antenna coupling, and AGP cavity design, opening a route to scalable, polarization and frequency selective, liquid nitrogen cooled, and low power consumption THz detection platforms based on plasmon thermoelectric transduction.</description>

Abstract: We theoretically compare the quantum Fisher information (QFI) for three configurations of absorption spectroscopy with undetected idler photons: an SU(1,1) interferometer with inter-source idler loss, an induced-coherence (IC) setup in which the idler partially seeds a second squeezer together with a vacuum ancilla, and a distributed-loss (DL) scheme with in-medium attenuation. We calculate the QFI as a function of parametric gain for both full and signal-only detection access. For losses below 99% and low to moderate gain, the SU(1,1) configuration provides the largest QFI. At high gain and intermediate loss, the IC scheme performs best, while under extreme attenuation (transmission $&lt;$ 1%) the DL model becomes optimal. These results delineate the measurement regimes in which each architecture is optimal in terms of information theory.</description>

      <title>Hybrid III-V/Silicon Quantum Photonic Device Generating Broadband Entangled Photon Pairs</title>

Abstract: The demand for integrated photonic chips combining the generation and manipulation of quantum states of light is steadily increasing, driven by the need for compact and scalable platforms for quantum information technologies. While photonic circuits with diverse functionalities are being developed in different single material platforms, it has become crucial to realize hybrid photonic circuits that harness the advantages of multiple materials while mitigating their respective weaknesses, resulting in enhanced capabilities. Here, we demonstrate a hybrid III-V/Silicon quantum photonic device combining the strong second-order nonlinearity and direct bandgap of the III-V semiconductor platform with the high maturity and CMOS compatibility of the silicon photonic platform. Our device embeds the spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) of photon pairs into an AlGaAs source and their vertical routing to an adhesively-bonded silicon-on-insulator circuitry, within an evanescent coupling scheme managing both polarization states. This enables the on-chip generation of broadband (&gt; 40 nm) telecom photons by type 0 and type 2 SPDC from the hybrid device, at room temperature and with internal pair generation rates exceeding $10^5$ $s^{-1}$ for both types, while the pump beam is strongly rejected. Two-photon interference with 92% visibility (and up to 99% upon 5 nm spectral filtering) proves the high energy-time entanglement quality of the produced quantum state, thereby enabling a wide range of quantum information applications on-chip, within an hybrid architecture compliant with electrical pumping and merging the assets of two mature and highly complementary platforms in view of out-of-the-lab deployment of quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Bright and pure single-photon source in a silicon chip by nanoscale positioning of a color center in a microcavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12744v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an all-silicon source of near-infrared linearly-polarized single photons, fabricated by nanoscale positioning of a color center in a silicon-on-insulator microcavity. The color center consists of a single W center, created at a well-defined position by Si$^{+}$ ion implantation through a 150 nm-diameter nanohole in a mask. A circular Bragg grating cavity resonant with the W's zero-phonon line at 1217 nm is fabricated at the same location as the nanohole. By Purcell enhancement of zero-phonon emission, we obtain a photon count rate of $1.29 \pm 0.01$ Mcounts/s at saturation under above-gap continuous-wave excitation with a Debye-Waller factor of $98.6\pm1.4 \%$. A clean photon antibunching behavior is observed up to pump powers ensuring saturation of the W's emission ($g^{(2)}(0)=0.06\pm0.02$ at $P=9.2P_{sat}$), evidencing that the density of additional parasitic fluorescent defects is very low. We also demonstrate the triggered emission of single photons with $93\pm2 \%$ purity under weak pulsed laser excitation. At high pulsed laser power, we reveal a detrimental effect of repumping processes, that could be mitigated using selective pumping schemes in the future. These results represent a major step towards on-demand sources of indistinguishable near-infrared single photons within silicon photonics chips.</description>

      <title>Nonadiabatic effect in high order harmonic generation revealed by a fully analytical method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20257v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a fully analytical method for describing high-order harmonic generation (HHG). This method is based on the strong-field approximation (SFA) and electron-trajectory theory, but utilizes the perturbation expansion on the Keldysh parameter $\gamma$. This expansion allows us to clearly differentiate the nonadiabatic and adiabatic effects on HHG. We show that the nonadiabatic effect relating to high-order expansion depends on the laser wavelength and remarkably enhances the HHG yields for cases of short wavelengths, providing deeper insights into wavelength-dependent HHG yields which are important in producing attosecond pulses. Especially, our method provides the analytical and accurate descriptions of nonadiabatic exit velocity and position of the tunneling electron at the tunnel exit. These descriptions are meaningful for constructing a fully analytical and quantitative Coulomb-included HHG model, which is crucial in HHG-based attosecond measurement.</description>

      <title>Continuous-wave, high-resolution, ultra-broadband mid-infrared nonlinear spectroscopy with tunable plasmonic nanocavities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12097v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vibrational sum- and difference-frequency generation (SFG and DFG) spectroscopy probes the nonlinear response of interfaces at mid-infrared (MIR) wavelengths while detecting upconverted signals in the visible. Recent work has moved from large-area films and colloids to nanoscale structures using dual-resonant plasmonic nanocavities that co-confine light and matter in deep-subwavelength volumes. Here we implement high-resolution ($&lt;1$~cm$^{-1}$), continuous-wave ultrabroadband vSFG, vDFG, and four-wave mixing (FWM) coherent spectroscopy from 860 to 1670~cm$^{-1}$ on dual-resonant antennas under ambient conditions. Using a commercial, broadly tunable quantum-cascade laser and eliminating geometric phase matching simplify acquisition and expand spectral reach. The resulting spectra exhibit coherent interference between resonant (vibrational) and nonresonant (electronic) contributions to the effective $\chi^{(2)}$, previously accessible only under fs/ps excitation. Simultaneous measurement of SFG and DFG enables a {ratiometric} analysis that suppresses common-mode drifts and helps reveal vibrational resonances. We demonstrate versatility and reproducibility across several analytes that span distinct relative strengths of vibrational vs. electronic nonlinearities. Together, these capabilities position our approach as a scalable route to multiplexed, high-resolution MIR sensing and a practical basis for chip-level, label-free coherent spectroscopy. It opens a feasible path toward single- and few-molecule optomechanical studies using nanoscale trapping strategies.</description>

      <title>Computational TIRF enables optical sectioning beyond the evanescent field for widefield fluorescence microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06853v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The resolving ability of widefield fluorescence microscopy is fundamentally limited by out-of-focus background owing to its low axial resolution, particularly for densely labeled biological samples. Although total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy provides strong near-surface sectioning, they are intrinsically restricted to shallow imaging depths. Here we present computational TIRF (cTIRF), a deep learning-based imaging modality that generates TIRF-like sectioned images directly from conventional widefield epifluorescence measurements without any optical modification. By integrating a physics-informed forward model into network training, cTIRF achieves effective background suppression and axial resolution enhancement while maintaining consistency with the measured widefield data. We demonstrate that cTIRF recovers near-surface structures with performance comparable to experimental TIRF, and further enables both single-frame and volumetric sectioned reconstruction in densely labeled samples where conventional TIRF fails. This work establishes cTIRF as a practical and deployable alternative to hardware-based optical sectioning in fluorescence microscopy, enabled by rapid adaptation to new imaging systems with minimal calibration data.</description>

      <title>Semiclassical Approach to Quantum Fisher Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21306v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum sensors driven into the quantum chaotic regime can have dramatically enhanced sensitivity, which, however, depends intricately on the details of the underlying classical phase space. Here, we develop an accurate semiclassical approach that provides direct and efficient access to the phase-space-resolved quantum Fisher information (QFI), the central quantity that quantifies the ultimate achievable sensitivity. This approximation reveals, in very concrete terms, that the QFI is large whenever a specific dynamical quantity tied to the sensing parameter displays a large variance over the course of the corresponding classical time evolution. Applied to a paradigmatic system of quantum chaos, the kicked top, we show that the semiclassical description is accurate already for modest quantum numbers, i.e., deep in the quantum regime, and it extends seamlessly to very high quantum numbers that are beyond the reach of other methods.</description>

      <title>Tunable passive squeezing of squeezed light through unbalanced double homodyne detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08540v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The full characterization of quantum states of light is a central task in quantum optics and information science. Double homodyne detection provides a powerful method for the direct measurement of the Husimi Q quasi-probability distribution, offering a complete state representation in a simple experimental setting and a limited time frame. Here, we demonstrate that double homodyne detection can serve as more than a passive characterization tool. By intentionally unbalancing the input beamsplitter that splits the quantum signal, we show that the detection scheme itself performs an effective squeezing or anti-squeezing transformation on the state being measured. The resulting measurement directly samples the Q function of the input state as if it were acted upon by a squeezing operator whose strength is a tunable experimental parameter: the beamsplitter's reflectivity. We experimentally realize this technique using a robust polarization-encoded double homodyne detection to characterize a squeezed vacuum state. Our results demonstrate the controlled deformation of the measured Q function's phase-space distribution, confirming that unbalanced double homodyne detection is a versatile tool for simultaneous quantum state manipulation and characterization.</description>
