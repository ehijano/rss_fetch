      <title>Dynamic Mode Decomposition of real-time 4D imaging data to explore intermittent fluid connectivity in subsurface flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interaction of multiple fluids through a heterogeneous pore space leads to complex pore-scale flow dynamics, such as intermittent pathway flow. The non-local nature of these dynamics, and the size of the 4D datasets acquired to capture them, presents challenges in identifying key fluctuations controlling fluid connectivity. To address these challenges, this work employs Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD), a data-driven algorithm that decomposes complex nonlinear systems into dominant spatio-temporal structures without relying on prior system assumptions. We present a workflow that identifies critical spatio-temporal regions exhibiting intermittent flow dynamics. This workflow is validated through three test cases, each exploring the impact of viscosity ratio on flow dynamics while maintaining a constant capillary number. Our findings demonstrate DMD's potential in analyzing extensive experimental datasets and identifying crucial intermittent flow structures, offering a powerful tool for understanding complex fluid behaviors in heterogeneous pore spaces. Using our method, we can quickly identify the timescales and locations of interest in an objective manner, providing a valuable diagnostic tool for analysing large synchrotron datasets.</description>

      <title>Finer resolutions and targeted process representations in earth systems models improve hydrologic projections and hydroclimate impacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Earth system models inform water policy and interventions, but knowledge gaps in hydrologic representations limit the credibility of projections and impacts assessments. The literature does not provide conclusive evidence that incorporating higher resolutions, comprehensive process models, and latest parameterization schemes, will result in improvements. We compare hydroclimate representations and runoff projections across two generations of Coupled Modeling Intercomparison Project (CMIP) models, specifically, CMIP5 and CMIP6, with gridded runoff from Global Runoff Reconstruction (GRUN) and ECMWF Reanalysis V5 (ERA5) as benchmarks. Our results show that systematic embedding of the best available process models and parameterizations, together with finer resolutions, improve runoff projections with uncertainty characterizations in 30 of the largest rivers worldwide in a mechanistically explainable manner. The more skillful CMIP6 models suggest that, following the mid-range SSP370 emissions scenario, 40% of the rivers will exhibit decreased runoff by 2100, impacting 260 million people.</description>

      <title>Differentiating frictionally locked asperities from kinematically coupled zones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Seismogenic zones resist slipping before generating earthquakes. Therefore, slip deficit, also called coupling, is a proxy of interseismic seismogenic zones on plate boundaries. However, when a part of a frictional interface sticks together (locked), its sliding surroundings are braked (coupled), so the coupled zone is an overestimate of the locked zone. Several indicators collectively termed mechanical coupling have been proposed to capture locked zones, but their relationship with true frictional locking is unclear. This study combines the frictional physics that locked and unlocked zones should observe, pointing out that we can estimate frictionally locked segments, known as asperities in fault mechanics, with remarkable simplicity but with high generality. First, we assemble the definitions of locking in various frictional failures and arrive at its unified expression: in any friction law, locking/unlocking is the pre-/post-yield phase of frictional failure, and their interseismic approximation is static-dynamic friction, which imposes either of the stationary (constant slip) or steady (constant stress) state. We then parametrize locked zones as distributed circular asperities on unlocked interfaces, to develop a trans-dimensional slip deficit inversion that incorporates the physical constraints of locking-unlocking (static-dynamic). We apply our method and detect five asperities in the Nankai subduction zone in southwestern Japan. Their spatial distribution indicates the asperity location correlates with seafloor topography. Estimated locked zones are consistent with slip zones of historical megathrust earthquakes while mostly not overlapping with slow-earthquake occurrence zones at depth, supporting a hypothesis that the nests of slow earthquakes are normally in long-wavelength scales coupled but unlocked.</description>

      <title>Evolution of Semi-convective Staircases in Rotating Flows: Consequences for Fuzzy Cores in Giant Planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10833v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent observational constraints on the internal structure of Jupiter and Saturn suggest that these planets have ``fuzzy" cores, i.e., gradients of the concentration of heavy elements that might span a large fraction of the planet's radius. These cores could be composed of a semi-convective staircase, i.e., multiple convective layers separated by diffusive interfaces arising from double-diffusive instabilities. However, to date, no study has demonstrated how such staircases can avoid layer mergers and persist over evolutionary time scales. In fact, previous work has found that these mergers occur rapidly, leading to only a single convective layer. Using 3D simulations, we demonstrate that rotation prolongs the lifetime of a convective staircase by increasing the timescale for both layer merger and erosion of the interface between the final two layers. We present an analytic model for the erosion phase, predicting that rotation increases the erosion time by a factor of approximately $\mathrm{Ro}^{-1/2}$, where $\mathrm{Ro}$ is the Rossby number of the convective flows (the ratio of the rotation period to the convective turnover time). For Jovian conditions at early times after formation (when convection is vigorous enough to mix a large fraction of the planet), we find the erosion time to be roughly $10^{9}~\mathrm{yrs}$ in the non-rotating case and $10^{11}~\mathrm{yrs}$ in the rotating case. If these timescales are confirmed with a larger suite of numerical simulations, the existence of convective staircases within the deep interiors of giant planets is a strong possibility, and rotation could be an important factor in the preservation of their fuzzy cores.</description>
