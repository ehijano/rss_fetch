      <title>Bayesian tit-for-tat fosters cooperation in evolutionary stochastic games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning from experience is a key feature of decision-making in cognitively complex organisms. Strategic interactions involving Bayesian inferential strategies can enable us to better understand how evolving individual choices to be altruistic or selfish can affect collective outcomes in social dilemmas. Bayesian strategies are distinguished, from their reactive opponents, in their ability to modulate their actions in the light of new evidence. We investigate whether such strategies can be resilient against reactive strategies when actions not only determine the immediate payoff but can affect future payoffs by changing the state of the environment. We use stochastic games to mimic the change in environment in a manner that is conditioned on the players' actions. By considering three distinct rules governing transitions between a resource-rich and a resource-poor states, we ascertain the conditions under which Bayesian tit-for-tat strategy can resist being invaded by reactive strategies. We find that the Bayesian strategy is resilient against a large class of reactive strategies and is more effective in fostering cooperation leading to sustenance of the resource-rich state. However, the extent of success of the Bayesian strategies depends on the other strategies in the pool and the rule governing transition between the two different resource states.</description>

      <title>Balanced spanning trees of the 2-by-N grid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We obtain an exact formula for the probability that a uniformly random spanning tree of the $2$-by-$n$ square grid is ``balanced'' in the sense that it has an edge whose removal partitions its vertices into two sets of equal size. We compute the exact limit of this probability as $n\rightarrow\infty$.</description>

      <title>Correlations in Motion: A Simple Response-Based Analysis of Traffic Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02307v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Why does a traffic jams form out of nowhere, and why does it stretch for kilometers even after the initial cause is passed? This study examines how congestion moves and spreads across motorways using a surprisingly simple method: response functions. These functions are based purely on data and show how changes in traffic flow, density, and velocity are connected over time and space. Using real-world data from German motorways, we track how traffic reacts to earlier disturbances, capturing the waves of slowing and accelerating that drivers experience in stop-and-go traffic. The results demonstrate how congestion propagates and how its rhythm can be measured and predicted. Unlike complex traffic models, this approach requires no simulations or assumptions about driver behavior. It works directly from the information provided by the road. The goal is clear: to understand congestion better so that we can manage it more effectively and perhaps spend less time stuck in it.</description>

      <title>A Review on Flood Risk Conceptual Frameworks and Development of Hierarchical Structures for Assessment Criteria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08803v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Climate change and rapid urbanization have intensified the frequency and severity of flooding, resulting in substantial damage to communities and infrastructure. Existing research on flood risk addresses a wide range of dimensions, ranging from physical to managerial aspects, which adds complexity to the assessment process. This paper introduces the Integrated Risk Linkages (IRL) Framework to provide a systematic approach to flood risk assessment. The IRL Framework defines risk as the intersection of hazard and vulnerability, where vulnerability is shaped by exposure and susceptibility. Resilience, including coping and adaptive capacities, serves as a counterbalance to vulnerability, offering pathways to mitigate flood impacts. Guided by the IRL framework, this study conducts a comprehensive review of the literature to identify and organize a detailed set of 91 criteria and sub-criteria into three hierarchical structures: hazard, susceptibility, and resilience. Furthermore, the paper evaluates existing flood risk assessment methods, emphasizing their characteristics and practical applicability. The IRL framework presented in this study offers essential insights for navigating the complexities of flood risk management, serving as a valuable reference for researchers, policymakers, and practitioners. Its flexibility empowers users to adapt the framework by utilizing specific components or its entire hierarchical structure, depending on data availability and research objectives, thereby enhancing its applicability across diverse contexts.</description>
