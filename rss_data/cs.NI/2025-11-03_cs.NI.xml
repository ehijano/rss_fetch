      <title>Trace-driven Path Emulation of Satellite Networks using Hypatia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing prevalence LEO satellite mega-constellations for global Internet coverage requires new approaches to evaluate the behavior of existing Internet protocols and applications. Traditional discrete event simulators like Hypatia allow for modeling these environments but fall short in evaluating real applications. This paper builds upon our previous work, in which we proposed a system design for trace-driven emulation of such satellite networks, bridging the gab between simulations and real-time testbeds. By extending the Hypatia framework, we record network path characteristics, e.g., delay and bandwidth, between two endpoints in the network during non-real-time simulations. Path characteristics are exported to Trace Files, which are replayed in real-time emulation environments on real systems, enabling evaluations with real software and human interaction. An advantage of our approach is its easy adaptability to existing simulation models. Our extensive evaluation involves multiple scenarios with different satellite constellations, illustrating the approach's accuracy in reproducing the behavior of satellite networks. Between full simulation, which serves as a baseline for our evaluation, and emulation runs, we observe high correlation metrics of up to 0.96, validating the approach's effectiveness. Challenges such as the lack of emulation-to-simulation feedback and synchronization issues are discussed.</description>

      <title>Analytical Model of NR-V2X Mode 2 with Re-Evaluation Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive message transmissions, unpredictable aperiodic messages, and high-speed moving vehicles contribute to the complex wireless environment, resulting in inefficient resource collisions in Vehicle to Everything (V2X). In order to achieve better medium access control (MAC) layer performance, 3GPP introduced several new features in NR-V2X. One of the most important is the re-evaluation mechanism. It allows the vehicle to continuously sense resources before message transmission to avoid resource collisions. So far, only a few articles have studied the re-evaluation mechanism of NR-V2X, and they mainly focus on network simulator that do not consider variable traffic, which makes analysis and comparison difficult. In this paper, an analytical model of NR-V2X Mode 2 is established, and a message generator is constructed by using discrete time Markov chain (DTMC) to simulate the traffic pattern recommended by 3GPP advanced V2X services. Our study shows that the re-evaluation mechanism improves the reliability of NR-V2X transmission, but there are still local improvements needed to reduce latency.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Geometry of Cylinders: Characterizing Inter-Nodal Distances for 3D UAV Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The analytical characterization of coverage probability in finite three-dimensional wireless networks has long remained an open problem, hindered by the loss of spatial independence in finite-node settings and the coupling between link distances and interference in bounded geometries. This paper closes this gap by presenting the first exact analytical framework for coverage probability in finite 3D networks modeled by a binomial point process within a cylindrical region. To bypass the intractability that has long hindered such analyses, we leverage the independence structure, convolution geometry, and derivative properties of Laplace transforms, yielding a formulation that is both mathematically exact and computationally efficient. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations verify the analysis and demonstrate significant accuracy gains over conventional Poisson-based models. The results generalize to any confined 3D wireless system, including aerial, underwater, and robotic networks.</description>

      <title>Study of Cluster-Based Routing Based on Machine Learning for UAV Networks in 6G</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sixth generation (6G) wireless networks are envisioned to deliver ultra-low latency, massive connectivity, and high data rates, enabling advanced applications such as autonomous {unmaned aerial vehicles (UAV)} swarms and aerial edge computing. However, realizing this vision in Flying Ad Hoc Networks (FANETs) requires intelligent and adaptive clustering mechanisms to ensure efficient routing and resource utilization. This paper proposes a novel machine learning-driven framework for dynamic cluster formation and cluster head selection in 6G-enabled FANETs. The system leverages mobility prediction using {Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)} and a composite optimization strategy based on signal strength and spatial proximity to identify optimal cluster heads. To evaluate the proposed method, comprehensive simulations were conducted in both centralized (5G) and decentralized (6G) topologies using realistic video traffic patterns. Results show that the proposed model achieves significant improvements in delay, jitter, and throughput in decentralized scenarios. These findings demonstrate the potential of combining machine learning with clustering techniques to enhance scalability, stability, and performance in next-generation aerial networks.</description>

      <title>Effective Delayed Patching for Transient Malware Control on Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Patching nodes is an effective network defense strategy for malware control at early stages, and its performance is primarily dependent on how accurately the infection propagation is characterized. In this paper, we aim to design a novel patching policy based on the susceptible-infected epidemic network model by incorporating the influence of patching delay--the type of delay that has been largely overlooked in designing patching policies in the literature, while being prevalent in practice. We first identify 'critical edges' that form a boundary to separate the most likely infected nodes from the nodes which would still remain healthy after the patching delay. We next leverage the critical edges to determine which nodes to be patched in light of limited patching resources at early stages. To this end, we formulate a constrained graph partitioning problem and use its solution to identify a set of nodes to patch or vaccinate under the limited resources, to effectively prevent malware propagation from getting through the healthy region. We numerically validate that our patching policy significantly outperforms other baseline policies in protecting the healthy nodes under limited patching resources and in the presence of patching delay.</description>

      <title>Selected Results from the REDMARS2 Project: Recursive Delay-Tolerant Networking using Bundle-in-Bundle Encapsulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This whitepaper presents parts of the results of the REDMARS2 project conducted in 2021-2022, exploring the integration of Recursive Internetwork Architecture (RINA) concepts into Delay- and Disruption-Tolerant Networking (DTN) protocols. Using Bundle-in-Bundle Encapsulation (BIBE), we implemented scope-based separation mechanisms resulting in scalable DTNs. A key contribution of this work is the demonstration of practical BIBE-based use cases, including a realistic Solar System Internet communication scenario involving unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and satellite relays. The evaluation, supported by field tests in collaboration with the European Space Agency (ESA), confirmed the viability of BIBE as a foundation for scalable, recursive, and interoperable DTN architectures.</description>

      <title>Challenging Tribal Knowledge -- Large Scale Measurement Campaign on Decentralized NAT Traversal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The promise of decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) systems is fundamentally gated by the challenge of Network Address Translation (NAT) traversal, with existing solutions often reintroducing the very centralization they seek to avoid. This paper presents the first large-scale, longitudinal measurement study of a fully decentralized NAT traversal protocol, Direct Connection Upgrade through Relay (DCUtR), within the production libp2p-based IPFS network. Drawing on over 4.4 million traversal attempts from 85,000+ distinct networks across 167 countries, we provide a definitive empirical analysis of modern P2P connectivity. We establish a contemporary baseline success rate of $70\% \pm 7.1\%$ for the hole-punching stage, providing a crucial new benchmark for the field. Critically, we empirically refute the long-held 'tribal knowledge' of UDP's superiority for NAT traversal, demonstrating that DCUtR's high-precision, RTT-based synchronization yields statistically indistinguishable success rates for both TCP and QUIC ($\sim70\%$). Our analysis further validates the protocol's design for permissionless environments by showing that success is independent of relay characteristics and that the mechanism is highly efficient, with $97.6\%$ of successful connections established on the first attempt. Building on this analysis, we propose a concrete roadmap of protocol enhancements aimed at achieving universal connectivity and contribute our complete dataset to foster further research in this domain.</description>

      <title>Asynchronous Risk-Aware Multi-Agent Packet Routing for Ultra-Dense LEO Satellite Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rise of ultra-dense LEO constellations creates a complex and asynchronous network environment, driven by their massive scale, dynamic topologies, and significant delays. This unique complexity demands an adaptive packet routing algorithm that is asynchronous, risk-aware, and capable of balancing diverse and often conflicting QoS objectives in a decentralized manner. However, existing methods fail to address this need, as they typically rely on impractical synchronous decision-making and/or risk-oblivious approaches. To tackle this gap, we introduce PRIMAL, an event-driven multi-agent routing framework designed specifically to allow each satellite to act independently on its own event-driven timeline, while managing the risk of worst-case performance degradation via a principled primal-dual approach. This is achieved by enabling agents to learn the full cost distribution of the targeted QoS objectives and constrain tail-end risks. Extensive simulations on a LEO constellation with 1584 satellites validate its superiority in effectively optimizing latency and balancing load. Compared to a recent risk-oblivious baseline, it reduces queuing delay by over 70%, and achieves a nearly 12 ms end-to-end delay reduction in loaded scenarios. This is accomplished by resolving the core conflict between naive shortest-path finding and congestion avoidance, highlighting such autonomous risk-awareness as a key to robust routing.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Telemetry Design for Fine-Grained Anomaly Detection in 5G User Planes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting QoS anomalies in 5G user planes requires fine-grained per-flow visibility, but existing telemetry approaches face a fundamental trade-off. Coarse per-class counters are lightweight but mask transient and per-flow anomalies, while per-packet telemetry postcards provide full visibility at prohibitive cost that grows linearly with line rate. Selective postcard schemes reduce overhead but miss anomalies that fall below configured thresholds or occur during brief intervals. We present Kestrel, a sketch-based telemetry system for 5G user planes that provides fine-grained visibility into key metric distributions such as latency tails and inter-arrival times at a fraction of the cost of per-packet postcards. Kestrel extends Count-Min Sketch with histogram-augmented buckets and per-queue partitioning, which compress per-packet measurements into compact summaries while preserving anomaly-relevant signals. We develop formal detectability guarantees that account for sketch collisions, yielding principled sizing rules and binning strategies that maximize anomaly separability. Our evaluations on a 5G testbed with Intel Tofino switches show that Kestrel achieves 10% better detection accuracy than existing selective postcard schemes while reducing export bandwidth by 10x.</description>

      <title>Medium Access for Push-Pull Data Transmission in 6G Wireless Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02637v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Medium access in 5G systems was tailored to accommodate diverse traffic classes through network resource slicing. 6G wireless systems are expected to be significantly reliant on Artificial Intelligence (AI), leading to data-driven and goal-oriented communication. This leads to augmentation of the design space for Medium Access Control (MAC) protocols, which is the focus of this article. We introduce a taxonomy based on push-based and pull-based communication, which is useful to categorize both the legacy and the AI-driven access schemes. We provide MAC protocol design guidelines for pull- and push-based communication in terms of goal-oriented criteria, such as timing and data relevance. We articulate a framework for co-existence between pull and push-based communications in 6G systems, combining their advantages. We highlight the design principles and main tradeoffs, as well as the architectural considerations for integrating these designs in Open-Radio Access Network (O-RAN) and 6G systems.</description>

      <title>The Role of Fractal Dimension in Wireless Mesh Network Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19366v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wireless mesh networks (WMNs) depend on the spatial distribution of nodes, which directly influences connectivity, routing efficiency, and overall network performance. Conventional models typically assume uniform or random node placement, which inadequately represent the complex, hierarchical spatial patterns observed in practical deployments. In this study, we present a novel algorithm that constructs WMN topologies with tunable fractal dimensions, allowing precise control over spatial self-similarity. By systematically varying the fractal dimension, the algorithm generates network layouts spanning a continuum of spatial complexities, ranging from sparse fragmented clusters to dense, cohesive structures. Through NS-3 simulations, Key performance metrics including throughput, latency, jitter, and packet delivery ratio were evaluated across a range of fractal dimensions. Comparative evaluations against classical random, small-world, scale-free, grid and hierarchical tree networks models reveal that high-dimensional fractal topologies achieve enhanced resilience and throughput under equivalent conditions. These findings demonstrate the potential of fractal geometry as a design paradigm for scalable and efficient WMN architectures.</description>

      <title>NETREPLICA: Toward a Programmable Substrate for Last-Mile Data Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13476v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Last-mile access networks are often the dominant bottlenecks for Internet applications, creating demand for data-generation approaches that are both realistic and reusable. Meeting this goal requires five properties: fidelity (capturing real network behaviors), controllability (systematic variation of network conditions), diversity (coverage of heterogeneous network behaviors), composability (construction of complex scenarios from simpler elements), and replicability (consistent outcomes across runs). Existing approaches satisfy only a subset of these requirements. This paper introduces NETREPLICA, a programmable substrate for last-mile data generation that achieves all five. NETREPLICA decomposes bottlenecks into static attributes (capacity, base latency, buffer size, shaping and active queue management policies) and dynamic attributes derived from passive traces. It introduces Cross-Traffic Profiles (CTPs) that transform passive production traces into reusable, parameterizable building blocks. By trimming, scaling, and recombining CTPs, NETREPLICA generates realistic yet tunable conditions, replaying non-reactive cross traffic alongside reactive application workloads and enabling reproducible construction of heterogeneous scenarios. In a case study on adaptive bitrate streaming, models trained with NETREPLICA-generated traces reduced transmission-time prediction error by up to 47% in challenging slow-path domains (&gt;=400 ms RTT, &lt;=6 Mbps throughput) compared to models trained solely on production traces -- demonstrating the utility of NETREPLICA-generated data. Overall, NETREPLICA represents a first step toward a fully programmable data-generation substrate for networking.</description>

      <title>Careless Whisper: Exploiting Silent Delivery Receipts to Monitor Users on Mobile Instant Messengers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11194v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With over 3 billion users globally, mobile instant messaging apps have become indispensable for both personal and professional communication. Besides plain messaging, many services implement additional features such as delivery and read receipts informing a user when a message has successfully reached its target. This paper highlights that delivery receipts can pose significant privacy risks to users. We use specifically crafted messages that trigger delivery receipts allowing any user to be pinged without their knowledge or consent. By using this technique at high frequency, we demonstrate how an attacker could extract private information such as the online and activity status of a victim, e.g., screen on/off. Moreover, we can infer the number of currently active user devices and their operating system, as well as launch resource exhaustion attacks, such as draining a user's battery or data allowance, all without generating any notification on the target side. Due to the widespread adoption of vulnerable messengers (WhatsApp and Signal) and the fact that any user can be targeted simply by knowing their phone number, we argue for a design change to address this issue.</description>
