      <title>Novel Method to Estimate Kinetic Microparameters from Dynamic Whole-Body Imaging in Regular-Axial Field-of-View PET Scanners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For whole-body (WB) kinetic modeling based on a typical PET scanner, a multipass multibed scanning protocol is necessary because of the limited axial field of view. Such a protocol introduces loss of early dynamics of the time-activity curve (TAC) and sparsity in TAC measurements, inducing uncertainty in parameter estimation when using prevalent least squares estimation (LSE) (i.e., common standard) especially for kinetic microparameters. We developed and investigated a method to estimate microparameters enabling parametric imaging, by focusing on general image qualities, overall visibility, and tumor detectability. Our method, denoted parameter combination-driven estimation (PCDE), has two distinctive characteristics: 1) improved probability of having one-on-one mapping between early and late dynamics in TACs (the former missing from typical protocols) at the cost of the precision of the estimated parameter, and 2) utilization of multiple aspects of TAC in selection of best fits. To compare the general image quality of the two methods, we plotted tradeoff curves for noise and bias. We also evaluated the impact of different iteration numbers of the OSEM reconstruction algorithm on the tradeoff curves. In addition, for overall visibility, the overall signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and spatial noise were calculated and compared. Furthermore, the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and relative error of the tumor-to-background ratio were calculated. Furthermore, we implemented and tested the proposed method on patient datasets to further verify clinical applicability. Overall, improved general image quality was verified in microparametric images (i.e., reduction in overall NRMSE). The overall visibility and tumor detectability were also improved. For our patient study, improved overall visibility and tumor detectability were demonstrated in micoparametric images.</description>

      <title>Synchronous PIV measurements of a self-powered blood turbine and pump couple for right ventricle support</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A blood turbine-pump system (iATVA), resembling a turbocharger was proposed as a mechanical right-heart assist device without external drive power. In this study, the iATVA system is investigated with particular emphasis on the blood turbine flow dynamics. A time-resolved 2D particle image velocimetry (PIV) set-up equipped with a beam splitter and two high speed cameras, allowed simultaneous recordings from both the turbine and pump impellers at 7 different phased-locked instances. The iATVA prototype is 3D printed using an optically clear resin following our earlier PIV protocols. Results showed that magnetically coupled impellers operated synchronously. As the turbine flow rate increased from 1.6 to 2.4 LPM, the rotational speed and relative inlet flow angle increase from 630 to 900 rpm, and 38 to 55% respectively. At the trailing edges, backflow region spanned 3/5 of the total passage outlet flow, and an extra leakage flow was observed at the leading edge. For this initial turbine design, approximately, 75% of the turbine blade passage was not contributing to the impulse operation mode. The maximum non-wall shear rate was ~2288 s-1 near to the inlet exit, which is significantly lower than the commercial blood pumps, encouraging further research and blood experiments of this novel concept. Experimental results will improve the hydrodynamic design of the turbine impeller and volute regions and will be useful in computational fluid dynamics validation studies of similar passive devices.</description>
