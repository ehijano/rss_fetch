      <title>LinkThief: Combining Generalized Structure Knowledge with Node Similarity for Link Stealing Attack against GNN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph neural networks(GNNs) have a wide range of applications in multimedia.Recent studies have shown that Graph neural networks(GNNs) are vulnerable to link stealing attacks,which infers the existence of edges in the target GNN's training graph.Existing attacks are usually based on the assumption that links exist between two nodes that share similar posteriors;however,they fail to focus on links that do not hold under this assumption.To this end,we propose LinkThief,an improved link stealing attack that combines generalized structure knowledge with node similarity,in a scenario where the attackers' background knowledge contains partially leaked target graph and shadow graph.Specifically,to equip the attack model with insights into the link structure spanning both the shadow graph and the target graph,we introduce the idea of creating a Shadow-Target Bridge Graph and extracting edge subgraph structure features from it.Through theoretical analysis from the perspective of privacy theft,we first explore how to implement the aforementioned ideas.Building upon the findings,we design the Bridge Graph Generator to construct the Shadow-Target Bridge Graph.Then,the subgraph around the link is sampled by the Edge Subgraph Preparation Module.Finally,the Edge Structure Feature Extractor is designed to obtain generalized structure knowledge,which is combined with node similarity to form the features provided to the attack model.Extensive experiments validate the correctness of theoretical analysis and demonstrate that LinkThief still effectively steals links without extra assumptions.</description>

      <title>PyRIT: A Framework for Security Risk Identification and Red Teaming in Generative AI System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) is becoming ubiquitous in our daily lives. The increase in computational power and data availability has led to a proliferation of both single- and multi-modal models. As the GenAI ecosystem matures, the need for extensible and model-agnostic risk identification frameworks is growing. To meet this need, we introduce the Python Risk Identification Toolkit (PyRIT), an open-source framework designed to enhance red teaming efforts in GenAI systems. PyRIT is a model- and platform-agnostic tool that enables red teamers to probe for and identify novel harms, risks, and jailbreaks in multimodal generative AI models. Its composable architecture facilitates the reuse of core building blocks and allows for extensibility to future models and modalities. This paper details the challenges specific to red teaming generative AI systems, the development and features of PyRIT, and its practical applications in real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>FlipAttack: Jailbreak LLMs via Flipping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a simple yet effective jailbreak attack named FlipAttack against black-box LLMs. First, from the autoregressive nature, we reveal that LLMs tend to understand the text from left to right and find that they struggle to comprehend the text when noise is added to the left side. Motivated by these insights, we propose to disguise the harmful prompt by constructing left-side noise merely based on the prompt itself, then generalize this idea to 4 flipping modes. Second, we verify the strong ability of LLMs to perform the text-flipping task, and then develop 4 variants to guide LLMs to denoise, understand, and execute harmful behaviors accurately. These designs keep FlipAttack universal, stealthy, and simple, allowing it to jailbreak black-box LLMs within only 1 query. Experiments on 8 LLMs demonstrate the superiority of FlipAttack. Remarkably, it achieves $\sim$98\% attack success rate on GPT-4o, and $\sim$98\% bypass rate against 5 guardrail models on average. The codes are available at GitHub\footnote{https://github.com/yueliu1999/FlipAttack}.</description>

      <title>Demonstration Attack against In-Context Learning for Code Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized code intelligence by improving programming productivity and alleviating challenges faced by software developers. To further improve the performance of LLMs on specific code intelligence tasks and reduce training costs, researchers reveal a new capability of LLMs: in-context learning (ICL). ICL allows LLMs to learn from a few demonstrations within a specific context, achieving impressive results without parameter updating. However, the rise of ICL introduces new security vulnerabilities in the code intelligence field. In this paper, we explore a novel security scenario based on the ICL paradigm, where attackers act as third-party ICL agencies and provide users with bad ICL content to mislead LLMs outputs in code intelligence tasks. Our study demonstrates the feasibility and risks of such a scenario, revealing how attackers can leverage malicious demonstrations to construct bad ICL content and induce LLMs to produce incorrect outputs, posing significant threats to system security. We propose a novel method to construct bad ICL content called DICE, which is composed of two stages: Demonstration Selection and Bad ICL Construction, constructing targeted bad ICL content based on the user query and transferable across different query inputs. Ultimately, our findings emphasize the critical importance of securing ICL mechanisms to protect code intelligence systems from adversarial manipulation.</description>

      <title>Universally Optimal Watermarking Schemes for LLMs: from Theory to Practice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) boosts human efficiency but also poses misuse risks, with watermarking serving as a reliable method to differentiate AI-generated content from human-created text. In this work, we propose a novel theoretical framework for watermarking LLMs. Particularly, we jointly optimize both the watermarking scheme and detector to maximize detection performance, while controlling the worst-case Type-I error and distortion in the watermarked text. Within our framework, we characterize the universally minimum Type-II error, showing a fundamental trade-off between detection performance and distortion. More importantly, we identify the optimal type of detectors and watermarking schemes. Building upon our theoretical analysis, we introduce a practical, model-agnostic and computationally efficient token-level watermarking algorithm that invokes a surrogate model and the Gumbel-max trick. Empirical results on Llama-13B and Mistral-8$\times$7B demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Furthermore, we also explore how robustness can be integrated into our theoretical framework, which provides a foundation for designing future watermarking systems with improved resilience to adversarial attacks.</description>

      <title>Safeguard is a Double-edged Sword: Denial-of-service Attack on Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Safety is a paramount concern of large language models (LLMs) in their open deployment. To this end, safeguard methods aim to enforce the ethical and responsible use of LLMs through safety alignment or guardrail mechanisms. However, we found that the malicious attackers could exploit false positives of safeguards, i.e., fooling the safeguard model to block safe content mistakenly, leading to a new denial-of-service (DoS) attack on LLMs. Specifically, by software or phishing attacks on user client software, attackers insert a short, seemingly innocuous adversarial prompt into to user prompt templates in configuration files; thus, this prompt appears in final user requests without visibility in the user interface and is not trivial to identify. By designing an optimization process that utilizes gradient and attention information, our attack can automatically generate seemingly safe adversarial prompts, approximately only 30 characters long, that universally block over 97\% of user requests on Llama Guard 3. The attack presents a new dimension of evaluating LLM safeguards focusing on false positives, fundamentally different from the classic jailbreak.</description>

      <title>A Simple Method for Secret-Key Generation Between Mobile Users Across Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two or more mobiles users can continuously superimpose sequences of bits chosen from different packets or files already exchanged and authenticated between themselves to continuously renew a secret key for continuous strengthening of their privacy and authentication. This accumulative, adaptable and additive (AAA) method is discussed in this paper. The equivocation to Eve of any bit in the generated key by the AAA method equals to the probability that not all corresponding independent bits exchanged between the users are intercepted by Eve. This performance, achieved without using any knowledge of non-stationary probabilities of bits being intercepted by Eve, is compared to an established capacity achievable using that knowledge. A secrecy robustness of the AAA method against some correlations known to Eve is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Can Watermarked LLMs be Identified by Users via Crafted Prompts?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text watermarking for Large Language Models (LLMs) has made significant progress in detecting LLM outputs and preventing misuse. Current watermarking techniques offer high detectability, minimal impact on text quality, and robustness to text editing. However, current researches lack investigation into the imperceptibility of watermarking techniques in LLM services. This is crucial as LLM providers may not want to disclose the presence of watermarks in real-world scenarios, as it could reduce user willingness to use the service and make watermarks more vulnerable to attacks. This work is the first to investigate the imperceptibility of watermarked LLMs. We design an identification algorithm called Water-Probe that detects watermarks through well-designed prompts to the LLM. Our key motivation is that current watermarked LLMs expose consistent biases under the same watermark key, resulting in similar differences across prompts under different watermark keys. Experiments show that almost all mainstream watermarking algorithms are easily identified with our well-designed prompts, while Water-Probe demonstrates a minimal false positive rate for non-watermarked LLMs. Finally, we propose that the key to enhancing the imperceptibility of watermarked LLMs is to increase the randomness of watermark key selection. Based on this, we introduce the Water-Bag strategy, which significantly improves watermark imperceptibility by merging multiple watermark keys.</description>

      <title>Research Directions for Verifiable Crypto-Physically Secure TEEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A niche corner of the Web3 world is increasingly making use of hardware-based Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) to build decentralized infrastructure. One of the motivations to use TEEs is to go beyond the current performance limitations of cryptography-based alternatives such as zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP), fully homomorphic encryption (FHE), and multi-party computation (MPC). Despite their appealing advantages, current TEEs suffer from serious limitations as they are not secure against physical attacks, and their attestation mechanism is rooted in the chip manufacturer's trust. As a result, Web3 applications have to rely on cloud infrastruture to act as trusted guardians of hardware-based TEEs and have to accept to trust chip manufacturers. This work aims at exploring how we could potentially architect and implement chips that would be secure against physical attacks and would not require putting trust in chip manufacturers. One goal of this work is to motivate the Web3 movement to acknowledge and leverage the substantial amount of relevant hardware research that already exists. In brief, a combination of: (1) physical unclonable functions (PUFs) to secure the root-of-trust; (2) masking and redundancy techniques to secure computations; (3) open source hardware and imaging techniques to verify that a chip matches its expected design; can help move towards attesting that a given TEE can be trusted without the need to trust a cloud provider and a chip manufacturer.</description>

      <title>An Intelligent Quantum Cyber-Security Framework for Healthcare Data Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital healthcare is essential to facilitate consumers to access and disseminate their medical data easily for enhanced medical care services. However, the significant concern with digitalization across healthcare systems necessitates for a prompt, productive, and secure storage facility along with a vigorous communication strategy, to stimulate sensitive digital healthcare data sharing and proactive estimation of malicious entities. In this context, this paper introduces a comprehensive quantum-based framework to overwhelm the potential security and privacy issues for secure healthcare data management. It equips quantum encryption for the secured storage and dispersal of healthcare data over the shared cloud platform by employing quantum encryption. Also, the framework furnishes a quantum feed-forward neural network unit to examine the intention behind the data request before granting access, for proactive estimation of potential data breach. In this way, the proposed framework delivers overall healthcare data management by coupling the advanced and more competent quantum approach with machine learning to safeguard the data storage, access, and prediction of malicious entities in an automated manner. Thus, the proposed IQ-HDM leads to more cooperative and effective healthcare delivery and empowers individuals with adequate custody of their health data. The experimental evaluation and comparison of the proposed IQ-HDM framework with state-of-the-art methods outline a considerable improvement up to 67.6%, in tackling cyber threats related to healthcare data security.</description>

      <title>AutoPenBench: Benchmarking Generative Agents for Penetration Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative AI agents, software systems powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), are emerging as a promising approach to automate cybersecurity tasks. Among the others, penetration testing is a challenging field due to the task complexity and the diverse strategies to simulate cyber-attacks. Despite growing interest and initial studies in automating penetration testing with generative agents, there remains a significant gap in the form of a comprehensive and standard framework for their evaluation and development. This paper introduces AutoPenBench, an open benchmark for evaluating generative agents in automated penetration testing. We present a comprehensive framework that includes 33 tasks, each representing a vulnerable system that the agent has to attack. Tasks are of increasing difficulty levels, including in-vitro and real-world scenarios. We assess the agent performance with generic and specific milestones that allow us to compare results in a standardised manner and understand the limits of the agent under test. We show the benefits of AutoPenBench by testing two agent architectures: a fully autonomous and a semi-autonomous supporting human interaction. We compare their performance and limitations. For example, the fully autonomous agent performs unsatisfactorily achieving a 21% Success Rate (SR) across the benchmark, solving 27% of the simple tasks and only one real-world task. In contrast, the assisted agent demonstrates substantial improvements, with 64% of SR. AutoPenBench allows us also to observe how different LLMs like GPT-4o or OpenAI o1 impact the ability of the agents to complete the tasks. We believe that our benchmark fills the gap with a standard and flexible framework to compare penetration testing agents on a common ground. We hope to extend AutoPenBench along with the research community by making it available under https://github.com/lucagioacchini/auto-pen-bench.</description>

      <title>Practical Light Clients for Committee-Based Blockchains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light clients are gaining increasing attention in the literature since they obviate the need for users to set up dedicated blockchain full nodes. While the literature features a number of light client instantiations, most light client protocols optimize for long offline phases and implicitly assume that the block headers to be verified are signed by highly dynamic validators.
  In this paper, we show that (i) most light clients are rarely offline for more than a week, and (ii) validators are unlikely to drastically change in most permissioned blockchains and in a number of permissionless blockchains, such as Cosmos and Polkadot. Motivated by these findings, we propose a novel practical system that optimizes for such realistic assumptions and achieves minimal communication and computational costs for light clients when compared to existing protocols. By means of a prototype implementation of our solution, we show that our protocol achieves a reduction by up to $90$ and $40000\times$ (respectively) in end-to-end latency and up to $1000$ and $10000\times$ (respectively) smaller proof size when compared to two state-of-the-art light client instantiations from the literature.</description>

      <title>Camel: Communication-Efficient and Maliciously Secure Federated Learning in the Shuffle Model of Differential Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has rapidly become a compelling paradigm that enables multiple clients to jointly train a model by sharing only gradient updates for aggregation, without revealing their local private data. In order to protect the gradient updates which could also be privacy-sensitive, there has been a line of work studying local differential privacy (LDP) mechanisms to provide a formal privacy guarantee. With LDP mechanisms, clients locally perturb their gradient updates before sharing them out for aggregation. However, such approaches are known for greatly degrading the model utility, due to heavy noise addition. To enable a better privacy-utility tradeoff, a recently emerging trend is to apply the shuffle model of DP in FL, which relies on an intermediate shuffling operation on the perturbed gradient updates to achieve privacy amplification. Following this trend, in this paper, we present Camel, a new communication-efficient and maliciously secure FL framework in the shuffle model of DP. Camel first departs from existing works by ambitiously supporting integrity check for the shuffle computation, achieving security against malicious adversary. Specifically, Camel builds on the trending cryptographic primitive of secret-shared shuffle, with custom techniques we develop for optimizing system-wide communication efficiency, and for lightweight integrity checks to harden the security of server-side computation. In addition, we also derive a significantly tighter bound on the privacy loss through analyzing the Renyi differential privacy (RDP) of the overall FL process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Camel achieves better privacy-utility trade-offs than the state-of-the-art work, with promising performance.</description>

Abstract: Augmenting language models with image inputs may enable more effective jailbreak attacks through continuous optimization, unlike text inputs that require discrete optimization. However, new multimodal fusion models tokenize all input modalities using non-differentiable functions, which hinders straightforward attacks. In this work, we introduce the notion of a tokenizer shortcut that approximates tokenization with a continuous function and enables continuous optimization. We use tokenizer shortcuts to create the first end-to-end gradient image attacks against multimodal fusion models. We evaluate our attacks on Chameleon models and obtain jailbreak images that elicit harmful information for 72.5% of prompts. Jailbreak images outperform text jailbreaks optimized with the same objective and require 3x lower compute budget to optimize 50x more input tokens. Finally, we find that representation engineering defenses, like Circuit Breakers, trained only on text attacks can effectively transfer to adversarial image inputs.</description>

      <title>Dorami: Privilege Separating Security Monitor on RISC-V TEEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: TEE implementations on RISC-V offer an enclave abstraction by introducing a trusted component called the security monitor (SM). The SM performs critical tasks such as isolating enclaves from each other as well as from the OS by using privileged ISA instructions that enforce the physical memory protection. However, the SM executes at the highest privilege layer on the platform (machine-mode) along side firmware that is not only large in size but also includes third-party vendor code specific to the platform. In this paper, we present Dorami - a privilege separation approach that isolates the SM from the firmware thus reducing the attack surface on TEEs. Dorami re-purposes existing ISA features to enforce its isolation and achieves its goals without large overheads.</description>

      <title>TREBLE: Fast Software Updates by Creating an Equilibrium in an Active Software Ecosystem of Globally Distributed Stakeholders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents our experience with TREBLE, a two-year initiative to build the modular base in Android, a Java-based mobile platform running on the Linux kernel. Our TREBLE architecture splits the hardware independent core framework written in Java from the hardware dependent vendor implementations (e.g., user space device drivers, vendor native libraries, and kernel written in C/C++). Cross-layer communications between them are done via versioned, stable inter-process communication interfaces whose backward compatibility is tested by using two API compliance suites. Based on this architecture, we repackage the key Android software components that suffered from crucial post-launch security bugs as separate images. That not only enables separate ownerships but also independent updates of each image by interested ecosystem entities. We discuss our experience of delivering TREBLE architectural changes to silicon vendors and device makers using a yearly release model. Our experiments and industry rollouts support our hypothesis that giving more freedom to all ecosystem entities and creating an equilibrium are a transformation necessary to further scale the world largest open ecosystem with over two billion active devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents new methods that have the potential to improve privacy process efficiency with LLM and RAG. To reduce hallucination, we continually pre-train the base LLM model with a privacy-specific knowledge base and then augment it with a semantic RAG layer. Our evaluations demonstrate that this approach enhances the model performance (as much as doubled metrics compared to out-of-box LLM) in handling privacy-related queries, by grounding responses with factual information which reduces inaccuracies.</description>

      <title>Fine-Tuning Language Models with Differential Privacy through Adaptive Noise Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Language models are capable of memorizing detailed patterns and information, leading to a double-edged effect: they achieve impressive modeling performance on downstream tasks with the stored knowledge but also raise significant privacy concerns. Traditional differential privacy based training approaches offer robust safeguards by employing a uniform noise distribution across all parameters. However, this overlooks the distinct sensitivities and contributions of individual parameters in privacy protection and often results in suboptimal models. To address these limitations, we propose ANADP, a novel algorithm that adaptively allocates additive noise based on the importance of model parameters. We demonstrate that ANADP narrows the performance gap between regular fine-tuning and traditional DP fine-tuning on a series of datasets while maintaining the required privacy constraints.</description>

      <title>Towards Universal Certified Robustness with Multi-Norm Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing certified training methods can only train models to be robust against a certain perturbation type (e.g. $l_\infty$ or $l_2$). However, an $l_\infty$ certifiably robust model may not be certifiably robust against $l_2$ perturbation (and vice versa) and also has low robustness against other perturbations (e.g. geometric transformation). To this end, we propose the first multi-norm certified training framework \textbf{CURE}, consisting of a new $l_2$ deterministic certified training defense and several multi-norm certified training methods, to attain better \emph{union robustness} when training from scratch or fine-tuning a pre-trained certified model. Further, we devise bound alignment and connect natural training with certified training for better union robustness. Compared with SOTA certified training, \textbf{CURE} improves union robustness up to $22.8\%$ on MNIST, $23.9\%$ on CIFAR-10, and $8.0\%$ on TinyImagenet. Further, it leads to better generalization on a diverse set of challenging unseen geometric perturbations, up to $6.8\%$ on CIFAR-10. Overall, our contributions pave a path towards \textit{universal certified robustness}.</description>

      <title>FedCert: Federated Accuracy Certification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for training machine learning models in a decentralized manner, preserving data privacy by keeping local data on clients. However, evaluating the robustness of these models against data perturbations on clients remains a significant challenge. Previous studies have assessed the effectiveness of models in centralized training based on certified accuracy, which guarantees that a certain percentage of the model's predictions will remain correct even if the input data is perturbed. However, the challenge of extending these evaluations to FL remains unresolved due to the unknown client's local data. To tackle this challenge, this study proposed a method named FedCert to take the first step toward evaluating the robustness of FL systems. The proposed method is designed to approximate the certified accuracy of a global model based on the certified accuracy and class distribution of each client. Additionally, considering the Non-Independent and Identically Distributed (Non-IID) nature of data in real-world scenarios, we introduce the client grouping algorithm to ensure reliable certified accuracy during the aggregation step of the approximation algorithm. Through theoretical analysis, we demonstrate the effectiveness of FedCert in assessing the robustness and reliability of FL systems. Moreover, experimental results on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets under various scenarios show that FedCert consistently reduces the estimation error compared to baseline methods. This study offers a solution for evaluating the robustness of FL systems and lays the groundwork for future research to enhance the dependability of decentralized learning.

      <title>Oracle Separation Between Quantum Commitments and Quantum One-wayness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that there exists a unitary quantum oracle relative to which quantum commitments exist but no (efficiently verifiable) one-way state generators exist. Both have been widely considered candidates for replacing one-way functions as the minimal assumption for cryptography: the weakest cryptographic assumption implied by all of computational cryptography. Recent work has shown that commitments can be constructed from one-way state generators, but the other direction has remained open. Our results rule out any black-box construction, and thus settle this crucial open problem, suggesting that quantum commitments (as well as its equivalency class of EFI pairs, quantum oblivious transfer, and secure quantum multiparty computation) appear to be strictly weakest among all known cryptographic primitives.</description>

      <title>A Simple Framework for Secure Key Leasing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Secure key leasing (a.k.a. key-revocable cryptography) enables us to lease a cryptographic key as a quantum state in such a way that the key can be later revoked in a verifiable manner. We propose a simple framework for constructing cryptographic primitives with secure key leasing via the certified deletion property of BB84 states. Based on our framework, we obtain the following schemes.
  - A public key encryption scheme with secure key leasing that has classical revocation based on any IND-CPA secure public key encryption scheme. Prior works rely on either quantum revocation or stronger assumptions such as the quantum hardness of the learning with errors (LWE) problem.
  - A pseudorandom function with secure key leasing that has classical revocation based on one-way functions. Prior works rely on stronger assumptions such as the quantum hardness of the LWE problem.
  - A digital signature scheme with secure key leasing that has classical revocation based on the quantum hardness of the short integer solution (SIS) problem. Our construction has static signing keys, i.e., the state of a signing key almost does not change before and after signing. Prior constructions either rely on non-static signing keys or indistinguishability obfuscation to achieve a stronger goal of copy-protection.
  In addition, all of our schemes remain secure even if a verification key for revocation is leaked after the adversary submits a valid certificate of deletion. To our knowledge, all prior constructions are totally broken in this setting. Moreover, in our view, our security proofs are much simpler than those for existing schemes.</description>

      <title>A New World in the Depths of Microcrypt: Separating OWSGs and Quantum Money from QEFID</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While in classical cryptography, one-way functions (OWFs) are widely regarded as the "minimal assumption," the situation in quantum cryptography is less clear. Recent works have put forward two concurrent candidates for the minimal assumption in quantum cryptography: One-way state generators (OWSGs), postulating the existence of a hard search problem with an efficient verification algorithm, and EFI pairs, postulating the existence of a hard distinguishing problem. Two recent papers [Khurana and Tomer STOC'24; Batra and Jain FOCS'24] showed that OWSGs imply EFI pairs, but the reverse direction remained open. In this work, we give strong evidence that the opposite direction does not hold: We show that there is a quantum unitary oracle relative to which EFI pairs exist, but OWSGs do not. In fact, we show a slightly stronger statement that holds also for EFI pairs that output classical bits (QEFID). As a consequence, we separate, via our oracle, QEFID, and one-way puzzles from OWSGs and several other Microcrypt primitives, including efficiently verifiable one-way puzzles and unclonable state generators. In particular, this solves a problem left open in [Chung, Goldin, and Gray Crypto'24]. Using similar techniques, we also establish a fully black-box separation (which is slightly weaker than an oracle separation) between private-key quantum money schemes and QEFID pairs. One conceptual implication of our work is that the existence of an efficient verification algorithm may lead to qualitatively stronger primitives in quantum cryptography.</description>

      <title>Ward: Provable RAG Dataset Inference via LLM Watermarks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) improves LLMs by enabling them to incorporate external data during generation. This raises concerns for data owners regarding unauthorized use of their content in RAG systems. Despite its importance, the challenge of detecting such unauthorized usage remains underexplored, with existing datasets and methodologies from adjacent fields being ill-suited for its study. In this work, we take several steps to bridge this gap. First, we formalize this problem as (black-box) RAG Dataset Inference (RAG-DI). To facilitate research on this challenge, we further introduce a novel dataset specifically designed for benchmarking RAG-DI methods under realistic conditions, and propose a set of baseline approaches. Building on this foundation, we introduce Ward, a RAG-DI method based on LLM watermarks that enables data owners to obtain rigorous statistical guarantees regarding the usage of their dataset in a RAG system. In our experimental evaluation, we show that Ward consistently outperforms all baselines across many challenging settings, achieving higher accuracy, superior query efficiency and robustness. Our work provides a foundation for future studies of RAG-DI and highlights LLM watermarks as a promising approach to this problem.</description>

      <title>Kick Bad Guys Out! Conditionally Activated Anomaly Detection in Federated Learning with Zero-Knowledge Proof Verification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.04055v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) systems are susceptible to adversarial attacks, where malicious clients submit poisoned models to disrupt the convergence or plant backdoors that cause the global model to misclassify some samples. Current defense methods are often impractical for real-world FL systems, as they either rely on unrealistic prior knowledge or cause accuracy loss even in the absence of attacks. Furthermore, these methods lack a protocol for verifying execution, leaving participants uncertain about the correct execution of the mechanism. To address these challenges, we propose a novel anomaly detection strategy that is designed for real-world FL systems. Our approach activates the defense only when potential attacks are detected, and enables the removal of malicious models without affecting the benign ones. Additionally, we incorporate zero-knowledge proofs to ensure the integrity of the proposed defense mechanism. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing FL system security against a comprehensive set of adversarial attacks in various ML tasks.</description>

      <title>BreakHammer: Enhancing RowHammer Mitigations by Carefully Throttling Suspect Threads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13477v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: RowHammer is a major read disturbance mechanism in DRAM where repeatedly accessing (hammering) a row of DRAM cells (DRAM row) induces bitflips in other physically nearby DRAM rows. RowHammer solutions perform preventive actions (e.g., refresh neighbor rows of the hammered row) that mitigate such bitflips to preserve memory isolation, a fundamental building block of security and privacy in modern computing systems. However, preventive actions induce non-negligible memory request latency and system performance overheads as they interfere with memory requests. As shrinking technology node size over DRAM chip generations exacerbates RowHammer, the overheads of RowHammer solutions become prohibitively expensive. As a result, a malicious program can effectively hog the memory system and deny service to benign applications by causing many RowHammer-preventive actions.
  In this work, we tackle the performance overheads of RowHammer solutions by tracking and throttling the generators of memory accesses that trigger RowHammer solutions. To this end, we propose BreakHammer. BreakHammer 1) observes the time-consuming RowHammer-preventive actions of existing RowHammer mitigation mechanisms, 2) identifies hardware threads that trigger many of these actions, and 3) reduces the memory bandwidth usage of each identified thread. As such, BreakHammer significantly reduces the number of RowHammer-preventive actions performed, thereby improving 1) system performance and DRAM energy, and 2) reducing the maximum slowdown induced on a benign application, with near-zero area overhead. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate that BreakHammer effectively reduces the negative performance, energy, and fairness effects of eight RowHammer mitigation mechanisms. To foster further research we open-source our BreakHammer implementation and scripts at https://github.com/CMU-SAFARI/BreakHammer.</description>

      <title>Do Not Trust Power Management: A Survey on Internal Energy-based Attacks Circumventing Trusted Execution Environments Security Properties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15537v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over the past few years, several research groups have introduced innovative hardware designs for Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), aiming to secure applications against potentially compromised privileged software, including the kernel. Since 2015, a new class of software-enabled hardware attacks leveraging energy management mechanisms has emerged. These internal energy-based attacks comprise fault, side-channel and covert channel attacks. Their aim is to bypass TEE security guarantees and expose sensitive information such as cryptographic keys. They have increased in prevalence in the past few years. Popular TEE implementations, such as ARM TrustZone and Intel SGX, incorporate countermeasures against these attacks. However, these countermeasures either hinder the capabilities of the power management mechanisms or have been shown to provide insufficient system protection. This article presents the first comprehensive knowledge survey of these attacks, along with an evaluation of literature countermeasures. We believe that this study will spur further community efforts towards this increasingly important type of attacks.</description>

      <title>Scalable Private Search with Wally</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06761v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents Wally, a private search system that supports efficient semantic and keyword search queries against large databases. When sufficiently many clients are making queries, Wally's performance is significantly better than previous systems. In previous private search systems, for each client query, the server must perform at least one expensive cryptographic operation per database entry. As a result, performance degraded proportionally with the number of entries in the database. In Wally, we get rid of this limitation. Specifically, for each query the server performs cryptographic operations only against a few database entries. We achieve these results by requiring each client to add a few fake queries and send each query via an anonymous network to the server at independently chosen random instants. Additionally, each client also uses somewhat homomorphic encryption (SHE) to hide whether a query is real or fake. Wally provides $(\epsilon, \delta)$-differential privacy guarantee, which is an accepted standard for strong privacy. The number of fake queries each client makes depends inversely on the number of clients making queries. Therefore, the fake queries' overhead vanishes as the number of clients increases, enabling scalability to millions of queries and large databases. Concretely, Wally can process eight million queries in just 117 mins. That is around four orders of magnitude less than the state of the art.</description>

      <title>Bag of Tricks: Benchmarking of Jailbreak Attacks on LLMs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09324v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant capabilities in executing complex tasks in a zero-shot manner, they are susceptible to jailbreak attacks and can be manipulated to produce harmful outputs. Recently, a growing body of research has categorized jailbreak attacks into token-level and prompt-level attacks. However, previous work primarily overlooks the diverse key factors of jailbreak attacks, with most studies concentrating on LLM vulnerabilities and lacking exploration of defense-enhanced LLMs. To address these issues, we evaluate the impact of various attack settings on LLM performance and provide a baseline benchmark for jailbreak attacks, encouraging the adoption of a standardized evaluation framework. Specifically, we evaluate the eight key factors of implementing jailbreak attacks on LLMs from both target-level and attack-level perspectives. We further conduct seven representative jailbreak attacks on six defense methods across two widely used datasets, encompassing approximately 354 experiments with about 55,000 GPU hours on A800-80G. Our experimental results highlight the need for standardized benchmarking to evaluate these attacks on defense-enhanced LLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/usail-hkust/Bag_of_Tricks_for_LLM_Jailbreaking.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Inductive Miner</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04595v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Protecting personal data about individuals, such as event traces in process mining, is an inherently difficult task since an event trace leaks information about the path in a process model that an individual has triggered. Yet, prior anonymization methods of event traces like k-anonymity or event log sanitization struggled to protect against such leakage, in particular against adversaries with sufficient background knowledge. In this work, we provide a method that tackles the challenge of summarizing sensitive event traces by learning the underlying process tree in a privacy-preserving manner. We prove via the so-called Differential Privacy (DP) property that from the resulting summaries no useful inference can be drawn about any personal data in an event trace. On the technical side, we introduce a differentially private approximation (DPIM) of the Inductive Miner. Experimentally, we compare our DPIM with the Inductive Miner on 14 real-world event traces by evaluating well-known metrics: fitness, precision, simplicity, and generalization. The experiments show that our DPIM not only protects personal data but also generates faithful process trees that exhibit little utility loss above the Inductive Miner.</description>

      <title>EIA: Environmental Injection Attack on Generalist Web Agents for Privacy Leakage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11295v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generalist web agents have demonstrated remarkable potential in autonomously completing a wide range of tasks on real websites, significantly boosting human productivity. However, web tasks, such as booking flights, usually involve users' PII, which may be exposed to potential privacy risks if web agents accidentally interact with compromised websites, a scenario that remains largely unexplored in the literature. In this work, we narrow this gap by conducting the first study on the privacy risks of generalist web agents in adversarial environments. First, we present a realistic threat model for attacks on the website, where we consider two adversarial targets: stealing users' specific PII or the entire user request. Then, we propose a novel attack method, termed Environmental Injection Attack (EIA). EIA injects malicious content designed to adapt well to environments where the agents operate and our work instantiates EIA specifically for privacy scenarios in web environments. We collect 177 action steps that involve diverse PII categories on realistic websites from the Mind2Web, and conduct experiments using one of the most capable generalist web agent frameworks to date. The results demonstrate that EIA achieves up to 70% ASR in stealing specific PII and 16% ASR for full user request. Additionally, by accessing the stealthiness and experimenting with a defensive system prompt, we indicate that EIA is hard to detect and mitigate. Notably, attacks that are not well adapted for a webpage can be detected via human inspection, leading to our discussion about the trade-off between security and autonomy. However, extra attackers' efforts can make EIA seamlessly adapted, rendering such supervision ineffective. Thus, we further discuss the defenses at the pre- and post-deployment stages of the websites without relying on human supervision and call for more advanced defense strategies.</description>

      <title>MoJE: Mixture of Jailbreak Experts, Naive Tabular Classifiers as Guard for Prompt Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17699v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) in diverse applications underscores the pressing need for robust security measures to thwart potential jailbreak attacks. These attacks exploit vulnerabilities within LLMs, endanger data integrity and user privacy. Guardrails serve as crucial protective mechanisms against such threats, but existing models often fall short in terms of both detection accuracy, and computational efficiency. This paper advocates for the significance of jailbreak attack prevention on LLMs, and emphasises the role of input guardrails in safeguarding these models. We introduce MoJE (Mixture of Jailbreak Expert), a novel guardrail architecture designed to surpass current limitations in existing state-of-the-art guardrails. By employing simple linguistic statistical techniques, MoJE excels in detecting jailbreak attacks while maintaining minimal computational overhead during model inference. Through rigorous experimentation, MoJE demonstrates superior performance capable of detecting 90% of the attacks without compromising benign prompts, enhancing LLMs security against jailbreak attacks.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Challenges in Network Intrusion Detection Systems: Research Insights and Future Prospects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18736v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning has brought significant advances in cybersecurity, particularly in the development of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). These improvements are mainly attributed to the ability of machine learning algorithms to identify complex relationships between features and effectively generalize to unseen data. Deep neural networks, in particular, contributed to this progress by enabling the analysis of large amounts of training data, significantly enhancing detection performance. However, machine learning models remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks, where carefully crafted input data can mislead the model into making incorrect predictions. While adversarial threats in unstructured data, such as images and text, have been extensively studied, their impact on structured data like network traffic is less explored. This survey aims to address this gap by providing a comprehensive review of machine learning-based Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) and thoroughly analyzing their susceptibility to adversarial attacks. We critically examine existing research in NIDS, highlighting key trends, strengths, and limitations, while identifying areas that require further exploration. Additionally, we discuss emerging challenges in the field and offer insights for the development of more robust and resilient NIDS. In summary, this paper enhances the understanding of adversarial attacks and defenses in NIDS and guide future research in improving the robustness of machine learning models in cybersecurity applications.</description>

      <title>Buckle Up: Robustifying LLMs at Every Customization Stage via Data Curation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02220v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are extensively adapted for downstream applications through a process known as "customization," with fine-tuning being a common method for integrating domain-specific expertise. However, recent studies have revealed a vulnerability that tuning LLMs with malicious samples can compromise their robustness and amplify harmful content, an attack known as "jailbreaking." To mitigate such attack, we propose an effective defensive framework utilizing data curation to revise commonsense texts and enhance their safety implication from the perspective of LLMs. The curated texts can mitigate jailbreaking attacks at every stage of the customization process: before customization to immunize LLMs against future jailbreak attempts, during customization to neutralize jailbreaking risks, or after customization to restore the compromised models. Since the curated data strengthens LLMs through the standard fine-tuning workflow, we do not introduce additional modules during LLM inference, thereby preserving the original customization process. Experimental results demonstrate a substantial reduction in jailbreaking effects, with up to a 100% success in generating responsible responses. Notably, our method is effective even with commonsense texts, which are often more readily available than safety-relevant data. With the every-stage defensive framework and supporting experimental performance, this work represents a significant advancement in mitigating jailbreaking risks and ensuring the secure customization of LLMs.</description>

      <title>Continuous-Variable Quantum Key Distribution with key rates far above the PLOB bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04770v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Continuous-Variable Quantum Key Distribution (CVQKD) at large distances has such high noise levels that the error-correcting code must have very low rate. In this regime it becomes feasible to implement random-codebook error correction, which is known to perform close to capacity. We propose a reverse reconciliation scheme for CVQKD in which the first step is advantage distillation based on random-codebook error correction operated above the Shannon limit. Our scheme has a novel way of achieving statistical decoupling between the public reconciliation data and the secret key. We provide an analysis of the secret key rate for the case of Gaussian collective attacks, and we present numerical results. The best performance is obtained when the message size exceeds the mutual information $I(X;Y)$ between Alice's quadratures $X$ and Bob's measurements $Y$, i.e. the Shannon limit. This somewhat counter-intuitive result is understood from a tradeoff between code rate and frame rejection rate, combined with the fact that error correction for QKD needs to reconcile only random data. We obtain secret key rates that lie far above the Devetak-Winter value $I(X;Y) - I(E;Y)$, which is the upper bound in the case of one-way error correction. Furthermore, our key rates lie above the PLOB bound for Continuous-Variable detection, but below the PLOB bound for Discrete-Variable detection.</description>

      <title>Seeing the Forest through the Trees: Data Leakage from Partial Transformer Gradients</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00999v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have shown that distributed machine learning is vulnerable to gradient inversion attacks, where private training data can be reconstructed by analyzing the gradients of the models shared in training. Previous attacks established that such reconstructions are possible using gradients from all parameters in the entire models. However, we hypothesize that most of the involved modules, or even their sub-modules, are at risk of training data leakage, and we validate such vulnerabilities in various intermediate layers of language models. Our extensive experiments reveal that gradients from a single Transformer layer, or even a single linear component with 0.54% parameters, are susceptible to training data leakage. Additionally, we show that applying differential privacy on gradients during training offers limited protection against the novel vulnerability of data disclosure.</description>

      <title>GoldCoin: Grounding Large Language Models in Privacy Laws via Contextual Integrity Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11149v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Privacy issues arise prominently during the inappropriate transmission of information between entities. Existing research primarily studies privacy by exploring various privacy attacks, defenses, and evaluations within narrowly predefined patterns, while neglecting that privacy is not an isolated, context-free concept limited to traditionally sensitive data (e.g., social security numbers), but intertwined with intricate social contexts that complicate the identification and analysis of potential privacy violations. The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers unprecedented opportunities for incorporating the nuanced scenarios outlined in privacy laws to tackle these complex privacy issues. However, the scarcity of open-source relevant case studies restricts the efficiency of LLMs in aligning with specific legal statutes. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel framework, GoldCoin, designed to efficiently ground LLMs in privacy laws for judicial assessing privacy violations. Our framework leverages the theory of contextual integrity as a bridge, creating numerous synthetic scenarios grounded in relevant privacy statutes (e.g., HIPAA), to assist LLMs in comprehending the complex contexts for identifying privacy risks in the real world. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that GoldCoin markedly enhances LLMs' capabilities in recognizing privacy risks across real court cases, surpassing the baselines on different judicial tasks.</description>

      <title>Investigating Imperceptibility of Adversarial Attacks on Tabular Data: An Empirical Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11463v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adversarial attacks are a potential threat to machine learning models by causing incorrect predictions through imperceptible perturbations to the input data. While these attacks have been extensively studied in unstructured data like images, applying them to tabular data, poses new challenges. These challenges arise from the inherent heterogeneity and complex feature interdependencies in tabular data, which differ from the image data. To account for this distinction, it is necessary to establish tailored imperceptibility criteria specific to tabular data. However, there is currently a lack of standardised metrics for assessing the imperceptibility of adversarial attacks on tabular data. To address this gap, we propose a set of key properties and corresponding metrics designed to comprehensively characterise imperceptible adversarial attacks on tabular data. These are: proximity to the original input, sparsity of altered features, deviation from the original data distribution, sensitivity in perturbing features with narrow distribution, immutability of certain features that should remain unchanged, feasibility of specific feature values that should not go beyond valid practical ranges, and feature interdependencies capturing complex relationships between data attributes. We evaluate the imperceptibility of five adversarial attacks, including both bounded attacks and unbounded attacks, on tabular data using the proposed imperceptibility metrics. The results reveal a trade-off between the imperceptibility and effectiveness of these attacks. The study also identifies limitations in current attack algorithms, offering insights that can guide future research in the area. The findings gained from this empirical analysis provide valuable direction for enhancing the design of adversarial attack algorithms, thereby advancing adversarial machine learning on tabular data.</description>

      <title>TGIF: Text-Guided Inpainting Forgery Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11566v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Digital image manipulation has become increasingly accessible and realistic with the advent of generative AI technologies. Recent developments allow for text-guided inpainting, making sophisticated image edits possible with minimal effort. This poses new challenges for digital media forensics. For example, diffusion model-based approaches could either splice the inpainted region into the original image, or regenerate the entire image. In the latter case, traditional image forgery localization (IFL) methods typically fail. This paper introduces the Text-Guided Inpainting Forgery (TGIF) dataset, a comprehensive collection of images designed to support the training and evaluation of image forgery localization and synthetic image detection (SID) methods. The TGIF dataset includes approximately 75k forged images, originating from popular open-source and commercial methods, namely SD2, SDXL, and Adobe Firefly. We benchmark several state-of-the-art IFL and SID methods on TGIF. Whereas traditional IFL methods can detect spliced images, they fail to detect regenerated inpainted images. Moreover, traditional SID may detect the regenerated inpainted images to be fake, but cannot localize the inpainted area. Finally, both IFL and SID methods fail when exposed to stronger compression, while they are less robust to modern compression algorithms, such as WEBP. In conclusion, this work demonstrates the inefficiency of state-of-the-art detectors on local manipulations performed by modern generative approaches, and aspires to help with the development of more capable IFL and SID methods.
