      <title>Price Prediction Using Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of artificial intelligence has made significant contributions to the financial sector. One of the main interests of investors is price predictions. Technical and fundamental analyses, as well as econometric analyses, are conducted for price predictions; recently, the use of AI-based methods has become more prevalent. This study examines daily Dollar/TL exchange rates from January 1, 2020, to October 4, 2024. It has been observed that among artificial intelligence models, random forest, support vector machines, k-nearest neighbors, decision trees, and gradient boosting models were not suitable; however, multilayer perceptron and linear regression models showed appropriate suitability and despite the sharp increase in Dollar/TL rates in Turkey as of 2019, the suitability of valid models has been maintained.</description>

      <title>Economic evaluation of empowering older patients transitioning from hospital to home: Trial-based analysis of the 'Your Care Needs You' intervention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Transitioning from hospital to home presents significant challenges, particularly for patients aged 75 and above. The 'Your Care Needs You' (YCNY) intervention, evaluated through a cluster randomised controlled trial (cRCT), aims to empower these patients by providing essential information and skills to prepare them for being at home. This study evaluates the cost-effectiveness of the YCNY intervention compared to standard care within the UK National Health Service (NHS) over the trial's duration (90 days post-discharge). Methods: The economic evaluation utilised individual patient-level data from the YCNY cRCT. The analysis was conducted from the perspective of the NHS and Personal Social Services. The analysis calculated the adjusted mean differences in costs and Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) between the YCNY intervention and control groups. In our base case, Multilevel Mixed-Effects Generalised Linear Models (MME-GLM) were employed to account for the hierarchical data structure. Additional alternative scenarios and a probabilistic sensitivity analysis were conducted to assess the robustness of the findings. Results: The base case results indicated the YCNY intervention reduced costs ({\pounds}269) and improved outcomes (QALY gain of 0.0057). The net health benefit (NHB) of the YCNY intervention using a cost-effectiveness threshold of {\pounds}15.000/QALY was 0.0246. These findings suggest the YCNY intervention dominates usual care, with a high probability (89%) of the YCNY intervention being cost-effective at a {\pounds}15,000 per QALY threshold. The results remained robust across several alternative scenario analyses. Discussion: The YCNY intervention could represent a promising and potentially cost-effective approach for enhancing the safety and experience of older adults transitioning from hospital to home in the UK.</description>

      <title>On the Extent, Correlates, and Consequences of Reporting Bias in Survey Wages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surveys are an indispensable source of data for applied economic research; however, their reliance on self-reported information can introduce bias, especially if core variables such as personal income are misreported. To assess the extent and impact of this misreporting bias, we compare self-reported wages from the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) with administrative wages from social security records (IEB) for the same individuals. Using a novel and unique data linkage (SOEP-ADIAB), we identify a modest but economically significant reporting bias, with SOEP respondents underreporting their administrative wages by about 7.3%. This misreporting varies systematically with individual, household, and especially job and firm characteristics. In replicating common empirical analyses in which wages serve as either dependent or independent variables, we find that misreporting is consequential for some, but not all estimated relationships. It turns out to be inconsequential for examining the returns to education, but relevant for analyzing the gender wage gap. In addition we find that misreporting bias can significantly affect the results when wage is used as the independent variable. Specifically, estimates of the wage-satisfaction relationship are substantially overestimated when based on survey data, although this bias is mitigated when focusing on interpersonal changes. Our findings underscore that survey-based measures of individual wages can significantly bias commonly estimated empirical relationships. They also demonstrate the enormous research potential of linked administrative-survey data.</description>

      <title>Words that Move Markets- Quantifying the Impact of RBI's Monetary Policy Communications on Indian Financial Market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the impact of the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) monetary policy communications on Indian financial market from April 2014 to June 2024 using advanced natural language processing techniques. Employing BERTopic for topic modeling and a fine-tuned RoBERTa model for sentiment analysis, we assess how variations in sentiment across different economic topics affect the stock market. Our findings indicate that dovish sentiment generally leads to declines in equity markets, particularly in topics related to the interest rate policy framework and economic growth, suggesting that market participants interpret dovish language as signaling economic weakness rather than policy easing. Conversely, dovish sentiment regarding foreign exchange reserves management has a positive impact on equity market. These results highlight the importance of topic-specific communication strategies for central banks in emerging markets.</description>

      <title>Bridging an energy system model with an ensemble deep-learning approach for electricity price forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper combines a techno-economic energy system model with an econometric model to maximise electricity price forecasting accuracy. The proposed combination model is tested on the German day-ahead wholesale electricity market. Our paper also benchmarks the results against several econometric alternatives. Lastly, we demonstrate the economic value of improved price estimators maximising the revenue from an electric storage resource. The results demonstrate that our integrated model improves overall forecasting accuracy by 18 %, compared to available literature benchmarks. Furthermore, our robustness checks reveal that a) the Ensemble Deep Neural Network model performs best in our dataset and b) adding output from the techno-economic energy systems model as econometric model input improves the performance of all econometric models. The empirical relevance of the forecast improvement is confirmed by the results of the exemplary storage optimisation, in which the integration of the techno-economic energy system model leads to a revenue increase of up to 10 %.</description>

      <title>Idiosyncratic Risk, Government Debt and Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00471v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: How does public debt matter for price stability? If it is useful for the private sector to insure idiosyncratic risk, even transitory government debt expansions can exert upward pressure on interest rates and create inflation. As I demonstrate using an analytically tractable model, this holds in the presence of an active Taylor rule and does not require the absence of future fiscal consolidation. Further analysis using a quantitative 2-asset HANK model reveals the magnitude of the mechanism to crucially depend on the structure of the asset market: under common assumptions, the interest rate effects of public debt are either overly strong or overly weak. After disciplining this aspect based on evidence regarding its long-term relationship with treasury returns, my framework indicates relevant short-run effects of public debt on inflation under active monetary policy: In particular, in the HANK model the mechanism can account for US inflation remaining elevated in 2023 and afterwards.</description>

      <title>Maximal Social Welfare Relations on Infinite Populations Satisfying Permutation Invariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05851v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study social welfare relations (SWRs) on an infinite population. Our main result is a new characterization of a utilitarian SWR as the \emph{largest} SWR (in terms of subset when the weak relation is viewed as a set of pairs) which satisfies Strong Pareto, Permutation Invariance (elsewhere called ``Relative Anonymity'' and ``Isomorphism Invariance''), and a further ``Quasi-Independence'' axiom.</description>
