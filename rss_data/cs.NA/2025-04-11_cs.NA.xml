      <title>A Space-Time Continuous Galerkin Finite Element Method for Linear Schr\"odinger Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a space-time finite element method for the linear time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation with Dirichlet conditions in a bounded Lipschitz domain. The proposed discretization scheme is based on a space-time variational formulation of the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation. In particular, the space-time method is conforming and is of Galerkin-type, i.e., trial and test spaces are equal. We consider a tensor-product approach with respect to time and space, using piecewise polynomial, continuous trial and test functions. In this case, we state the global linear system and efficient direct space-time solvers based on exploiting the Kronecker structure of the global system matrix. This leads to the Bartels-Stewart method and the fast diagonalization method. Both methods result in solving a sequence of spatial subproblems. In particular, the fast diagonalization method allows for solving the spatial subproblems in parallel, i.e., a time parallelization is possible. Numerical examples for a two-dimensional spatial domain illustrate convergence in space-time norms and show the potential of the proposed solvers.</description>

      <title>High-order discretization errors for the Caputo derivative in H\"{o}lder spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building upon the recent work of Teso and Plociniczak (2025) regarding L1 discretization errors for the Caputo derivative in H\"{o}lder spaces, this study extends the analysis to higher-order discretization errors within the same functional framework. We first investigate truncation errors for the L2 and L1-2 methods, which approximate the Caputo derivative via piecewise quadratic interpolation. Then we generalize the results to arbitrary high-order discretization. Theoretical analyses reveal a unified error structure across all schemes: the convergence order equals the difference between the smoothness degree of the function space and the fractional derivative order, i.e., order of error = degree of smoothness - order of the derivative. Numerical experiments validate these theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Stability and Convergence of Strang Splitting Method for the Allen-Cahn Equation with Homogeneous Neumann Boundary Condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Strang splitting method has been widely used to solve nonlinear reaction-diffusion equations, with most theoretical convergence analysis assuming periodic boundary conditions. However, such analysis presents additional challenges for the case of homogeneous Neumann boundary condition. In this work the Strang splitting method with variable time steps is investigated for solving the Allen--Cahn equation with homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions. Uniform $H^k$-norm stability is established under the assumption that the initial condition $u^0$ belongs to the Sobolev space $H^k(\Omega)$ with integer $k\ge 0$, using the Gagliardo--Nirenberg interpolation inequality and the Sobolev embedding inequality. Furthermore, rigorous convergence analysis is provided in the $H^k$-norm for initial conditions $u^0 \in H^{k+6}(\Omega)$, based on the uniform stability. Several numerical experiments are conducted to verify the theoretical results, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>A computational study of low precision incomplete Cholesky factorization preconditioners for sparse linear least-squares problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our interest lies in the robust and efficient solution of large sparse linear least-squares problems. In recent years, hardware developments have led to a surge in interest in exploiting mixed precision arithmetic within numerical linear algebra algorithms to take advantage of potential savings in memory requirements, runtime and energy use, whilst still achieving the requested accuracy. We explore employing mixed precision when solving least-squares problems, focusing on the practicalities of developing robust approaches using low precision incomplete Cholesky factorization preconditioners. Key penalties associated with lower precision include a loss of reliability and less accuracy in the computed solution. Through experiments involving problems from practical applications, we study computing incomplete Cholesky factorizations of the normal matrix using low precision and using the factors to precondition LSQR using mixed precision. We investigate level-based and memory-limited incomplete factorization preconditioners. We find that the former are not effective for least-squares problems while the latter can provide high-quality preconditioners. In particular, half precision arithmetic can be considered if high accuracy is not required in the solution or the memory for the incomplete factors is very restricted; otherwise, single precision can be used, and double precision accuracy recovered while reducing memory consumption, even for ill-conditioned problems.</description>

      <title>Global approximation to the Boys functions for vectorized computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fast approximation to the Boys functions (related to the lower incomplete gamma function of half-integer parameter) by a single closed-form analytical expression for all argument values have been developed and tested. Besides the exponential function needed anyway for downward recursion, it uses a small number of addition, multiplication, division, and square root operations, and thus is straightforward to vectorize.</description>

      <title>On the instabilities of naive FEM discretizations for PDEs with sign-changing coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a scalar diffusion equation with a sign-changing coefficient in its principle part. The well-posedness of such problems has already been studied extensively provided that the contrast of the coefficient is non-critical. Furthermore, many different approaches have been proposed to construct stable discretizations thereof, because naive finite element discretizations are expected to be non-reliable in general. However, no explicit example proving the actual instability is known and numerical experiments often do not manifest instabilities in a conclusive manner. To this end we construct an explicit example with a broad family of meshes for which we prove that the corresponding naive finite element discretizations are unstable. On the other hand, we also provide a broad family of (non-symmetric) meshes for which we prove that the discretizations are stable. Together, these two findings explain the results observed in numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>A Riemannian Gradient Descent Method for the Least Squares Inverse Eigenvalue Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address an algorithm for the least squares fitting of a subset of the eigenvalues of an unknown Hermitian matrix lying an an affine subspace, called the Lift and Projection (LP) method, due to Chen and Chu (SIAM Journal on Numerical Analysis, 33 (1996), pp.2417-2430). The LP method iteratively `lifts' the current iterate onto the spectral constraint manifold then 'projects' onto the solution's affine subspace. We prove that this is equivalent to a Riemannian Gradient Descent with respect to a natural Riemannian metric. This insight allows us to derive a more efficient implementation, analyse more precisely its global convergence properties, and naturally append additional constraints to the problem. We provide several numerical experiments to demonstrate the improvement in computation time, which can be more than an order of magnitude if the eigenvalue constraints are on the smallest eigenvalues, the largest eigenvalues, or the eigenvalues closest to a given number. These experiments include an inverse eigenvalue problem arising in Inelastic Neutron Scattering of Manganese-6, which requires the least squares fitting of 16 experimentally observed eigenvalues of a $32400\times32400$ sparse matrix from a 5-dimensional subspace of spin Hamiltonian matrices.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Multi-Criteria Decision-Making for Circularity Performance of Modern Methods of Construction Products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The construction industry faces increasingly more significant pressure to reduce resource consumption, minimise waste, and enhance environmental performance. Towards the transition to a circular economy in the construction industry, one of the challenges is the lack of a standardised assessment framework and methods to measure circularity at the product level. To support a more sustainable and circular construction industry through robust and enhanced scenario analysis, this paper integrates probabilistic analysis into the coupled assessment framework; this research addresses uncertainties associated with multiple criteria and diverse stakeholders in the construction industry to enable more robust decision-making support on both circularity and sustainability performance. By demonstrating the application in three real-world MMC products, the proposed framework offers a novel approach to simultaneously assess the circularity and sustainability of MMC products with robustness and objectiveness.</description>

      <title>Physical significance of artificial numerical noise in direct numerical simulation of turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using clean numerical simulation (CNS) in which artificial numerical noise is negligible over a finite, sufficiently long interval of time, we provide evidence, for the first time, that artificial numerical noise in direct numerical simulation (DNS) of turbulence is approximately equivalent to thermal fluctuation and/or stochastic environmental noise. This confers physical significance on the artificial numerical noise of DNS of the Navier-Stokes equations. As a result, DNS on a fine mesh should correspond to turbulence under small internal/external physical disturbance, whereas DNS on a sparse mesh corresponds to turbulent flow under large physical disturbance, respectively. The key point is that: all of them have physical meanings and so are correct in terms of their deterministic physics, even if their statistics are quite different. This is illustrated herein. Our paper provides a positive viewpoint regarding the presence of artificial numerical noise in DNS.</description>

      <title>Global approximations to the error function of real argument for vectorized computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The error function of real argument can be uniformly approximated to a given accuracy by a single closed-form expression for the whole variable range either in terms of addition, multiplication, division, and square root operations only, or also using the exponential function. The coefficients have been tabulated for up to 128-bit precision. Tests of a computer code implementation using the standard single- and double-precision floating-point arithmetic show good performance and vectorizability.</description>

      <title>Min-Max Optimisation for Nonconvex-Nonconcave Functions Using a Random Zeroth-Order Extragradient Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores the performance of the random Gaussian smoothing Zeroth-Order ExtraGradient (ZO-EG) scheme considering min-max optimisation problems with possibly NonConvex-NonConcave (NC-NC) objective functions. We consider both unconstrained and constrained, differentiable and non-differentiable settings. We discuss the min-max problem from the point of view of variational inequalities. For the unconstrained problem, we establish the convergence of the ZO-EG algorithm to the neighbourhood of an $\epsilon$-stationary point of the NC-NC objective function, whose radius can be controlled under a variance reduction scheme, along with its complexity. For the constrained problem, we introduce the new notion of proximal variational inequalities and give examples of functions satisfying this property. Moreover, we prove analogous results to the unconstrained case for the constrained problem. For the non-differentiable case, we prove the convergence of the ZO-EG algorithm to a neighbourhood of an $\epsilon$-stationary point of the smoothed version of the objective function, where the radius of the neighbourhood can be controlled, which can be related to the ($\delta,\epsilon$)-Goldstein stationary point of the original objective function.</description>

      <title>Numerical solution by shape optimization method to an inverse shape problem in multi-dimensional advection-diffusion problem with space dependent coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work focuses on numerically solving a shape identification problem related to advection-diffusion processes with space-dependent coefficients using shape optimization techniques. Two boundary-type cost functionals are considered, and their corresponding variations with respect to shapes are derived using the adjoint method, employing the chain rule approach. This involves firstly utilizing the material derivative of the state system and secondly using its shape derivative. Subsequently, an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) combined with the Sobolev-gradient-descent algorithm is applied to stably solve the shape reconstruction problem. Numerical experiments in two and three dimensions are conducted to demonstrate the feasibility of the methods.</description>

      <title>Pychop: Emulating Low-Precision Arithmetic in Numerical Methods and Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the growing demand for low-precision arithmetic in computational science, we exploit lower-precision emulation in Python -- widely regarded as the dominant programming language for numerical analysis and machine learning. Low-precision training has revolutionized deep learning by enabling more efficient computation and reduced memory and energy consumption while maintaining model fidelity. To better enable numerical experimentation with and exploration of low precision computation, we developed the Pychop library, which supports customizable floating-point formats and a comprehensive set of rounding modes in Python, allowing users to benefit from fast, low-precision emulation in numerous applications. Pychop also introduces interfaces for both PyTorch and JAX, enabling efficient low-precision emulation on GPUs for neural network training and inference with unparalleled flexibility.
  In this paper, we offer a comprehensive exposition of the design, implementation, validation, and practical application of Pychop, establishing it as a foundational tool for advancing efficient mixed-precision algorithms. Furthermore, we present empirical results on low-precision emulation for image classification and object detection using published datasets, illustrating the sensitivity of the use of low precision and offering valuable insights into its impact. Pychop enables in-depth investigations into the effects of numerical precision, facilitates the development of novel hardware accelerators, and integrates seamlessly into existing deep learning workflows.

      <title>On the numerical approximation of the distance to singularity for matrix-valued functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.01220v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a matrix-valued function $\mathcal{F}(\lambda)=\sum_{i=1}^d f_i(\lambda) A_i$, with complex matrices $A_i$ and $f_i(\lambda)$ entire functions for $i=1,\ldots,d$, we discuss a method for the numerical approximation of the distance to singularity of $\mathcal{F}(\lambda)$. The closest singular matrix-valued function $\widetilde{\mathcal{F}}(\lambda)$ with respect to the Frobenius norm is approximated using an iterative method. The property of singularity on the matrix-valued function is translated into a numerical constraint for a suitable minimization problem. Unlike the case of matrix polynomials, in the general setting of matrix-valued functions the main issue is that the function $\det ( \widetilde{\mathcal{F}}(\lambda) )$ may have an infinite number of roots. An important feature of the numerical method consists in the possibility of addressing different structures, such as sparsity patterns induced by the matrix coefficients, in which case the search of the closest singular function is restricted to the class of functions preserving the structure of the matrices.</description>

      <title>Model order reduction of parametric dynamical systems by slice sampling tensor completion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07151v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated the great potential of reduced order modeling for parametric dynamical systems using low-rank tensor decompositions (LRTD). In particular, within the framework of interpolatory tensorial reduced order models (ROM), LRTD is computed for tensors composed of snapshots of the system's solutions, where each parameter corresponds to a distinct tensor mode. This approach requires full sampling of the parameter domain on a tensor product grid, which suffers from the curse of dimensionality, making it practical only for systems with a small number of parameters. To overcome this limitation, we propose a sparse sampling of the parameter domain, followed by a low-rank tensor completion. The resulting specialized tensor completion problem is formulated for a tensor of order $C + D$, where $C$ fully sampled modes correspond to the snapshot degrees of freedom, and $D$ partially sampled modes correspond to the system's parameters. To address this non-standard tensor completion problem, we introduce a low-rank tensor format called the hybrid tensor train. Completion in this format is then integrated into an interpolatory tensorial ROM. We demonstrate the effectiveness of both the completion method and the ROM on several examples of dynamical systems derived from finite element discretizations of parabolic partial differential equations with parameter-dependent coefficients or boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Randomized Kaczmarz with tail averaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19877v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The randomized Kaczmarz (RK) method is a well-known approach for solving linear least-squares problems with a large number of rows. RK accesses and processes just one row at a time, leading to exponentially fast convergence for consistent linear systems. However, RK fails to converge to the least-squares solution for inconsistent systems. This work presents a simple fix: average the RK iterates produced in the tail part of the algorithm. The proposed tail-averaged randomized Kaczmarz (TARK) converges for both consistent and inconsistent least-squares problems at a polynomial rate, which is known to be optimal for any row-access method. An extension of TARK also leads to efficient solutions for ridge-regularized least-squares problems.</description>

      <title>GridapROMs.jl: Efficient reduced order modelling in the Julia programming language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15994v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce GridapROMs, a Julia-based library for the numerical approximation of parameterized partial differential equations (PDEs) using a comprehensive suite of linear reduced order models (ROMs). The library is designed to be extendable and productive, leveraging an expressive high-level API built on the Gridap PDE solver backend, while achieving high performance through Julia's just-in-time compiler and advanced lazy evaluation techniques. GridapROMs is PDE-agnostic, enabling its application to a wide range of problems, including linear, nonlinear, single-field, multi-field, steady, and unsteady equations. This work details the library's key innovations, implementation principles, and core components, providing usage examples and demonstrating its capabilities by solving a fluid dynamics problem modeled by the Navier-Stokes equations in a 3D geometry.</description>

      <title>Accelerating a restarted Krylov method for matrix functions with randomization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22631v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many scientific applications require the evaluation of the action of the matrix function over a vector and the most common methods for this task are those based on the Krylov subspace. Since the orthogonalization cost and memory requirement can quickly become overwhelming as the basis grows, the Krylov method is often restarted after a few iterations. This paper proposes a new acceleration technique for restarted Krylov methods based on randomization. The numerical experiments show that the randomized method greatly outperforms the classical approach with the same level of accuracy. In fact, randomization can actually improve the convergence rate of restarted methods in some cases. The paper also compares the performance and stability of the randomized methods proposed so far for solving very large finite element problems, complementing the numerical analyses from previous studies.</description>

      <title>Policy iteration for the deterministic control problems -- a viscosity approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.00419v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the convergence rate of policy iteration for (deterministic) optimal control problems in continuous time. To overcome the problem of ill-posedness due to lack of regularity, we consider a semi-discrete scheme by adding a viscosity term via finite differences in space. We prove that PI for the semi-discrete scheme converges exponentially fast, and provide a bound on the error induced by the semi-discrete scheme. We also consider the discrete space-time scheme, where both space and time are discretized. Convergence rate of PI and the discretization error are studied.</description>

      <title>Mamba Neural Operator: Who Wins? Transformers vs. State-Space Models for PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02113v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) are widely used to model complex physical systems, but solving them efficiently remains a significant challenge. Recently, Transformers have emerged as the preferred architecture for PDEs due to their ability to capture intricate dependencies. However, they struggle with representing continuous dynamics and long-range interactions. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Mamba Neural Operator (MNO), a novel framework that enhances neural operator-based techniques for solving PDEs. MNO establishes a formal theoretical connection between structured state-space models (SSMs) and neural operators, offering a unified structure that can adapt to diverse architectures, including Transformer-based models. By leveraging the structured design of SSMs, MNO captures long-range dependencies and continuous dynamics more effectively than traditional Transformers. Through extensive analysis, we show that MNO significantly boosts the expressive power and accuracy of neural operators, making it not just a complement but a superior framework for PDE-related tasks, bridging the gap between efficient representation and accurate solution approximation.</description>

      <title>Distillation of Discrete Diffusion through Dimensional Correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08709v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated exceptional performances in various fields of generative modeling, but suffer from slow sampling speed due to their iterative nature. While this issue is being addressed in continuous domains, discrete diffusion models face unique challenges, particularly in capturing dependencies between elements (e.g., pixel relationships in image, sequential dependencies in language) mainly due to the computational cost of processing high-dimensional joint distributions. In this paper, (i) we propose "mixture" models for discrete diffusion that are capable of treating dimensional correlations while remaining scalable, and (ii) we provide a set of loss functions for distilling the iterations of existing models. Two primary theoretical insights underpin our approach: First, conventional models with element-wise independence can well approximate the data distribution, but essentially require {\it many sampling steps}. Second, our loss functions enable the mixture models to distill such many-step conventional models into just a few steps by learning the dimensional correlations. Our experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method in distilling pretrained discrete diffusion models across image and language domains.
