      <title>Multi-strain SIS dynamics with coinfection under host population structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coinfection phenomena are common in nature, yet there is a lack of analytical approaches for coinfection systems with a high number of circulating and interacting strains. In this paper, we investigated a coinfection SIS framework applied to N strains, co-circulating in a structured host population. Adopting a general formulation for fixed host classes, defined by arbitrary epidemiological traits such as class-specific transmission rates, susceptibilities, clearance rates, etc., our model can be easily applied in different frameworks: for example, when different host species share the same pathogen, in classes of vaccinated or non-vaccinated hosts, or even in classes of hosts defined by the number of contacts. Using the strain similarity assumption, we identify the fast and slow variables of the epidemiological dynamics on the host population, linking neutral and non-neutral strain dynamics, and deriving a global replicator equation. This global replicator equation allows to explicitly predict coexistence dynamics from mutual invasibility coefficients among strains. The derived global pairwise invasion fitness matrix contains explicit traces of the underlying host population structure, and of its entanglement with the strain interaction and trait landscape. Our work thus enables a more comprehensive study and efficient simulation of multi-strain dynamics in endemic ecosystems, paving the way to deeper understanding of global persistence and selection forces, jointly shaped by pathogen and host diversity.</description>

      <title>From Discrete to Continuous Mixed Populations of Conformists, Nonconformists, and Imitators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In two-strategy decision-making problems, individuals often imitate the highest earners or choose either the common or rare strategy.
  Individuals who benefit from the common strategy are conformists, whereas those who profit by choosing the less common one are called nonconformists.
  The population proportions of the two strategies may undergo perpetual fluctuations
  in finite, discrete, heterogeneous populations of imitators, conformists, and nonconformists.
  How these fluctuations evolve as population size increases was left as an open question and is addressed in this paper.
  We show that the family of Markov chains describing the discrete population dynamics forms a generalized stochastic approximation process for a differential inclusion--the continuous-time dynamics.
  Furthermore, we prove that the continuous-time dynamics always equilibrate.
  Then, by leveraging results from the stochastic approximation theory, we show that the amplitudes of fluctuations in the proportions of the two strategies in the population approach zero with probability one when the population size grows to infinity.
  Our results suggest that large-scale perpetual fluctuations are unlikely in large, well-mixed populations consisting of these three types, particularly when imitators follow the highest earners.</description>

      <title>Size and shape of terrestrial animals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Natural selection for terrestrial locomotion has yielded unifying patterns in the body shape of legged animals, often manifesting as scaling laws. One such pattern appears in the frontal aspect ratio. Smaller animals like insects typically adopt a landscape frontal aspect ratio, with a wider side-to-side base of support than center of mass height. Larger animals like elephants, however, are taller than wide with a portrait aspect ratio. Known explanations for postural scaling are restricted to animal groups with similar anatomical and behavioural motifs, but the trend in frontal aspect ratio transcends such commonalities. Here we show that vertebrates and invertebrates with diverse body plans, ranging in mass from 28 mg to 22000 kg, exhibit size-dependent scaling of the frontal aspect ratio driven by the need for lateral stability on uneven natural terrain. Because natural terrain exhibit scale-dependent unevenness, and the frontal aspect ratio is important for lateral stability during locomotion, smaller animals need a wider aspect ratio for stability. This prediction is based on the fractal property of natural terrain unevenness, requires no anatomical or behavioural parameters, and agrees with the measured scaling despite vast anatomical and behavioural differences. Furthermore, a statistical phylogenetic comparative analysis found that shared ancestry and random trait evolution cannot explain the measured scaling. Thus, our findings reveal that terrain roughness, acting through natural selection for stability, likely drove the macroevolution of frontal shape in terrestrial animals.</description>

      <title>Organismal Agency and Rapid Adaptation: The Phenopoiesis Algorithm for Phenotype-First Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evolutionary success depends on the capacity to adapt: organisms must respond to environmental challenges through both genetic innovation and lifetime learning. The gene-centric paradigm attributes evolutionary causality exclusively to genes, while Denis Noble's phenotype-first framework argues that organisms are active agents capable of interpreting genetic resources, learning from experience, and shaping their own development. However, this framework has remained philosophically intuitive but algorithmically opaque.
  We show for the first time that organismal agency can be implemented as a concrete computational process through heritable phenotypic patterns. We introduce the Phenopoiesis Algorithm, where organisms inherit not just genes but also successful phenotypic patterns discovered during lifetime learning. Through experiments in changing environments, these pattern-inheriting organisms achieve 3.4 times faster adaptation compared to gene-centric models. Critically, these gains require cross-generational inheritance of learned patterns rather than within-lifetime learning alone.
  We conclude that organismal agency is not a philosophical abstraction but an algorithmic mechanism with measurable adaptive value. The mechanism works through compositional reuse: organisms discover how to compose primitive elements into solutions, encode those compositional recipes, and transmit them to offspring. Evolution operates across multiple timescales -- fast, reversible phenotypic inheritance and slow, permanent genetic inheritance -- providing adaptive flexibility that single-channel mechanisms cannot achieve.</description>

      <title>Generalized Lotka-Volterra systems with quenched random interactions and saturating nonlinear response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04056v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The generalized Lotka-Volterra (GLV) equations with quenched random interactions have been extensively used to investigate the stability and dynamics of complex ecosystems. However, the standard linear interaction model suffers from pathological unbounded growth, especially under strong cooperation or heterogeneity. This work addresses that limitation by introducing a Monod-type saturating nonlinear response into the GLV framework. Using Dynamical Mean Field Theory, we derive analytical expressions for the species abundance distribution in the Unique Fixed Point phase and show the suppression of unbounded dynamics. Numerical simulations reveal a rich dynamical structure in the Multiple Attractor phase, including a transition between high-dimensional chaotic and low-volatility regimes, governed by interaction symmetry. These findings offer a more ecologically realistic foundation for disordered ecosystem models and highlight the role of nonlinearity and symmetry in shaping the diversity and resilience of large ecological communities.</description>

      <title>A mean-field theory for heterogeneous random growth with redistribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23189v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the competition between random multiplicative growth and redistribution/migration in the mean-field limit, when the number of sites is very large but finite. We find that for static random growth rates, migration should be strong enough to prevent localisation, i.e. extreme concentration on the fastest growing site. In the presence of an additional temporal noise in the growth rates, a third partially localised phase is predicted theoretically, using results from Derrida's Random Energy Model. Such temporal fluctuations mitigate concentration effects, but do not make them disappear. We discuss our results in the context of population growth and wealth inequalities.</description>
