      <title>exoTEDRF: An EXOplanet Transit and Eclipse Data Reduction Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here, I present the community with exoTEDRF (EXOplanet Transit and Eclipse Data Reduction Framework; formerly known as supreme-SPOON), an end-to-end pipeline for data reduction and light curve analysis of time series observations (TSOs) of transiting exoplanets with JWST. The pipeline is highly modular and designed to produce reliable spectra from raw JWST exposures. exoTEDRF (pronounced exo-tedorf) consists of four stages, each of which are further subdivided into a series of steps. These steps can either be run individually, for example in a Jupyter notebook, or via the command line using the provided configuration files. The steps are highly tunable, allowing full control over every parameter in the reduction. Each step also produces diagnostic plots to allow the user to verify their results at each intermediate stage, and compare outputs with other pipelines if so desired. Finally, exoTEDRF has also been designed to be run in "batch" mode: simultaneously running multiple reductions, each tweaking a subset of parameters, to understand any impacts on the resulting atmosphere spectrum.</description>

      <title>End-to-End simulation framework for astronomical spectrographs: SOXS, CUBES and ANDES</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present our numerical simulation approach for the End-to-End (E2E) model applied to various astronomical spectrographs, such as SOXS (ESO-NTT), CUBES (ESO-VLT), and ANDES (ESO-ELT), covering multiple wavelength regions. The E2E model aim at simulating the expected astronomical observations starting from the radiation of the scientific sources (or calibration sources) up to the raw-frame data produced by the detectors. The comprehensive description includes E2E architecture, computational models, and tools for rendering the simulated frames. Collaboration with Data Reduction Software (DRS) teams is discussed, along with efforts to meet instrument requirements. The contribution to the cross-correlation algorithm for the Active Flexure Compensation (AFC) system of CUBES is detailed.</description>

      <title>Multi-layer anti-reflection coats using ePTFE membrane for mm-wavelength plastic optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Future millimeter wavelength experiments aim to both increase aperture diameters and broaden bandwidths to increase the sensitivity of the receivers. These changes produce a challenging anti-reflection (AR) design problem for refracting and transmissive optics. The higher frequency plastic optics require consistently thin polymer coats across a wide area, while wider bandwidths require multilayer designs. We present multilayer AR coats for plastic optics of the high frequency BICEP Array receiver (200-300 GHz) utilizing an expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) membrane, layered and compressively heat-bonded to itself. This process allows for a range of densities (from 0.3g/cc to 1g/cc) and thicknesses (&gt;0.05mm) over a wide radius (33cm), opening the parameter space of potential AR coats in interesting directions. The layered ePTFE membrane has been combined with other polymer layers to produce band average reflections between 0.2% and 0.6% on high density polyethylene and a thin high modulus polyethylene window, respectively.</description>

      <title>Tackling the Problem of Distributional Shifts: Correcting Misspecified, High-Dimensional Data-Driven Priors for Inverse Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bayesian inference for inverse problems hinges critically on the choice of priors. In the absence of specific prior information, population-level distributions can serve as effective priors for parameters of interest. With the advent of machine learning, the use of data-driven population-level distributions (encoded, e.g., in a trained deep neural network) as priors is emerging as an appealing alternative to simple parametric priors in a variety of inverse problems. However, in many astrophysical applications, it is often difficult or even impossible to acquire independent and identically distributed samples from the underlying data-generating process of interest to train these models. In these cases, corrupted data or a surrogate, e.g. a simulator, is often used to produce training samples, meaning that there is a risk of obtaining misspecified priors. This, in turn, can bias the inferred posteriors in ways that are difficult to quantify, which limits the potential applicability of these models in real-world scenarios. In this work, we propose addressing this issue by iteratively updating the population-level distributions by retraining the model with posterior samples from different sets of observations and showcase the potential of this method on the problem of background image reconstruction in strong gravitational lensing when score-based models are used as data-driven priors. We show that starting from a misspecified prior distribution, the updated distribution becomes progressively closer to the underlying population-level distribution, and the resulting posterior samples exhibit reduced bias after several updates.</description>

      <title>The GLINT nulling interferometer: improving nulls for high-contrast imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: GLINT is a nulling interferometer downstream of the SCExAO extreme-adaptive-optics system at the Subaru Telescope (Hawaii, USA), and is a pathfinder instrument for high-contrast imaging of circumstellar environments with photonic technologies. GLINT is effectively a testbed for more stable, compact, and modular instruments for the era of 30m-class telescopes. GLINT is now undergoing an upgrade with a new photonic chip for more achromatic nulls, and for phase information to enable fringe tracking. Here we provide an overview of the motivations for the GLINT project and report on the design of the new chip, the on-site installation, and current status.</description>

      <title>Cross-Observatory Coordination with tilepy: A Novel Tool for Observations of Multi-Messenger Transient Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-domain astrophysics has leaped forward with the direct discovery of gravitational waves and the emergence of new generation instruments for multi-messenger studies. The capacity of the multi-messenger multi-wavelength community to effectively pursue follow-up observations is hindered by the suboptimal localization of numerous transient events and the escalating volume of alerts. Thus, we have developed an effective tool to overcome the observational and technical hurdles inherent in the emerging field of multi-messenger astrophysics. We present tilepy, a Python package for the automatic scheduling of follow-up observations of poorly localized transient events. It is ideally suited to tackle the challenge of complex follow-up in mid and small-FoV telescope campaigns, with or without human intervention. We demonstrate the capabilities of tilepy in the realm of multi-observatory, multi-wavelength campaigns, to cover the localization uncertainty region of various events ultimately aiming at pinpointing the source of the multi-messenger emission. The tilepy code is publicly available on GitHub and is sufficiently flexible to be employed either automatically or in a customized manner, tailored to collaboration and individual requirements. tilepy is also accessible via a public API and through the Astro-COLIBRI platform.</description>

      <title>Design, manufacture and metrology of additively manufactured, metal and ceramic lightweight circular mirror prototypes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spaced-based mirrors are a developing use-case for Additive Manufacturing (AM), the process that builds a part layer-by-layer. The increased geometric freedom results in novel and advantageous designs previously unachievable. Conventionally, mirror fabrication uses subtractive (milling &amp; turning), formative (casting) and fabricative (bonding) manufacturing methods; however, an additive method can simplify an assembly by consolidating individual components into one, and incorporating lattice structures and function optimised geometries to reduce the mass of components, which are beneficial to space-based instrumentation as mass and volume are constrained. Attention must be given to the printability of the design - build orientation and powder/resin removal from lattices and internal cavities are challenges when designing for AM.
  This paper will describe the design, manufacture and metrology of mirror prototypes from the Active Deployable Optical Telescope (ADOT) 6U CubeSat project. The AM mirror is 52mm in diameter, 10mm deep, with a convex 100mm radius of curvature reflective surface and deploys telescopically on three booms. The objectives of the designs were to combine the boom mounting features into the mirror and to lightweight both prototypes by 50% and 70% using internal, thin-walled lattices. Four final lattice designs were downselected through simulation and prototype validation. Prototypes were printed in the aluminium alloy AlSi10Mg using powder bed fusion and fused silica using stereolithography. Aluminium mirrors were single point diamond turned and had surface roughness measurements taken. Fused silica designs were adapted from the aluminium designs and have completed printing.</description>

      <title>Periodicity significance testing with null-signal templates: reassessment of PTF's SMBH binary candidates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Periodograms are widely employed for identifying periodicity in time series data, yet they often struggle to accurately quantify the statistical significance of detected periodic signals when the data complexity precludes reliable simulations. We develop a data-driven approach to address this challenge by introducing a null-signal template (NST). The NST is created by carefully randomizing the period of each cycle in the periodogram template, rendering it non-periodic. It has the same frequentist properties as a periodic signal template regardless of the noise probability distribution, and we show with simulations that the distribution of false positives is the same as with the original periodic template, regardless of the underlying data. Thus, performing a periodicity search with the NST acts as an effective simulation of the null (no-signal) hypothesis, without having to simulate the noise properties of the data. We apply the NST method to the supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHB) search in the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF), where Charisi et al. had previously proposed 33 high signal to (white) noise candidates utilizing simulations to quantify their significance. Our approach reveals that these simulations do not capture the complexity of the real data. There are no statistically significant periodic signal detections above the non-periodic background. To improve the search sensitivity we introduce a Gaussian quadrature based algorithm for the Bayes Factor with correlated noise as a test statistic, in contrast to the standard signal to white noise. We show with simulations that this improves sensitivity to true signals by more than an order of magnitude. However, using the Bayes Factor approach also results in no statistically significant detections in the PTF data.</description>

      <title>Ionospheric effect on the synthetic Epoch of Reionization observations with the SKA1-Low</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The redshifted $21$\,cm signal of neutral hydrogen can be used as a direct probe of the intergalactic medium during Cosmic Dawn\,(CD) and Epoch of Reionization\,(EoR). However, detecting this inherently weak signal has numerous challenges. The major ones include accurate foreground removal from low-frequency radio observations and systematics arising from instrumental effects. The Earth's ionosphere poses a major obstacle at these low radio frequencies. Thus, a systematic study of ionospheric effects on these sensitive low-frequency observations is critical, given that the construction of the Square Kilometre Array (SKA1-Low) is in full progress. We use the end-to-end pipeline, called {\sc 21cme2e}, to study the effect of time-varying ionospheric corruption on the $21$\,cm power spectrum recovery. We use two models: a) a catalogue-based model focused on source position shift due to the refractive effect of the ionosphere and b) a realistic ionospheric condition generated using Kolmogorov's turbulence model. We assess the effect of the imperfections thus generated on the extraction of \HI\ $21$\,cm signal power spectrum. Our study shows that beyond ``median ionospheric offset" ($\theta_{\text{MIO}} \lesssim 0.1''$), the $21$\,cm signal from the EoR is unaffected by residual ionospheric effects. Our study emphasizes the need for the development of efficient ionospheric calibration algorithms for the upcoming SKA1-Low observations to extract the \HI\ $21$\,cm power spectra from the CD/EoR.</description>

      <title>Identifying pulsar candidates in interferometric radio images using scintillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pulsars have been primarily detected by their narrow pulses or periodicity in time domain data. Interferometric surveys for pulsars are challenging due to the trade-off between beam sensitivity and beam size and the corresponding tradeoff between survey sensitivity (depth), sky coverage, and computational efforts. The detection sensitivity of time-domain searches for pulsars is affected by dispersion smearing, scattering, and rapid orbital motion of pulsars in binaries. We have developed a new technique to select pulsar candidates in interferometric radio images by identifying scintillating sources and measuring their scintillation bandwidth and timescale. Identifying likely candidates allows sensitive, focused time-domain searches, saving computational effort. Pulsar scintillation is independent of its timing properties and hence offers a different selection of pulsars compared to time-domain searches. Candidates identified from this method could allow us to find hard-to-detect pulsars, such as sub-millisecond pulsars and pulsars in very compact, highly-accelerated binary orbits. We use uGMRT observations in the fields of PSR\,B1508+55, PSR\,J0437$-$4715, and PSR\,B0031$-$07 as test cases for our technique. We demonstrate that the technique correctly differentiates between the pulsar and other non-scintillating point sources and show that the extracted dynamic spectrum of the pulsar is equivalent to that extracted from the uGMRT phased array beam. We show the results from our analysis of known pulsar fields and discuss challenges in dealing with interference and instrumental effects.</description>

      <title>HAMSTER: Hyperspectral Albedo Maps dataset with high Spatial and TEmporal Resolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Surface albedo is an important parameter in radiative transfer simulations of the Earth's system, as it is fundamental to correctly calculate the energy budget of the planet. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instruments on NASA's Terra and Aqua satellites continuously monitor daily and yearly changes in reflection at the planetary surface. The MODIS Surface Reflectance black-sky albedo dataset (MCD43D, version 6.1) gives detailed albedo maps in seven spectral bands in the visible and near-infrared range. These albedo maps allow us to classify different Lambertian surface types and their seasonal and yearly variability and change, albeit only in seven spectral bands. However, a complete set of albedo maps covering the entire wavelength range is required to simulate radiance spectra, and to correctly retrieve atmospheric and cloud properties from Earth's remote sensing. We use a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) regression algorithm to generate hyperspectral albedo maps of Earth. Combining different datasets of hyperspectral reflectance laboratory measurements for various dry soils, vegetation surfaces, and mixtures of both, we reconstruct the albedo maps in the entire wavelength range from 400 to 2500~nm. The PCA method is trained with a 10-years average of MODIS data for each day of the year. We obtain hyperspectral albedo maps with a spatial resolution of 0.05{\deg} in latitude and longitude, a spectral resolution of 10~nm, and a temporal resolution of 1~day. Using the hyperspectral albedo maps, we estimate the spectral profiles of different land surfaces, such as forests, deserts, cities and icy surfaces, and study their seasonal variability. These albedo maps shall enable to refine calculations of Earth's energy budget, its seasonal variability, and improve climate simulations.</description>

      <title>Next Generation LLRF Control Platform for Compact C-band Linear Accelerator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Low-Level RF (LLRF) control circuits of linear accelerators (LINACs) are conventionally realized with heterodyne based architectures, which have analog RF mixers for up and down conversion with discrete data converters. We have developed a new LLRF platform for C-band linear accelerator based on the Frequency System-on-Chip (RFSoC) device from AMD Xilinx. The integrated data converters in the RFSoC can directly sample the RF signals in C-band and perform the up and down mixing digitally. The programmable logic and processors required for signal processing for the LLRF control system are also included in a single RFSoC chip. With all the essential components integrated in a device, the RFSoC-based LLRF control platform can be implemented more cost-effectively and compactly, which can be applied to a broad range of accelerator applications. In this paper, the structure and configuration of the newly developed LLRF platform will be described. The LLRF prototype has been tested with high power test setup with a Cool Cooper Collider (C\(^3\)) accelerating structure. The LLRF and the solid state amplifier (SSA) loopback setup demonstrated phase jitter in 1 s as low as 115 fs, which is lower than the requirement of C\(^3\). The rf signals from the klystron forward and accelerating structure captured with peak power up to 16.45 MW will be presented and discussed.</description>

      <title>Catalog of Proper Orbits for 1.25 Million Main Belt Asteroids and Discovery of 136 New Collisional Families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The proper elements of asteroids are obtained from the instantaneous orbital elements by removing periodic oscillations produced by gravitational interactions with planets. They are unchanging in time, at least if chaotic dynamics and non-gravitational forces could be ignored, and can therefore be used to identify fragments of major collisions (asteroid families) that happened eons ago. Here we present a new catalog of proper elements for 1.25 million main belt asteroids. We explain the methodology, evaluate uncertainties, and discuss how the new catalog can be used to identify asteroid families. A systematic search for families yielded 153 cases not reported in Nesvorn\'y at al. (2015) -- 17 of these cases were identified in various other publications, 136 cases are new discoveries. There are now 274 families in the asteroid belt in total (plus a handful of families in the resonant Hilda population). We analyzed several compact families in detail. The new family around the middle belt asteroid (9332) 1990SB1 (9 members) is the youngest family found so far (estimated formation only 16-17 kyr ago). New families (1217) Maximiliana, (6084) Bascom, (10164) Akusekijima and (70208) 1999RX33 all formed 0.5-2.5 Myr ago. The (2110) Moore-Sitterly family is a close pair of relatively large bodies, 2110 and 44612, and 15 small members all located sunwards from 2110 and 44612, presumably a consequence of the Yarkovsky drift over the estimated family age (1.2-1.5 Myr). A systematic characterization of the new asteroid families is left for future work.</description>

      <title>Light Curve Classification with DistClassiPy: a new distance-based classifier</title>

Abstract: The rise of synoptic sky surveys has ushered in an era of big data in time-domain astronomy, making data science and machine learning essential tools for studying celestial objects. While tree-based models (e.g. Random Forests) and deep learning models dominate the field, we explore the use of different distance metrics to aid in the classification of astrophysical objects. We developed DistClassiPy, a new distance metric based classifier. The direct use of distance metrics is unexplored in time-domain astronomy, but distance-based methods can help make classification more interpretable and decrease computational costs. In particular, we applied DistClassiPy to classify light curves of variable stars, comparing the distances between objects of different classes. Using 18 distance metrics on a catalog of 6,000 variable stars across 10 classes, we demonstrate classification and dimensionality reduction. Our classifier meets state-of-the-art performance but has lower computational requirements and improved interpretability. Additionally, DistClassiPy can be tailored to specific objects by identifying the most effective distance metric for that classification. To facilitate broader applications within and beyond astronomy, we have made DistClassiPy open-source and available at https://pypi.org/project/distclassipy/.</description>

      <title>Automated scheduler for the SOXS instrument: design and performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17262v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the advancements in the development of the scheduler for the Son Of X-shooter instrument at the ESO-NTT 3.58-m telescope in La Silla, Chile. SOXS is designed as a single-object spectroscopic facility and features a high-efficiency spectrograph with two arms covering the spectral range of 350-2000 nm and a mean resolving power of approximately R=4500. It will conduct UV-visible and near-infrared follow-up observations of astrophysical transients, drawing from a broad pool of targets accessible through the streaming services of wide-field telescopes, both current and future, as well as high-energy satellites. The instrument will cater to various scientific objectives within the astrophysical community, each entailing specific requirements for observation planning. SOXS will operate at the European Southern Observatory (ESO) in La Silla, without the presence of astronomers on the mountain. This poses a unique challenge for the scheduling process, demanding a fully automated algorithm that is autonomously interacting with the appropriate databases and the La Silla Weather API, and is capable of presenting the operator not only with an ordered list of optimal targets (in terms of observing constraints) but also with optimal backups in the event of changing weather conditions. This imposes the necessity for a scheduler with rapid-response capabilities without compromising the optimization process, ensuring the high quality of observations and best use of the time at the telescope. We thus developed a new highly available and scalable architecture, implementing API Restful applications like Docker Containers, API Gateway, and Python-based Flask frameworks. We provide an overview of the current state of the scheduler, which is now ready for the approaching on-site testing during Commissioning phase, along with insights into its web interface and preliminary performance tests.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave constraints on planetary-mass primordial black holes using LIGO O3a data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19468v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves from sub-solar mass inspiraling compact objects would provide almost smoking-gun evidence for primordial black holes (PBHs). We perform the first search for inspiraling planetary-mass compact objects in equal-mass and highly asymmetric mass-ratio binaries using data from the first half of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA third observing run. Though we do not find any significant candidates, we determine the maximum luminosity distance reachable with our search to be of $O(0.1-100)$ kpc, and corresponding model-independent upper limits on the merger rate densities to be $O(10^{3}-10^{-7})$ kpc$^{-3}$yr$^{-1}$ for systems with chirp masses of $O(10^{-4}-10^{-2})M_\odot$, respectively. Furthermore, we interpret these rate densities as arising from PBH binaries and constrain the fraction of dark matter that such objects could comprise. For equal-mass PBH binaries, we find that these objects would compose less than 4-100% of DM for PBH masses of $10^{-2}M_\odot$ to $2\times 10^{-3}M_\odot$, respectively. For asymmetric binaries, assuming one black hole mass corresponds to a peak in the mass function at 2.5$M_\odot$, a PBH dark-matter fraction of 10% and a second, much lighter PBH, we constrain the mass function of the second PBH to be less than 1 for masses between $1.5\times 10^{-5}M_\odot$ and $2\times 10^{-4}M_\odot$. Our constraints, released on Zenodo, are robust enough to be applied to any PBH or exotic compact object binary formation models, and complement existence microlensing results. More details about our search can be found in our companion paper.</description>

      <title>Astronomy in Colombia: a bibliometric perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02255v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In Colombia, astronomical research is experiencing accelerated growth. To better understand its evolution and current state, we conducted a bibliometric study using data from the Astrophysics Data System (ADS) and the Web of Science (WoS). In the ADS, we identified 422 peer-reviewed publications from 1980, the year of the first publication, until 2023, the cut-off year of the study. Of the 25 Colombian institutions participating in at least one publication, 14 are private and 11 are state institutions. More than half of these institutions are concentrated in two main cities: Bogot\'a with 11 institutions, followed by Medell\'in with 3 institutions. The number of contributions from four universities stands out: Universidad de los Andes, Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Universidad Industrial de Santander, and Universidad de Antioquia with 104, 78, 68, and 67 publications, respectively. By cross-referencing the information from the ADS and the WoS, we found that the areas in which publications with the highest impact are found are three: high energies and fundamental physics, stars and stellar physics, and galaxies and cosmology. At the global level, according to the WoS, Colombia ranks 52nd in the number of peer-reviewed publications between 2019 and 2023 and fifth in Latin America. Additionally, we identified three highly cited publications (top 1% worldwide) belonging to the field of observational cosmology.</description>

      <title>Anomaly Detection and Approximate Similarity Searches of Transients in Real-time Data Streams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01235v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present LAISS (Lightcurve Anomaly Identification and Similarity Search), an automated pipeline to detect anomalous astrophysical transients in real-time data streams. We deploy our anomaly detection model on the nightly ZTF Alert Stream via the ANTARES broker, identifying a manageable $\sim$1-5 candidates per night for expert vetting and coordinating follow-up observations. Our method leverages statistical light-curve and contextual host-galaxy features within a random forest classifier, tagging transients of rare classes (spectroscopic anomalies), of uncommon host-galaxy environments (contextual anomalies), and of peculiar or interaction-powered phenomena (behavioral anomalies). Moreover, we demonstrate the power of a low-latency ($\sim$ms) approximate similarity search method to find transient analogs with similar light-curve evolution and host-galaxy environments. We use analogs for data-driven discovery, characterization, (re-)classification, and imputation in retrospective and real-time searches. To date we have identified $\sim$50 previously known and previously missed rare transients from real-time and retrospective searches, including but not limited to: SLSNe, TDEs, SNe IIn, SNe IIb, SNe Ia-CSM, SNe Ia-91bg-like, SNe Ib, SNe Ic, SNe Ic-BL, and M31 novae. Lastly, we report the discovery of 325 total transients, all observed between 2018-2021 and absent from public catalogs ($\sim$1% of all ZTF Astronomical Transient reports to the Transient Name Server through 2021). These methods enable a systematic approach to finding the "needle in the haystack" in large-volume data streams. Because of its integration with the ANTARES broker, LAISS is built to detect exciting transients in Rubin data.</description>
