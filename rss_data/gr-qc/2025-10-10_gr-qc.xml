      <title>Physical Existence of Relativistic Stellar Models within the context of Anisotropic Matter Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two distinct non-singular interior models that describe anisotropic spherical configurations are presented in this work. We develop the Einstein field equations and the associated mass function in accordance with a static spherical spacetime. We then discuss certain requirements that must be satisfied for compact models to be physically validated. Two distinct limitations are taken into account to solve the field equations, including different forms of the radial geometric component and anisotropy, which ultimately leads to a couple of relativistic models. In both cases, solving the differential equations result in the appearance of integration constants. By equating the Schwarzschild exterior metric and spherical interior line element on the interface, these constants are explicitly obtained. The disappearance of the radial pressure on the hypersurface is also used in this context. We further use estimated radii and masses of six different stars to graphically visualize the physical properties of new solutions. Both of our models are deduced to be well-aligned with all physical requirements, indicating the superiority of the presence of anisotropy in compact stellar interiors over the perfect isotropic fluid content.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent paper we discussed when it is possible to define reference frames nonrotating with respect to distant inertial reference objects (extension of the IAU reference systems to exact general relativity), and how to construct them. We briefly review the construction, illustrating it with further examples, and caution against the recent misuse of zero angular momentum observers (ZAMOs).</description>

      <title>Asymptotically flat black holes with a singular Cauchy horizon and a spacelike singularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In our recent work [Van de Moortel, The coexistence of null and spacelike singularities inside spherically symmetric black holes], we analyzed the transition between null and spacelike singularities in spherically symmetric dynamical black holes and demonstrated that the spacelike portion is described by a Kasner metric with positive varying exponents that degenerate to $(1,0,0)$ near the null-spacelike transition. In the present paper, we provide examples of global spacetimes satisfying the assumptions of this previous result and apply its analysis to obtain a large class of asymptotically flat (spherically symmetric) black hole spacetimes that exhibit coexisting null and spacelike singularities. Our main results include:
  _The construction of one-ended asymptotically flat black hole spacetimes solving the Einstein-Maxwell-charged-scalar-field equations. The proof relies on a new spacelike-characteristic gluing method between any uncharged spherically symmetric solution and the event horizon of a charged dynamical black hole.
  _The construction of a large class of two-ended asymptotically flat black hole spacetimes solving the Einstein-Maxwell-(uncharged)-scalar-field equations.
  In both cases, we show that the terminal boundary in the black hole interior only has two distinct components: a weakly singular (null) Cauchy horizon $\mathcal{CH}_{i^+}$ where curvature blows up and a strong singularity $\mathcal{S}=\{r=0\}$.
  Our construction provides the first examples of black holes with coexisting null and spacelike singularities. These examples hold particular significance in the one-ended case as a model of gravitational collapse, where this phenomenon is conjecturally generic for the Einstein-scalar-field model, even beyond spherical symmetry.</description>

      <title>Weakly turbulent saturation of the nonlinear scalar ergoregion instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform time-domain evolutions of the ergoregion instability on a horizonless spinning ultracompact spacetime in scalar theories with potential-type and derivative self-interactions mimicking the nonlinear structure of the Einstein equations. We find that the instability saturates by triggering a weakly turbulent direct cascade, which transfers energy from the most unstable and large-scale modes to small scales. The cascade's nonlinear timescales of each mode are orders of magnitude shorter than the corresponding linear e-folding times. Through this mechanism, the counter-rotating stable light ring is filled with a spectrum of higher-order azimuthal modes forming a ring-like shape. Thereby we demonstrate that turbulent processes are likely also important during the fully gravitational saturation of the instability, leaving imprints in the gravitational wave emission.</description>

      <title>Ergoregion instability in bosonic stars: scalar mode structure, universality, and weakly nonlinear effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultracompact spinning horizonless spacetimes with ergoregions are subject to the ergoregion instability. We systematically investigate the instability of a massless scalar field in a variety of rapidly spinning Proca stars and boson stars using WKB-, frequency-, and time-domain methods. We find universal features in the mode structure: the onset of the instability is signaled by a zero-mode, the mode frequencies and growth rates are related by a simple scaling relation in the small-frequency limit (as found for Kerr-like objects), the mode frequencies approach the orbital frequency of counter-rotating stably trapped null geodesics in the eikonal limit, and for each unstable azimuthal mode only a finite number of overtones and polar modes are exponentially growing. The e-folding times are as short as $\tau\sim 10^4 M$ (in terms of the spacetime's ADM mass $M$). Interestingly, we find a near universal relationship between the frequencies and growth rates across all bosonic stars and also compared with Kerr-like objects. Furthermore, we show that weakly nonlinear backreaction of the instability induces a shift in growth rates as well as emission of gravitational waves; we find evidence that these effects lead to an amplification of the unstable process. This suggests that strongly nonlinear interactions are important during the gravitational saturation of the instability.</description>

      <title>Shadows and amplitude luminosity of an embedded rotating black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a rotating black hole embedded in a five-dimensional flat bulk by extending the Kerr metric through the Gurses-Gursey line element. Employing Boyer-Lindquist coordinates, we reinterpret the black hole as a charged-like object in five dimensions and analyze its horizon structure and shadow morphology. Our results reveal that the shadow is shaped by an axially symmetric gravitational field modulated by an extrinsic curvature term arising from the higher-dimensional embedding. Simulations demonstrate that the visibility amplitude and shadow profile of the Gurses-Gursey black hole align with Event Horizon Telescope observations of M87 in the Kerr limit, while also allowing measurable deviations that could be probed by future high-resolution experiments.</description>

      <title>Mass-to-Horizon Relation and Entropy Beyond the Bekenstein-Hawking Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a generalized mass-horizon relation applicable to cosmological horizons. This formulation provides a unified framework for deriving a broad class of Bekenstein entropy extensions motivated by statistical mechanics, quantum gravity, and phenomenological considerations, through the application of the Clausius relation together with the Hawking temperature. We further introduce this notion as a foundational framework for constructing generalized entropy forms that remain consistent with thermodynamic laws and the holographic principle.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Waves on Kerr Black Holes II: Metric Reconstruction with Cosmological Constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this second paper of our series started with \cite{Berens2024}, we investigate linearized gravitational perturbations of a rotating Kerr black hole in a non-asymptotically flat spacetime with (anti-)de Sitter boundary conditions. Here, we explicitly write down the metric components (in both ingoing and outgoing radiation gauge) of the perturbations that correspond to a given mode of either Weyl scalar. We provide formulas involving Hertz potentials (intermediate quantities with a holographic interpretation) as well as some that involve only the separated radial and angular modes. We expect these analytic results to prove useful in numerical studies of black hole perturbation theory in the context of the holographic correspondence.</description>

      <title>Effects of magnetic fields on spinning test particles orbiting Kerr-Bertotti-Robinson black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the kinematic effects of spinning test particles orbiting the Kerr-Bertotti-Robinson black hole. Employing with the Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon equations, we explore the dynamics of precessing orbits and distinct orbital types, including circular orbits and innermost stable circular orbits. Our results reveal the substantial impact of the magnetic field on the trajectories of spinning particles, particularly in regions characterized by significant radial distances. More importantly, our study shows that an augmented magnetic field necessitates an increased orbital angular momentum to uphold spinning particles within their characteristic orbits at equivalent radial distances. Our result contributes valuable insights to the understanding of the spinning celestial object motion around black holes endowed with magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Newly scalarization of the Einstein-Euler-Heisenberg black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Th spontaneous scalarization of the Einstein-Euler-Heisenberg (EEH) black hole is performed in the EEH-scalar theory by introducing an exponential scalar coupling (with $\alpha$ coupling constant) to the Maxwell term.Here, the EEH black hole as a blad black hole is described by mass $M$ and magnetic charge $q$ with an action parameter $\mu$. A choice of $\mu=0.3$ gurantees a single horizon with unrestricted magnetic charge $q$. The onset scalarization of this black hole appears for a positive coupling $\alpha$ with an unlimited magnetic charge $q$. However, there exists a difference between $q\le1$ and $q&gt;1$ onset scalarizations. We notify the presence of infinite branches labeled by the number of $n=0,1,2,\cdots$ of scalarized charged black holes by taking into account the scalar seeds around the EEH black hole. We find that the $n=0$ fundamental branch of all scalarized black holes is stable against the radial perturbations, while the $n=1$ excited branch is unstable.</description>

      <title>The influence of the mean anomaly on the dynamical quantities of binary black hole mergers in eccentric orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In studies of binary black hole (BBH) mergers in eccentric orbits, the mean anomaly, traditionally regarded as less significant than eccentricity, has been thought to encode only the orbital phase, leading to the assumption that it exerts minimal influence on the dynamics of eccentric mergers. In a previous investigation, we identified consistent oscillations in dynamical quantities peak luminosity $L_{\text{peak}}$, remnant mass $M_{\text{rem}}$, spin $\alpha_{\text{rem}}$, and recoil velocity $V_{\text{rem}}$ in relation to the initial eccentricity $e_0$. These oscillations are associated with integer orbital cycles within a phenomenological framework. In this paper, we aim to explore the underlying physical nature of these oscillations through gravitational waveforms. Our examination of remnant mass and spin reveals that while the initial ADM mass $M_{\mathrm{ADM}}$ and orbital angular momentum $L_0$ exhibit gradual variations with $e_0$, the radiated energy $E_{\text{rad}}$ and angular momentum $L_{\text{rad}}$ display oscillatory patterns akin to those observed in $M_{\text{rem}}$ and $\alpha_{\text{rem}}$. By decomposing the waveforms into three distinct phases inspiral, late inspiral to merger, and ringdown, we demonstrate that these oscillations persist across all phases, suggesting a common origin. Through a comparative analysis of $E_{\text{rad}}$ and $L_{\text{rad}}$ derived from numerical relativity (NR), post-Newtonian (PN) waveforms, and orbital-averaged PN fluxes during the inspiral phase, we identify the initial mean anomaly $l_0$ as the source of the observed oscillations. ...</description>

      <title>Noncommutative Regge-Wheeler potential: some nonperturbative results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the gravitational perturbation theory of black holes in noncommutative spacetimes with noncommutativity of the type $[t\stackrel{\star}{,} r] = i a \alpha A(r)$ and $[\varphi \stackrel{\star}{,} r] = i a \beta A(r)$ for arbitrary $A(r)$, which includes several Moyal-type spaces and also the $\kappa$-Minkowski space. The main result of this paper is an analytical expression for the effective potential of the axial perturbation modes, valid to all orders in the noncommutativity parameter. This is achieved by evaluating the $\star$-products using translations in the radial direction, i.e., Bopp shift. We comment on various regimes, such as Planck-scale black holes, where the noncommutativity length scale is of the same order of magnitude as the black hole horizon.</description>

      <title>Spectrum of pure $R^2$ gravity: full Hamiltonian analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a full Hamiltonian constraint analysis of pure Ricci-scalar-squared ($R^2$) gravity to clarify recent controversies regarding its particle spectrum. While it is well established that the full theory consistently propagates three degrees of freedom, we confirm that its linearised spectrum around Minkowski spacetime is empty. moreover, we show that this is not a feature unique to Minkowski spacetime, but a generic property of all traceless-Ricci spacetimes that have a vanishing Ricci scalar, such as the Schwarzschild and Kerr black hole spacetimes. The mechanism for this phenomenon is a change in the nature of the constraints upon linearisation: ten second-class constraints of the full theory become first-class, while the three momentum constraints degenerate into a single constraint. Furthermore, we show that higher order perturbation theory around these singular backgrounds reveals no degrees of freedom at any order. This is in conflict with the general analysis and points to the fact that such backgrounds are surfaces of strong coupling in field space, where the dynamics of perturbations becomes nonperturbative. We further show via a cosmological phase-space analysis that the evolving universe is able to penetrate through the singular $R=0$ surface.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes, Charge, and Dark Matter: Rethinking Evaporation Limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Limits on the dark matter fraction of small mass primordial black holes from Hawking radiation are predominantly derived from the assumption of a Schwarzschild black hole evaporating. However, astrophysical black holes are usually much more realistically modelled by the rotating Kerr black hole solution. Meanwhile, electromagnetically charged black holes are astrophysically of little importance due to their fast neutralisation in the present universe. Dark matter is not just a possible solution to issues of astrophysics and cosmology, but also to issues of the standard model of particle physics. Extensions of this model thus can lead to charges present in the early universe which remain preserved in the charge of primordial black holes - even when the corresponding particles have disappeared from the particle content of the present epoch of the universe. Here, we report on a thorough proof-of-concept that such charges can greatly change evaporation limits for primordial black hole dark matter. Special emphasis is placed on (near-)extremal black holes, for which this effect is especially pronounced.</description>

      <title>Scalar-tensor theories in the Lyra geometry: Invariance under local transformations of length units and the Jordan-Einstein frame conundrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Lyra geometry provides an interesting approach to develop purely geometrical scalar-tensor theories due to the natural presence of the Lyra scale function. This paper explores further the scale function source term to construct a theory on Lyra manifolds which contains proper generalizations of both Brans-Dicke gravity and the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet scalar-tensor theory. It is shown that the symmetry group of gravitational theories on the Lyra geometry comprises not only coordinate transformations but also local transformations of length units, so that the Lyra function is the conformal factor which locally fixes the unit of length. By performing a Lyra transformation to a frame in which the unit of length is globally fixed, it is shown that General Relativity is obtained from the Lyra Scalar-Tensor Theory (LyST). Through the same procedure, even in the presence of matter fields, it is found that Brans-Dicke gravity and the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet scalar-tensor theory are obtained from their Lyra counterparts. It is argued that this approach is consistent with the Mach-Dicke principle, since the strength of gravity in Brans-Dicke-Lyra is controlled by the scale function. It might be possible that any known scalar-tensor theory can be naturally geometrized by considering a particular Lyra frame, for which the scalar field is the function which locally controls the unit of length. The Jordan-Einstein frame conundrum is also assessed from the perspective of Lyra transformations, it is shown that the Lyra geometry makes explicit that the two frames are only different representations of the same theory, so that in the Einstein frame the unit of length varies locally. The Lyra formalism is then shown to be better suited for exploring scalar-tensor gravity, since in its well-defined structure the conservation of the energy-momentum tensor and geodesic motion are assured in the Einstein frame.</description>

      <title>Effects of dark dipole radiation on eccentric supermassive black hole binary inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The final-parsec problem has long posed a central challenge in understanding the merger of supermassive black hole binaries. In this paper, we investigate a scenario in which a dark scalar or vector field is sourced by eccentric binaries, leading to accelerated mergers through additional dipole radiation, and thereby extending the range of masses for which the binary merges within a Hubble time. The radiation fluxes from an eccentric charged Keplerian binary are derived using general results for localized periodic sources in flat spacetime. We find that dipole radiation, although insufficient to fully resolve the final-parsec problem, can alter the low-frequency spectrum of the stochastic gravitational-wave background from supermassive black hole binary inspirals. We construct a simplified model for the spectrum and perform a Bayesian analysis using the current pulsar timing array data.</description>

      <title>Large-scale peculiar velocities in the universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observations have repeatedly confirmed the presence of large-scale peculiar motions in the universe, commonly referred to as ``bulk flows''. These are vast regions of the observable universe, typically spanning scales of several hundred Mpc, that move coherently with speeds of the order of several hundred km/sec. While there is a general consensus on the direction of these motions, discrepancies persist in their reported sizes and velocities, with some of them exceeding the predictions of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. The observed large-scale peculiar-velocity fields are believed to have originated as weak peculiar-velocity perturbations soon after equipartition, which have subsequently grown by structure formation and by the increasing inhomogeneity of the post-recombination universe. However, the evolution and the implications of these bulk velocity fields remain poorly understood and they are still a matter of debate. For instance, it remains a challenge for the theoreticians to explain the high velocities measured by several bulk-flow surveys, like those recently reported using the CosmicFlows-4 data. Such extensive and fast velocity fields could have played a non-negligible role during structure formation and they might have also ``contaminated'' our observations. After all, in the history of astronomy, there are examples where relative-motion effects have led us to a serious misinterpretation of reality (shortened abstract due to length limits).</description>

      <title>Localized states of BFSS super quantum mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the recently discovered localized and non-uniform phases of the Banks-Fischler-Shenker-Susskind (BFSS) matrix quantum mechanics. Building on [1], we provide first-principles derivations of their properties and extend the results with new analytic and numerical insights. We show that strongly coupled BFSS dynamics emerge from a specific Carrollian transformation of 11-dimensional supergravity, which we justify in detail. In this framework, the uniform BFSS phase corresponds to a black string in a $pp$-wave background. We demonstrate that this background is unstable to a Gregory-Laflamme instability and, for the first time, compute the associated growth rate. The instability gives rise to non-uniform and localized phases that dominate the microcanonical ensemble in certain low-energy regimes, with the localized phase also prevailing in the canonical ensemble at low temperatures. We identify the corresponding first- and second-order phase transitions and derive analytic formulas for the thermodynamics of the localized phase, accurate to better than $0.3\%$ against numerical results.</description>

      <title>Heterotic Footprints in Classical Gravity: PM dynamics from On-Shell soft amplitudes at one loop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study classical scattering of charged black holes in Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton (EMD) theory. Working in the classical (Post-Minkowskian) regime, we extract the conservative two-body potential by expanding the one loop amplitudes in the soft regime. We show explicitly that, as in GR, the relevant soft amplitudes are infrared (IR) finite once the long-range interactions are consistently treated via Lippmann-Schwinger equation and the associated IR subtraction. The scattering angle is then obtained from the eikonal exponentiation of the soft amplitude. Our results track the separate roles of electromagnetic and dilatonic charges in both the conservative dynamics and the eikonal phase, and they reduce smoothly to the GR limit when the charges and dilaton coupling are switched off. Where applicable, we compare with existing results in the literature and find agreement. These findings provide amplitude-based benchmarks for compact-object dynamics in EMD and furnish building blocks for waveform modeling in beyond-GR scenarios.</description>

      <title>On the consistent disformal couplings to fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Disformal couplings to fermions lead to a unique derivative coupling to the axial fermionic current, which contains higher derivatives in general. We derive general conditions on consistent disformal couplings by requiring the absence of higher time derivatives, as they typically lead to ghost degrees of freedom. For a two-scalar field disformal transformation, we show that the consistent disformal coupling must have a degenerate field space metric. This allows us to explore consistent, new two-scalar field modified gravity models. We show that the transformation of the Einstein-Hilbert action leads to two-field Horndeski or two-field DHOST theories. Our formalism also applies to disformal transformations with higher derivatives. We derive the consistent subclasses of disformal transformations that include second derivatives of a scalar field and first derivatives of a vector field that lead to generalized U-DHOST and degenerate beyond generalized Proca theories.</description>

      <title>Apparent Lorentz violation from disformally coupled ultralight dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the impact of general disformal metric transformations on fermions, which shift the gravitational metric by an additional rank-2 tensor. This tensor can in principle be constructed from scalar-field gradients, vector fields, or field-strength contractions. We show this transformation results in the conventional Dirac action being modified by additional kinetic and axial-current couplings that are quadratic in the shifted field. When the field sourcing the metric shift takes on a non-trivial background value, apparent Lorentz-violating effects can result, which we identify as terms in an effective field theory. Assuming the well-motivated cases of scalar and vector ultralight dark matter, we demonstrate that experimental tests of rotation and boost violation imply constraints on the additional kinetic coupling. Even under conservative assumptions, the constraints for vector ultralight dark matter are extremely stringent.</description>

      <title>GPU-Accelerated X-ray Pulse Profile Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pulse-profile modeling (PPM) of thermal X-ray emission from rotation-powered millisecond pulsars enables simultaneous constraints on the mass $M$, radius $R$, and hence the equation of state of cold, dense matter. However, Bayesian PPM has faced a hard accuracy-speed bottleneck: current production resolutions used to keep inference tractable can under-resolve extreme hotspot geometries and bias the waveform computation, whereas the higher resolutions that remove this bias push forward models to minutes per evaluation, making inference impractical. We break this trade-off with, to our knowledge, the first public GPU-accelerated X-ray PPM framework that matches established benchmarks to within $\sim10^{-3}$ relative accuracy even for extreme geometries, while collapsing minutes-long high-fidelity computations to $2$--$5$ ms on an RTX 4080 ($10^{3}$--$10^{4}\times$ speedups), enabling posterior exploration at resolutions and complexities previously out of reach. We further uncover a bias near the interpolation boundaries of atmosphere lookup tables, demonstrate it with two diagnostic tests, and counter it with a mixed-order interpolator. Together, these advances enlarge the feasible hotspot model space and reduce key systematics in PPM, strengthening inferences for current and future X-ray missions.</description>

      <title>The detection of Planck-scale physics facilitated by nonlinear quantum optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A tenet of contemporary physics is that novel physics beyond the Standard Model lurks at a scale related to the Planck length. The development and validation of a unified framework that merges general relativity and quantum physics is contingent upon the observation of Planck-scale physics. Here, we present a fully quantum model for measuring the nonstationary dynamics of a ng-mass mechanical resonator, which will slightly deviate from the predictions of standard quantum mechanics induced by modified commutation relations associated with quantum gravity effects at low-energy scalar. The deformed commutator is quantified by the oscillation frequency deviation, which is amplified by the nonlinear mechanism of the detection field. The measurement resolution is optimized to a precision level that is $15$ orders of magnitude below the electroweak scale.</description>

      <title>Work distribution of quantum fields in static curved spacetimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the formulation of work distributions for quantum scalar fields in static curved spacetimes by extending the Ramsey interferometric protocol originally developed in previous works for flat spacetimes. The use of Unruh-DeWitt particle detectors provides a causally consistent framework to define and measure work statistics, avoiding the limitations of the two-time projective measurement scheme in relativistic quantum field theory. We derive a non-perturbative expression for the characteristic function of the quantum field and apply it to thermal Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (KMS) states, showing that the resulting work distributions satisfy both the Crooks fluctuation theorem and the Jarzynski equality. Furthermore, we analyse the case of a pointlike detector, obtaining compact expressions for the first two moments of the work distribution, allowing us to recover the standard fluctuation-dissipation relation in the high-temperature limit. Our results demonstrate that fluctuation theorems hold for quantum fields interacting with Unruh-DeWitt particle detectors in static curved spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Probing departures from $\Lambda$CDM by late-time datasets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observational data play a pivotal role in identifying cosmological models that are both theoretically consistent and empirically viable. In this work, we investigate whether the standard $\Lambda$CDM model exhibits significant departure with current late time datasets, including Cosmic Chronometers, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations from DESI DR2, and various Type Ia supernova compilations (Pantheon$^+$, DES-SN5Y, Union3). We analyze several dynamical dark energy models, including $\omega$CDM, o$\omega$CDM, $\omega_0\omega_a$CDM, Logarithmic, Exponential, JBP, BA, and GEDE. While CC + DESI DR2 data show mild deviations from $\Lambda$CDM ($\lesssim 2\sigma$), adding supernova samples (DES-SN5Y or Union3) increases deviations, with BA, JBP, and Logarithmic models reaching $3-3.5\sigma$, and CC + DESI DR2 + DES-SN5Y producing the largest deviations. We find consistent evidence for $\omega_0 &gt; -1$ and $\omega_a &lt; 0$ in all dark energy models, indicating that the cosmological constant faces a potential crisis and that dynamical dark energy models could provide a possible solution, characterized by a Quintom-B type scenario. The $\Lambda$CDM model has long served as the cornerstone of modern cosmology, successfully shaping our understanding of the Universe from its earliest epochs to the present day. However, in light of DESI DR2 and other recent measurements, emerging cracks in this paradigm suggest that a complete understanding of the cosmos may require moving beyond the cosmological constant and exploring new physics governing the dark sector.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Waves on Kerr Black Holes I: Reconstruction of Linearized Metric Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20311v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The gravitational perturbations of a rotating Kerr black hole are notoriously complicated, even at the linear level. In 1973, Teukolsky showed that their physical degrees of freedom are encoded in two gauge-invariant Weyl curvature scalars that obey a separable wave equation. Determining these scalars is sufficient for many purposes, such as the computation of energy fluxes. However, some applications -- such as second-order perturbation theory -- require the reconstruction of metric perturbations. In principle, this problem was solved long ago, but in practice, the solution has never been worked out explicitly. Here, we do so by writing down the metric perturbation (in either ingoing or outgoing radiation gauge) that corresponds to a given mode of either Weyl scalar. Our formulas make no reference to the Hertz potential (an intermediate quantity that plays no fundamental role) and involve only the radial and angular Kerr modes, but not their derivatives, which can be altogether eliminated using the Teukolsky--Starobinsky identities. We expect these analytic results to prove useful in numerical studies and for extending black hole perturbation theory beyond the linear regime.</description>

Abstract: We establish a lower bound on the total mass of the time slices of (n + 1)-dimensional asymptotically flat standard static spacetimes under the timelike convergence condition. The inequality can be viewed equivalently as a Minkowski-type inequality in these spaces, i.e. as a lower bound on the total mean curvature of the boundary, and thus extends inequalities from [3], [22], [19], and [10]. Equality is achieved only by slices of Schwarzschild space and is related to the characterization of quasi-spherical static vacuum metrics from [10]. As a notable special case of the main inequality, we obtain the Riemannian Penrose inequality in all dimensions for static spaces under the TCC.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05754v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the performances of a world-wide network made by a European third-generation gravitational-wave (GW) detector, together with a 40km Cosmic Explorer detector in the US, considering three scenarios for the European detector: (1) Einstein Telescope (ET) in its 10km triangle configuration; (2) ET in its configuration featuring two 15km L-shaped detectors in different sites, still taken to have all other ET characteristics (underground, and with each detector made of a high-frequency interferometer and a cryogenic low-frequency interferometer); (3) A single L-shaped underground interferometer with the ET sensitivity curve, either with 15km or with 20km arm length. Overall, we find that, if a configuration with two widely separated L-shaped detectors ("2L") should be retained for ET, the network made by a single-L European underground detector together with CE-40km could already provide a very interesting intermediate step toward the construction of a full 2L+CE network, and is in any case superior to a 10km triangle not inserted in an international network. We also study the performance of a network made by a single L-shaped underground interferometer with the ET sensitivity curve together with a single 40km CE and with LIGO-India (taken at A# sensitivity), and we find that it also has very interesting performances.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate that Cherenkov radiation can be interpreted as ghost instability of a certain type. Solutions of modified gravity theories often contain ghost instabilities. One type of such ghost instability is associated with existence of different types of species with causal cones that do not share common time, which leads to vacuum decay via creation of particles with positive and negative energies. We show that this ghost instability can be seen as Cherenkov radiation and vice versa.</description>

      <title>Modeling matter(s) in SEOBNRv5THM: Generating fast and accurate effective-one-body waveforms for spin-aligned binary neutron stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18934v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present SEOBNRv5THM, an accurate and fast gravitational-waveform model for quasi-circular, spinning, non-precessing binary neutron stars (BNS) within the effective-one-body (EOB) formalism. It builds on the binary-black-hole approximant SEOBNRv5HM and, compared to its predecessor SEOBNRv4T, it i) incorporates recent high-order post-Newtonian results in the inspiral, including higher-order adiabatic tidal contributions, spin-induced multipoles and dynamical tides for spin-aligned neutron stars, ii) includes the gravitational modes $(\ell, |m|)=(2,2),(3,3),(2,1),(4,4),(5,5),(3,2),$ and $(4,3)$, iii) has a time of merger calibrated to BNS numerical-relativity (NR) simulations, iv) accurately models the pre-merger $(2,2)$ mode through a novel phenomenological ansatz, and v) is 100 to 1000 times faster than its predecessor model for BNS systems with total mass $M \geq 2\, M_\odot$. Thus, SEOBNRv5THM can be used in Bayesian parameter estimation, which we perform for two BNS events observed by the LIGO-Virgo Collaboration, GW170817 and GW190425. The model accurately reproduces BAM and SACRA NR waveforms with errors comparable to or lower than the intrinsic NR uncertainty. We validate the model against the other state-of-the-art BNS waveform models NRTidalv3 and TEOBResumS and find differences only for highly spinning and highly tidally deformable BNS, where there is no NR coverage and the models employ different spin prescriptions. Our model serves as a foundation for the development of subsequent SEOBNR waveform models with matter that incorporate further effects, such as spin-precession and eccentricity, to be employed for upcoming observing runs of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration and future facilities on the ground.</description>

      <title>Tidal heating in binary inspiral of strange quark stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07659v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate tidal heating associated with the binary inspiral of strange quark stars and its impact on the resulting gravitational wave signal. Tidal heating during the merger of neutron stars composed of nuclear matter may be considered negligible, but it has been demonstrated recently that the presence of hyperons at high densities could significantly enhance the dissipation during inspiral. In this work, we evaluate the bulk viscosity arising from non-leptonic weak processes involving quarks and show that it can be several orders of magnitude higher than the viscosity of nuclear matter at temperatures relevant to the inspiral phase of the merger of strange stars. We model strange quark matter in the normal phase using a non-ideal bag model including electrons and ensure compatibility with astrophysical constraints. By analysing equal-mass binary systems with component masses ranging from 1.4 to 1.8 $\, M_{\odot}$, we find that temperatures close to 0.1 MeV are reached by the end of the inspiral phase. We also estimate the effect on the gravitational waveform and conclude that the additional phase shift could range from $0.1$ to $0.5$ radians for strange quark masses of 200 MeV, making it potentially detectable by next-generation gravitational wave detectors. Given that tidal heating from hyperons is dominant only for very massive neutron stars having masses 1.8 to 2.0 $\, M_{\odot}$, a successful detection of this phase shift during the inspiral of binary systems with relatively low masses of 1.4 to 1.6 $\, M_{\odot}$ could be a smoking gun signature for the existence of strange quark stars.</description>

Abstract: We describe asymptotic symmetries at spatial infinity of asymptotically flat spacetimes within the context of a generalization of the Beig-Schmidt-Ashtekar-Romano-framework. We demonstrate that it is possible to relax certain smoothness requirements of the asymptotic transformations considered previously, without violating asymptotic flatness. This leads to an enhancement of the asymptotic symmetry group that includes logarithmic supertranslations at spatial infinity. Our results complement several recent results which confirm the existence of logarithmic supertranslations at spatial infinity in the Hamiltonian formalism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07172v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultracold fermionic atoms in an optical lattice, with a sudden position-dependent change (a quench) in the effective dispersion relation, have been proposed by Rodr\'iguez-Laguna et al as an analogue spacetime test of the Unruh effect. We provide new support for this analogue by analysing the entanglement of a scalar field in a (1 + 1)-dimensional continuum spacetime with a similar quench, and the harvesting of this entanglement by a pair of Unruh-DeWitt detectors. We present numerical evidence that the concurrence and mutual information harvested by the detectors are qualitatively similar to those in Rindler spacetime, but they exhibit a small yet noticeable variation when the energy pulse created by the quench crosses the detectors. These findings provide further motivation to implement the experimental proposal of Rodr\'iguez-Laguna et al.</description>

      <title>Superradiant Axionic Black-Hole Clouds as Seeds for Graviton Squeezing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01689v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is shown that both, standard general relativity (GR) and Chern-Simons (CS) gravity, the latter containing chiral gravitational anomaly terms, seed the production of pairs of entangled gravitons in a multi-mode squeezed state. This involves the interaction of gravitons with the axionic cloud surrounding a superradiant Kerr (rotating) black hole background. The order of magnitude of the squeezing effect, specifically the number of graviton excitations in the squeezed vacuum, is estimated in the non-relativistic limit, relevant for the superradiance process. It is found analytically that the squeezing from the GR process of annihilation of two axions into two gravitons, dominates, by many orders of magnitude, that coming from the axion decay into two gravitons, induced by the higher-derivative CS term. It is also shown that significant squeezing effects are produced in the case of long-lived axionic clouds, whose lifetimes are much longer than the timescale for which superradiance is effective. A brief discussion on current exclusion (for the first time) of very-long axion-cloud lifetimes, through comparison of our results with current LIGO data, as well as potential detection of such effects in future interferometers is also given</description>

Abstract: We analyze the thermodynamic properties of the apparent horizon of Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Roberson-Walker (FLRW) spacetimes in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity. We use the generalized definition of entropy for gravity theories in higher dimensions to determine the main thermodynamic variables and to compare their behavior with the corresponding quantities in Einstein's theory, emphasizing the role of the Gauss-Bonnet coupling constant and the dimension number. By imposing the validity of the laws of thermodynamics, we show that the apparent horizon can be interpreted thermodynamically as a dark energy fluid, independently of the coupling constant and the dimension number. Using the response functions, we determine the adiabatic index and the number of thermally accesible degrees of freedom of the apparent horizon and argue that this leads to a discretization of the Gauss-Bonnet coupling constant.</description>

      <title>Extracting energy from plunging region of a Kerr-Taub-NUT black hole by magnetic reconnection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11859v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have studied the energy extraction from a Kerr-Taub-NUT black hole via magnetic reconnection occurring in the plunging region. Our results show that the gravitomagnetic charge suppresses the energy extraction process through magnetic reconnection and reduces the corresponding extraction efficiency, which is opposite to the effects of the black hole spin and the magnetization parameter. Finally, we treat the energy extraction process through magnetic reconnection as a mechanism to revisit the problem of the observed jet power and radiative efficiency of GRS 1915+105. Our results show that the allowed black hole parameter region originating from the jet power has an intersection with the region from the radiative efficiency. This means that with this mechanism related to magnetic reconnection the Kerr-Taub-NUT metric can simultaneously explain the observed jet power and radiative efficiency for GRS 1915+105, which is not explained by other mechanisms in previous studies.</description>

      <title>Toward Low-Latency, High-Fidelity Calibration of the LIGO Detectors with Enhanced Monitoring Tools</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08423v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate and reliable calibration of the Advanced LIGO detectors has enabled a plethora of gravitational-wave discoveries in the detectors' first decade of operation, starting with the ground-breaking discovery, GW150914. In the first decade of operation, the calibrated strain data from Advanced LIGO detectors has become available at a lower latency and with more reliability. In this paper, we discuss the relevant history of Advanced LIGO calibration and introduce new tools that have been developed to enable faster and more robust calibrated strain data products in the fourth observing run (O4). We discuss improvements to the robustness, reliability, and accuracy of the low-latency calibration pipeline as well as the development of a new tool for monitoring the LIGO detector calibration in real time.</description>

Abstract: We perform the first study of the throttling process and heat engine efficiency of asymptotically Anti-de Sitter charged and rotating black strings in the extended phase space. For the throttling process, we calculate the Joule-Thomson coefficient and inversion temperature. We also depict the inversion and isenthalpic curves in the temperature-pressure plane, thereby identifying the corresponding cooling and heating regions. For the black string heat engine, we obtain analytical expressions for the efficiency of the Carnot and rectangular engine cycles and draw their diagrams in terms of some relevant thermodynamics variables.</description>

      <title>Tidal disruption of a neutron star near naked singularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26108v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the tidal disruption of a neutron star (NS) near a black hole (BH), and for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, near a naked singularity (NaS). For a BH with a mass greater than about $10 M_{\odot}$, the tidal disruption of NS should occur within the event horizon, and hence neither can the stellar material escape nor a distant observer observe the disruption. Since NaS does not have an event horizon, a significant portion of the NS's material can escape, and the tidal disruption can be observed by a distant observer. One could identify such an event from the observed emission from the disrupted NS's material and the decay of the light curve of the disruption event. The escape of a significant fraction of the NS's material may also have implications for the heavy elements in the universe. Moreover, observing such an event can be useful for confirming a NaS, probing its spacetime, and studying the motion of matter in such a geometry. This may help constrain the NS parameters and equation of state models. As a first step in this direction, we calculate here the tidal disruption radius and other parameters for a specific type (Joshi-Malafarina-Narayan type 1) of NaS and compare our results with observations.</description>

Abstract: The correspondence of single-field cosmological models based on Einstein gravity to modern observational data is considered. A method is proposed to determine possible types of dynamics based on extreme values of the scalar field. It is shown that within the framework of this approach, it is possible to obtain a limited class of known inflationary models at early times. It is also shown that on large times the proposed approach leads to the $\Lambda$CDM--model in order to describe the dynamics of the second accelerated expansion of the universe. An interpretation of the considered models is presented as a starting point for constructing verifiable cosmological models based on modified gravity theories.</description>

      <title>GW231123: extreme spins or microglitches?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07228v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recently reported binary black hole merger, GW231123, has unusual properties that make it hard to explain astrophysically. Parameter estimation studies are consistent with maximally spinning black holes and the dimensionless spin of the more massive component is constrained to be $\chi_1\gtrsim 0.8$. Analysis of data also revealed potential systematics that could not be fully replicated with simulated studies. We explore the possibility that these measurements are biased due to unmodeled non-Gaussian noise in the detectors, and that the actual black hole spins are more modest. We present evidence for a population of \textit{microglitches} in LIGO gravitational-wave strain data that can lead to biases in the parameter estimation of short-duration signals such as GW231123. Using simulated data of a massive event like GW231123, we demonstrate how microglitches can bias our measurements of black hole spins toward $\chi\approx1$ with negligible posterior support for the true value of $\chi\approx0.7$. We develop a noise model to account for microglitches and show that this model successfully reduces biases in the recovery of signal parameters. We characterize the microglitch population in real interferometer data surrounding GW231123 and find a single detector glitch duty cycle of $0.57_{-0.19}^{+0.21}$, which implies nearly a $100\%$ probability that at least one event through the fourth gravitational wave transient catalog coincides with microglitches in two detectors. We argue that further investigations are required before we can have a confident picture of the astrophysical properties of GW231123.</description>

      <title>Getting More Out of Black Hole Superradiance: a Statistically Rigorous Approach to Ultralight Boson Constraints from Black Hole Spin Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10337v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Black hole (BH) superradiance can provide strong constraints on the properties of ultralight bosons (ULBs). While most of the previous work has focused on the theoretical predictions, here we investigate the most suitable statistical framework to constrain ULB masses and self-interactions using BH spin measurements. We argue that a Bayesian approach based on a simple timescales analysis provides a clear statistical interpretation, deals with limitations regarding the reproducibility of existing BH analyses, incorporates the full information from BH data, and allows us to include additional nuisance parameters or to perform hierarchical modelling with BH populations in the future. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach using mass and spin posterior samples for the X-ray binary BH M33 X-7 and, for the first time in this context, the supermassive BH IRAS 09149-6206. We explain the differences to existing ULB constraints in the literature and illustrate the effects of various assumptions about the superradiance process (equilibrium regime vs cloud collapse, higher occupation levels). As a result, our procedure yields the most statistically rigorous ULB constraints available in the literature, with important implications for the QCD axion and axion-like particles. We encourage all groups analysing BH data to publish likelihood functions or posterior samples as supplementary material to facilitate this type of analysis, and for theory developments to compress their findings to effective timescale modifications.</description>

      <title>Unitarity, Causality, and Solar System Bounds May Significantly Limit the Use of Gravitational Waves to Test General Relativity</title>

Abstract: The prospect of detecting/constraining deviations from general relativity by studying gravitational waves (GWs) from merging black holes has been one of the primary motivations of GW interferometers like LIGO/Virgo. Within pure gravity, the only possible way deviations can arise is from the existence of higher order derivative corrections, namely higher powers of the Riemann curvature tensor, in the effective action. Any observational bounds imply constraints on the corresponding Wilson coefficients. At the level of the action, one can imagine the coefficients are sufficiently large so as to be in principle detectable. However, from the point of view of some fundamental principles, namely causality and unitarity, this is much less clear, as we examine here. We begin by reviewing certain known bounds on these coefficients, which together imply a low cut off on the effective theory. We then consider a possible mechanism to generate such terms, namely in the form of many scalars, minimally coupled to only gravity, that can be integrated out to give these higher order operators. We show that a by product of this is the generation of quantum corrections to Newton's potential, whose observable consequences are already ruled out by solar system tests. We point out that over 7 orders of magnitude of improvement in interferometer sensitivity would be required to avoid such solar system constraints. We also mention further constraints from Hawking radiation from black holes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08690v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Formulating a quantum theory of gravity lies at the heart of fundamental theoretical physics. This collection of lecture notes encompasses a selection of topics that were covered in six mini-courses at the Nordita PhD school "Towards Quantum Gravity". The scope was to provide a coherent picture, from its foundation to forefront research, emphasizing connections between different areas. The lectures begin with perturbative quantum gravity and effective field theory. Subsequently, two ultraviolet-complete approaches are presented: asymptotically safe gravity and string theory. Finally, elements of quantum effects in black hole spacetimes are discussed.</description>

Abstract: To deepen our understanding of Quantum Gravity and its connections with black holes and cosmology, building a common language and exchanging ideas across different approaches is crucial. The Nordita Program "Quantum Gravity: from gravitational effective field theories to ultraviolet complete approaches" created a platform for extensive discussions, aimed at pinpointing both common grounds and sources of disagreements, with the hope of generating ideas and driving progress in the field. This contribution summarizes the twelve topical discussions held during the program and collects individual thoughts of speakers and panelists on the future of the field in light of these discussions.</description>

      <title>Auto- and cross-correlations for multiple images of corotating hotspots in accretion disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22343v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to the short gravitational timescale of Sgr A*, variable emissions near the galactic center are expected in the Very-long-baseline interferometry observations. Phenomenologically, the high-flux variable emissions could be interpreted as occasional events from hotspots within accretion disks. It provides a probe of black hole (BH) geometry and accretion matter in the strong-field regime of gravity. In this study, we find that light curve profile alone is not proper for distinguishing BH geometries, as our results show that the profiles, even including those from higher-order images, are dependent on hotspot shapes, which are known in practice as amorphous. To alleviate this situation, we examine the spatial-temporal correlations between multiple images of the corotating hotspots. Our results find that the correlations, particularly those from higher-order images, could serve as a robust observable to reflect the inclination angles and BH geometries, because i) the correlated band structure is independent of the hotspot shapes, and ii) the correlations from higher-order images could encode BH geometries and exhibit no overlap with observational signatures from the lower-order ones. We present a comprehensive study on correlations from primary the eighth-order images with various orbital configurations and inclination angles, and show its observational signatures. It is expected that BH geometries can be inferred via the spatial-temporal correlation analysis.</description>

      <title>Ryu-Takayanagi Formula for Multi-Boundary Black Holes from 2D Large-$c$ CFT Ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12388v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a class of quantum states involving multiple entangled CFTs in AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$, associated with multi-boundary black hole geometries, and demonstrate that the Ryu-Takayanagi (RT) formula for entanglement entropy can be derived using only boundary CFT data. Approximating the OPE coefficients by their Gaussian moments within the 2D large-$c$ CFT ensemble, we show that both the norm of the states and the entanglement entropies associated with various bipartitions--reproducing the expected bulk dual results--can be computed purely from the CFT. All $\textit{macroscopic geometric}$ structures arising from gravitational saddles emerge entirely from the universal statistical moments of the $\textit{microscopic algebraic}$ CFT data, revealing a statistical-mechanical mechanism underlying semiclassical gravity. We establish a precise correspondence between the CFT norm, the Liouville partition function with ZZ boundary conditions, and the exact gravitational path integral over 3D multi-boundary black hole geometries. For entanglement entropy, each RT phase arises from a distinct leading-order Gaussian contraction, with phase transitions--analogous to replica wormholes--emerging naturally from varying dominant statistical patterns in the CFT ensemble. Our derivation elucidates how the general mechanism behind holographic entropy, namely a boundary replica direction that elongates and becomes contractible in the bulk dual, is encoded explicitly in the statistical structure of the CFT data.</description>

      <title>Modeling Tidal Disruptions with Dynamical Tides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16025v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tidal disruption events (TDEs) occur when stars pass close enough to supermassive black holes to be torn apart by tidal forces. Traditionally, these events are studied with computationally intensive hydrodynamical simulations. In this paper, we present a fast, physically motivated two-stage model for TDEs. In the first stage, we model the star's tidal deformation using linear stellar perturbation theory, treating the star as a collection of driven harmonic oscillators. When the tidal energy exceeds a fraction $\gamma$ of the star's gravitational binding energy (with $\gamma \sim \mathcal O(1)$), we transition to the second stage, where we model the disrupted material as free particles. The parameter $\gamma$ is determined with a one-time calibration to the critical impact parameter obtained in hydrodynamical simulations. This method enables fast computation of the energy distribution ${\rm d} M/{\rm d}E$ and fallback rate ${\rm d} M/{\rm d} T$, while offering physical insight into the disruption process. We apply our model to MESA-generated profiles of middle-age main-sequence stars. Our code is available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>The construction and use of dephasing prescriptions for environmental effects in gravitational wave astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09513v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the first part of this work, we provide a curated overview of the theoretical framework necessary for incorporating dephasing due to environmental effects (EE) in gravitational wave (GW) templates. We focus in particular on the relationship between orbital perturbations in the time-domain and the resulting dephasing in both time and frequency domain, elucidating and resolving some inconsistencies present in the literature. We discuss how commonly studied binary environments often result in several sources of dephasing that affect the GW signal at the same time. This work synthesizes insights from two decades of literature, offering a unified conceptual narrative alongside a curated reference of key formulas, illustrative examples and methodological prescriptions. It can serve both as a reference for researchers in the field as well as a modern introduction for those who wish to enter it. In the second part, we derive novel aspects of dephasing for eccentric GW sources and lay the foundations for consistently treating the full problem. Importantly, we demonstrate that the detectability of EEs can be significantly enhanced in the presence of eccentricity, even for $e_\mathrm{10Hz}\lesssim0.2$, substantially increasing the prospects for detection in ground based detectors. Our results highlight the unique potential of modeling and searching for EE in eccentric binary sources of GWs.</description>

      <title>The Effect of Large Optical Depths on the Non-Gaussian 21-cm signal from Cosmic Dawn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23011v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: During the Cosmic Dawn (CD), the HI 21-cm optical depth ($\tau$ ) in the intergalactic medium can become significantly large. Consequently, the second and higher-order terms of $\tau$ appearing in the Taylor expansion of the HI 21-cm differential brightness temperature ($\delta T_{\rm b}$ ) become important. This introduces additional non-Gaussianity into the signal. We study the impact of large $\tau$ on statistical quantities of HI 21-cm signal using a suite of standard numerical simulations that vary X-ray heating efficiency and the minimum halo mass required to host radiation sources. We find that the higher order terms suppress statistical quantities such as skewness, power-spectrum and bispectrum. However, the effect is found to be particularly strong on the non-Gaussian signal. We find that the change in skewness can reach several hundred percent in low X-ray heating scenarios, whereas for moderate and high X-ray heating models changes are around $\sim40\%$ and $60\%$, respectively, for $M_{\rm h,min}=10^{9}\, {\rm M}_{\odot}$. This change is around $\sim 75\%$, $25\%$ and $20\%$ for low, moderate and high X-ray heating models, respectively, for $M_{\rm h,min}=10^{10}\, {\rm M}_{\odot}$. The change in bispectrum in both the halo cutoff mass scenarios ranges from $\sim 10\%$ to $\sim 300\%$ for low X-ray heating model. However, for moderate and high X-ray heating models the change remains between $\sim 10\%$ to $\sim 200\%$ for both equilateral and squeezed limit triangle configuration. Finally, we find that up to third orders of $\tau$ need to be retained to accurately model $\delta T_{\rm b}$, especially for capturing the non-Gaussian features in the HI 21-cm signal.</description>

      <title>Ultra High Energy Neutrino Event KM3-230213A as a Signal of Electroweak Vacuum Turbulence in Merging Black Hole Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23387v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent detection of the ultra-high-energy neutrino event KM3-230213A ($\sim$220 PeV) by KM3NeT telescope poses a challenge to conventional astrophysical models, particularly in light of the absence of similar $\gtrsim$100 PeV events in IceCube data, despite its larger exposure. We propose a novel mechanism in which binary black hole mergers act as transient neutrino sources via gravitationally induced electroweak vacuum instability. In this scenario, the extreme spacetime curvature near the horizons during the final inspiral phase destabilizes the Higgs vacuum, triggering nucleation of true-vacuum bubbles. Collisions between these bubbles produce microscopic black holes that rapidly evaporate via Hawking radiation, emitting intense, short-lived bursts of neutrinos with energies exceeding 100 PeV. The resulting neutrino fluence follows a heavy-tailed distribution, allowing rare but highly luminous sources to account for events like KM3-230213A while remaining consistent with IceCube's non-detections. This framework links gravitational wave sources to ultra-high-energy neutrino production and suggests that future multi-messenger observations may detect electromagnetic signatures from microscopic black hole evaporation.</description>

      <title>Inferring the neutron star equation of state with nuclear-physics informed semiparametric models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03232v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over the past decade, an abundance of information from neutron-star observations, nuclear experiments and theory has transformed our efforts to elucidate the properties of dense matter. However, at high densities relevant to the cores of neutron stars, substantial uncertainty about the dense matter equation of state (EoS) remains. In this work, we present a semiparametric EoS framework aimed at better integrating knowledge across these domains in astrophysical inference. We use a Meta-model at low densities, and Gaussian Process extensions at high densities. Comparisons between our semiparametric framework to fully nonparametric EoS representations show that imposing nuclear theoretical and experimental constraints through the Meta-model up to nuclear saturation density results in constraints on the pressure up to twice nuclear saturation density. We show that our Gaussian Process trained on EoS models with nucleonic, hyperonic, and quark compositions extends the range of EoS explored at high density compared to a piecewise polytropic extension schema, under the requirements of causality of matter and of supporting the existence of heavy pulsars. We find that maximum TOV masses above $3.2 M_{\odot}$ can be supported by causal EoS compatible with nuclear constraints at low densities. We then combine information from existing observations of heavy pulsar masses, gravitational waves from binary neutron star mergers, and X-ray pulse profile modeling of millisecond pulsars within a Bayesian inference scheme using our semiparametric EoS prior. With current astrophysical observations, we find a favored pressure at two times nuclear saturation density of $P(2\rho_{\rm nuc}) = 1.98^{+2.13}_{-1.08}\times10^{34}$ dyn/cm$^{2}$, a radius of a $1.4 M_{\odot}$ neutron star value of $R_{1.4} = 11.4^{+0.98}_{-0.60}$\;km, and $M_{\rm max} = 2.31_{-0.23}^{+0.35} M_{\odot}$ at the 90\% credible level.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02785v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study tidal Love numbers of static black holes in four-dimensional quadratic theory of gravity, extending the result of GR. We use worldline effective field theory (WEFT) methods to compute metric perturbations from one-point functions, treating the higher-derivative terms perturbatively. We show that insertions of scalar fields on the worldline induce non-zero tidal tails, and the corresponding Love number displays no RG running. The same conclusion holds for the insertions of tensor fields. Furthermore, for scalar dipole perturbations, we derive a Yukawa-deformed Frobenius solution and match the asymptotic behavior to fix the UV charge, finding agreement with EFT predictions of Wilson coefficients. Our work demonstrates that quadratic higher-curvature corrections induce non-zero but scale-independent tidal responses, offering a robust EFT framework to test deviations from GR in gravitational wave observations.</description>

      <title>Harvesting Contextuality from the Vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11773v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum contextuality is the notion that certain measurement scenarios do not admit a global description of their statistics and has been implicated as the source of quantum advantage in a number of quantum information protocols. It has been shown that contextuality generalizes the concepts of non-local entanglement and magic, and is an equivalent notion of non-classicality to Wigner negativity. In this paper, the protocol of contextuality harvesting is introduced and it is shown that Unruh-DeWitt models are capable of harvesting quantum contextuality from the vacuum of a massless scalar quantum field. In particular, it is shown that gapless systems can be made to harvest contextuality given a suitable choice of measurements. The harvested contextuality is also seen to behave similarly to harvested magic and can be larger in magnitude for specific parameter regimes. An Unruh-DeWitt qubit-qutrit system is also investigated, where it is shown that certain tradeoffs exist between the harvested contextuality of the qutrit and the harvested entanglement between the systems, and that there are harvesting regimes where the two resources can both be present. Some of the tools of contextuality, namely the contextual fraction, are also imported and used as general harvesting measures for any form of contextuality, including non-local entanglement and magic. Additionally, new criteria for genuine harvesting are put forward that also apply to individual systems, revealing new permissible harvesting parameter regimes.</description>

      <title>Template-Free Gravitational Wave Detection with CWT-LSTM Autoencoders: A Case Study of Run-Dependent Calibration Effects in LIGO Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10505v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational wave detection requires sophisticated signal processing to identify weak astrophysical signals buried in instrumental noise. Traditional matched filtering approaches face computational challenges with diverse signal morphologies and non-stationary noise. This work presents an unsupervised deep learning methodology integrating Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) preprocessing with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) autoencoder architecture for template-free gravitational wave detection. We train and evaluate our model on LIGO H1 data from Observing Run 4 (O4, 2023-2024), comprising 126 confirmed gravitational wave events from the GWTC-4.0 catalog and 1991 noise segments. During development, we discovered that reconstruction errors from multi-run training (O1-O4) clustered by observing run rather than astrophysical parameters, revealing systematic batch effects from GWOSC's evolving calibration procedures. Following LIGO's established practice of per-run optimization, we adopted single-run (O4) training, which eliminated these batch effects and improved recall from 52% to 96% while maintaining 97% precision. The final model achieves 97.0% precision, 96.1% recall, F1-score 96.6%, and ROC-AUC 0.994 on 102 test signals and 399 noise segments. The reconstruction error distribution shows clean separation between noise (mean 0.48) and signals (mean 0.77). This unsupervised, template-free approach demonstrates that anomaly detection can achieve performance competitive with supervised methods while enabling discovery of signals with unexpected morphologies. Our identification and resolution of cross-run batch effects provides methodological guidance for future machine learning applications to multi-epoch gravitational wave datasets.</description>

      <title>Comparing Minimal and Non-Minimal Quintessence Models to 2025 DESI Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13302v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we examine the 2025 DESI analysis of dark energy, which suggests that dark energy is evolving in time with an increasing equation of state $w$. We explore a wide range of quintessence models, described by a potential function $V(\varphi)$, including: quadratic potentials, quartic hilltops, double wells, cosine functions, Gaussians, inverse powers. We find that while some provide improvement in fitting to the data, compared to a cosmological constant, the improvement is only modest. We then consider non-minimally coupled scalars which can help fit the data by providing an effective equation of state that temporarily obeys $w&lt;-1$ and then relaxes to $w&gt;-1$. Since the scalar is very light, this leads to a fifth force and to time evolution in the effective gravitational strength, which are both tightly constrained by tests of gravity. For a very narrow range of carefully selected non-minimal couplings we are able to evade these bounds, but not for generic values.</description>

      <title>Charged Black-Hole Binary Evolution at Second Post-Newtonian Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20432v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of electrically charged black-hole binaries and their gravitational-wave emission during the inspiral phase. Within the post-Newtonian framework, we derive the conservative and dissipative dynamics up to second order (2PN), combining Effective Field Theory and classical methods. We compute the NNLO conservative Lagrangian, LO dissipative effects in harmonic and Lorenz gauges, and provide the equations of motion, center-of-mass transformations, and the Lagrangian/Hamiltonian in ADM-type coordinates. We also obtain gauge-invariant expressions for the binding energy, periastron advance in quasi-circular orbits, and the scattering angle in unbound orbits. Our results extend previous analyses and are fully consistent with recent post-Minkowskian findings.</description>

      <title>Holographic CFT phase transitions and criticality for charged Gauss-Bonnet AdS black holes in the ensemble at fixed $(C, \mathcal{V}, \tilde{Q}, \tilde{\mathcal{A}})$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05423v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the holographic dual of the extended thermodynamics of spherically symmetric, charged Gauss-Bonnet AdS black holes in the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence. The gravitational thermodynamics of Gauss-Bonnet AdS black holes can be extended by allowing for variations of the cosmological constant and Newton's constant. In the dual CFT this corresponds to including the central charge C and its chemical potential $\mu$ as a new pair of conjugate thermodynamic variables. In addition, compared to Einstein's theory of gravity, Gauss-Bonnet gravity introduces higher-order curvature terms. The coupling constants of these higher-order curvature terms $\alpha$ can serve as new thermodynamic quantities, which will also be dual to thermodynamic quantities on the boundary CFT, a feature not present in the CFT dual to Einstein's gravity previously. Based on the holographic dictionary, we consider the critical behavior and phase transition phenomena of the CFT description of the charged Gauss-Bonnet black holes in $d=4$ and $d=5$ in the ensemble at fixed $(C, \mathcal{V}, \tilde{Q}, \tilde{\mathcal{A}})$. We find that the conventional description of free energy cannot adequately describe the phase transitions and critical behavior of the CFT in this ensemble. This may stem from the fact that the constraints we have adopted are different from the conventional ones.</description>
