      <title>A Lightweight, Interpretable Deep Learning System for Automated Detection of Cervical Adenocarcinoma In Situ (AIS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cervical adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) is a critical premalignant lesion whose accurate histopathological diagnosis is challenging. Early detection is essential to prevent progression to invasive cervical adenocarcinoma. In this study, we developed a deep learning-based virtual pathology assistant capable of distinguishing AIS from normal cervical gland histology using the CAISHI dataset, which contains 2240 expert-labeled H&amp;E images (1010 normal and 1230 AIS). All images underwent Macenko stain normalization and patch-based preprocessing to enhance morphological feature representation. An EfficientNet-B3 convolutional neural network was trained using class-balanced sampling and focal loss to address dataset imbalance and emphasize difficult examples. The final model achieved an overall accuracy of 0.7323, with an F1-score of 0.75 for the Abnormal class and 0.71 for the Normal class. Grad-CAM heatmaps demonstrated biologically interpretable activation patterns, highlighting nuclear atypia and glandular crowding consistent with AIS morphology. The trained model was deployed in a Gradio-based virtual diagnostic assistant. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of lightweight, interpretable AI systems for cervical gland pathology, with potential applications in screening workflows, education, and low-resource settings.</description>

      <title>A phenotype-structured mathematical model for the influence of hypoxia on oncolytic virotherapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02413v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The effectiveness of oncolytic virotherapy is significantly affected by several elements of the tumour microenvironment, which reduce the ability of the virus to infect cancer cells. In this work, we focus on the influence of hypoxia on this therapy and develop a novel continuous mathematical model that considers both the spatial and epigenetic heterogeneity of the tumour. We investigate how oxygen gradients within tumours affect the spatial distribution and replication of both the tumour and oncolytic viruses, focusing on regions of severe hypoxia versus normoxic areas. Additionally, we analyse the evolutionary dynamics of tumour cells under hypoxic conditions and their influence on susceptibility to viral infection. Our findings show that the reduced metabolic activity of hypoxic cells may significantly impact the virotherapy effectiveness; the knowledge of the tumour's oxygenation could, therefore, suggest the most suitable type of virus to optimise the outcome. The combination of numerical simulations and theoretical results for the model equilibrium values allows us to elucidate the complex interplay between viruses, tumour evolution and oxygen dynamics, ultimately contributing to developing more effective and personalised cancer treatments.</description>
