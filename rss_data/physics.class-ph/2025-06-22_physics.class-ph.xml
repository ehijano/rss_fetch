      <title>On the transpositional relation for nonholonomic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the dynamics of nonholonomic mechanical systems, with a particular focus on the fundamental variational assumptions and the role of the transpositional rule. We analyze how the $\check Cetaev condition and the first variation of constraints define compatible virtual displacements for systems subject to kinematic constraints, which can be both linear and nonlinear in generalized velocities. The study meticulously explores the necessary conditions for the commutation relations to hold, clarifying their impact on the consistency of the derived equations of motion. By detailing the interplay between these variational identities and the Lagrangian derivatives of the constraint functions, we shed light on the differences between equations of motion formulated via d'Alembert--Lagrange principle and those obtained from extended time-integral variational principles. This work aims to provide a clearer theoretical framework for understanding and applying these core principles in the complex domain of nonholonomic dynamics.</description>

      <title>On the action for a charged particle moving in a magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Application of the Bohr-Wilson-Sommerfeld quantization condition to a charged particle in a uniform magnetic field requires knowledge of the canonical momentum of such a particle, which in turn requires students to know about the vector potential. The canonical momentum in this situation is conventionally obtained by introducing an appropriate additional term involving the corresponding vector potential in the Lagrangian. In this work, we take a different approach to this problem by analyzing it with Maupertuis principle of least action. We show that satisfying this principle for a charged particle moving in a uniform magnetic field requires that a term proportional to the flux passing through the area enclosed by the trajectory of the particle be included in its action. This additional term accomplishes two tasks. First, it facilitates applying the Bohr-Wilson-Sommerfeld quantum condition for a charged particle moving in a uniform magnetic field without using the Lagrangian approach, and, secondly, it gives the appropriate canonical momentum and Lagrangian for a charged particle in a general electromagnetic field in a straightforward manner.</description>

      <title>Geometric sensitivity of modal parameters in wind instrument models: a case study on Saxophone intonation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Transfer Matrix Method is a practical approach for modeling plane wave propagation in one-dimensional waveguides. Its simplicity makes it especially attractive for accounting for viscothermal losses, enabling realistic simulations of complex waveguides such as wind instruments. Another strength of this method lies in its fully analytical formulation of wave propagation. Modal parameters naturally arise as by-products of the model, obtained by numerically solving analytical expressions. In this work, the analytical potential of the method is extended by deriving the sensitivity of modal parameters to changes in the geometry of the resonator. These analytical gradients are applied in the context of wind instrument design. A simplified model of a soprano saxophone is used to investigate how octave harmonicity can be optimized through small geometric adjustments. The proposed approach enables predictive adjustments of geometry and offers valuable insight for both sound synthesis and instrument making.</description>

      <title>Full-scatter vector field analysis of an overmoded and periodically-loaded cylindrical structure for the transportation of THz radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09030v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The full-scatter vector field analysis of a highly overmoded and periodically loaded cylindrical wavguiding structure (or "iris line") is presented. This type of structure is promising for the transportation of diffraction-prone short THz radiation pulses over hundreds of meters. The analysis uses vector fields, superseding scalar field descriptions, to account for diffraction loss as well as polarization effects and ohmic loss on practical conductive screens. Its results are quite general, as it only assumes a paraxial incidence with a slowly-varying envelope (i.e. a parabolic wave equation) along the axis of the structure. It removes the traditional assumption of very thin screens, allowing for the study of thicker screens in the high-frequency limit, while hosting hundreds of modes and formulating the problem efficiently by scattering matrices whose coefficients are found analytically. The theory expands previously established methods, including Vainstein's asymptotic limit and the forward-scatter approximation, and validates them (as they become special cases with respect to it). It also facilitates accurate visualization of the transient regime at the entrance of the structure and how it evolves to reach steady state.</description>
