      <title>Symmetric Monoidal Bicategories and Biextensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study monoidal 2-categories and bicategories in terms of categorical extensions and the cohomological data they determine in appropriate cohomology theories with coefficients in Picard groupoids. In particular, we analyze the hierarchy of possible commutativity conditions in terms of progressive stabilization of these data. We also show that monoidal structures on bicategories give rise to biextensions of a pair of (abelian) groups by a Picard groupoid, and that the progressive vanishing of obstructions determined by the tower of commutative structures corresponds to appropriate symmetry conditions on these biextensions. In the fully symmetric case, which leads us fully into the stable range, we show how our computations can be expressed in terms of the cubical Q-construction underlying MacLane (co)homology.</description>

      <title>On the Gottlieb group, Drinfeld centre and the centre of a crossed module</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.00981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.00981v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This new version includes a connection of the main construction to the Gottlieb group, which was absent in the previous versions. However, the first version included material about Lie algebras which will become available soon as a separate paper.
  The aim of this paper is to introduce the concept of the centre of a crossed module \(\G_* = (\G_1\to \G_0)\). This centre is closely related to the Gottlieb group of the classifying space of a crossed module and also to the Drinfeld centre of a monoidal category introduced independently by Drinfeld and Joyal and Street. Our definition of the centre is based on certain crossed homomorphisms $\G_0\to \G_1$, which makes it easy to relate it to group cohomology. This connection is used to relate the Gottlieb group of a 2-type to its Whitehead centre.</description>

      <title>The three graces in the Tits--Kantor--Koecher category</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.20635v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A metaphor of Loday describes Lie, associative, and commutative associative algebras as ``the three graces'' of the operad theory. In this article, we study the three graces in the category of $\mathfrak{sl}_2$-modules that are sums of copies of the trivial and the adjoint representation. That category is not symmetric monoidal, and so one cannot apply the wealth of results available for algebras over operads. Motivated by a recent conjecture of the second author and Mathieu, we embark on the exploration of the extent to which that category ``pretends'' to be symmetric monoidal. To that end, we examine various homological properties of free associative algebras and free associative commutative algebras, and study the Lie subalgebra generated by the generators of the free associative algebra.</description>

      <title>Moduli spaces of semiorthogonal decompositions in families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.03303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2002.03303v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a smooth projective family of schemes we prove that a semiorthogonal decomposition of the bounded derived category of coherent sheaves of a fibre uniquely deforms over an \'etale neighbourhood of the point. We do this using a comparison theorem between semiorthogonal decompositions and decomposition triangles of the structure sheaf of the diagonal. We then apply to the latter a deformation theory for morphisms with a fixed lift of the target, which is developed in the appendix.
  Using this as a key ingredient we introduce a moduli space which classifies semiorthogonal decompositions of the category of perfect complexes of a smooth projective family. Using Artin's criterion, we show that this is an \'etale algebraic space over the base scheme of the family, which can be non-quasicompact and non-separated.
  We generalise this to families of geometric noncommutative schemes in the sense of Orlov. We also define a subfunctor classifying nontrivial semiorthogonal decompositions only, and conjecture it is an open and closed subspace.</description>

      <title>C*-framework for higher-order bulk-boundary correspondences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04226v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A typical crystal is a finite piece of a material which may be invariant under some point symmetry group. If it is a so-called intrinsic higher-order topological insulator or superconductor, then it displays boundary modes at hinges or corners protected by the crystalline symmetry and the bulk topology. We explain the mechanism behind such phenomena using operator K-theory. Specifically, we derive a groupoid C*-algebra that 1) encodes the dynamics of the electrons in the infinite size limit of a crystal; 2) remembers the boundary conditions at the crystal's boundaries, and 3) admits a natural action by the point symmetries of the atomic lattice. The filtrations of the groupoid's unit space by closed subsets that are invariant under the groupoid and point group actions supply equivariant cofiltrations of the groupoid C*-algebra. We show that specific derivations of the induced spectral sequences in twisted equivariant K-theories enumerate all non-trivial higher-order bulk-boundary correspondences.</description>

      <title>Spectral Floer theory and tangential structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03257v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In \cite{PS}, for a stably framed Liouville manifold $X$ we defined a Donaldson-Fukaya category $\mathcal{F}(X;\mathbb{S})$ over the sphere spectrum, and developed an obstruction theory for lifting quasi-isomorphisms from $\mathcal{F}(X;\mathbb{Z})$ to $\mathcal{F}(X;\mathbb{S})$. Here, we define a spectral Donaldson-Fukaya category for any `graded tangential pair' $\Theta \to \Phi$ of spaces living over $BO \to BU$, whose objects are Lagrangians $L\to X$ for which the classifying maps of their tangent bundles lift to $\Theta \to \Phi$. The previous case corresponded to $\Theta = \Phi = \{\mathrm{pt}\}$. We extend our obstruction theory to this setting. The flexibility to `tune' the choice of $\Theta$ and $\Phi$ increases the range of cases in which one can kill the obstructions, with applications to bordism classes of Lagrangian embeddings in the corresponding bordism theory $\Omega^{(\Theta,\Phi),\circ}_*$. We include a self-contained discussion of when (exact) spectral Floer theory over a ring spectrum $R$ should exist, which may be of independent interest.</description>
