      <title>Comprehensive investigation of HYPERSCINT RP-FLASH scintillator for electron FLASH research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate, dose-rate-independent, fast-response dosimeters that capture the spatiotemporal characteristics of ultra-high dose rate irradiation (&gt;40Gy/s, UHDR) beams are urgently needed to facilitate FLASH research and support the clinical translation of FLASH radiotherapy. This study evaluated the performance of HYPERSCINT RP-FLASH scintillator in UHDR electron beam dosimetry, with sampling frequency(fs) up to 1 kHz. Four-component calibration and 18MeV conventional dose rate irradiation(CONV, ~0.1Gy/s) were used to calibrate the spectral characteristics of the scintillator and its signal-to-dose conversion. Dosimetric accuracy for CONV and UHDR electron beams was quantified against ion chamber or EBT-XD film measurements. The effects of beam energy, field size, dose per pulse(DPP), pulse repetition frequency(PRF), and accumulated dose on the scintillator's response were investigated. Time-resolved dose measurements were verified using a PMT-fiber optic detector, which measures the relative output of electron pulses by scattered radiation. The scintillator system achieved &lt;0.5% accuracy compared to ion chamber measurements under 0.1-35Gy CONV irradiation at 1Hz and &lt;3% accuracy against EBT-XD film in UHDR conditions up to 40Gy at 1 kHz. There was minimal energy dependence between 6 and 18MeV, field size dependence for 2x1-25x25cm2, DPP dependence for 1-2.3Gy, and PRF dependence for 30-180Hz. The scintillator exhibited -2.6%/kGy signal degradation for 0-2kGy, indicating radiation damage. The time-resolved dose results at 1kHz were verified within 3% accuracy compared to the PMT-fiber optic detector. With proper calibration, the scintillator system can serve as an accurate, dose-rate-independent, fast-response, millisecond-resolved UHDR electron beam dosimeter, with minimal dependence on dose, dose rate, energy, field size, DPP, and PRF within ranges common to UHDR electron beams.</description>

      <title>Dosimetric impact of real-time re-optimization of proton pencil-beam scanning for moving targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When treating moving tumors, the precise delivery of proton therapy by pencil beam scanning (PBS) is challenged by the interplay effect. Although several 4D-optimization methods have been proposed, what is the most beneficial motion management technique is still an open question. In this study, we wish to investigate the dosimetric impact of re-optimizing the PBS spot weights during the treatment delivery in response to, and in anticipation of, variations in the patient's breathing pattern. We simulate for PBS the implementation of a real-time adaptive framework based on principles from receding horizon control. We consider the patient motion as characterized by a one-dimensional amplitude signal and a 4DCT, to simulate breathing of variable frequency. The framework tracks the signal and predicts the future motion with uncertainty increasing with the length of the prediction horizon. After each delivered energy layer, the framework re-optimizes the spot weights of the next layer based on the delivered dose and the predicted motion. For three lung patients, we generate 500 variable breathing patterns to evaluate the dosimetric results of the framework and compare them to those of implementations of previously proposed non-adaptive methods. Compared to the best non-adaptive method, the adaptive framework improves the CTV D98 in the near-worst breathing scenario (5th percentile), from 96.4 to 98.9 % of the prescribed dose and considerably reduces the variation as measured by a mean decrease in the inter-quartile range by more than 80 %. The target coverage improvements are achieved without generally compromising target dose homogeneity or OAR dose. The study indicates that a motion-adaptive approach based on re-optimization of spot weights during delivery has the potential to substantially improve the dosimetric performance of PBS given fast and accurate models of patient motion.</description>

      <title>Medical Physics Dataset Article: a database of FLASH Murine In-Vivo Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The FLASH effect refers to a lower normal tissue damage for an equivalent tumour response, potentially widening the therapeutic window for radiotherapy. Although this effect has been demonstrated in various experiments using different types of particles and irradiation parameters, the underlying mechanism is not yet clearly understood. Uncertainties surround the conducted experiments, the explored parameter space, and the variability of reported results. To gain a better overview, we created a dataset that includes in-vivo FLASH experiments. This dataset documents all machine and biological dosimetric parameters, and for determined endpoints, it includes the outcome of the experiment. Our goal is to increase awareness of the results and their variability and provide a useful research and analysis tool for the community. The database contains peer-reviewed papers published until March 2024 on the FLASH in-vivo (murine) experiments. From each paper, previously defined parameters have been manually extracted and/or recalculated to ensure compatibility within the database entries. We provide two types of datasets: a user-friendly web-based Notion database and spreadsheets on a Zenodo repository. The database contains all the reviewed papers with extracted information in text or numeric form. Users can duplicate the database or view, search, filter, and reorganise online entries. The spreadsheets contain the data for the most analysed endpoints, allowing a comparative analysis. The study has two main applications. The web-based database will allow for a user-friendly search of information and meta-data of all published FLASH murine data. This will facilitate future research efforts to better understand the FLASH effect. The spreadsheets are a simple and useful tool for the community to conduct statistical analysis and determine the parameters associated with the FLASH effect.</description>

      <title>A Probabilistic Model of Bilateral Lymphatic Spread in Head and Neck Cancer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current guidelines for elective nodal irradiation in oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) recommend including large portions of the contralateral lymph system in the clinical target volume (CTV-N), even for lateralized tumors with no clinical lymph node involvement in the contralateral neck. This study introduces a probabilistic model of bilateral lymphatic tumor progression in OPSCC to estimate personalized risks of occult disease in specific lymph node levels (LNLs) based on clinical involvement, T-stage, and tumor lateralization. Building on a previously developed hidden Markov model for ipsilateral spread, we extend the approach to the contralateral neck. The model represents LNLs I, II, III, IV, V, and VII on both sides of the neck as binary hidden variables (healthy/involved), connected via arcs representing spread probabilities. These probabilities are learned using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling from a dataset of 833 OPSCC patients, enabling the model to reflect the underlying lymphatic progression dynamics. The model accurately and precisely describes observed patterns of involvement with a compact set of interpretable parameters. Midline extension of the primary tumor is identified as the primary risk factor for contralateral involvement, with advanced T-stage and extensive ipsilateral involvement further increasing risk. Occult disease in contralateral LNL III is highly unlikely if upstream LNL II is clinically negative, and in contralateral LNL IV, occult disease is exceedingly rare without LNL III involvement. For lateralized tumors not crossing the midline, the model suggests the contralateral neck may safely be excluded from the CTV-N. For tumors extending across the midline but with a clinically negative contralateral neck, the CTV-N could be limited to LNL II, reducing unnecessary exposure of normal tissue while maintaining regional tumor control.</description>

      <title>Assessing ultrasonic and optical flow velocimetry in a millifluidic device using oil-in-water emulsions as blood mimicking fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blood-mimicking fluids (BMFs) play a critical role in ultrasonic imaging and Doppler flow studies by replicating the physical and acoustic properties of blood. This study introduces a novel soybean oil-in-water emulsion as a BMF with particle size and deformability akin to red blood cells. Using a millifluidic device, we cross-validated flow profiles through both Doppler velocimetry and optical particle tracking, demonstrating compatibility with theoretical Poiseuille flow models. The millifluidic chip, fabricated via stereolithography, provided an optimized platform for dual optical and ultrasonic assessments. Results showed strong agreement between the two methods across a range of flow rates, affirming the suitability of the emulsion for velocimetry applications. Furthermore, the acoustic properties of soybean oil droplets support their potential as an echogenic and stable alternative to conventional BMFs.</description>

      <title>Towards reconstruction of Pulsed-wave Doppler signals from Non-invasive fetal ECG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fetal cardiac health monitoring with invasive methods have a limited viability because they can only be utilized during labor and are uncomfortable. On the other hand non-invasive fECG are adulterated with maternal ECG, and hence resulting in poor analysis. In contrast, Pulsed-wave Doppler (PwD) echocardiography generates high-quality signals representing fetal blood volume inflow-outflow. It also follows non-invasive signal acquisition. The only drawback is that it requires highly expensive setup. To address this aspect, we put forward a challenging research question - can we reconstruct PwD signals using non-invasive fetal ECG?</description>

      <title>Image-Space Gridding for Nonrigid Motion-Corrected MR Image Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motion remains a major challenge in magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, particularly in free-breathing cardiac MR imaging, where data are acquired over multiple heartbeats at varying respiratory phases. We adopt a model-based approach for nonrigid motion correction, addressing two challenges: (a) motion representation and (b) motion estimation. For motion representation, we derive image-space gridding by adapting the nonuniform fast Fourier transform (NUFFT) to represent and compute nonrigid motion, which provides an exact forward-adjoint pair of linear operators. We then introduce nonrigid SENSE operators that incorporate nonrigid motion into the multi-coil MR acquisition model. For motion estimation, we employ both low-resolution 3D image-based navigators (iNAVs) and high-resolution 3D self-navigating image-based navigators (self-iNAVs). During each heartbeat, data are acquired along two types of non-Cartesian trajectories: a subset of a high-resolution trajectory that sparsely covers 3D k-space, followed by a full low-resolution trajectory. We reconstruct 3D iNAVs for each heartbeat using the full low-resolution data, which are then used to estimate bulk motion and identify the respiratory phase of each heartbeat. By combining data from multiple heartbeats within the same respiratory phase, we reconstruct high-resolution 3D self-iNAVs, allowing estimation of nonrigid respiratory motion. For each respiratory phase, we construct the nonrigid SENSE operator, reformulating the nonrigid motion-corrected reconstruction as a standard regularized inverse problem. In a preliminary study, the proposed method enhanced sharpness of the coronary arteries and improved image quality in non-cardiac regions, outperforming translational motion-corrected reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Three-Dimensional Diffusion-Weighted Multi-Slab MRI With Slice Profile Compensation Using Deep Energy Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) multi-slab acquisition is a technique frequently employed in high-resolution diffusion-weighted MRI in order to achieve the best signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) efficiency. However, this technique is limited by slab boundary artifacts that cause intensity fluctuations and aliasing between slabs which reduces the accuracy of anatomical imaging. Addressing this issue is crucial for advancing diffusion MRI quality and making high-resolution imaging more feasible for clinical and research applications. In this work, we propose a regularized slab profile encoding (PEN) method within a Plug-and-Play ADMM framework, incorporating multi-scale energy (MuSE) regularization to effectively improve the slab combined reconstruction. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves image quality compared to non-regularized and TV-regularized PEN approaches. The regularized PEN framework provides a more robust and efficient solution for high-resolution 3D diffusion MRI, potentially enabling clearer, more reliable anatomical imaging across various applications.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity of Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping in Clinical Brain Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background: Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) of the brain is an advanced MRI technique for assessing tissue characteristics based on magnetic susceptibility, which varies with the composition of the tissue, such as iron, calcium, and myelin levels. QSM consists of multiple processing steps, with various choices for each step. Despite its increasing application in detecting and monitoring neurodegenerative diseases, the impact of algorithmic choices in QSM's workflow on clinical outcomes has not been thoroughly quantified.
  Objective: This study aimed to evaluate how choices in background field removal (BFR), dipole inversion algorithms, and anatomical referencing impact the sensitivity and reproducibility error of QSM in detecting group-level and longitudinal changes in deep gray matter susceptibility in a clinical setting.
  Methods: We compared 378 different QSM pipelines using a 10-year follow-up dataset of healthy adults. We analyzed the sensitivity of pipelines to detect known aging-related susceptibility changes in the DGM over time.
  Results: We found high variability in the sensitivity of QSM pipelines to detect susceptibility changes. The study highlighted that while most pipelines could detect changes reliably, the choice of BFR algorithm and the referencing strategy substantially influenced the outcome reproducibility error and sensitivity. Notably, pipelines using RESHARP with AMP-PE, HEIDI or LSQR inversion showed the highest overall sensitivity.
  Conclusions: The findings underscore the critical influence of algorithmic choices in QSM processing on the accuracy and reliability of detecting physiological changes in the brain. This has profound implications for clinical research and trials where QSM is used as a biomarker for disease progression, highlighting that careful consideration should be given to pipeline configuration to optimize clinical outcomes.</description>
