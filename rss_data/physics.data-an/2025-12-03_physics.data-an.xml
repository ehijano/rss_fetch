      <title>Design of an Imaging Air Cherenkov Telescope array layout with differential programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current optimization of ground-based Cherenkov telescopes arrays, also called Imaging Air Cherenkov Telescope (IACT) arrays, relies on brute-force human-driven approaches based on large simulations requiring both high amount of storage and long computation time. To explore the full phase space of telescope positioning of a given array even more simulations would be required. To optimize any array layout, we explore the possibility of developing a differential program with surrogate models of IACT arrays based on high-level instrument response functions (IRFs). The simulation time of a single telescope to a cosmic-ray event can be significantly reduced with its instrument response function or with generative models. However, it is not straight forward to model the array of telescopes from a set of single telescope surrogate models as the array is a stereoscopic imaging system. The complexity increases as well if the telescopes in the array are of different types. Additionally, the optimum of the array layout depends on the scientific use case. Current array layout optimization are obtained by minimizing the sensitivity of the array, a metric that depends on several high-level parameters such as the trigger efficiency, the energy and angular resolution, as well as the background rejection capability. The variety of telescopes types in IACT arrays, such as in the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO), not only extends the sensitive energy range but also allows for cross-calibration of the instruments. Therefore, the optimal array layout is not only which minimizes sensitivity but also which reduces the systematic uncertainties. We focus on the optimization of a telescope array based on the SST-1M IACTs in Hanle, Ladakh India aiming at building a generic optimization pipeline for future ground-based cosmic-ray observatories</description>

      <title>QCD in Language Models: What do they really know about QCD?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents an analysis of modern open-source large language models (LLMs) -- including Llama, Qwen, and Gemma -- to evaluate their encoded knowledge of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). Through reverse engineering of these models' representations, we uncover the naturally idiosyncratic patterns in how foundational QCD concepts are embedded within their parameter spaces. Our methodology combines targeted probing techniques and knowledge extraction protocols to assess the models' understanding of critical QCD principles like color confinement, asymptotic freedom, and the running coupling constant. This work provides a tool for utilizing LLMs as an assistant in physics research, while also highlighting current limitations in their representation of advanced quantum field theory concepts that future model development should address.</description>

      <title>Identifying preferred routes of sharing information on social networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spread of information has become faster and wider than ever with the advent of social network platforms. The question raised in this study is whether information dissemination in social networks is random or follows a discernible structure. Our results from real-world hashtag data suggest that the spread of hashtags is not random and follows specific patterns. This study proposes two preferential models to explore how news spreads on social media. Specifically, we examine global and local preferential selection models and demonstrate that information dissemination aligns with these patterns. According to these two models, information flows are distributed through specific paths on networks. This suggests that new information tends to propagate along the same paths as previous news, with the specific pathways varying depending on the type of content. Finally, an examination of the propagation of political hashtags on Twitter confirms the existence of these paths that also emerge from the two preferential models.</description>

      <title>Position-Sensitive Silicon Photomultiplier Array with Enhanced Position Reconstruction by means of a Deep Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single-photon sensitive detectors like Silicon Photomultipliers are widely used in many medical imaging applications. By using detectors with position resolutions, it is possible to build compact photodetector readouts with reduced number of channels, but still preserving position resolution and gamma-rays imaging capabilities. In this work, we present the advantage of using a Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) light position reconstruction applied to a 2x2 array of linearly-graded SiPMs (LG-SiPMs), to minimize the distortions on the reconstructed event maps. Our approach significantly enhances both the resolution and linearity of position detection compared to the nominal reconstruction formula based on the device architecture. Remarkably, the DNN-based reconstruction boosts the number of resolved areas (pixels) by a factor of at least 5.7, allowing a higher level of precision and performance in light detection.</description>

      <title>Q-triplet characterization of atmospheric time series at Antofagasta: A missing values problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Located in northern Chile (23.7{\deg}S, 70.4{\deg}W), Antofagasta has an exceptionally arid and stable climate characterized by minimal precipitation and consistent weather patterns. Nevertheless, despite these climate conditions being meaningful for several research and practical applications, our understanding of weather dynamics remains limited. The available meteorological data from 1969 to 2016 is analogical, which presents a significant challenge to analyze because these records are riddled with missing values, some measurements were taken at irregular measuring intervals, making it an interesting puzzle to grasp the Antofagasta's climate scenario. To overcome this issue, we present a comprehensive statistical analysis of atmospheric temperature, pressure, and humidity time series. Our analytical approach involves the q-triplet calculation method, serving as a powerful tool to identify distinctive behavior within systems under non-equilibrium states. Our results suggest that, in general, the q-triplet values satisfy the condition $q_\text{sens}&lt;1&lt;q_\text{stat}&lt;q_\text{rel}$, a pattern that has been observed in previous studies.</description>

      <title>The Intrinsic Dimension of Collider Events and Model-Independent Searches in 100 Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20760v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The phase space of hadron collider events spans hundreds of dimensions, generating an intricate geometry that we are just starting to explore. The number of possible new physics signals is exponential in the number of dimensions and detecting all of them is currently impossible for any human or artificial intelligence. In this work we introduce a method to search for new physics model-independently in this high-dimensional space. It is based on the measurement of the most basic property of the manifold of collider events, its dimensionality. Our proposed technique does not suffer from a look-elsewhere effect that grows exponentially with the number of dimensions of the dataset, and by construction is insensitive to energy scale uncertainties. We illustrate its potential by finding new physics in simulated events with hundreds of phase space dimensions, taking as input single particles rather than jets. This study sets the stage for new model-independent search strategies based on global properties of collider data manifolds.</description>
