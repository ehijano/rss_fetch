      <title>Optimal Catastrophe Risk Pooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Catastrophe risk has long been recognized to pose a serious threat to the insurance sector. Although natural disasters such as flooding, hurricane or severe drought are rare events, they generally lead to devastating damages that traditional insurance schemes may not be able to efficiently cover. Catastrophe risk pooling is an effective way to diversify the losses from such risks. In this paper, we improve the catastrophe risk pool by Pareto-optimally allocating the diversification benefits among participants. Finding the practical Pareto-optimal pool entails solving a high-dimensional optimization problem, for which analytical solutions are typically unavailable and numerical methods can be computationally intensive and potentially unreliable. We propose evaluating the diversification benefits at the limit case and using it to approximate the optimal pool by deriving an asymptotic optimal pool. Simulation studies are undertaken to explore the implications of the results and an empirical analysis from the U.S. National Flood Insurance Program is also carried out to illustrate how this framework can be applied in practice.</description>

      <title>What's the Price of Monotonicity? A Multi-Dataset Benchmark of Monotone-Constrained Gradient Boosting for Credit PD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Financial institutions face a trade-off between predictive accuracy and interpretability when deploying machine learning models for credit risk. Monotonicity constraints align model behavior with domain knowledge, but their performance cost - the price of monotonicity - is not well quantified. This paper benchmarks monotone-constrained versus unconstrained gradient boosting models for credit probability of default across five public datasets and three libraries. We define the Price of Monotonicity (PoM) as the relative change in standard performance metrics when moving from unconstrained to constrained models, estimated via paired comparisons with bootstrap uncertainty. In our experiments, PoM in AUC ranges from essentially zero to about 2.9 percent: constraints are almost costless on large datasets (typically less than 0.2 percent, often indistinguishable from zero) and most costly on smaller datasets with extensive constraint coverage (around 2-3 percent). Thus, appropriately specified monotonicity constraints can often deliver interpretability with small accuracy losses, particularly in large-scale credit portfolios.</description>

      <title>Institutional Backing and Crypto Volatility: A Hybrid Framework for DeFi Stabilization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decentralized finance (DeFi) lacks centralized oversight, often resulting in heightened volatility. In contrast, centralized finance (CeFi) offers a more stable environment with institutional safeguards. Institutional backing can play a stabilizing role in a hybrid structure (HyFi), enhancing transparency, governance, and market discipline. This study investigates whether HyFi-like cryptocurrencies, those backed by institutions, exhibit lower price risk than fully decentralized counterparts. Using daily data for 18 major cryptocurrencies from January 2020 to November 2024, we estimate panel EGLS models with fixed, random, and dynamic specifications. Results show that HyFi-like assets consistently experience lower price risk, with this effect intensifying during periods of elevated market volatility. The negative interaction between HyFi status and market-wide volatility confirms their stabilizing role. Conversely, greater decentralization is strongly associated with increased volatility, particularly during periods of market stress. Robustness checks using quantile regressions and pre-/post-Terra Luna subsamples reinforce these findings, with stronger effects observed in high-volatility quantiles and post-crisis conditions. These results highlight the importance of institutional architecture in enhancing the resilience of digital asset markets.</description>

      <title>Heston vol-of-vol and the VVIX</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Heston stochastic volatility model is arguably, the most popular stochastic volatility model used to price and risk manage exotic derivatives. In spite of this, it is not necessarily easy to calibrate to the market and obtain stable exotic option prices with this model. This paper focuses on the vol-of-vol parameter and its relation with the volatility of volatility index (VVIX) level. Four different approaches to estimate the VVIX in the Heston model are presented: two based on the known transition density of the variance, one analytical approximation, and one based on the Heston PDE which computes the value directly out of the underlying SPX500. Finally we explore their use to improve calibration stability.</description>

      <title>Counterexamples for FX Options Interpolations -- Part I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article provides a list of counterexamples, where some of the popular fx option interpolations break down. Interpolation of FX option prices (or equivalently volatilities), is key to risk-manage not only vanilla FX option books, but also more exotic derivatives which are typically valued with local volatility or local stochastic volatilility models.</description>
