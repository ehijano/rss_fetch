      <title>Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) Network Instrument: Measuring PQC Adoption Rates and Identifying Migration Pathways</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of adopting quantum-resistant cryptographic network protocols or post-quantum cryptography (PQC) is critically important to democratizing quantum computing. The problem is urgent because practical quantum computers will break classical encryption in the next few decades. Past encrypted data has already been collected and can be decrypted in the near future. The main challenges of adopting post-quantum cryptography lie in algorithmic complexity and hardware/software/network implementation. The grand question of how existing cyberinfrastructure will support post-quantum cryptography remains unanswered.
  This paper describes: i) the design of a novel Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) network instrument placed at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and a part of the FABRIC testbed; ii) the latest results on PQC adoption rate across a wide spectrum of network protocols (Secure Shell -- SSH, Transport Layer Security -- TLS, etc.); iii) the current state of PQC implementation in key scientific applications (e.g., OpenSSH or SciTokens); iv) the challenges of being quantum-resistant; and v) discussion of potential novel attacks.
  This is the first large-scale measurement of PQC adoption at national-scale supercomputing centers and FABRIC testbeds. Our results show that only OpenSSH and Google Chrome have successfully implemented PQC and achieved an initial adoption rate of 0.029\% (6,044 out of 20,556,816) for OpenSSH connections at NCSA coming from major Internet Service Providers or Autonomous Systems (ASes) such as OARNET, GTT, Google Fiber Webpass (U.S.) and Uppsala Lans Landsting (Sweden), with an overall increasing adoption rate year-over-year for 2023-2024. Our analyses identify pathways to migrate current applications to be quantum-resistant.</description>

      <title>Age of Information Analysis for Multi-Priority Queue and NOMA Enabled C-V2X in IoV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As development Internet-of-Vehicles (IoV) technology and demand for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) increase, there is a growing need for real-time data and communication by vehicle users. Traditional request-based methods face challenges such as latency and bandwidth limitations. Mode 4 in Connected Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X) addresses latency and overhead issues through autonomous resource selection. However, Semi-Persistent Scheduling (SPS) based on distributed sensing may lead to increased collision. Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) can alleviate the problem of reduced packet reception probability due to collisions. Moreover, the concept of Age of Information (AoI) is introduced as a comprehensive metric reflecting reliability and latency performance, analyzing the impact of NOMA on C-V2X communication system. AoI indicates the time a message spends in both local waiting and transmission processes. In C-V2X, waiting process can be extended to queuing process, influenced by packet generation rate and Resource Reservation Interval (RRI). The transmission process is mainly affected by transmission delay and success rate. In C-V2X, a smaller selection window (SW) limits the number of available resources for vehicles, resulting in higher collision rates with increased number of vehicles. SW is generally equal to RRI, which not only affects AoI in queuing process but also AoI in the transmission process. Therefore, this paper proposes an AoI estimation method based on multi-priority data type queues and considers the influence of NOMA on the AoI generated in both processes in C-V2X system under different RRI conditions. This work aims to gain a better performance of C-V2X system comparing with some known algorithms.</description>

      <title>Enhance the Detection of DoS and Brute Force Attacks within the MQTT Environment through Feature Engineering and Employing an Ensemble Technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid development of the Internet of Things (IoT) environment has introduced unprecedented levels of connectivity and automation. The Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol has become recognized in IoT applications due to its lightweight and efficient features; however, this simplicity also renders MQTT vulnerable to multiple attacks that can be launched against the protocol, including denial of service (DoS) and brute-force attacks. This study aims to improve the detection of intrusion DoS and brute-force attacks in an MQTT traffic intrusion detection system (IDS). Our approach utilizes the MQTT dataset for model training by employing effective feature engineering and ensemble learning techniques. Following our analysis and comparison, we identified the top 10 features demonstrating the highest effectiveness, leading to improved model accuracy. We used supervised machine learning models, including Random Forest, Decision Trees, k-Nearest Neighbors, and XGBoost, in combination with ensemble classifiers. Stacking, voting, and bagging ensembles utilize these four supervised machine-learning methods to combine models. This study's results illustrate the proposed technique's efficacy in enhancing the accuracy of detecting DoS and brute-force attacks in MQTT traffic. Stacking and voting classifiers achieved the highest accuracy of 0.9538. Our approach outperforms the most recent study that utilized the same dataset.</description>

      <title>Manifold-Based Optimizations for RIS-Aided Massive MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Manifold optimization (MO) is a powerful mathematical framework that can be applied to optimize functions over complex geometric structures, which is particularly useful in advanced wireless communication systems, such as reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided massive MIMO (mMIMO) and extra-large scale massive MIMO (XL-MIMO) systems. MO provides a structured approach to tackling complex optimization problems. By leveraging the geometric properties of the manifold, more efficient and effective solutions can be found compared to conventional optimization methods. This paper provides a tutorial on MO technique and provides some applications of MO in the context of wireless communications systems. In particular, to corroborate the effectiveness of MO methodology, we explore five application examples in RIS-aided mMIMO system, focusing on fairness, energy efficiency (EE) maximization, intracell pilot reuse interference mitigation, and grant-free (GF) random access (RA).</description>

      <title>CAVE: Crowdsourcing Passing-By Vehicles for Reliable In-Vehicle Edge Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In-vehicle edge computing is a much anticipated paradigm to serve ever-increasing computation demands originated from the ego vehicle, such as passenger entertainments. In this paper, we explore the unique idea of crowdsourcing passing-by vehicles to augment computing of the ego vehicle. The challenges lie in the high dynamics of passing-by vehicles, time-correlated task computation, and the stringent requirement of computing reliability for individual user tasks. To this end, we formulate an optimization problem to minimize the end-to-end latency by optimizing the task assignment and resource allocation of user tasks. To address the complex problem, we propose a new algorithm (named CAVE) with multiple key designs. We build an end-to-end network and compute simulator and conduct extensive simulation to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>A New Horizon of Data Communication through Quantum Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By the blessing of our existing data communication system, we can communicate or share our information with each other in every nook and corner of the world within some few seconds but there are some limitations in our traditional data communication system. Every day we are trying to overcome these limitations and improve our systems for better performance. Among them some problems may not be resolvable, for the reason of very basic or root dependencies of physics. In this paper, we have clarified some main drawbacks in our traditional communication system and provided a conceptual model to overcome these issues by using mystic Quantum Entanglement theorem rather than classical or modern physics phenomenon. In the end, we introduced a possible Quantum circuit diagram and Quantum network architecture for end-to-end data communication. It is predicted that through this hypothetical model data can be transmitted faster than light and it will be 100% real time between any distances without any kinds of traditional communication medium that are being used to date.</description>

      <title>Mobility-Aware Federated Self-supervised Learning in Vehicular Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is an advanced distributed machine learning approach, that protects the privacy of each vehicle by allowing the model to be trained on multiple devices simultaneously without the need to upload all data to a road side unit (RSU). This enables FL to handle scenarios with sensitive or widely distributed data. However, in these fields, it is well known that the labeling costs can be a significant expense, and models relying on labels are not suitable for these rapidly evolving fields especially in vehicular networks, or mobile internet of things (MIoT), where new data emerges constantly. To handle this issue, the self-supervised learning paves the way for training without labels. Additionally, for vehicles with high velocity, owing to blurred images, simple aggregation not only impacts the accuracy of the aggregated model but also reduces the convergence speed of FL. This paper proposes a FL algorithm based on image blur level to aggregation, called FLSimCo, which does not require labels and serves as a pre-training stage for self-supervised learning in the vehicular environment. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm exhibits fast and stable convergence.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Digital Forensics Readiness In Big Data Wireless Medical Networks: A Secure Decentralised Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wireless medical networks are pivotal for chronic disease management, yet the sensitive Big Data they generate presents administration challenges and cyber vulnerability. This Big Data is valuable within both healthcare and legal contexts, serving as a resource for investigating medical malpractice, civil cases, criminal activities, and network-related incidents. However, the rapid evolution of network technologies and data creates complexities in digital forensics investigations and audits. To address these issues, this paper proposes a secure decentralised framework aimed at bolstering digital forensics readiness (DFR) in Big Data wireless medical networks by identifying security threats, complexities, and gaps in current research efforts. By improving the network's resilience to cyber threats and aiding in medical malpractice investigations, this framework significantly advances digital forensics, wireless networks, and healthcare. It enhances digital forensics readiness, incident response, and the management of medical malpractice incidents in Big Data wireless medical networks. A real-world scenario-based evaluation demonstrated the framework's effectiveness in improving forensic readiness and response capabilities, validating its practical applicability and impact. A comparison of the proposed framework with existing frameworks concluded that it is an advancement in framework design for DFR, especially in regard to Big Data processing, decentralised DFR storage and scalability.</description>

      <title>LeFi: Learn to Incentivize Federated Learning in Automotive Edge Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12720v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is the promising privacy-preserve approach to continually update the central machine learning (ML) model (e.g., object detectors in edge servers) by aggregating the gradients obtained from local observation data in distributed connected and automated vehicles (CAVs). The incentive mechanism is to incentivize individual selfish CAVs to participate in FL towards the improvement of overall model accuracy. It is, however, challenging to design the incentive mechanism, due to the complex correlation between the overall model accuracy and unknown incentive sensitivity of CAVs, especially under the non-independent and identically distributed (Non-IID) data of individual CAVs. In this paper, we propose a new learn-to-incentivize algorithm to adaptively allocate rewards to individual CAVs under unknown sensitivity functions. First, we gradually learn the unknown sensitivity function of individual CAVs with accumulative observations, by using compute-efficient Gaussian process regression (GPR). Second, we iteratively update the reward allocation to individual CAVs with new sampled gradients, derived from GPR. Third, we project the updated reward allocations to comply with the total budget. We evaluate the performance of extensive simulations, where the simulation parameters are obtained from realistic profiling of the CIFAR-10 dataset and NVIDIA RTX 3080 GPU. The results show that our proposed algorithm substantially outperforms existing solutions, in terms of accuracy, scalability, and adaptability.</description>

      <title>Digital Twin-Empowered Task Assignment in Aerial MEC Network: A Resource Coalition Cooperation Approach with Generative Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01555v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To meet the demands for ubiquitous communication and temporary edge computing in 6G networks, aerial mobile edge computing (MEC) networks have been envisioned as a new paradigm. However, dynamic user requests pose challenges for task assignment strategies. Most of the existing research assumes that the strategy is deployed on ground-based stations or UAVs, which will be ineffective in an environment lacking infrastructure and continuous energy supply. Moreover, the resource mutual exclusion problem of dynamic task assignment has not been effectively solved. Toward this end, we introduce the digital twin (DT) into the aerial MEC network to study the resource coalition cooperation approach with the generative model (GM), which provides a preliminary coalition structure for the coalition game. Specifically, we propose a novel network framework that is composed of an application plane, a physical plane, and a virtual plane. After that, the task assignment problem is simplified to convex optimization programming with linear constraints. And then, we also propose a resource coalition cooperation approach that is based on a transferable utility (TU) coalition game to obtain an approximate optimal solution. Numerical results confirm the effectiveness of our proposed approach in terms of energy consumption and utilization of resources.</description>

      <title>Towards Variable-Length In-Network Caching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21324v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present StarCache, a new in-network caching architecture that can cache variable-length items to balance a wide range of key-value workloads. Unlike existing works, StarCache does not cache hot items in the switch memory. Instead, we make hot items revisit the switch data plane continuously by exploiting packet recirculation. Our approach keeps cached key-value pairs in the switch data plane while freeing them from item size limitations caused by hardware constraints. We implement a StarCache prototype on an Intel Tofino switch. Our experimental results show that StarCache can balance highly skewed workloads with various key and value sizes.</description>
