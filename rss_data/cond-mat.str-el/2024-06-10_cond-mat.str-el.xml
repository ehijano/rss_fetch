      <title>Unconventional discontinuous transitions in isospin systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that two-dimensional fermions with dispersion $k^2$ or $k^4$ undergo a first-order Stoner transition to a fully spin-polarized state despite that the spin susceptibility diverges at the critical point. We extend our analysis to systems with dispersion $k^{2\alpha}$ and spin and valley isospin and show that there is a cascade of instabilities into fractional-metal states with some electron bands fully depleted; narrow intermediate ranges of partially-depleted bands exist for $\alpha&lt;1$ or $\alpha &gt; 2$. The susceptibility becomes large near each transition. We discuss applications to biased bilayer and tri-layer graphene and moir\'e systems.</description>

      <title>Unconventional discontinuous transitions in a 2D system with spin and valley degrees of freedom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the transition into the most favorable ordered state for a system of 2D fermions with spin and valley degrees of freedom. We show that for a range of rotationally invariant dispersions, the ordering transition is highly unconventional: the associated susceptibility diverges (or almost diverges) at the transition, yet immediately below it the system jumps discontinuously into a fully polarized state. We analyze the dispersion of the longitudinal and transverse collective modes in different parameter regimes above and below the transition. Additionally, we consider ordering in a system with full $\mathrm{SU(4)}$ symmetry and show that there is a cascade of discontinuous transitions into a set of states, which includes a quarter-metal, a half-metal and a three-quarter metal. We compare our results with the data for biased bilayer and tri-layer graphene.</description>

      <title>Magnetic response and antiferromagnetic correlations in strained kagome ribbons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the physics of the strong-coupling Hubbard model in a kagome lattice ribbon under mechanical tension and half-filling. It is known that in the absence of strain, the lattice symmetry of the system and strong electronic interactions induce magnetic frustration. As uniaxial strain is applied, the ribbon exhibits various configurations with energy oscillations that depend on the direction of the strain axis. The ground states are obtained by density matrix enormalization group calculations. We find that the system is characterized by strong antiferromagnetic bonds distributed throughout the lattice along directions and patterns that depend on the strain directions and may coexist with easily polarizable sites that are only weakly correlated to their neighbors. We identify frustration and correlation measures that follow the strain and interaction dependence of the system well. These results illustrate that strain-dependent magnetic susceptibility could be explored experimentally to help probe the role of symmetry and interactions in these systems.</description>

      <title>Spin Dynamics of the Centrosymmetric Skyrmion Material GdRu2Si2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic skyrmion crystals are traditionally associated with non-centrosymmetric crystal structures; however, it has been demonstrated that skyrmion crystals can be stabilized by competing interactions in centrosymmetric crystals. To understand and optimize the physical responses associated with topologically-nontrivial skyrmion textures, it is important to quantify their magnetic interactions by comparing theoretical predictions with spectroscopic data. Here, we present neutron diffraction and spectroscopy data on the centrosymmetric skyrmion material GdRu$_2$Si$_2$, and show that the key spectroscopic features can be explained by the magnetic interactions calculated using density-functional theory calculations. We further show that the recently-proposed 2-$\mathbf{q}$ "topological spin stripe" structure yields better agreement with our data than a 1-$\mathbf{q}$ helical structure, and identify how the magnetic structure evolves with temperature.</description>

      <title>Charge self-consistent density functional theory plus ghost rotationally-invariant slave-boson theory for correlated materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a charge self-consistent density functional theory combined with the ghost-rotationally-invariant slave-boson (DFT+gRISB) formalism for studying correlated materials. This method is applied to SrVO$_3$ and NiO, representing prototypical correlated metals and charge-transfer insulators. For SrVO$_3$, we demonstrate that DFT+gRISB yields an accurate equilibrium volume and effective mass close to experimentally observed values. Regarding NiO, DFT+gRISB enables the simultaneous description of charge transfer and Mott-Hubbard bands, significantly enhancing the accuracy of the original DFT+RISB approach. Furthermore, the calculated equilibrium volume and spectral function reasonably agree with experimental observations.</description>

      <title>Magnetism of $\mathrm{NaYbS_2}$: From finite temperatures to ground state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rare-earth chalcogenide compounds $\mathrm{ARECh_2}$ (A = alkali or monovalent metal, RE = rare earth, Ch = O, S, Se, Te) are a large family of quantum spin liquid (QSL) candidate materials. $\mathrm{NaYbS_2}$ is a representative member of the family. Several key issues on $\mathrm{NaYbS_2}$, particularly how to determine the highly anisotropic spin Hamiltonian and describe the magnetism at finite temperatures and the ground state, remain to be addressed. In this paper, we conducted an in-depth and comprehensive study on the magnetism of $\mathrm{NaYbS_2}$ from finite temperatures to the ground state. Firstly, we successfully detected three crystalline electric field (CEF) excitation energy levels using low-temperature Raman scattering technique. Combining them with the CEF theory and magnetization data, we worked out the CEF parameters, CEF energy levels, and CEF wavefunctions. We further determined a characteristic temperature of $\sim$40 K, above which the magnetism is dominated by CEF excitations while below which the spin-exchange interactions play a main role. The characteristic temperature has been confirmed by the temperature-dependent electron spin resonance (ESR) linewidth. Low-temperature ESR experiments on the dilute magnetic doped crystal of $\mathrm{NaYb_{0.1}Lu_{0.9}S_2}$ further helped us to determine the accurate $g$-factor. Next, we quantitatively obtained the spin-exchange interactions in the spin Hamiltonian by consistently simulating the magnetization and specific heat data. Finally, the above studies allow us to explore the ground state magnetism of $\mathrm{NaYbS_2}$ by using the density matrix renormalization group. We combined numerical calculations and experimental results to demonstrate that the ground state of $\mathrm{NaYbS_2}$ is a Dirac-like QSL.</description>

      <title>Anomaly inflow for dipole symmetry and higher form foliated field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In accordance with recent progress of fracton topological phases, unusual topological phases of matter hosting fractionalized quasiparticle excitations with mobility constraints, new type of symmetry is studied -- multipole symmetry, associated with conservation of multipoles. Based on algebraic relation between dipole and global charges, we introduce a series of $(d+1)$-dimensional BF theories with $p$-form gauge fields, which admit dipole of spatially extended excitations, and study their physical properties. We elucidate that gauge invariant loops have unusual form, containing linear function of the spatial coordinate, which leads to the position dependent braiding statistics and unusual ground state degeneracy dependence on the system size. We also show that the theories exhibit a mixed 't Hooft anomaly between $p$-form and $(d-p)$-form dipole symmetries, which is canceled by an invertible theory defined in one dimensional higher via anomaly inflow mechanism.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear effects on charge fractionalization in critical chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the generic transport in a one-dimensional strongly correlated fermionic chain beyond linear response. Starting from a Gaussian wave packet with positive momentum on top of the ground state, we find that the numerical time evolution splits the signal into at least three distinct fractional charges moving with different velocities. A fractional left-moving charge is expected from conventional Luttinger liquid theory, but for the prediction of the two separate right-moving packets the nonlinearity of the dispersion must also be taken into account. This out-of-equilibrium protocol therefore allows a direct measurement of nonlinear interaction parameters, which also govern threshold singularities of dynamic response functions. The nonlinear Luttinger Liquid theory also predicts the correct dynamics at low energies, where it agrees with the conventional Luttinger liquid. Moreover, at high energies, the wave packet dynamics reveals signatures of composite excitations containing two-particle bound states. Our results uncover a simple strategy to probe the nonlinear regime in time-resolved experiments in quantum wires and ultracold-atom platforms.</description>

      <title>Kondo Screening and Indirect Magnetic Exchange through a Conventional Superconductor Studied by the Density-Matrix Renormalization Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The competition between the Kondo screening and indirect magnetic exchange in systems with two magnetic impurities coupled to a conventional s-wave superconductor gives rise to a nontrivial ground-state phase diagram. Here, we utilize the density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method and exploit the non-abelian spin-SU(2) symmetry to study the phase diagram for two quantum-spin-$\frac12$ impurities locally exchange coupled to large one-dimensional chains. The nonlocal inter-impurity exchange is treated as an emergent Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) coupling. We find qualitatively different phase diagrams for impurity spins coupled to sites with odd or even distances $d$ on the chain and a partial-Kondo-screened spin-doublet phase that extends over the whole range of local exchange couplings $J$ in the limit of weak superconducting pairing strength $\Delta$. Our numerical studies are complemented by exact diagonalization of small (quantum-box) systems and by perturbative-in-$J$ computations of the $d$ and $\Delta$ dependent RKKY interaction. It is thereby demonstrated that the specific system geometry is essential for our understanding of magnetic impurity interactions in superconducting hosts, and thus for insights into the control of quantum-state properties in nanoparticle systems and topological superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Curvature induced magnetization of altermagnetic films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a thin film of $d$-wave altermagnet bent in a stretching-free manner and demonstrate that gradients of the film curvature induce a local magnetization which is approximately tangential to the film. The magnetization amplitude directly reflects the altermagnetic symmetry and depends on the direction of bending. It is maximal for the bending along directions of the maximal altermagnetic splitting of the magnon bands. A periodically bent film of sinusoidal shape possesses a total magnetic moment per period $\propto\mathscr{A}^2q^4$ where $\mathscr{A}$ and $q$ are the bending amplitude and wave vector, respectively. The total magnetic moment is perpendicular to the plane of the unbent film and its direction (up or down) is determined by the bending direction. A film roll up to a nanotube possesses a toroidal moment directed along the tube $\propto \delta_r/r^2$ per one coil, where $r$ and $\delta_r$ are the coil radius and the pitch between coils. All these analytical predictions agree with numerical spin-lattice simulations.</description>

      <title>Explainable Machine Learning Identification of Superconductivity from Single-Particle Spectral Functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The traditional method of identifying symmetry-breaking phase transitions through the emergence of a single-particle gap encounters significant challenges in quantum materials with strong fluctuations. To address this, we have developed a data-driven approach using a domain-adversarial neural network trained on simulated spectra of cuprates. This model compensates for the scarcity of experimental data -- a significant barrier to the wide deployment of machine learning in physical research -- by leveraging the abundance of theoretically simulated data. When applied to unlabeled experimental spectra, our model successfully distinguishes the true superconducting states from gapped fluctuating states, without the need for fine temperature sampling across the transition. Further, the explanation of our machine learning model reveals the crucial role of the Fermi-surface spectral intensity even in gapped states. It paves the way for robust and direct spectroscopic identification of fluctuating orders, particularly in low-dimensional, strongly correlated materials.</description>

      <title>Emergence of topological states in relaxation dynamics of interacting bosons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological concepts have been employed to understand the ground states of many strongly correlated systems, but it is still quite unclear if and how topology manifests itself in the relaxation dynamics. Here we uncover emergent topological phenomena in the time evolution of far-from-equilibrium one-dimensional interacting bosons. Beginning with simple product states, the system evolves into long-time stationary states with high energy that are nonthermal for a wide range of parameters, and they exhibit nonlocal string correlation that is characteristic of the symmetry-protected topological ground state of the Hamiltonian. In contrast, no topological feature is found in the stationary state as long as the system thermalizes. This difference is further corroborated by the distinct behaviour of quantum entanglement and edge states of the system. Our theoretical prediction can be examined by current experimental techniques and paves the way for a more comprehensive understanding of topological phases in nonequilibrium settings.</description>

      <title>$T_c$ and the elastocaloric effect of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ under $\langle 110 \rangle$ uniaxial stress: no indications of transition splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is considerable evidence that the superconductivity of Sr2RuO4 has two components. Among this evidence is a jump in the shear elastic modulus $c_{66}$ at the critical temperature $T_c$, observed in ultrasound measurements. Such a jump is forbidden for homogeneous single-component order parameters, and implies that $T_c$ should develop as a cusp under the application of shear strain with $\langle 110 \rangle$ principal axes. This shear strain should split the onset temperatures of the two components, if they coexist, or select one component if they do not. Here, we report measurements of $T_c$ and the elastocaloric effect of Sr2RuO4 under uniaxial stress applied along the $[110]$ lattice direction. Within experimental resolution, we resolve neither a cusp in the stress dependence of $T_c$, nor any second transition in the elastocaloric effect data. We show that reconciling these null results with the observed jumps in $c_{66}$ requires extraordinarily fine tuning to a triple point of the Ginzburg-Landau parameter space. In addition, our results are inconsistent with homogeneous time reversal symmetry breaking at a temperature $T_2 \leq T_c$ as identified in muon spin relaxation experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This review provides a comprehensive overview of current research on the structural, electronic, and magnetic characteristics of the recently discovered high-temperature superconductor La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under high pressures. We present the experimental results for synthesizing and characterizing this material, derived from measurements of transport, thermodynamics, and various spectroscopic techniques, and discuss their physical implications. We also explore theoretical models proposed to describe the electronic structures and superconducting pairing symmetry in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, highlighting the intricate interplay between electronic correlations and magnetic interactions. Despite these advances, challenges remain in growing high-quality samples free of extrinsic phases and oxygen deficiencies and in developing reliable measurement tools for determining diamagnetism and other physical quantities under high pressures. Further investigations in these areas are essential to deepening our understanding of the physical properties of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and unlocking its superconducting pairing mechanism.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive description of color centers by wave function theory: a CASSCF-NEVPT2 study of the NV defect in diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Paramagnetic point defects in wide-bandgap semiconductors, characterized by atomic-like in-gap defect states, constitute a unique challenge for ab initio modeling. In this theoretical study, we aim to devise a wave-function only computational protocol, exemplified on the prominent nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond, which enables the full characterization of future quantum bit candidates implemented in color centers. We propose the application of the second order $n$-electron valence state perturbation theory on top of the complete active space self-consistent field approximation (CASSCF-NEVPT2) to provide a balanced ab initio level description of the correlation effects yielded from the defect orbitals and the embedding nanodiamond. By relaxing the molecular cluster under the compression of the surrounding bulk material, we manage to model both the vertical and relaxed experimental electronic spectra within an average error margin of 0.1 eV. Furthermore, the experimentally observed Jahn-Teller behavior of $^3E$ and $^1E$ states, the measured fine structure of the triplet electronic states, as well as the expected spin-selectivity are quantitatively reproduced by the presented methodology. Our findings showcase that using conventional wave-function-based quantum chemical approaches on carefully crafted cluster models can be a competing alternative for discussing the energetics of point defects in solids.</description>

Rooted in the dimensionality of their extended Hilbert spaces, the high computational complexity of simulating open quantum systems calls for the development of strategies to approximate their dynamics. In this paper, we present an approach for tackling open quantum system dynamics. Using an exact probabilistic formulation of quantum physics based on positive operator-valued measure (POVM), we compactly represent quantum states with autoregressive transformer neural networks; such networks bring significant algorithmic flexibility due to efficient exact sampling and tractable density. We further introduce the concept of String States to partially restore the symmetry of the autoregressive transformer neural network and improve the description of local correlations. Efficient algorithms have been developed to simulate the dynamics of the Liouvillian superoperator using a forward-backward trapezoid method and find the steady state via a variational formulation. Our approach is benchmarked on prototypical one and two-dimensional systems, finding results which closely track the exact solution and achieve higher accuracy than alternative approaches based on using Markov chain Monte Carlo to sample restricted Boltzmann machines. Our work provides general methods for understanding quantum dynamics in various contexts, as well as techniques for solving high-dimensional probabilistic differential equations in classical setups.</description>

      <title>Gauge Invariant and Anyonic Symmetric Transformer and RNN Quantum States for Quantum Lattice Models</title>

Abstract: Symmetries such as gauge invariance and anyonic symmetry play a crucial role in quantum many-body physics. We develop a general approach to constructing gauge invariant or anyonic symmetric autoregressive neural network quantum states, including a wide range of architectures such as Transformer and recurrent neural network (RNN), for quantum lattice models. These networks can be efficiently sampled and explicitly obey gauge symmetries or anyonic constraint. We prove that our methods can provide exact representation for the ground and excited states of the 2D and 3D toric codes, and the X-cube fracton model. We variationally optimize our symmetry incorporated autoregressive neural networks for ground states as well as real-time dynamics for a variety of models. We simulate the dynamics and the ground states of the quantum link model of $\text{U(1)}$ lattice gauge theory, obtain the phase diagram for the 2D $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory, determine the phase transition and the central charge of the $\text{SU(2)}_3$ anyonic chain, and also compute the ground state energy of the SU(2) invariant Heisenberg spin chain. Our approach provides powerful tools for exploring condensed matter physics, high energy physics and quantum information science.</description>

      <title>Decomposing imaginary time Feynman diagrams using separable basis functions: Anderson impurity model strong coupling expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.08566v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a deterministic algorithm for the efficient evaluation of imaginary time diagrams based on the recently introduced discrete Lehmann representation (DLR) of imaginary time Green's functions. In addition to the efficient discretization of diagrammatic integrals afforded by its approximation properties, the DLR basis is separable in imaginary time, allowing us to decompose diagrams into linear combinations of nested sequences of one-dimensional products and convolutions. Focusing on the strong coupling bold-line expansion of generalized Anderson impurity models, we show that our strategy reduces the computational complexity of evaluating an $M$th-order diagram at inverse temperature $\beta$ and spectral width $\omega_{\max}$ from $\mathcal{O}((\beta \omega_{\max})^{2M-1})$ for a direct quadrature to $\mathcal{O}(M (\log (\beta \omega_{\max}))^{M+1})$, with controllable high-order accuracy. We benchmark our algorithm using third-order expansions for multi-band impurity problems with off-diagonal hybridization and spin-orbit coupling, presenting comparisons with exact diagonalization and quantum Monte Carlo approaches. In particular, we perform a self-consistent dynamical mean-field theory calculation for a three-band Hubbard model with strong spin-orbit coupling representing a minimal model of Ca$_2$RuO$_4$, demonstrating the promise of the method for modeling realistic strongly correlated multi-band materials. For both strong and weak coupling expansions of low and intermediate order, in which diagrams can be enumerated, our method provides an efficient, straightforward, and robust black-box evaluation procedure. In this sense, it fills a gap between diagrammatic approximations of the lowest order, which are simple and inexpensive but inaccurate, and those based on Monte Carlo sampling of high-order diagrams.</description>

      <title>Subsystem symmetries, critical Bose surface, and immobile excitations in an extended compass model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.08300v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an extended compass model that hosts subsystem symmetries and has potential experimental relevance with 3d transition metal compounds. The subsystem symmetries strongly constrain the mobility of spin excitations and lead to profound consequences. At the quantum critical point we find the presence of "critical Bose surface" along the entire $k_x$ and $k_y$ axis. Across which we find a nodal-line spin liquid that undergoes nematic instability at low temperatures. In the ferro-quadrupole phase, we find that one excitation is immobile individually analogous to "fractons".</description>

      <title>Floquet engineering of binding in doped and photo-doped Mott insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.04899v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the emergence of bound states in chemically and photo-doped Mott insulators, mediated by spin and $\eta$-pairing fluctuations within both 2-leg ladder and 2D systems. To effectively describe the photo and chemically doped state on the same footings, we employ the Schrieffer-Wolff transformation, resulting in a generalized $t$-$J$ model. Our results demonstrate that the binding energies and localization length in the chemically and photo-doped regimes are comparable, with $\eta$-pairing fluctuations not playing a crucial role. Furthermore, we show that manipulating the binding is possible through external periodic driving, a technique known as Floquet engineering, leading to significantly enhanced binding energies. We also roughly estimate the lifetime of photo-doped states under periodic driving conditions based on the Fermi golden rule. Lastly, we propose experimental protocols for realizing Hubbard excitons in cold-atom experiments.</description>

      <title>Magnetic quantum oscillations of in-plane Hall conductivity and magnetoresistance tensor in quasi-two-dimensional metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07496v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop the theory of magnetoresistance oscillations in layered quasi-two-dimensional (quasi-2D) metals. Using the Kubo-Streda formula, we calculate the Hall intralayer conductivity in a magnetic field perpendicular to conducting layers. The analytical expressions for the amplitudes and phases of magnetic quantum oscillations (MQO) and of the difference or the so-called slow oscillations (SO) are derived as a function of several parameters: magnetic field strength, interlayer transfer integral, temperature, and the electron mean-free time. We calculate the quantum oscillations of the magnetoresistance tensor, because the magnetoresistance rather than conductivity is usually measured. We also discuss the averaging of magnetoresistance oscillations over MQO period due to finite temperature and long-range sample inhomogeneities. The results obtained are useful to analyze experimental data on magnetoresistance oscillations in various quasi-2D metals.</description>

      <title>Strength of Kitaev Interaction in Na$_3$Co$_2$SbO$_6$ and Na$_3$Ni$_2$BiO$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03338v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kitaev spin liquid is proposed to be promisingly realized in low spin-orbit coupling $3d$ systems, represented by Na$_3$Co$_2$SbO$_6$ and Na$_3$Ni$_2$BiO$_6$. However, the existence of Kitaev interaction is still debatable among experiments, and obtaining the strength of Kitaev interaction from first-principles calculations is also challenging. Here, we report the state-dependent anisotropy of Kitaev interaction, based on which a convenient method is developed to rapidly determine the strength of Kitaev interaction. Applying such method and density functional theory calculations, it is found that Na$_3$Co$_2$SbO$_6$ with $3d^7$ configuration exhibits considerable ferromagnetic Kitaev interaction. Moreover, by further applying the symmetry-adapted cluster expansion method, a realistic spin model is determined for Na$_3$Ni$_2$BiO$_6$ with $3d^8$ configuration. Such model indicates negligible small Kitaev interaction, but it predicts many properties, such as ground states and field effects, which are well consistent with measurements. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the heavy elements, Sb or Bi, located at the hollow sites of honeycomb lattice, do not contribute to emergence of Kitaev interaction through proximity, contradictory to common belief. The presently developed anisotropy method will be beneficial not only for computations but also for measurements.</description>

      <title>Theory of intrinsic acoustic plasmons in twisted bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16384v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a theoretical study of the intrinsic plasmonic properties of twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) as a function of the twist angle $\theta$ (and other microscopic parameters such as temperature and filling factor). Our calculations, which rely on the random phase approximation, take into account four crucially important effects, which are treated on equal footing: i) the layer-pseudospin degree of freedom, ii) spatial non-locality of the density-density response function, iii) crystalline local field effects, and iv) Hartree self-consistency. We show that the plasmonic spectrum of TBG displays a smooth transition from a strongly-coupled regime (at twist angles $\theta \lesssim 2^{\circ}$), where the low-energy spectrum is dominated by a weakly dispersive intra-band plasmon, to a weakly-coupled regime (for twist angles $\theta \gtrsim 2^{\circ}$) where an acoustic plasmon clearly emerges. This crossover offers the possibility of realizing tunable mid-infrared sub-wavelength cavities, whose vacuum fluctuations may be used to manipulate the ground state of strongly correlated electron systems.</description>

      <title>Lindblad dynamics from spatio-temporal correlation functions in nonintegrable spin-1/2 chains with different boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18177v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the Lindblad equation in the context of boundary-driven magnetization transport in spin-$1/2$ chains. Our central question is whether the nonequilibrium steady state of the open system, including its buildup in time, can be described on the basis of the dynamics in the closed system. To this end, we rely on a previous work [Phys. Rev. B 108, L201119 (2023)], where a description in terms of spatio-temporal correlation functions has been suggested in the case of weak driving and small system-bath coupling. Because this work has focused on integrable systems and periodic boundary conditions, we here extend the analysis in three directions: We (i) consider nonintegrable systems, (ii) take into account open boundary conditions and other bath-coupling geometries, and (iii) provide a comparison to time-evolving block decimation. While we find that nonintegrability plays a minor role, the choice of the specific boundary conditions can be crucial, due to potentially nondecaying edge modes. Our large-scale numerical simulations suggest that a description based on closed-system correlation functions is an useful alternative to already existing state-of-the-art approaches.</description>

      <title>Uncovering the lowest thickness limit for room-temperature ferromagnetism of Cr$_{1.6}$Te$_{2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11977v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Metallic ferromagnetic transition metal dichalcogenides have emerged as important building blocks for scalable magnonics and memory applications. Downscaling such systems to the ultra-thin limit is critical to integrate them into technology. Here, we achieved layer-by-layer control over the transition metal dichalcogenide Cr$_{1.6}$Te$_{2}$ by using pulsed laser deposition, and we uncovered the minimum critical thickness above which room temperature magnetic order is maintained. The electronic and magnetic structure is explored experimentally and theoretically and it is shown that the films exhibit strong in-plane magnetic anisotropy as a consequence of large spin-orbit effects. Our study elucidates both magnetic and electronic properties of Cr$_{1.6}$Te$_{2}$, and corroborates the importance of intercalation to tune the magnetic properties of nanoscale materials architectures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08394v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the non-equilibrium dynamics of two coupled SYK models, conjectured to be holographically dual to an eternal traversable wormhole in AdS$_2$. We consider different periodic drivings of the parameters of the system. We analyze the energy flows in the wormhole and black hole phases of the model as a function of the driving frequency. Our numerical results show a series of resonant frequencies in which the energy absorption and heating are enhanced significantly and the transmission coefficients drop, signalling a closure of the wormhole. These frequencies correspond to part of the conformal tower of states and to the boundary graviton of the dual gravitational theory. Furthermore, we provide evidence supporting the existence of a hot wormhole phase between the black hole and wormhole phases. When driving the strength of the separate SYK terms we find that the transmission can be enhanced by suitably tuning the driving.</description>
