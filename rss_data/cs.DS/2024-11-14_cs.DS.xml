      <title>New Separations and Reductions for Directed Preservers and Hopsets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study distance preservers, hopsets, and shortcut sets in $n$-node, $m$-edge directed graphs, and show improved bounds and new reductions for various settings of these problems. Our first set of results is about exact and approximate distance preservers. We give the following bounds on the size of directed distance preservers with $p$ demand pairs: 1) $\tilde{O}(n^{5/6}p^{2/3} + n)$ edges for exact distance preservers in unweighted graphs; and 2) $\Omega(n^{2/3}p^{2/3})$ edges for approximate distance preservers with any given finite stretch, in graphs with arbitrary aspect ratio.
  Additionally, we establish a new directed-to-undirected reduction for exact distance preservers. We show that if undirected distance preservers have size $O(n^{\lambda}p^{\mu} + n)$ for constants $\lambda, \mu &gt; 0$, then directed distance preservers have size $O\left( n^{\frac{1}{2-\lambda}}p^{\frac{1+\mu-\lambda}{2-\lambda}} + n^{1/2}p + n\right).$ As a consequence of the reduction, if current upper bounds for undirected preservers can be improved for some $p \leq n$, then so can current upper bounds for directed preservers.
  Our second set of results is about directed hopsets and shortcut sets. For hopsets in directed graphs, we prove that the hopbound is: 1) $\Omega(n^{2/9})$ for $O(m)$-size shortcut sets, improving the previous $\Omega(n^{1/5})$ bound [Vassilevska Williams, Xu and Xu, SODA 2024]; 2) $\Omega(n^{2/7})$ for $O(m)$-size exact hopsets in unweighted graphs, improving the previous $\Omega(n^{1/4})$ bound [Bodwin and Hoppenworth, FOCS 2023]; and 3) $\Omega(n^{1/2})$ for $O(n)$-size approximate hopsets with any given finite stretch, in graphs with arbitrary aspect ratio. This result establishes a separation between this setting and $O(n)$-size approximate hopsets for graphs with polynomial aspect ratio, which have hopbound $\widetilde{O}(n^{1/3})$ [Bernstein and Wein, SODA 2023].</description>

      <title>Improved Approximations for Stationary Bipartite Matching: Beyond Probabilistic Independence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study stationary online bipartite matching, where both types of nodes--offline and online--arrive according to Poisson processes. Offline nodes wait to be matched for some random time, determined by an exponential distribution, while online nodes need to be matched immediately. This model captures scenarios such as deceased organ donation and time-sensitive task assignments, where there is an inflow of patients and workers (offline nodes) with limited patience, while organs and tasks (online nodes) must be assigned upon arrival.
  We present an efficient online algorithm that achieves a $(1-1/e+\delta)$-approximation to the optimal online policy's reward for a constant $\delta &gt; 0$, simplifying and improving previous work by Aouad and Sarita\c{c} (2022). Our solution combines recent online matching techniques, particularly pivotal sampling, which enables correlated rounding of tighter linear programming approximations, and a greedy-like algorithm. A key technical component is the analysis of a stochastic process that exploits subtle correlations between offline nodes, using renewal theory. A byproduct of our result is an improvement to the best-known competitive ratio--that compares an algorithm's performance to the optimal offline policy--via a $(1-1/\sqrt{e} + \eta)$-competitive algorithm for a universal constant $\eta &gt; 0$, advancing the results of Patel and Wajc (2024).</description>

      <title>Learning-Augmented Algorithms for Online Concave Packing and Convex Covering Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning-augmented algorithms have been extensively studied across the computer science community in the recent years, driven by advances in machine learning predictors, which can provide additional information to augment classical algorithms. Such predictions are especially powerful in the context of online problems, where decisions have to be made without knowledge of the future, and which traditionally exhibits impossibility results bounding the performance of any online algorithm. The study of learning-augmented algorithms thus aims to use external advice prudently, to overcome classical impossibility results when the advice is accurate, and still perform comparably to the state-of-the-art online algorithms even when the advice is inaccurate.
  In this paper, we present learning-augmented algorithmic frameworks for two fundamental optimizations settings, extending and generalizing prior works. For online packing with concave objectives, we present a simple but overarching strategy that switches between the advice and the state-of-the-art online algorithm. For online covering with convex objectives, we greatly extend primal-dual methods for online convex covering programs by Azar et al. (FOCS 2016) and previous learning-augmented framework for online covering linear programs from the literature, to many new applications. We show that our algorithms break impossibility results when the advice is accurate, while maintaining comparable performance with state-of-the-art classical online algorithms even when the advice is erroneous.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Analysis of Byte-Pair Encoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) is a widely used method for subword tokenization, with origins in grammar-based text compression. It is employed in a variety of language processing tasks such as machine translation or large language model (LLM) pretraining, to create a token dictionary of a prescribed size. Most evaluations of BPE to date are empirical, and the reasons for its good practical performance are not well understood.
  In this paper we focus on the optimization problem underlying BPE: finding a pair encoding that achieves optimal compression utility. We show that this problem is APX-complete, indicating that it is unlikely to admit a polynomial-time approximation scheme. This answers, in a stronger form, a question recently raised by Zouhar et al.
  On the positive side, we show that BPE approximates the compression utility of the optimal pair encoding to a worst-case factor between $0.333$ and $0.625$. Our results aim to explain the ongoing success of BPE and are, to our knowledge, the first rigorous guarantees on its compression utility that hold for all inputs.</description>

      <title>Optimal Oblivious Subspace Embeddings with Near-optimal Sparsity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An oblivious subspace embedding is a random $m\times n$ matrix $\Pi$ such that, for any $d$-dimensional subspace, with high probability $\Pi$ preserves the norms of all vectors in that subspace within a $1\pm\epsilon$ factor. In this work, we give an oblivious subspace embedding with the optimal dimension $m=\Theta(d/\epsilon^2)$ that has a near-optimal sparsity of $\tilde O(1/\epsilon)$ non-zero entries per column of $\Pi$. This is the first result to nearly match the conjecture of Nelson and Nguyen [FOCS 2013] in terms of the best sparsity attainable by an optimal oblivious subspace embedding, improving on a prior bound of $\tilde O(1/\epsilon^6)$ non-zeros per column [Chenakkod et al., STOC 2024]. We further extend our approach to the non-oblivious setting, proposing a new family of Leverage Score Sparsified embeddings with Independent Columns, which yield faster runtimes for matrix approximation and regression tasks.
  In our analysis, we develop a new method which uses a decoupling argument together with the cumulant method for bounding the edge universality error of isotropic random matrices. To achieve near-optimal sparsity, we combine this general-purpose approach with new traces inequalities that leverage the specific structure of our subspace embedding construction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work concerns an alignment problem that has applications in many geospatial problems such as resource allocation and building reliable disease maps. Here, we introduce the problem of optimally aligning $k$ collections of $m$ spatial supports over $n$ spatial units in a $d$-dimensional Euclidean space. We show that the 1-dimensional case is solvable in time polynomial in $k$, $m$ and $n$. We then show that the 2-dimensional case is NP-hard for 2 collections of 2 supports. Finally, we devise a heuristic for aligning a set of collections in the 2-dimensional case.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Matching via In-n-Out Local Computation Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider the following stochastic matching problem. Given a graph $G=(V, E)$, an unknown subgraph $G_p = (V, E_p)$ is realized where $E_p$ includes every edge of $E$ independently with some probability $p \in (0, 1]$. The goal is to query a sparse subgraph $H$ of $G$, such that the realized edges in $H$ include an approximate maximum matching of $G_p$.
  This problem has been studied extensively over the last decade due to its numerous applications in kidney exchange, online dating, and online labor markets. For any fixed $\epsilon &gt; 0$, [BDH STOC'20] showed that any graph $G$ has a subgraph $H$ with $\text{quasipoly}(1/p) = (1/p)^{\text{poly}(\log(1/p))}$ maximum degree, achieving a $(1-\epsilon)$-approximation. A major open question is the best approximation achievable with $\text{poly}(1/p)$-degree subgraphs. A long line of work has progressively improved the approximation in the $\text{poly}(1/p)$-degree regime from .5 [BDH+ EC'15] to .501 [AKL EC'17], .656 [BHFR SODA'19], .666 [AB SOSA'19], .731 [BBD SODA'22] (bipartite graphs), and most recently to .68 [DS '24]. In this work, we show that a $\text{poly}(1/p)$-degree subgraph can obtain a $(1-\epsilon)$-approximation for any desirably small fixed $\epsilon &gt; 0$, achieving the best of both worlds.
  Beyond its quantitative improvement, a key conceptual contribution of our work is to connect local computation algorithms (LCAs) to the stochastic matching problem for the first time. While prior work on LCAs mainly focuses on their out-queries (the number of vertices probed to produce the output of a given vertex), our analysis also bounds the in-queries (the number of vertices that probe a given vertex). We prove that the outputs of LCAs with bounded in- and out-queries (in-n-out LCAs for short) have limited correlation, a property that our analysis crucially relies on and might find applications beyond stochastic matchings.</description>

      <title>Communication Efficient Decentralization for Smoothed Online Convex Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the multi-agent Smoothed Online Convex Optimization (SOCO) problem, where $N$ agents interact through a communication graph. In each round, each agent $i$ receives a strongly convex hitting cost function $f^i_t$ in an online fashion and selects an action $x^i_t \in \mathbb{R}^d$. The objective is to minimize the global cumulative cost, which includes the sum of individual hitting costs $f^i_t(x^i_t)$, a temporal "switching cost" for changing decisions, and a spatial "dissimilarity cost" that penalizes deviations in decisions among neighboring agents. We propose the first decentralized algorithm for multi-agent SOCO and prove its asymptotic optimality. Our approach allows each agent to operate using only local information from its immediate neighbors in the graph. For finite-time performance, we establish that the optimality gap in competitive ratio decreases with the time horizon $T$ and can be conveniently tuned based on the per-round computation available to each agent. Moreover, our results hold even when the communication graph changes arbitrarily and adaptively over time. Finally, we establish that the computational complexity per round depends only logarithmically on the number of agents and almost linearly on their degree within the graph, ensuring scalability for large-system implementations.</description>

Abstract: We study the problem of tolerant testing of stabilizer states. In particular, we give the first such algorithm that accepts mixed state inputs. Formally, given a mixed state $\rho$ that either has fidelity at least $\varepsilon_1$ with some stabilizer pure state or fidelity at most $\varepsilon_2$ with all such states, where $\varepsilon_2 \leq \varepsilon_1^{O(1)}$, our algorithm distinguishes the two cases with sample complexity $\text{poly}(1/\varepsilon_1)$ and time complexity $O(n \cdot \text{poly}(1/\varepsilon_1))$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2012.08476v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A path graph is the intersection graph of paths in a tree. A directed path graph is the intersection graph of paths in a directed tree. Even if path graphs and directed path graphs are characterized very similarly, their recognition algorithms differ widely. We further unify these two graph classes by presenting the first recognition algorithm for both path graphs and directed path graphs. We deeply use a recent characterization of path graphs, and we extend it to directed path graphs. Our algorithm does not require complex data structures and has an easy and intuitive implementation, simplifying recognition algorithms for both graph classes.</description>

      <title>Small Space Encoding and Recognition of $k$-Palindromic Prefixes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03309v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Palindromes are non-empty strings that read the same forward and backward. The problem of recognizing strings that can be represented as the concatenation of even-length palindromes, the concatenation of palindromes of length greater than one, and the concatenation of exactly $k$ palindromes was introduced in the seminal paper of Knuth, Morris, and Pratt [SIAM J. Comput., 1977].
  In this work, we study the problem of recognizing so-called $k$-palindromic strings, which can be represented as the concatenation of exactly $k$ palindromes. It was shown that the problem is solvable in linear space and time [Rubinchik and Schur, MFCS'2020]. We aim to develop a sublinear-space solution, and show the following results:
  (1) First, we show a structural characterization of the set of all $k$-palindromic prefixes of a string by representing it as a union of a small number of highly structured string sets, called affine prefix sets. We show that the size of this representation is of the right asymptotic form by constructing an almost matching lower bound.
  (2) Secondly, we derive a read-only algorithm that, given a string $T$ of length $n$ and an integer $k$, computes a compact representation of the $i$-palindromic prefixes of $T$, for all $1 \le i \le k$.
  (3) Finally, we also give a read-only algorithm for computing the palindromic length of $T$, which is the smallest $\ell$ such that $T$ is $\ell$-palindromic, given that $\ell \le k$.
  The algorithms use $\mathcal O(n \cdot 6^{k^2} \cdot \log^k n)$ time and $\mathcal O(6^{k^2} \cdot \log^k n)$ space. Our work is the first step toward a streaming algorithm for the recognition of $k$-palindromic prefixes.</description>

      <title>Vizing's Theorem in Near-Linear Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05240v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vizing's theorem states that any $n$-vertex $m$-edge graph of maximum degree $\Delta$ can be edge colored using at most $\Delta + 1$ different colors [Vizing, 1964]. Vizing's original proof is algorithmic and shows that such an edge coloring can be found in $O(mn)$ time. This was subsequently improved to $\tilde O(m\sqrt{n})$ time, independently by [Arjomandi, 1982] and by [Gabow et al., 1985].
  Very recently, independently and concurrently, using randomization, this runtime bound was further improved to $\tilde{O}(n^2)$ by [Assadi, 2024] and $\tilde O(mn^{1/3})$ by [Bhattacharya, Carmon, Costa, Solomon and Zhang, 2024] (and subsequently to $\tilde O(mn^{1/4})$ time by [Bhattacharya, Costa, Solomon and Zhang, 2024]).
  In this paper, we present a randomized algorithm that computes a $(\Delta+1)$-edge coloring in near-linear time -- in fact, only $O(m\log{\Delta})$ time -- with high probability, giving a near-optimal algorithm for this fundamental problem.</description>

      <title>Log-concave Sampling from a Convex Body with a Barrier: a Robust and Unified Dikin Walk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05700v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of sampling from a $d$-dimensional log-concave distribution $\pi(\theta) \propto \exp(-f(\theta))$ for $L$-Lipschitz $f$, constrained to a convex body with an efficiently computable self-concordant barrier function, contained in a ball of radius $R$ with a $w$-warm start.
  We propose a \emph{robust} sampling framework that computes spectral approximations to the Hessian of the barrier functions in each iteration. We prove that for polytopes that are described by $n$ hyperplanes, sampling with the Lee-Sidford barrier function mixes within $\widetilde O((d^2+dL^2R^2)\log(w/\delta))$ steps with a per step cost of $\widetilde O(nd^{\omega-1})$, where $\omega\approx 2.37$ is the fast matrix multiplication exponent. Compared to the prior work of Mangoubi and Vishnoi, our approach gives faster mixing time as we are able to design a generalized soft-threshold Dikin walk beyond log-barrier.
  We further extend our result to show how to sample from a $d$-dimensional spectrahedron, the constrained set of a semidefinite program, specified by the set $\{x\in \mathbb{R}^d: \sum_{i=1}^d x_i A_i \succeq C \}$ where $A_1,\ldots,A_d, C$ are $n\times n$ real symmetric matrices. We design a walk that mixes in $\widetilde O((nd+dL^2R^2)\log(w/\delta))$ steps with a per iteration cost of $\widetilde O(n^\omega+n^2d^{3\omega-5})$. We improve the mixing time bound of prior best Dikin walk due to Narayanan and Rakhlin that mixes in $\widetilde O((n^2d^3+n^2dL^2R^2)\log(w/\delta))$ steps.</description>

      <title>Overcoming Non-Submodularity: Constant Approximation for Network Immunization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19205v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a network with an ongoing epidemic, the network immunization problem seeks to identify a fixed number of nodes to immunize in order to maximize the number of infections prevented. One of the fundamental computational challenges in network immunization is that the objective function is generally neither submodular nor supermodular. As a result, no efficient algorithm is known to consistently find a solution with a constant approximation guarantee. Traditionally, this problem is addressed using proxy objectives, which offer better approximation properties. However, converting to these indirect optimizations often introduces losses in effectiveness. In this paper, we overcome these fundamental barriers by utilizing the underlying stochastic structures of the diffusion process. Similar to the traditional influence objective, the immunization objective is an expectation that can be expressed as the sum of objectives over deterministic instances. However, unlike the former, some of these terms are not submodular. The key step is proving that this sum has a bounded deviation from submodularity, thereby enabling the greedy algorithm to achieve constant factor approximation. We show that this approximation still stands considering a variety of immunization settings and spread models.</description>

      <title>Fine-grained Meta-Theorems for Vertex Integrity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.10333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.10333v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vertex Integrity is a graph measure which sits squarely between two more well-studied notions, namely vertex cover and tree-depth, and that has recently gained attention as a structural graph parameter. In this paper we investigate the algorithmic trade-offs involved with this parameter from the point of view of algorithmic meta-theorems for First-Order (FO) and Monadic Second Order (MSO) logic. Our positive results are the following: (i) given a graph $G$ of vertex integrity $k$ and an FO formula $\phi$ with $q$ quantifiers, deciding if $G$ satisfies $\phi$ can be done in time $2^{O(k^2q+q\log q)}+n^{O(1)}$; (ii) for MSO formulas with $q$ quantifiers, the same can be done in time $2^{2^{O(k^2+kq)}}+n^{O(1)}$. Both results are obtained using kernelization arguments, which pre-process the input to sizes $2^{O(k^2)}q$ and $2^{O(k^2+kq)}$ respectively.
  The complexities of our meta-theorems are significantly better than the corresponding meta-theorems for tree-depth, which involve towers of exponentials. However, they are worse than the roughly $2^{O(kq)}$ and $2^{2^{O(k+q)}}$ complexities known for corresponding meta-theorems for vertex cover. To explain this deterioration we present two formula constructions which lead to fine-grained complexity lower bounds and establish that the dependence of our meta-theorems on $k$ is the best possible. More precisely, we show that it is not possible to decide FO formulas with $q$ quantifiers in time $2^{o(k^2q)}$, and that there exists a constant-size MSO formula which cannot be decided in time $2^{2^{o(k^2)}}$, both under the ETH. Hence, the quadratic blow-up in the dependence on $k$ is unavoidable and vertex integrity has a complexity for FO and MSO logic which is truly intermediate between vertex cover and tree-depth.</description>

      <title>An Edge-Based Decomposition Framework for Temporal Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.11843v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A temporal network is a dynamic graph where every edge is assigned an integer time label that indicates at which discrete time step the edge is available. We consider the problem of hierarchically decomposing the network and introduce an edge-based decomposition framework that unifies the core and truss decompositions for temporal networks while allowing us to consider the network's temporal dimension. Based on our new framework, we introduce the $(k,\Delta)$-core and $(k,\Delta)$-truss decompositions, which are generalizations of the classic $k$-core and $k$-truss decompositions for multigraphs. Moreover, we show how $(k,\Delta)$-cores and $(k,\Delta)$-trusses can be efficiently further decomposed to obtain spatially and temporally connected components. We evaluate the characteristics of our new decompositions and the efficiency of our algorithms. Moreover, we demonstrate how our $(k,\Delta)$-decompositions can be applied to analyze malicious content in a Twitter network to obtain insights that state-of-the-art baselines cannot obtain.</description>

      <title>Fast relaxation of the random field Ising dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06171v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the convergence properties of Glauber dynamics for the random field Ising model (RFIM) with ferromagnetic interactions on finite domains of $\mathbb{Z}^d$, $d \ge 2$. Of particular interest is the Griffiths phase where correlations decay exponentially fast in expectation over the quenched disorder, but there exist arbitrarily large islands of weak fields where low-temperature behavior is observed. Our results are twofold:
  1. Under weak spatial mixing (boundary-to-bulk exponential decay of correlations) in expectation, we show that the dynamics satisfy a weak Poincar\'e inequality implying algebraic relaxation to equilibrium over timescales polynomial in the volume $N$ of the domain, and polynomial time mixing from a warm start. From this we construct a polynomial-time approximate sampling algorithm based on running Glauber dynamics over an increasing sequence of approximations of the domain.
  2. Under strong spatial mixing (exponential decay of correlations even near boundary pinnings) in expectation, we prove a full Poincar\'e inequality, implying exponential relaxation to equilibrium and $N^{o(1)}$-mixing time. Note by way of example, both weak and strong spatial mixing hold at any temperature, provided the external fields are strong enough.
  Our proofs combine a stochastic localization technique which has the effect of increasing the variance of the field, with a field-dependent coarse graining which controls the resulting sub-critical percolation process of sites with weak fields.</description>
