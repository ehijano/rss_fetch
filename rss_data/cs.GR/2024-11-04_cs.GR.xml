      <title>Two Dimensional Hidden Surface Removal with Frame-to-frame Coherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe a hidden surface removal algorithm for two-dimensional layered scenes built from arbitrary primitives, particularly suited to interaction and animation in rich scenes (for example, in illustration). The method makes use of a set-based raster representation to implement a front-to-back rendering model which analyses and dramatically reduces the amount of rasterization and composition required to render a scene. The method is extended to add frame-to-frame coherence analysis and caching for interactive or animated scenes. A powerful system of primitive-combiners called filters is described, which preserves the efficiencies of the algorithm in highly complicated scenes. The set representation is extended to solve the problem of correlated mattes, leading to an efficient solution for high quality antialiasing. A prototype implementation has been prepared.</description>

      <title>All-frequency Full-body Human Image Relighting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relighting of human images enables post-photography editing of lighting effects in portraits. The current mainstream approach uses neural networks to approximate lighting effects without explicitly accounting for the principle of physical shading. As a result, it often has difficulty representing high-frequency shadows and shading. In this paper, we propose a two-stage relighting method that can reproduce physically-based shadows and shading from low to high frequencies. The key idea is to approximate an environment light source with a set of a fixed number of area light sources. The first stage employs supervised inverse rendering from a single image using neural networks and calculates physically-based shading. The second stage then calculates shadow for each area light and sums up to render the final image. We propose to make soft shadow mapping differentiable for the area-light approximation of environment lighting. We demonstrate that our method can plausibly reproduce all-frequency shadows and shading caused by environment illumination, which have been difficult to reproduce using existing methods.</description>

      <title>Self-Ensembling Gaussian Splatting for Few-shot Novel View Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated remarkable effectiveness for novel view synthesis (NVS). However, the 3DGS model tends to overfit when trained with sparse posed views, limiting its generalization capacity for broader pose variations. In this paper, we alleviate the overfitting problem by introducing a self-ensembling Gaussian Splatting (SE-GS) approach. We present two Gaussian Splatting models named the $\mathbf{\Sigma}$-model and the $\mathbf{\Delta}$-model. The $\mathbf{\Sigma}$-model serves as the primary model that generates novel-view images during inference. At the training stage, the $\mathbf{\Sigma}$-model is guided away from specific local optima by an uncertainty-aware perturbing strategy. We dynamically perturb the $\mathbf{\Delta}$-model based on the uncertainties of novel-view renderings across different training steps, resulting in diverse temporal models sampled from the Gaussian parameter space without additional training costs. The geometry of the $\mathbf{\Sigma}$-model is regularized by penalizing discrepancies between the $\mathbf{\Sigma}$-model and the temporal samples. Therefore, our SE-GS conducts an effective and efficient regularization across a large number of Gaussian Splatting models, resulting in a robust ensemble, the $\mathbf{\Sigma}$-model. Experimental results on the LLFF, Mip-NeRF360, DTU, and MVImgNet datasets show that our approach improves NVS quality with few-shot training views, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods. The code is released at https://github.com/sailor-z/SE-GS.</description>

      <title>StyleTex: Style Image-Guided Texture Generation for 3D Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Style-guided texture generation aims to generate a texture that is harmonious with both the style of the reference image and the geometry of the input mesh, given a reference style image and a 3D mesh with its text description. Although diffusion-based 3D texture generation methods, such as distillation sampling, have numerous promising applications in stylized games and films, it requires addressing two challenges: 1) decouple style and content completely from the reference image for 3D models, and 2) align the generated texture with the color tone, style of the reference image, and the given text prompt. To this end, we introduce StyleTex, an innovative diffusion-model-based framework for creating stylized textures for 3D models. Our key insight is to decouple style information from the reference image while disregarding content in diffusion-based distillation sampling. Specifically, given a reference image, we first decompose its style feature from the image CLIP embedding by subtracting the embedding's orthogonal projection in the direction of the content feature, which is represented by a text CLIP embedding. Our novel approach to disentangling the reference image's style and content information allows us to generate distinct style and content features. We then inject the style feature into the cross-attention mechanism to incorporate it into the generation process, while utilizing the content feature as a negative prompt to further dissociate content information. Finally, we incorporate these strategies into StyleTex to obtain stylized textures. The resulting textures generated by StyleTex retain the style of the reference image, while also aligning with the text prompts and intrinsic details of the given 3D mesh. Quantitative and qualitative experiments show that our method outperforms existing baseline methods by a significant margin.</description>

      <title>Towards High-fidelity Head Blending with Chroma Keying for Industrial Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce an industrial Head Blending pipeline for the task of seamlessly integrating an actor's head onto a target body in digital content creation. The key challenge stems from discrepancies in head shape and hair structure, which lead to unnatural boundaries and blending artifacts. Existing methods treat foreground and background as a single task, resulting in suboptimal blending quality. To address this problem, we propose CHANGER, a novel pipeline that decouples background integration from foreground blending. By utilizing chroma keying for artifact-free background generation and introducing Head shape and long Hair augmentation ($H^2$ augmentation) to simulate a wide range of head shapes and hair styles, CHANGER improves generalization on innumerable various real-world cases. Furthermore, our Foreground Predictive Attention Transformer (FPAT) module enhances foreground blending by predicting and focusing on key head and body regions. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our CHANGER outperforms state-of-the-art methods, delivering high-fidelity, industrial-grade results.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14903v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel framework to explore neural control and design of complex fluidic systems with dynamic solid boundaries. Our system features a fast differentiable Navier-Stokes solver with solid-fluid interface handling, a low-dimensional differentiable parametric geometry representation, a control-shape co-design algorithm, and gym-like simulation environments to facilitate various fluidic control design applications. Additionally, we present a benchmark of design, control, and learning tasks on high-fidelity, high-resolution dynamic fluid environments that pose challenges for existing differentiable fluid simulators. These tasks include designing the control of artificial hearts, identifying robotic end-effector shapes, and controlling a fluid gate. By seamlessly incorporating our differentiable fluid simulator into a learning framework, we demonstrate successful design, control, and learning results that surpass gradient-free solutions in these benchmark tasks.</description>

      <title>Conditional GAN for Enhancing Diffusion Models in Efficient and Authentic Global Gesture Generation from Audios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20359v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Audio-driven simultaneous gesture generation is vital for human-computer communication, AI games, and film production. While previous research has shown promise, there are still limitations. Methods based on VAEs are accompanied by issues of local jitter and global instability, whereas methods based on diffusion models are hampered by low generation efficiency. This is because the denoising process of DDPM in the latter relies on the assumption that the noise added at each step is sampled from a unimodal distribution, and the noise values are small. DDIM borrows the idea from the Euler method for solving differential equations, disrupts the Markov chain process, and increases the noise step size to reduce the number of denoising steps, thereby accelerating generation. However, simply increasing the step size during the step-by-step denoising process causes the results to gradually deviate from the original data distribution, leading to a significant drop in the quality of the generated actions and the emergence of unnatural artifacts. In this paper, we break the assumptions of DDPM and achieves breakthrough progress in denoising speed and fidelity. Specifically, we introduce a conditional GAN to capture audio control signals and implicitly match the multimodal denoising distribution between the diffusion and denoising steps within the same sampling step, aiming to sample larger noise values and apply fewer denoising steps for high-speed generation.</description>

      <title>NASM: Neural Anisotropic Surface Meshing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23109v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new learning-based method, NASM, for anisotropic surface meshing. Our key idea is to propose a graph neural network to embed an input mesh into a high-dimensional (high-d) Euclidean embedding space to preserve curvature-based anisotropic metric by using a dot product loss between high-d edge vectors. This can dramatically reduce the computational time and increase the scalability. Then, we propose a novel feature-sensitive remeshing on the generated high-d embedding to automatically capture sharp geometric features. We define a high-d normal metric, and then derive an automatic differentiation on a high-d centroidal Voronoi tessellation (CVT) optimization with the normal metric to simultaneously preserve geometric features and curvature anisotropy that exhibit in the original 3D shapes. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a deep learning framework and a large dataset are proposed to construct a high-d Euclidean embedding space for 3D anisotropic surface meshing. Experimental results are evaluated and compared with the state-of-the-art in anisotropic surface meshing on a large number of surface models from Thingi10K dataset as well as tested on extensive unseen 3D shapes from Multi-Garment Network dataset and FAUST human dataset.</description>

      <title>In-Context LoRA for Diffusion Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23775v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent research arXiv:2410.15027 has explored the use of diffusion transformers (DiTs) for task-agnostic image generation by simply concatenating attention tokens across images. However, despite substantial computational resources, the fidelity of the generated images remains suboptimal. In this study, we reevaluate and streamline this framework by hypothesizing that text-to-image DiTs inherently possess in-context generation capabilities, requiring only minimal tuning to activate them. Through diverse task experiments, we qualitatively demonstrate that existing text-to-image DiTs can effectively perform in-context generation without any tuning. Building on this insight, we propose a remarkably simple pipeline to leverage the in-context abilities of DiTs: (1) concatenate images instead of tokens, (2) perform joint captioning of multiple images, and (3) apply task-specific LoRA tuning using small datasets (e.g., $20\sim 100$ samples) instead of full-parameter tuning with large datasets. We name our models In-Context LoRA (IC-LoRA). This approach requires no modifications to the original DiT models, only changes to the training data. Remarkably, our pipeline generates high-fidelity image sets that better adhere to prompts. While task-specific in terms of tuning data, our framework remains task-agnostic in architecture and pipeline, offering a powerful tool for the community and providing valuable insights for further research on product-level task-agnostic generation systems. We release our code, data, and models at https://github.com/ali-vilab/In-Context-LoRA</description>
