      <title>Twisting BFSS &amp; IKKT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note we initiate the study of ``twisted holography'' for the dualities involving the BFSS matrix quantum mechanics and the IKKT matrix model in their $N \rightarrow \infty$ limits. We identify the admissible twists of each model, compute their cohomology in the BV-BRST formalism, and identify them -- in the planar limit and in perturbation theory around the trivial background -- with corresponding twists of IIA and IIB string theories, respectively. The twisted gravitational duals make manifest certain infinite dimensional symmetry algebras. In the BFSS example, the dual IIA supergravity twists are also obtained as certain zero mode truncations of the minimal (1/16-BPS) and maximal (1/4-BPS) twists of eleven-dimensional supergravity.</description>

      <title>Resurgence in the Virasoro Minimal String and 3d Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute non-perturbative, resurgent contributions to the Virasoro minimal string and 3d gravity using techniques from hermitian matrix models. In particular, we construct a fully non-perturbative partition function for the Virasoro minimal string in terms of a Zak transform. In this context, negative tension D-branes appear naturally, which in the matrix model correspond to anti-eigenvalues, or instantons on the involuted sheet of the spectral curve. We further extend this analysis to resolvents and observe resurgent wall crossing phenomena between ZZ- and FZZT-branes. Using recent results that relate the Virasoro minimal string to 3d gravity with end-of-the-world branes we proceed to study the resurgent consequences of summing over the genus in 3d gravity, where we find non-perturbative contributions of doubly exponential type. These statements are then tested using resurgent large-order asymptotics. Lastly, we compute the non-perturbative eigenvalue density for generic hermitian matrix models and identify the change of asymptotic behavior at the edge of the eigenvalue distribution with a Stokes transition. This allows us to identify oscillations in the eigenvalue density with anti-Stokes behavior of FZZT-branes. In the case of 3d gravity with end-of-the-world branes we comment how this Stokes transition coincides with the onset of black hole behaviour and compute the non-perturbative primary density. Furthermore, we apply these techniques to the eigenvalue density of JT gravity to compute higher genus corrections.</description>

      <title>Strings on freely acting orbifolds: Spectra, moduli spaces and branes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this dissertation, we study various aspects of type IIB string theory compactified on freely acting orbifolds. We focus particularly on asymmetric orbifolds, which are examples of non-geometric string compactifications and constitute an intriguing corner in the string landscape. We describe the orbifolds using two complementary approaches; the duality twists and the lattice approach. First, we discuss the general construction of freely acting (asymmetric) orbifolds, focusing on the closed string sector. Afterwards, we present explicit examples of orbifolds preserving $\mathcal{N} = 6,4,2$ or $0$ supersymmetry in five dimensions and we demonstrate the connection between freely acting orbifolds and Scherk-Schwarz reductions by matching the lightest untwisted orbifold states with those arising form the effective supergravity theory. Regarding the orbifold twisted sectors, we show that at special points in the moduli space, generically massive states can become massless. Furthermore, we show that the spectrum of non-supersymmetric orbifolds can become tachyon-free away from special loci in the moduli space. Next, we turn our attention to the orbifold moduli space, and we focus on orbifolds preserving $\mathcal{N} = 2$ supersymmetry in five dimensions, for which we determine the classical hypermultiplet and vector multiplet moduli spaces. Moreover, by constructing dual orbifold pairs, we argue that no quantum corrections to the metric on the vector multiplet moduli space arise. Then, we discuss aspects of the swampland program in the context of freely acting asymmetric orbifolds and we verify that the swampland distance conjecture is valid in the non-geometric compactifications of string theory studied in this thesis. Finally, we focus on the D-brane spectrum of freely acting orbifolds and we determine the conditions under which the various D-branes survive the orbifolding.</description>

      <title>Continuous symmetries and charge measurement of boundary operators in holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study holographic charge measurement for continuous internal symmetries. Charged boundary operators are characterized by Wilson lines of bulk gauge fields ending on the boundary, while charge measurement is performed using U-shaped defects hanging from the boundary. We derive universal features of this process from a low-energy point of view, and show how the hanging defect picture mimics the thickening regularization of continuous symmetry operators in field theory. Furthermore, we provide explicit top-down realizations in AdS/CFT setups in Type IIB string theory and M-theory, featuring Abelian as well as non-Abelian symmetries. In the case of Type IIB constructions, we analyze the brane dynamics underlying the charge measurement process. Along the way, we also characterize how hanging brane configurations can be regarded as being topological, and demonstrate how tachyon dynamics account for their fusion rules.</description>

      <title>Self-Dual Gauge Fields from Superstring Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The action for self-dual gauge fields that emerges from the recently constructed superstring field theory is found. The new superstring field theory reduces to that of Sen in a certain limit, and in this limit the new action for self-dual gauge fields reduces to Sen's action for such fields. The theory describes two decoupled self-dual gauge fields that couple to two metrics, with each gauge field coupling to only one of the metrics. The action also features a background metric, and the non-linear coupling to these three metrics is non-standard. There are two spin-two gauge invariances, and diffeomorphisms arise from the diagonal subgroup.</description>

      <title>Three-Dimensional Modified Klein--Gordon Oscillator in Standard and Generalized Doubly Special Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Doubly Special Relativity (DSR) augments special relativity by introducing, alongside the invariant speed of light $c$, a second observer-independent scale typically associated with the Planck regime. At the level of effective wave equations this principle manifests itself through deformed dispersion relations and energy-dependent spatial operators. Here we quantify such effects in a prototypical exactly solvable bound-state problem: the three-dimensional Klein--Gordon oscillator generated by a non-minimal momentum coupling that yields isotropic harmonic confinement while preserving rotational symmetry. We analyze two standard DSR realizations (Amelino--Camelia and Magueijo--Smolin, parametrized by an invariant energy scale $k$) as well as a generalized DSR framework based on a first-order expansion in the Planck length $l_p$. After stationary reduction and separation in spherical coordinates, the eigenfunctions retain the generalized-Laguerre and spherical-harmonic structure of the undeformed oscillator, whereas DSR deforms the algebraic quantization condition that relates the principal oscillator number $N=2n+\ell\in\mathbb{N}_0$ to the relativistic energy. Closed-form spectra are obtained for the standard DSR cases, and perturbative Planck-suppressed shifts are derived for the generalized model. In all realizations the deformation induces branch-dependent shifts of both positive- and negative-energy solutions, which increase with excitation and vanish smoothly in the limits $k\to\infty$ or $l_p\to0$. The main goal of this paper is to extract analytic spectra and Planck-suppressed shifts that enable a direct comparison between different DSR prescriptions in a fully three-dimensional setting.</description>

      <title>Higher dualities in E11 exceptional field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been conjectured that there exists an E11-invariant formulation of eleven-dimensional supergravity in which the propagating fields of the theory are realised through an infinite tower of higher duals. In this work, we prove this conjecture explicitly within E11 exceptional field theory at the linearised level. Starting from the pseudo-Lagrangian, we construct parent actions for all higher gradient dual fields that are associated with the three-form, the six-form, and the dual graviton. We show that the resulting Euler-Lagrange equations constrain the Stueckelberg fields to be pure curls, ensuring that the higher duals propagate the same physical degrees of freedom as the original supergravity fields. The additional Stueckelberg fields, which are not predicted by the tensor hierarchy algebra, are shown to play a specific role as sources for the Labastida tensors of the higher dual fields.</description>

      <title>A Perfectoid Duality Between M-Theory and F-Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a non-singular, definition-level formulation of F-theory by replacing the traditional shrinking-fiber limit of M-theory with compactification on a tower-completed circle described using perfectoid geometry and condensed mathematics. This construction provides an intrinsic eleven-dimensional carrier for modular data and admits a canonical tilting and comparison procedure that yields elliptic geometry as an output rather than an auxiliary input. Using this framework, we establish a precise M-theory/Type IIB dictionary in the constant-coupling sector, showing how the physical axio-dilaton is fixed by eleven-dimensional geometric and topological data. The correspondence is tested at the level of the ten-dimensional bosonic effective action, including its topological couplings inherited from eleven dimensions. The tower-completed geometry naturally organizes global sectors in generalized cohomology, with charge data governed by K-theory and exhibiting a canonical prime-power torsion structure. We further show how this framework extends to varying-coupling backgrounds and duality defects, admits a natural adelic completion with prime-independence, and generalizes to higher-rank and U-duality geometries. We also discuss holographic aspects and the anomaly-refined extension of the duality group beyond the bosonic truncation. Together, these results provide a coherent, non-singular foundation for F-theory and its extensions.</description>

      <title>Geodesic equation in noncommutative space: a field theory perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the geodesic equation for point particles propagating in Moyal-type noncommutative spacetimes using a field-theoretic approach based on the quasi-classical limit of the noncommutative Klein-Gordon equation. Starting from a twisted-geometric construction of the covariant Laplace-Beltrami operator, we obtain the noncommutative Hamilton-Jacobi equation and show that all noncommutative effects are absorbed into an effective, position-dependent mass function $M(x)$ appearing in an otherwise standard relativistic dispersion relation. The corresponding particle dynamics then acquires an additional term in the geodesic equation that takes the form of a fixed external force $F_{\text{NC}}^\mu = -\frac{1}{2} g^{\mu\nu}\partial_\nu M^2(x)$, sourced entirely by the quantum nature of spacetime. We compute this effective mass perturbatively up to fourth order in the noncommutativity parameter for a general metric, proving that all odd-order corrections vanish identically. For the specific case of an $(r-\theta)$ twist applied to spherically symmetric backgrounds, we obtain explicit expressions demonstrating that the leading correction to geodesic motion appears at $\Theta^2$ order and is proportional to the probe particle's mass, while massless particles remain unaffected.</description>

      <title>Magnetized BPS lumps in the $CP^1$ model with Maxwell coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate Bogomolnyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) topological configurations in the $CP^1$ model minimally coupled to a Maxwell gauge field. Starting from the nonlinear $O(3)$ sigma model, we explicitly construct its classical mapping to the $CP^1$ formulation, emphasizing the emergence of a local $U(1)$ gauge symmetry intrinsically linked to the Fubini-Study target-space geometry. Focusing on the static sector, we analyze magnetized BPS lump configurations. By examining the topological boundary conditions, we show that the magnetic flux is quantized and fully determined by the asymptotic behavior of the gauge field. Within the BPS framework, we identify the specific self-interaction potential required for the existence of self-dual configurations. A detailed analysis of the asymptotic behavior, both near the lump core and at spatial infinity, demonstrates that finite-energy solutions necessarily correspond to lump-like BPS configurations in the $CP^1$ target space, with the scalar field vanishing asymptotically. The resulting BPS equations are solved numerically, and the main physical properties of the solutions are presented. We find that these configurations are regular, magnetically localized, and energetically stable, with their internal structure rigidly controlled by the geometry of the $CP^1$ target space. In contrast to Abelian Higgs vortices, the configurations discussed here do not rely on spontaneous symmetry breaking but arise purely from the geometry of the $CP^1$ target space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.22984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a holomorphic quantization scheme for free point particles on two-dimensional constant curvature Riemannian backgrounds. The procedure is based on a Lagrangian embedding of the particle configuration space into a product of coadjoint orbits of the background isometry group. Examples are provided by particles on the plane, torus, sphere, and hyperbolic plane, with or without a monopole field. We elaborate the method by recovering the Hamiltonian spectrum and the wave functions on such spaces. As a by-product, we obtain a geometric and physical interpretation of Repka's result on the decomposition of tensor products of $\mathbf{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$ discrete series representations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.22994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we discuss the entanglement phase transition of pseudo entropy in CFTs. We focus on the case where the in-state and the out-state are different boundary states related by boundary condition changing operators. We compute the pseudo entropy with BCFT methods and find a phase transition with respect to the conformal weight of the boundary condition changing operators. For holographic CFTs, we confirm that the CFT results match that evaluated in AdS.</description>

      <title>On BRST Lagrangian description of partially massless bosonic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an exhaustive BRST lagrangian description of partially massless bosonic fields in four-dimensional space. The basic fields are formulated in terms of two-component spin-tensors in (A)dS space where the tracelessness conditions are automatically fulfilled. The mass shell of partially massless fields is reformulated in terms of constraints on Fock space vectors including the second-class constraints. A conversion procedure for transforming second-class constraints into first-class ones is developed, allowing one to construct a Hermitian and nilpotent BRST charge in the Fock space under consideration. It is proven that the hermiticity and nilpotency restrict the conditions on the theory parameters, which are fulfilled only in dS space. The hermiticity of the BRST charge is incompatible with AdS space. The gauge invariant Lagrangian is constructed on the basis of the BRST charge, and for spin $s$ and depth $t$ the allowed states in the Lagrangian include only $(s-t)$ St\"uckelberg fields. Their exclusion leads to gauge transformations of degree $(s-t)$ for the physical fields. The Lagrangian equations of motion exactly reproduce the mass shell conditions. The Lagrangian in terms of conventional spin-tensor fields is also presented.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Light crossing dark domain walls that source a top form coupled to gauge Chern--Simons terms mixing visible and dark $U(1)$ gauge fields generically converts into dark photons. The effect is entirely localized on the wall and requires no additional ingredients. The conversion rate is a sharp function of the photon frequency in the wall rest frame, vanishing above the ultraviolet cutoff of the top form sector. Partial cloaking may also induce a rotation of the polarization of transmitted light of order $\Delta\vartheta \sim 10^{-3}$ radians, modify the cosmic microwave background power spectrum, and violate Etherington's reciprocity relation at low frequencies. These effects can impact cosmological determinations of the Hubble rate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.21263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the emergence of classical cosmological spacetimes in quantum cosmology by computing the reduced density matrix for long-wavelength curvature perturbations. Starting from standard Hartle--Hawking and tunneling boundary conditions, we emphasize that semiclassical WKB structure and inflationary squeezing do not by themselves yield classicality. Tracing over unobserved degrees of freedom and using the influence functional formalism, we derive the decoherence functional for superhorizon curvature modes during inflation. For a light massive environmental scalar field in the Bunch--Davies vacuum, we obtain an explicit noise kernel and show how a nonzero mass regulates the infrared behavior. We then evaluate decoherence under horizon-based and EFT-motivated coarse grainings, finding efficient suppression of interference between macroscopically distinct perturbation histories in both cases. The analysis clarifies the distinct roles of boundary conditions (branch amplitudes) and decoherence (classical branch selection) and yields an emergent cosmological arrow of time through environment-induced entanglement.</description>

      <title>Detecting Higher Berry Phase via Boundary Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Higher Berry phase has recently been proposed to study the topology of the space of gapped many-body quantum systems. In this work, we develop a boundary-scattering approach to detect higher Berry phases in one-dimensional gapped free-fermion systems. By coupling a gapless lead to the gapped system, we demonstrate that the higher Berry invariant can be obtained by studying the higher winding number of the boundary reflection matrix. The resulting topological invariant is robust against perturbations such as disorder. Our approach establishes a connection between higher Berry invariants and transport properties, thereby providing a potentially experimentally accessible probe of parametrized topological phases.</description>

      <title>Quantum simulation of massive Thirring and Gross--Neveu models for arbitrary number of flavors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of fermionic quantum field theories is an important problem for realizing the standard model of particle physics on a quantum computer. As a step towards this goal, we consider the massive Thirring and Gross--Neveu models with arbitrary number of fermion flavors, $N_f$, discretized on a spatial one-dimensional lattice of size $L$ in the Hamiltonian formulation. We compute the gate complexity using the higher-order product formula and using block-encoding/qubitization and quantum singular value transformations in the limit of large $N_f$ and $L$. We also prepare the ground states of both models with excellent fidelity for system sizes up to 20 qubits with $N_f = 1,2,3,4$ using the adaptive-variational quantum imaginary time algorithm. In addition, we also classify the dynamical Lie algebras of these relativistic fermionic models and show that they belong to the same isomorphism class. Our work is a concrete step towards the quantum simulation of real-time dynamics of large $N_f$ fermionic quantum field theories models relevant for chiral symmetry breaking, understanding dimensional transmutation, and exploring the conformal window of field theories on near-term and early fault-tolerant quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Kasner Singularity of Black Holes in Einstein-scalar Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the spacelike Kasner singularity of spherically-symmetric, static and asymptotically flat black holes in Einstein gravity minimally coupled to a massless scalar with a suitable self-interacting scalar potential. We focus on how the asymptotic information such as the mass and scalar charge affect the properties of the Kasner singularity, including the Kasner exponents. We show how a nontrivial integration constant can be extracted from the near-singularity geometry and find a general pattern that this integration constant asymptotes to a linear combination of the mass and scalar charge at large mass limit. We also find that there may be a black hole upper bound on the maximum surviving time of a massive particle inside such a black hole before it falls into the Kasner singularity, and the Schwarzschild black hole saturate this bound.</description>

      <title>Schwinger-Keldysh field theory for operator R\'{e}nyi entropy and entanglement growth in non-interacting systems with sub-ballistic transports</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The notion of operator growth in quantum systems furnishes a bridge between transport and the generation of entanglement between different parts of the system under quantum dynamics. We define a measure of operator growth in terms of subsystem operator R\'{e}nyi entropy, which provides a state-independent measure of operator growth, unlike entanglement entropies, and the usual measures of operator growth like out-of-time-order correlators. We show that the subsystem operator R\'{e}nyi entropy encodes both spatial and temporal information, and thus can directly connect to transport for a local operator related to a conserved quantity. We construct a unified Schwinger-Keldysh (SK) field theory formalism for the time evolution of operator R\'{e}nyi entropy and entanglement entropies of initial pure states. We use the SK field theory to obtain the operator R\'{e}nyi and state entanglement entropies in terms of infinite-temperature and vacuum Keldysh Green's functions, respectively, for non-interacting systems. We apply the method to explore the connection between operator and entanglement growth, and transport in non-interacting systems with quasiperiodic and random disorder, like the one- and two-dimensional Aubry-Andr\'{e} models and the two-dimensional Anderson model. In particular, we show that the growth of subsystem operator R\'{e}nyi entropy and state von Neumann and R\'{e}nyi entanglement entropies can capture both ballistic and sub-ballistic transport behaviors, like diffusive and anomalous diffusive transport, as well as localization in these systems.</description>

      <title>ACT-Consistent B-L Higgs Inflation in Supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a renormalizable extension of the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) endowed by an R and a gauged B - L symmetry. The model incorporates chaotic inflation driven by a quartic potential, associated with the Higgs superfields which lead to a spontaneous breaking of U(1)B-L. Consistency with the ACT data is achieved by considering a fractional shift-symmetric Kaehler potential which includes two free parameters (p,N) constrained in the ranges 1.355&lt;p&lt;6.7 and 6x10^-5&lt;N&lt;0.7. An explanation of the mu term of the MSSM is also provided, under the condition that a related parameter in the superpotential is somewhat small. Baryogenesis occurs via non-thermal leptogenesis which is also realized by the inflaton's decay to the lightest and/or next-to-lightest right-handed neutrinos for normal ordered light neutrino masses.</description>

      <title>The shape of transverse momentum spectra in hybrid hydrodynamic models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the scaled transverse momentum spectra over a wide parameter space of state-of-the-art hydrodynamic simulation models in order to learn what information can be obtained from the shape of identified-particle spectra -- previously observed to be surprisingly universal across centrality and collision systems in both experimental data and hydrodynamic simulations. We study its sensitivity to each of 17 model parameters in the context of 4 different models for particlization when switching from the hydro description to the kinetic theory afterburner. We find that the strongest sensitivity is to parameters relating to bulk viscosity, free-streaming time, and the $\texttt{T$_\mathrm{R}$ENTo}$ nucleon width parameter $w$. However, we find that the model generally has surprisingly little flexibility in describing the scaled spectrum observable, despite the large number of parameters.
  Within this small range of parameter dependence, we further find significant tension in a simultaneous description of momentum-integrated observables. In particular, while the mean transverse momentum prefers a large value of the nucleon width parameter $w$, a small value is required to obtain scaled spectra that are consistent with experimental measurements. We speculate on the origin of these model tensions and possible missing physics in the commonly-used $\texttt{T$_\mathrm{R}$ENTo}$+free streaming+hydro+afterburner simulation model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.22515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct simple qubit-regularized Hamiltonian lattice gauge theories formulated in the monomer--dimer--tensor-network (MDTN) basis that are free of sign problems in the pure gauge sector. These models naturally realize both confined and deconfined phases. Using classical Monte Carlo methods, we investigate the associated finite-temperature phase transitions and show that they exhibit the expected universality classes of conventional SU(N) lattice gauge theories in various spacetime dimensions. Furthermore, we argue that second-order quantum phase transitions separating the confined and deconfined phases are likely to exist. Such critical points would provide a nonperturbative route to defining continuum limits of qubit-regularized gauge theories, potentially allowing Yang--Mills theory and related continuum gauge theories to emerge from finite-dimensional lattice constructions.</description>

      <title>Quantum corrected thermodynamics and horizon quantization of the Reissner--Nordstr\"om black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this letter, we develop a unified semiclassical framework for the thermodynamics and quantization of the Reissner--Nordstr\"om (RN) black hole (BH) based on the Misner--Sharp--Hernandez (MSH) mass. Treating the quasi-local horizon energies as the relevant thermodynamic variables, we formulate a horizon-by-horizon first law and Smarr relation. Using a reduced phase-space quantization, we obtain a discrete MSH mass spectrum for both horizons, which reproduces the minimal entropy spacing. Quantum transitions between adjacent levels yield Planck-scale corrections to the Hawking temperatures and a universal logarithmic contribution to the entropy, consistent with independent approaches to quantum gravity. We encode these corrections into a quantum-deformed RN geometry via a simple multiplicative factor that preserves the classical horizon positions while reproducing the corrected surface gravities. The associated effective stress tensor behaves as a conserved vacuum-polarization source with characteristic $r^{-4}$ falloff and a small trace, providing a compact representation of semiclassical backreaction. The deformation slightly lowers both horizon temperatures, weakens the inner-horizon instability, and induces tiny shifts in photon-sphere and shadow observables for macroscopic BHs.</description>

      <title>Lorentzian Vacuum Transitions in $f(R)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study Lorentzian vacuum transition probabilities between two minima of a scalar field potential within the framework of $f(R)$ gravity. The analysis extends the previously considered WKB expansion of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation to modified gravity theories, up to second order. We apply the general method for homogeneous and isotropic FLRW universes, with zero and positive spatial curvature, for any $f(R)$ model. For the flat case we obtain analytic expressions for the transition probabilities for any model if we assume a constant Ricci scalar; this assumption has been considered in previous studies, in the Euclidean approach, from symmetry arguments. On the other hand, we also obtain explicit solutions without this assumption for power-law $f(R)=R^{1+n}$ models. Moreover, in the positive curvature scenario, we obtain that the assumption of a constant Ricci scalar is not consistent, but we are able to find analytical solutions in approximated regimes. In all cases we have found that the general behavior of the probabilities already found for Einstein Gravity is preserved, including the prediction of a non-singular initial state due to quantum corrections, even though the probabilities increase or decrease in a model dependent way.</description>

Abstract: We make predictions for the expected multiplicities of exotic charmed hadrons and charmed nuclei in Au+Au collisions at SIS100 and LHC beam energies, using input on light hadron and charm production from the UrQMD transport model, and applying the Thermal-FIST model. We demonstrate that the CBM experiment has the capability to explore these states with production rates of one per 3 seconds for $\chi_{c0}(1P)$ and $\chi_{c1}(1P)$, and one every 3 minutes for $X(3872)$ at the expected data taking rates. Due to the higher baryon density at CBM compared to the LHC, charmed nuclei, if they exist, will be equally abundant at CBM as at the LHC, even though the total charm production at CBM is much lower.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.22858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a comprehensive lattice formulation of various types of the Dirac operator indices, employing $K$-theory to classify the Wilson Dirac operator via its spectral flow. In contrast to the index of the overlap Dirac operator defined through the Ginsparg-Wilson relation, which is restricted to flat tori in even dimensions, our formulation offers several key advantages: 1) It can be applied straightforwardly to the Atiyah-Patodi-Singer index for manifolds with boundary. 2) The boundary can be curved, allowing for the inclusion of gravitational background effects. 3) The mod-2 index in both even and odd dimensions can be defined as a natural extension of the same formulation. In this talk, we present the mathematical proof and provide numerical evidence supporting the formulation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.22890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Confinement and string breaking are two fundamental phenomena in gauge theories. Signatures of both are currently pursued in quantum-simulator experiments, opening a new angle on strongly interacting dynamics of gauge fields out of equilibrium, complementary to traditional particle-physics settings. In this work, we report the emergence of metastable confinement dynamics in a U(1) lattice gauge theory, originating from the competition between string tension and four-Fermi coupling - a competition that naturally arises in Rydberg atom arrays. We show that the initial string state can be resonantly melted through controlled energy matching, a phenomenon we identify as resonant string breaking. We demonstrate this mechanism for both static and Floquet-driven systems, where periodic modulation generates a spectrum of tunable sideband resonances. Our work provides new insights into the mechanisms of confinement and string breaking driven by long-range interactions and time-dependent fields, which are available in current quantum simulators on a variety of platforms.</description>

We analytically constructed the expansion coefficients in both limits and used them as a basis to investigate gravitational lensing effects through observables, taking into account the variation of the parameters involved in the model, both for the canonical field and the phantom case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.22930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the interplay of the Weak Gravity Conjecture (WGC) and the Weak Cosmic Censorship Conjecture (WCCC) in $F(R)$-Euler-Heisenberg black holes in Anti-de Sitter and de Sitter backgrounds. The solution is characterized by the electric charge $q$, the $F(R)$ deviation $f_{R_0}$, the Euler--Heisenberg coupling $\lambda$, and the constant scalar curvature $R_0$. We establish a universal entropy--extremality relation that provides thermodynamic evidence for the WGC independently of $f_{R_0}$ and $R_0$. Photon sphere analysis from both geodesic and topological perspectives confirms the simultaneous compatibility of the WGC and WCCC, with the Euler--Heisenberg coupling restoring photon spheres in the naked singularity regime. Gravitational lensing in the strong- and weak-deflection limits reveals that the photon sphere radius is independent of the cosmological background while the critical impact parameter nearly doubles in de Sitter. Black hole shadow images under isotropic accretion are constructed. Within the Barrow entropy framework, we uncover van der Waals-type phase transitions and analyze Joule-Thomson expansion, identifying the small black hole phase as the WGC-compatible thermodynamic regime accessible via isenthalpic cooling.</description>

      <title>Charged scalar and Dirac perturbations on a global monopole Reissner-Nordstr\"om-de Sitter black hole: quasinormal modes and strong cosmic censorship</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study perturbations of charged scalar and Dirac fields around Reissner-Nordstr\"om-de Sitter black holes with a global monopole. To this end, we first derive the equations of motion for both fields on the aforementioned background; these equations are then reformulated uniformly into the Teukolsky equation. Since the Teukolsky equation in asymptotically de Sitter spacetimes can be mapped into the Heun equation, we are able to solve quasinormal spectra by employing the Heun function method, not only for photon sphere modes but also for de Sitter and near-extremal modes. We analyze the spectra of all three types for both fields and, in particular, ascertain the effects of the global monopole. In the near-extremal regime, we find that the presence of a global monopole, on the one hand, leaves the strong cosmic censorship conjecture unaffected for scalar perturbations, while on the other hand, it enhance the violation of strong cosmic censorship for Dirac perturbations. Furthermore, we identify that the impact of the global monopole on both the spectra and the strong cosmic censorship is achieved by a shift in the modified multipole number. Our work demonstrates that the Heun function method is an efficient and robust approach for exploring the interaction between asymptotically de Sitter black holes and perturbing fields.</description>

      <title>Spatially inhomogeneous confinement-deconfinement phase transition in rotating QGP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using first-principles numerical simulations, we find a new spatially inhomogeneous phase in a rotating gluon plasma. This mixed phase simultaneously contains regions of both confining and deconfining states in thermal equilibrium, separated by a spatial transition. The position of the boundary between the two phases is determined by the local critical temperature. We calculate the critical temperature of the local transition as a function of angular velocity and radius for a full (imaginary) rotating system and within a local thermalization approximation, and find an excellent agreement between these approaches. An analytic continuation of the results to the domain of real angular frequencies indicates that the confinement phase localizes at the periphery of the rotating system and the deconfinement phase appears closer to the rotation axis. We argue that the anisotropy of the gluon action in the curved co-rotating background can quantitatively explain the remarkable property that the spatial structure of this inhomogeneous phase disobeys the picture based on a straightforward implementation of the Tolman-Ehrenfest law. We also perform the first lattice simulation of rotating $N_f=2$ QCD which confirms that a similar picture is expected for theory with dynamical quarks.</description>

      <title>Universal and non-universal finite-volume effects in the vicinity of chiral phase transition in (2+1)-flavor QCD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.23118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this proceeding, we discuss the finite-size scaling analysis of the order parameter related to the chiral phase transition in QCD with two massless quarks. We use data obtained in lattice QCD calculations performed with highly improved staggered quarks (HISQ) for a range of light quark masses, $1/240 \leq m_\ell/m_s \leq 1/27$ for different spatial volumes ($N_\sigma$) on Euclidean lattices with temporal extent $N_\tau=8$, satisfying $3\,N_\tau \leq N_\sigma \leq 10\,N_\tau$. We observe that infinite volume extrapolated data for the order parameter agree reasonably well with the expected $O(2)$ scaling behavior even for physical ratios of the light-to-strange quark mass ratio. We quantify deviations from asymptotic scaling and perform a detailed analysis of the influence of finite-size effects in terms of temperature and quark masses at a fixed lattice cutoff. This is crucial for improving the reliability of the infinite-volume extrapolated estimate of the chiral order parameter and for a more precise determination of chiral phase transition temperature from direct Lattice QCD simulations.</description>

      <title>Symmetric Mass Generation via Multicriticality in a 3D Lattice Gross-Neveu Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a three-dimensional lattice model of two flavors of massless staggered fermions coupled through two independent four-fermion interactions, $U_I$ and $U_B$. Using large-scale fermion-bag Monte Carlo simulations, we map out the phase diagram in the $(U_I, U_B)$ parameter space and identify three distinct phases: a massless fermion phase, a symmetry-broken massive phase, and a symmetric massive phase. When one of the interactions is absent ($U_B=0$), the system undergoes a single continuous transition directly connecting the massless and symmetric massive phases, a feature previously associated with unconventional fermion mass generation. We find that turning on a nonzero $U_B$ separates this direct transition into two successive transitions with an intermediate symmetry-broken phase. The transition from the massless to the broken phase belongs to the Gross-Neveu universality class, while the transition from the broken to the symmetric massive phase falls into the three-dimensional XY universality class. Our results indicate that the special point at vanishing coupling, where the direct transition occurs, plays the role of a multicritical point organizing the surrounding phase structure. These findings provide a unified lattice perspective on conventional and unconventional mechanisms of fermion mass generation within a single model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.23195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive a Lorentz-covariant spectral universality for stationary stochastic fields in Minkowski spacetime. We show that no covariant local mapping can relate temporal and spatial power spectra in more than one spatial dimension. For Lorentz homogeneous spectra, the temporal index is symmetry protected, observer invariant, and offset from the spatial index by a universal geometric factor set by effective momentum space dimensionality. We show how spectral universality breaks down for anisotropic scaling and dispersion dominated spectra, establishing the necessity of a Lorentz-covariant formulation of relativistic spectral inference.</description>

      <title>The Axion-Photon Mixing and the Extragalactic Magnetic Background: Plateau Regimes, Resonances, and Non-Gaussian Boosts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an analytical treatment of Axion-Like-Particle (ALP)--photon mixing with extragalactic background light (EBL) attenuation for constant, Gaussian-stochastic, and non-Gaussian magnetic field configurations--with direct implications for Very High Energy (VHE) gamma-ray observations such as LHAASO, HAWC, and CTA experiments. For constant fields, we derive exact probabilities and identify a perturbative plateau regime where photon survival scales as quartic order of magnetic field, isolating the four-point magnetic correlation as a sensitive probe of non-Gaussianity. For Gaussian stochastic fields, we obtain--for the first time--analytical formulas for non-exponential-decay components in the strong-attenuation regime. Contrary to the widely used domain-like model, photon survival is suppressed by 4-6 orders of magnitude, while both conversion and survival probabilities exhibit distinct multi-peak structures from mass-equal resonance, stochastic resonance, and EBL attenuation. Extending to non-Gaussian fields, we show that non-Gaussianity can enhance photon survival by several orders of magnitude relative to the Gaussian case, potentially explaining the unexpectedly VHE photon event observed by LHAASO. Our results demonstrate that stochastic magnetic fields cannot be reduced to domain-like coherence without losing essential physics, and that VHE gamma-ray spectra encode observable information about both the power spectrum and non-Gaussian structure of intergalactic magnetic fields--critical as next-generation observatories push toward PeV sensitivities.</description>

Abstract: We study a particular exact solution for rotating spacetimes in four-dimensional Horava gravity, which has been proposed as a renormalizable gravity model without the ghost problem. We show that the zero-mass Kerr spacetime or the zero-mass Kerr-(A)dS spacetime in Einstein gravity is an exact solution in four-dimensional Horava for an arbitrary IR Lorentz-violation parameter lambda, but with an appropriate cosmological constant. In particular, for the zero-mass topological Kerr-AdS black hole solution with the hyperbolic horizon topology or the zero-mass Kerr-dS cosmological solution with the spherical horizon topology, there exist the ergosphere and the non-vanishing (positive) Hawking temperature, which imply the existence of negative mass black holes as well as positive mass spacetimes, by losing its mass from the zero-mass ones via the Hawking radiation or Penrose process in the ergosphere.</description>

Abstract: We extend the decomposition conjecture to 2d quantum field theories with a gauged $\text{Rep}(H)$ symmetry category for $H$ a finite-dimensional semisimple Hopf algebra with $\text{Rep}(G)$ trivially-acting and $\text{Vec}(\Gamma)$ the remaining symmetry, for $G,\Gamma$ finite groups. We check our extension by explicitly computing partition functions, and by verifying that previous results arise as special cases. Furthermore, we compute the topological operators responsible for enforcing the decomposition. Then, drawing from these results, we formulate a plausible decomposition conjecture for the even more general case of $\text{Rep}(H'')$ trivially-acting and $\text{Rep}(H')$ the remaining symmetry, for $H',H''$ Hopf algebras, not necessarily associated with groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20643v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the worldline quantum field theory approach we derive solutions to the equations of motion for spinning massive bodies up to quadratic order in spins. At leading post-Minkowskian (PM) order these trajectories are obtained in the time domain, and at sub-leading order in the frequency domain. Our approach incorporates diagrammatic techniques and modern Feynman integration technologies, and includes a new family of loop integrals different to those seen in asymptotic PM calculations. Our results provide a new mechanism for computing the radiated angular momentum involved in gravitational scattering, which we reproduce at 2PM order up to linear spins. We have established a framework for computing higher-order effects to further extend the high-precision frontier in analytical gravitational wave physics, and push predictions for the radiated angular momentum to higher perturbative orders.</description>

Abstract: It has been suggested that logarithmically enhanced infra-red loop corrections arising in theories with four derivatives correspond to a physical running of couplings, rendering quadratic gravity asymptotically free. We find that these effects depend on the gauge and on the field parameterisation. We compute physical on-shell amplitudes and find genuine infra-red log-enhanced loop corrections, that are process-dependent and cannot be absorbed into running couplings. As a byproduct, we derive the effective action of quadratic gravity at tree level, showing that its ghost does not contribute to effective operators and thereby does not violate positivity bounds.</description>

      <title>A New Action for Superstring Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03902v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sen's superstring field theory successfully formulates perturbative superstring theory but has a number of unusual features. The action is not background independent and the resulting effective field theory does not appear to have standard diffeomorphsim symmetry - instead there is an exotic gauge symmetry that acts on some fields but not others. A new action is found that reduces to Sen's action in a certain limit and gives the same results as Sen's theory for physical superstring amplitudes. However, the new theory is background independent: there is a shift symmetry so that a change in the background can be compensated for by a corresponding shift in the string fields. Sen's theory has two string fields leading to the physical interacting superstring plus a free superstring that decouples from the physical superstring. The new terms in the action give self-interactions to the second superstring which remains decoupled from the physical superstring. The two superstrings each have a graviton and the effective action for the two gravitons coupled to a background metric is studied and shown to be background independent and diffeomorphism invariant, and the origin of further diffeomorphism-like symmetries is explained.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04764v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is believed that the theory of quantum gravity describing our universe is unitary. Nonetheless, if we only have access to a subsystem, its dynamics is described by nonequilibrium physics. Motivated by this, we investigate the planar limit of large $N$ ungauged one-matrix quantum mechanics obeying the Lindblad master equation with dissipative jump terms, focusing on the existence, uniqueness, and properties of steady states that signal nonequilibrium phase transitions. In the first class of examples, where potentials are unbounded from below, we study nonequilibrium critical points above which strong dissipation allows for the existence of normalizable steady states that would otherwise not exist. In the second class of examples, termed matrix quantum optics, we find evidence of nonequilibrium phase transitions analogous to those recently reported in the quantum optics literature for driven-dissipative Kerr resonators. Preliminary results on two-matrix quantum mechanics are also presented. We implement bootstrap methods to obtain concrete and rigorous results for the nonequilibrium steady states of matrix quantum mechanics in the planar limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08038v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The fuzzy-sphere regularisation is a powerful tool to study conformal field theories (CFT) in three spacetime dimensions. In this paper, we extend its scope to CFTs with local fermionic operators. We realise the free-Majorana-fermion CFT on a set-up with one flavour of bosons and one flavour of fermions on the lowest Landau level with a $1/2$ angular momentum mismatch and allow conversion between two bosons and two fermions, and use a relative chemical potential as the tuning parameter. On the phase diagram, we observe two continuous transitions described respectively by a free Majorana fermion and a gauged Ising CFT. We numerically confirm the emergent conformal symmetry through the operator spectrum and the two-point correlation function of the local Majorana fermion. We further establish a correspondence between the fuzzy-sphere models and the field-theory Lagrangians, and extend it to an interacting fermionic CFT -- the super-Ising theory with emergent super-conformal symmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13655v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct, for the first time, new static non-extremal five-dimensional black hole solutions (without or with squashed horizons) endowing with four different electric charge parameters in the $D = 5$, $\mathcal{N} = 2$ supergravity coupled to three vector multiplets with a specific pre-potential $\mathcal{V} = STU -W^2U \equiv 1$. When the fourth charge parameter disappears, the solution simplify reduces to the three-charge static black hole solution previously presented in ref. [1], which belongs to the solution to the $D = 5$, $\mathcal{N} = 2$ supergravity coupled to two vector multiplets (also notably known as the $STU$ model). We parameterize the model in such a simple fashion that not only can one easily recover the static three-charge solution but also it is very convenient to study their thermodynamical properties of the obtained black hole solutions in the case without a squashing horizon. We then show that the thermodynamical quantities perfectly obey both the differential first law and integral Smarr formula of thermodynamics. Finally, we also extend to present its generalizations with squashed horizons or including a nonzero cosmological constant.</description>

Abstract: In this work, based on an analogy with holographic confining geometries and using complexified fields, we build a holographic toy model of third order photonic exceptional points (EPs) of ternary coupled microrings with gain and loss, which makes an open, non-Hermitian quantum system. In our model, we discuss the Ferrell-Glover-Tinkham sum rule for various combinations of gain and loss systems, and numerically find the behavior of spectra which matches with the experiments. We also discuss the inhomogeneous case of a holographic lattice for three-site photonic EPs. Additionally, we numerically find the behavior of phase rigidity and the Petermann factor around EPs versus various parameters of the model. We also discuss the connections between recent developments in complexified, time-dependent entanglement entropy and EPs, and finally, we connect EPs and the $\theta$-vacuum of QCD through topological structures, partition functions, and winding numbers, and find a second-order EP in a perturbed $\theta$-vacuum model.</description>

      <title>$\mathcal{N}=2$ Universality at Strong Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27594v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a detailed analysis of integrated correlators for an $\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal field theory on a squashed sphere with SU$(N)$ gauge group and fundamental/anti-symmetric matter. Employing the matrix model arising from supersymmetric localisation, we compute derivatives of the partition function $\mathcal{Z}$ with respect to the fundamental mass ($\mu$), the anti-symmetric mass ($m$) and the squashing parameter ($b$), corresponding to integrated insertions of the $\mathcal{N}=2$ flavour-current and stress-tensor multiplets, which are holographically dual to gluon and graviton scatterings in the presence of D7-branes. For correlators dual to only graviton scatterings, we confirm the planar-limit equivalence with $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM. Our main result is a remarkable universality for the mixed gluon-graviton scattering amplitudes off D7-branes, obtained from $\partial_\mu^2 \partial_m^2 \log \mathcal{Z}$ and $\partial_\mu^2 \partial_b^2 \log \mathcal{Z}$. We show that the leading and sub-leading large-$N$ contributions in the strong-coupling regime are governed by universal asymptotic series, identical to those found for integrated giant-graviton correlators in $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM. We also propose an $\text{SL}(2, \mathbb{Z})$-invariant completion of these results in terms of non-holomorphic Eisenstein series. This completion provides exact constraints on higher-derivative terms in the dual $\text{AdS}_5$ brane-string amplitudes and highlights an unexpected universality across distinct superconformal theories at strong coupling.</description>

      <title>Locality constraints in AdS$_2$ without parity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.20749v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study bulk locality constraints in quantum field theories in AdS$_2$. The known derivation of locality sum rules in AdS$_{d+1}$ does not apply for $d=1$ due to the different singularity structure of the conformal blocks and the inequivalence of operator orderings on the boundary. Assuming unitarity and a mild growth condition, we establish power-law bounds for correlators, derive dispersion relations and an expansion in terms of ``even'' and ``odd'' local blocks that converges in the entire AdS$_2$. These yield two novel families of symmetric and antisymmetric locality sum rules. We test these sum rules explicitly in the free scalar field theory.</description>

      <title>Zoo of flows in a 3d gauged supergravity with periodic potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21558v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we construct solutions with AdS/dS asymptotics for $D=3$ truncated gauged supergravity with a periodic scalar potential. In a holographic perspective, assuming Dirichlet boundary conditions, the solutions can be interpreted as deformations of 2d dual CFTs triggered by non-zero vacuum expectation values of irrelevant operators. In addition to the domain wall type solutions, we incorporated in the analysis a black string solution, which can also be interpreted as a deformation by VEV of an irrelevant operator. Generalizing the flows to finite temperature, we find that the corresponding geometries are singular but have horizons. For certain flows, we provide an analytical description near the horizon region. For an exact RG flow solution, we explicitly compute the Brown-York stress-energy tensor on a cutoff surface and show that the $T\overline{T}$ operator factorizes along the holographic RG flow. We also define an effective, scale-dependent deformation parameter $\mu(\phi)$, whose running is governed by the scalar field at the cutoff.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05545v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the parity-odd part of the Weyl anomaly for chiral fermions in a background gravitational field. We start from a manifestly real form of the Lagrangian (that is, not only real up to a total derivative), and we regularize it by means of Pauli-Villars fermions. All parity-odd terms in the anomaly cancel in the integrand, so that the result of the anomaly is necessarily parity-even.</description>

Abstract: We write down the global Hamiltonian of conformal field theory (CFT) in finite volume in terms of the modular Hamiltonian of the vacuum reduced to a local ball-shaped region, and use it to propose local approximations to the global Minkowski Hamiltonian in quantum field theory (QFT). The proposed Hamiltonians are motivated by the operator-algebraic property of nuclearity. They are constructed from the characteristic functions of inclusion of algebras and can be viewed as regulators of the modular Hamiltonian of local algebras of QFT</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.01548v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Near-extremal black membranes with topological (baryonic) $U(1)_B$ charge of M-theory compactified on the coset space $M^{1,1,0}$ are stable. $M^{1,1,0}$ coset is a ${\mathbb Z}_2$-invariant truncation of a larger $Q^{1,1,1}$ coset, with diagonal $U(1)_B\equiv U(1)_{B,+}\subset U(1)_B^2$ symmetry of the latter. We show that the baryonic black membranes of M-theory $M^{1,1,0}$ compactifications are unstable to ${\mathbb Z}_2$-odd gravitational bulk gauge and scalar fluctuations, but only if this bulk scalar is identified with the holographically dual $2+1$ dimensional superconformal gauge theory operator of conformal dimension $\Delta=1$. The instability is associated with the unstable charge transport of the off-diagonal $U(1)_{B,-}\subset U(1)_B^2$ symmetry.</description>

      <title>Deforming the Double-Scaled SYK &amp; Reaching the Stretched Horizon From Finite Cutoff Holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06113v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the properties of the double-scaled SYK (DSSYK) model under chord Hamiltonian deformations based on finite cutoff holography for general dilaton gravity theories with Dirichlet boundaries. The formalism immediately incorporates a lower-dimensional analog of $\text{T}\bar{\text{T}}(+\Lambda_2)$ deformations, denoted $T^2(+\Lambda_1)$, as special cases. In general, the deformation mixes the chord basis of the Hilbert space in the seed theory, which we order through the Lanczos algorithm. The resulting Krylov complexity for the Hartle-Hawking state represents a wormhole length at a finite cutoff in the bulk. We study the thermodynamic properties of the deformed theory; the growth of Krylov complexity; the evolution of $n$-point correlation functions with matter chords; and the entanglement entropy between the double-scaled algebras of the DSSYK model for a given chord state. The latter, in the triple-scaling limit, manifests as the minimal codimension-two area in the bulk following the Ryu-Takayanagi formula. By performing a sequence of $T^2$ and $T^2+\Lambda_1$ deformations in the upper tail of the energy spectrum in the deformed DSSYK, we concretely realize the cosmological stretched horizon proposal in de Sitter holography by Susskind. We discuss other extensions with sine dilaton gravity, end-of-the-world branes, and the Almheiri-Goel-Hu model.</description>

      <title>Explicit Hamiltonian representations of meromorphic connections and duality from different perspectives: a case study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19187v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we present an explicit study of $\hbar$-deformed meromorphic connections in $\mathfrak{gl}_3(\mathbb{C})$ with an unramified irregular pole at infinity of order $r_\infty=3$ and its spectral dual corresponding to the $\mathfrak{gl}_2(\mathbb{C})$ Painlev\'{e} IV Lax pair. Using the apparent singularities and their dual partners on the spectral curves as Darboux coordinates, we obtain the Hamiltonian evolutions, the reduction of these evolutions to a single non-trivial direction, the Jimbo-Miwa-Ueno tau-functions, the fundamental symplectic two-forms and the associated Hermitian matrix models on both sides. We then prove that the spectral duality connecting both sides extends to all these aspects, providing an explicit illustration of the generalized Harnad duality. We finally propose a conjecture relating the Jimbo-Miwa-Ueno differential as the $\hbar=0$ evaluation of the Hamiltonian differential in these Darboux coordinates that could provide insights on the geometric interpretation of the $\hbar$ formal parameter. As a byproduct we also obtain a rank $3$ Lax pair for the Painlev\'{e} IV equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18146v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ultrahigh-frequency (above 10 kHz) gravitational waves (GW) window provides a unique opportunity to detect primordial GWs, free from astrophysical foregrounds that dominate lower frequencies. A stochastic GW background in this range is generically predicted from cosmological phase transitions and topological defects associated with grand unification and other ultra-high energy theories. We establish a universal quantum limit framework for various detection schemes, setting a fundamental bound on GW detectability. Our analysis reveals that backgrounds in the kHz-MHz range are in principle observable, whereas higher-frequency signals lie below the quantum limit. These results offer theoretical guidance for future detector designs and open new avenues for probing early universe physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00407v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the temperature of the McVittie black holes in cavities. The cavities are isothermal boxes that can make the McVittie black holes thermodynamically stable. The McVittie black holes are dynamical black holes, so the traditional action method can hardly be used to calculate the cavity temperature. We find that the cavity temperature $T_c$ can be derived from the McVittie black hole temperature $T_+$ and the Tolman relation. By setting $H^2$ to be $\Lambda/3$, we also get the cavity temperature of de Sitter black holes, which are interestingly the same with the results from the action method, but our method is much more easier.</description>

      <title>Resonance in black hole ringdown: Benchmarking quasinormal mode excitation and extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06411v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate how resonant excitation near exceptional points manifests in Kerr black hole ringdown waveforms and examine its extraction. Using waveforms generated by localized initial data, where quasinormal mode amplitudes are given solely by excitation factors, we establish a controlled benchmark for overtone extraction. Applying an iterative fitting method with mirror modes, we analyze a mild resonance in the $(l,m)=(2,2)$ multipole and a sharp resonance in the $(3,1)$ multipole occurring as part of a sequence of successive resonances. For $(2,2)$, we extract the fundamental mode, the first three overtones, and the fundamental mirror mode with relative errors below $10\%$, and show that residual waveforms exhibit the expected damped sinusoids together with distinctive resonance signatures. For $(3,1)$, we demonstrate that resonances can not only amplify but also reduce quasinormal mode excitations, reshaping the overtone hierarchy and rendering the sharp resonance more pronounced in ringdown. Our results clarify the imprint of resonance in Kerr ringdown and highlight both the robustness and limitations of current extraction techniques, providing a foundation for more reliable extraction of higher overtones and for applications to observational data analysis.</description>

      <title>Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless quantum transition in 2 dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06682v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition is the prototype of a phase transition driven by the formation and interaction of topological defects in two-dimensional (2D) systems. In typical models these are vortices: above a transition temperature $T_{\rm BKT}$ vortices are free, below this transition temperature they get confined. In this work we extend the concept of BKT transition to quantum systems in two dimensions. In particular, we demonstrate that a zero-temperature quantum BKT phase transition, driven by a coupling constant can occur in 2D models governed by an effective gauge field theory with a diverging dielectric constant. One particular example is that of a compact U(1) gauge theory with a diverging dielectric constant, where the quantum BKT transition is induced by non-relativistic, purely 2D magnetic monopoles, which can be viewed also as electric vortices. These quantum BKT transitions have the same diverging exponent $z$ as the quantum Griffiths transition but have nothing to do with disorder.</description>

Abstract: In this letter, we review the well known ambiguity in defining angular momentum (and mass dipole) fluxes in general relativity and we reinterpret recent works that resolve the ambiguity by defining invariant charges. We resolve the ambiguity by finding the conditions that fix a frame for supertranslation and for space-time translation. We also present an elementary method for measuring the angular momentum aspect and work out explicitly the supertranslation frame-fixing conditions for the metric created by point particles to first nontrivial order in the Newton constant.</description>

      <title>In-in formalism with resummmation in a constant electric field: propagators including nontrivial boundary wavefunctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19337v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the derivation of an alternative representation of the real-time in-in formalism under a spatially homogeneous and time independent electric field. Because the system exhibits instability associated with pair production of particles and antiparticles, the perturbation theory should be reorganized depending on the choice of the reference vacuum. We recast the boundary wavefunctions into the quadratic self-energy-like terms in the functional integration formalism. The resulting generating functional in the modified in-in formalism leads to the propagators that resum infinite diagrams necessary to capture the vacuum-instability effects. The proper-time representations of the propagators reproduce the known expressions from the canonical operator formalism, but our derivation based on the generating functional along the closed-time path clarifies the origin of the additional proper-time contour and provides a better physical understanding. Finally, as a concrete example of the application, we compute the in-in expectation value of the vector current in a constant electric field, and find that the simple one-loop calculation captures the pair production effect.</description>

      <title>Versor: A Geometric Sequence Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10195v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A novel sequence architecture is introduced, Versor, which uses Conformal Geometric Algebra (CGA) in place of traditional linear operations to achieve structural generalization and significant performance improvements on a variety of tasks, while offering improved interpretability and efficiency. By embedding states in the $Cl_{4,1}$ manifold and evolving them via geometric transformations (rotors), Versor natively represents $SE(3)$-equivariant relationships without requiring explicit structural encoding. Versor is validated on chaotic N-body dynamics, topological reasoning, and standard multimodal benchmarks (CIFAR-10, WikiText-103), consistently outperforming Transformers, Graph Networks, and geometric baselines (GATr, EGNN). Key results include: orders-of-magnitude fewer parameters ($200\times$ vs. Transformers); interpretable attention decomposing into proximity and orientational components; zero-shot scale generalization (0.993 vs. 0.070 MCC for ViT); and featuring a Recursive Rotor Accumulator (RRA) for $O(L)$ linear temporal complexity in dynamical systems, and a Geometric Product Attention (GPA) mechanism for $O(L^{2})$ global relational modeling, allowing for task-specific architectural pruning or hybridization depending on the required scale. In out-of-distribution tests, Versor maintains stable predictions while Transformers fail catastrophically. Custom Clifford kernels achieve a cumulative over $100\times$ speedup via bit-masked contraction and specialized Matrix Isomorphism kernels, reducing per-step latency to 1.05 ms and outperforming highly-optimized Transformer baselines.</description>

      <title>A new product formula for $(z;q)_\infty$, with applications to asymptotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11329v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We express the $q$-Pochhammer symbol $(z;q)_\infty$ as an infinite product of gamma functions, analogously to how Narukawa expressed the elliptic gamma function as an infinite product of hyperbolic gamma functions. This identity is used to obtain asymptotic expansions when $q$ tends to $1$.</description>

      <title>Symmetric teleparallel gravitational effects on solar neutrino oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13355v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutrino oscillations probe the quantum gravity interface in unique ways. While gravitational effects on neutrinos are well studied in general relativity and torsion based geometries, the symmetric teleparallel regime where gravity stems solely from non-metricity, with zero curvature and torsion has remained uncharted. In this work, we perform the first analysis of neutrino oscillations in such a spacetime. Using the reduced Kerr metric in coincident gauge for the slowly rotating and weakly gravitating spherical Sun, we derive the Dirac Hamiltonian from the generalized Dirac equation and compute the accumulated phase of neutrino mass eigenstates. There are six free coupling constants in our model. Based on certain observational inputs, we inferred upper bounds on our arbitrary coupling constants. This allowed us to simplify the otherwise cumbersome calculations to some extent. Ultimately, we computed the phase differences that play a crucial role in solar neutrino oscillations and analyzed the contributions arising from our arbitrary coupling constants. Our results establish neutrino oscillations as a novel probe of non-metricity and open a new avenue for testing symmetric teleparallel gravity through astrophysical observations.</description>

      <title>Fan-Wang type regular black holes in Quasi-Topological Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16754v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a class of regular black hole solutions of the Fan-Wang type within quasi-topological gravity (QTG) in arbitrary spacetime dimensions greater than four. In contrast to the original Fan-Wang solution, which was obtained in four-dimensional general relativity coupled to nonlinear electrodynamics, our higher-dimensional generalization does not require any matter fields. Instead, regularity is achieved purely through an infinite tower of higher-curvature corrections. We demonstrate that the Fan-Wang-type metric is a solution to the QTG field equations by explicitly determining the corresponding coupling constants for each curvature order. Within an appropriate parameter regime, the solution describes an asymptotically flat black hole spacetime with a regular center. Remarkably, even in the case of negative mass, the geometry can remain completely regular, in sharp contrast to Einstein gravity.</description>
