      <title>A Self-Adjusting FEM-BEM Coupling Scheme for the Nonlinear Poisson-Boltzmann Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Poisson-Boltzmann equation is widely used to model molecular electrostatics; however, it is usually solved in linearised form because the sinh nonlinearity is challenging, limiting its applicability in highly charged systems such as nucleic acids. This work presents a solution method for the nonlinear Poisson-Boltzmann equation based on a coupled finite/boundary element scheme that automatically finds an optimal relaxation parameter, ensuring fast and reliable convergence of the nonlinear solver without user intervention. We validated our solver against APBS for a spherical cavity, and used RNA-based structures to perform a thorough study of the different algorithmic choices, and to test our implementation. We found that the best alternative to solve the Poisson-Boltzmann equation was using a Newton-Raphson method where the nonlinearity was gradually introduced with a cubic approximation in the first iteration. Newton-Raphson was also the best method to find the optimal relaxation factor, reducing the number of iterations by 40%. Including other optimisation techniques, we were able to obtain a 1.37x speed-up with respect to the best hand-picked relaxation factor for 1HC8 (molecule with highest charge in our tests), avoiding any trial-and-error process to find the relaxation factor.</description>

      <title>A multi-language auto-differentiation module and its application to a parallel particle-in-cell code on distributed computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The auto differentiable simulation is a type of simulation that outputs of the simulation include not only the simulation result itself, but also their derivatives with respect to various input parameters. It provides an efficient method to study sensitivity of the simulation results with respect to the input parameters. Furthermore, it can be used in gradient based optimization methods for rapidly optimizing design parameters. In this paper, we present the development of a fast and transparent auto-differentiation module/class designed for easy integration into numerous simulation codes. As an application, this auto-differentiation module is integrated into a parallel particle-in-cell code with message passing interface (MPI) on distributed memory computers.</description>

      <title>Single-pixel imaging via data-driven and deep image prior dual networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-pixel imaging(SPI),especially when integrated with deep neural networks like deep image prior networks (DIP-Net) or data-driven networks (DD-Net), has gained considerable attention for its capability to generate high-quality reconstructed images, even in the presence of sub-sampling conditions. However, DIP-Net often requires thousands of iterations to achieve high-quality image reconstruction, and DD-Net performs optimally only when the target closely resembles the features present in its training set. To overcome these limitations, we propose a dual-network iterative optimization (SPI-DNIO) framework that combines the strengths of both DD-Net and DIP-Net. It has been demonstrated that this approach can recover high-quality images with fewer iteration steps. Furthermore, to address the challenge of SPI inputs having less effective information at low sampling rates, we have designed a residual block enriched with gradient information, which can convey details to deeper layers, thereby enhancing the deep network's learning capabilities. We have applied these techniques to both indoor experiments with active lighting and outdoor long-range experiments with passive lighting. Our experimental results confirm the exceptional reconstruction capabilities and generalization performance of the SPI-DNIO framework.</description>

      <title>Efficient Pseudo-spectral Algorithms for Statistical Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present stochastic variants of the exponential time differencing schemes for stiff stochastic differential equations. We derive three explicit schemes that offer better stability compared to Euler-Maruyama and Milstein's method, and achieve strong convergence up to order O(h) in the time step h. We combine these schemes with a pseudo-spectral approach to outline efficient algorithms for simulating stochastic field theories with additive noise. To illustrate the effectiveness of this approach, we study several systems in and out of equilibrium, including Model A, Model B, the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation, and the Complex Ginzburg-Landau equation. We outline procedures for computing physical observables such as the critical exponents, correlation functions, and dynamic linear response, and provide our implementation as open source code.</description>

      <title>Robust Indexing for Challenging Serial X-ray Diffraction Patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Serial crystallography experiments routinely produce thousands of diffraction patterns from crystals in random orientations. To turn this stream of images into a usable dataset, each pattern must be indexed before integration and merging can proceed. In practice, diffraction patterns may contain only a small number of reliable peaks, be contaminated by background or spuriously detected reflections, or arise from crystals with highly skewed unit cells. These factors make indexing unstable in the small-N regime. We introduce a robust indexing algorithm tailored to this setting. We formulate indexing as a symmetry-aware lattice decoding problem and design a loss that explicitly incorporates lattice symmetries while trimming outlier peaks that are inconsistent with any plausible orientation. We combine this objective with a reciprocal-space basis reparameterization that stabilizes decoding for skewed or poorly conditioned lattices, and we develop a dedicated small-N objective mode that couples refined peak scoring with a method to recover orientations from very few reflections. The resulting method is memory-efficient and suitable for robust indexing. We evaluate our approach on three protein datasets from the Coherent X-ray Imaging Data Bank collected at XFEL facilities, using identical preprocessing and unit-cell information across methods. Across all datasets, our algorithm matches or outperforms established indexers such as XGANDALF and TORO, with particularly large gains for patterns with few indexed peaks and for crystals with skewed unit cells. While slower, our method is extremely memory-efficient, and its structure allows high-parallelism on CPUs or larger batch sizes on GPUs. These results show that exploiting lattice structure, symmetry, and small-N-aware search yields substantial improvements in indexing robustness.</description>

      <title>MDcraft -- a modern molecular dynamics simulation package with machine learning potentials support</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular dynamics is widely used to study various phenomena, such as diffusion, shock wave propagation, and plasma dynamics. A wide range of software packages supports the expanding scope of molecular dynamics applications. However, the quality of simulations depends on force field approximations, ranging from simple models to direct quantum solutions. Recently, machine learning approaches for constructing accurate interatomic potentials have received significant attention. In MDcraft, we integrate these advances into a scalable, physically accurate framework. MDcraft is a comprehensive, modern molecular dynamics platform. It offers a high-level Python API with a user-friendly, script-based interface. The core simulation algorithms are implemented in C++ to ensure robustness and computational efficiency. MDcraft is built for high-performance computing on modern clusters and supports dynamic domain decomposition and load balancing via the Message Passing Interface (MPI) for scalable parallelization. Additionally, MDcraft leverages multithreading within nodes through standard C++ parallelism, enabling efficient use of heterogeneous architectures. We demonstrate the code's capabilities through several examples, including the shock response in aluminum, the shock Hugoniot in argon, and the cold curve of copper.</description>

      <title>Discontinuity-aware physics-informed neural networks for phase-field method in three-phase flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have proved to be a promising method for modeling multiphase flows. However, due to the gradient-direction conflict during the optimization of the coupled strongly nonlinear Allen-Cahn, Cahn-Hilliard, and Navier-Stokes equations, phase-field-based PINNs have not been extended to three-phase flows with phase change. Furthermore, the interface thickness is known to be artificially magnified, whether in numerical or artificial intelligence-based simulations, reducing accuracy. To mitigate these limitations, this study presents a discontinuity-aware physics-informed neural network (DPINN) that solves an energy-stable phase-field model for three-phase flows. It incorporates a discontinuity-aware residual-adaptive architecture to mitigate spectral bias and to automatically detect and model sharp interfaces, and a learnable local artificial-viscosity term to stabilize the algorithm near steep gradients. During optimization, adaptive time-marching and loss-balancing strategies are introduced to reduce long-term error accumulation and to mitigate gradient conflicts in multi-objective training, respectively. In numerical experiments on the two-phase reversed single-vortex and bubble-rising problems, the proposed method accurately resolves sharp interfacial dynamics that conventional PINNs fail to converge. It also extends to a three-phase droplet-icing case with viscosity and density ratios exceeding 7 and 3 orders of magnitude, accurately capturing the phase-change dynamics and the formation of the pointy tip.</description>

      <title>GANDALF: A hardware-agnostic spectral solver for kinetic reduced MHD turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present GANDALF, a JAX-based spectral solver for Kinetic Reduced MHD (KRMHD) turbulence designed to lower infrastructure barriers to plasma turbulence research. Existing production codes require specialized HPC infrastructure and compilation expertise, limiting participation to well-resourced institutions. GANDALF addresses this barrier by leveraging JAX's hardware abstraction to run transparently on laptops, desktop GPUs, and Apple Silicon without modification, enabling single-command installation via pip. We employ Fourier spectral methods for spatial discretization and Hermite spectral basis for velocity space, combined with an exponential integrating factor method that exactly propagates linear Alfv\'en waves, eliminating associated numerical stiffness. Verification demonstrates research-grade accuracy: linear Alfv\'en waves achieve machine precision (~10^{-15} relative error), the Orszag-Tang vortex conserves energy to 10^{-6} over two Alfv\'en times, and driven turbulence reproduces the expected k_perp^{-5/3} cascade spectrum. GANDALF enables rapid prototyping, parameter surveys, and educational applications on commodity hardware. The code complements rather than replaces established solvers like AstroGK and Viriato, prioritizing accessibility for researchers without HPC resources. By removing infrastructure barriers while maintaining spectral accuracy, GANDALF broadens participation in fundamental plasma turbulence research, particularly benefiting students, small research groups, and institutions in developing regions.</description>

      <title>Droplet mobilization in actuated deformable tubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the mobilization of an oil droplet in a deformable, actuated constricted tube subjected to two different actuation mechanisms: hydrodynamic actuation (oscillatory body force in the fluid) and dynamic wall actuation (oscillatory traction on the tube walls). Using high-resolution fluid-structure interaction simulations, we analyze the effects of actuation frequency and amplitude on droplet transport through the constriction. Our simulations show that hydrodynamic actuation leads to a monotonic increase in the droplet's mobilization time with increasing actuation frequency, and a decrease with increasing actuation amplitude. In contrast, dynamic wall actuation exhibits a resonance effect-the mobilization time reaches a minimum at a frequency near the tube's resonant frequency. Our study highlights the potential of actuation mechanisms in deformable tubes for precise control of droplet transport in bio-microfluidic applications.</description>

      <title>An Efficient and Accurate Surrogate Modeling of Flapping Dynamics in Inverted Elastic Foils using Hypergraph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cantilevered elastic foils can undergo self-induced, large-amplitude flapping when subject to fluid flow, a widely observed phenomenon of fluid-structure interaction, from fluttering leaves or the movement of fish fins. When harnessed in steady currents, these oscillations enable the extraction of kinetic energy from the flow. However, accurately predicting these dynamics requires high-fidelity simulations that are prohibitively expensive to perform across the broad configuration space needed for design optimization. To address this, we develop a novel graph neural network (GNN) surrogate for the inverted foil problem, modeled as an elastically mounted rigid foil undergoing trailing-edge pitching in uniform flow. The coupled fluid-structure dynamics are solved using a Petrov-Galerkin finite element method with an arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian formulation, providing high-fidelity data for training and validation. The surrogate uses a rotation-equivariant, quasi-monolithic GNN architecture: structural mesh motion is compressed via proper orthogonal decomposition and advanced through a multilayer perceptron. At the same time, the GNN evolves the flow field consistent with system states. Specifically, this study extends the hypergraph framework to flexible, self-oscillating foils, capturing the nonlinear coupling between vortex dynamics and structural motion. The GNN surrogate achieves less than 1.5% error in predicting tip displacement and force coefficients over thousands of time steps, while accurately reproducing dominant vortex-shedding frequencies. The model captures energy transfer metrics within 3% of full-order simulations, demonstrating both accuracy and long-term stability. These results show a new, efficient surrogate for long-horizon prediction of unsteady flow-structure dynamics in energy-harvesting systems.</description>

      <title>Optimal Control for Rydberg multi-qubit operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing algorithms can be decomposed into a universal set of elementary one- and two-qubit gates. Different physical implementations of quantum computing, however, employ interactions that permit direct conditional dynamics on multiple qubits in a single step. In this work, we leverage quantum optimal control techniques to design single continuous laser pulses that implement multi-qubit controlled-phase, -NOT and -swap (Fredkin) gates on Rydberg atom quantum processors. The identification of robust multi-qubit operations leads to reduced operation time and less decoherence, and the control field provides continuous protection of the atoms from environmental noise. Notably, we find that the controlled-swap (Fredkin) gate, implemented using this approach achieves 99.74\% fidelity while accounting for imperfections such as spontaneous emission, laser fluctuations, and Doppler dephasing.</description>

      <title>Superradiant decay in non-Markovian Waveguide Quantum Electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An array of initially excited emitters coupled to a one-dimensional waveguide exhibits superradiant decay under the Born-Markov approximation, manifested as a coherent burst of photons in the output field. In this work, we employ tensor-network methods to investigate its non-Markovian dynamics induced by finite time delays in photon exchange among the emitters. We find that the superradiant burst breaks into a structured train of correlated photons, each intensity peak corresponding to a specific photon number. We quantify the emitter-photon and emitter-emitter entanglement generated during this process and show that the latter emerges in the long-time limit, as part of the excitation becomes trapped within the emitters' singlet subspace. We finally consider the decay of the system's most radiant state, the symmetric Dicke state, and show that time delay can lead to decay rates exceeding those predicted by the Markovian approximation.</description>

      <title>Solving the six-dimensional Vlasov-Maxwell System with Active Flux and Splitting Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active Flux (AF) is a modified Finite Volume method that evolves additional Degrees of Freedom (DoF) located on the cell interfaces to compute high-order approximations to the numerical fluxes through the respective interface. We present an AF-based scheme for the simulation of collisionless plasmas described by the Vlasov equation coupled with Maxwell's equations. In order to limit the DoF in high dimensional settings we employ operator splitting. The resulting one-dimensional advection equations can be solved efficiently and with low implementation complexity, making it a very fast alternative to standard Finite Volume methods. We compare our scheme's performance with a related Finite Volume method based on the semi-Lagrangian approach. We find that, as a consequence of its compact stencil, the AF scheme has significantly lower dissipation and reduced anisotropy, and thus produces results on par with or even superior to the benchmark for standard test cases reproducing important kinetic phenomena, while also offering lower computational cost.</description>

      <title>Machine-Learned Interatomic Potentials for Structural and Defect Properties of YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-Temperature Superconductors (HTS) such as YBa2Cu3O7-delta (YBCO) are essential for next-generation Tokamak fusion reactors, where Rare-Earth Barium Copper Oxides (REBCO) form the functional layers in HTS magnets. Because YBCO's superconductivity depends strongly on oxygen stoichiometry and defect structure, atomistic simulations can provide crucial insight into radiation-damage mechanisms and pathways to maintain material performance.
  In this work, we develop and benchmark four Machine-Learned Interatomic Potentials (MLPs) for YBCO: the Atomic Cluster Expansion (ACE), the Message-Passing Atomic Cluster Expansion (MACE), the Gaussian Approximation Potential (GAP), and the Tabulated Gaussian Approximation Potential (tabGAP), trained on an extensive Density Functional Theory (DFT) database explicitly designed to include irradiation-damaged-like configurations. The resulting models achieve DFT-level accuracy across a wide range of atomic environments, faithfully capturing the interatomic forces relevant to radiation damage processes.
  Among the tested models, MACE delivers the highest accuracy, although at greater computational cost, while ACE and tabGAP provide an excellent balance between efficiency and fidelity. These machine-learned potentials establish a robust foundation for large-scale molecular dynamics simulations of radiation-induced defect evolution in complex superconducting materials</description>

      <title>A Machine Learning Model for the Chemistry of a Solvated Electron</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In molecular simulations, machine-learning force fields can achieve ab initio accuracy at a lower cost but remain limited in the explicit modeling of electrons. In this work, we develop an electron-aware machine-learning force field, in which an excess electron of interest is modeled quantum mechanically, while the remaining short-range interactions and long-range Coulombic forces are machine-learned to reproduce a density functional theory calculation. We demonstrate the method on the solvated electron in bulk water and its reaction with a hydronium ion. We identify a proton transfer mechanism by which the excess proton recombines with the electron. We determine the forward reaction rates between 350 K and 450 K from first-passage survival functions, which yield an Arrhenius relationship with an activation energy of 3.2 kcal$\cdot$mol$^{-1}$, in good agreement with experiment. From an enhanced sampling simulation, we determine the equilibrium constant, and thus the reaction free energy, which is also consistent with experimental measurements.</description>

      <title>A Finite Element Method for Simulation of Coupled Dynamics of Dislocations and Fracture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a finite element method for simulating dynamic processes that involve the coupled evolution of dislocation motion and crack propagation. The method numerically solves the Concurrent Atomistic-Continuum (CAC) formulation of the conservation of linear momentum. A crystalline material is discretized at the unit-cell level using 6-node prism elements whose geometry allows dislocations and cracks to nucleate and propagate along element facets. Nanoscale simulations of single-crystal Cu, Fe, and Si demonstrate the initiation and propagation of dislocations and cracks, and these results are reproduced by the finite element method in excellent agreement with fully atomistic molecular dynamics simulations. Mesoscale simulations of single-crystal Cu further demonstrate the ability of the method to capture size-dependent brittle and ductile behavior. Under plane-strain conditions the Cu model fractures in a brittle manner, while a fully three-dimensional model exhibits curved and intersecting dislocations that blunt the crack tip and prevent crack propagation, resulting in ductile behavior. The accuracy, efficiency, and applicability of the method are discussed.</description>

      <title>Cosserat micropolar and couple-stress elasticity models of flexomagnetism at finite deformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose geometrically nonlinear (finite) continuum models of flexomagnetism based on the Cosserat micropolar and its descendent couple-stress theory. These models introduce the magneto-mechanical interaction by coupling the micro-dislocation tensor of the micropolar model with the magnetisation vector using a Lifshitz invariant. In contrast to conventional formulations that couple strain-gradients to the magnetisation using fourth-order tensors, our approach relies on third-order tensor couplings by virtue of the micro-dislocation being a second-order tensor. Consequently, the models permit centrosymmetric materials with a single new flexomagnetic constant, and more generally allow cubic-symmetric materials with two such constants. We postulate the flexomagnetic action-functionals and derive the corresponding governing equations using both scalar and vectorial magnetic potential formulations, and present numerical results for a nano-beam geometry, confirming the physical plausibility and computational feasibility of the models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present high-precision ab initio calculations of the four-point vertex function for the three-dimensional uniform electron gas using variational diagrammatic Monte Carlo. From these results, we extract Landau parameters that demonstrate a density-driven crossover from underscreening to overscreening. Guided by our numerical data, we propose a charge-based Kukkonen--Overhauser effective interaction within the local-density approximation, supplemented by a small s-wave correction (sKO$^+$), which accurately captures the electron--electron scattering amplitude. Using our numerically determined scattering amplitude, together with the sKO$^+$ ansatz, we compute the electron-electron contribution to the thermal resistivity, demonstrating excellent agreement with experimental measurements in simple metals.</description>

      <title>Interaction-Driven Chern Insulator at Zero Electric Field in ABCB-Stacked Tetralayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: ABCB-stacked tetralayer graphene, with intrinsic spontaneous polarization, offers a unique platform to explore electron correlation effects, whose interplay with spin-orbit coupling may engender topological phases. Here, employing a $\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{p}$ model with self-consistent Hartree-Fock calculations, we investigate its electronic ground states. Remarkably, we find that the intrinsic polarization, in conjunction with strong interactions ($U=8 \text{ eV}$) and SOC, is sufficient to drive a $C=3$ quantum anomalous Hall state, obviating the need for an external electric field typical in ABCA stacks. Conversely, at moderate interactions ($U=6 \text{ eV}$), a minimal electric field is necessary. Furthermore, calculations predict other correlation-driven metallic phases such as quarter- and three-quarter-filled states. These results establish that the synergy of intrinsic polarization, correlations, and SOC governs the rich topological phenomena, suggesting ABCB-stacked graphene as a highly tunable platform for exploring emergent topological phenomena.</description>

      <title>A Path-Conservative Method for a Weakly Compressible Two-Phase Model with Surface Tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When extended to two-phase flows, weakly compressible models lead to a non-conservative system, which precludes its treatment using standard finite volume techniques. In this paper, a novel HLLC-type path-conservative scheme is formulated for the weakly compressible two-phase model. Furthermore, capillary effects are included in the proposed path-conservative scheme, eliminating the need to discretize surface tension terms separately. The first-order path-conservative formulation is combined with a local solution reconstruction technique to obtain high-order spatial accuracy. The solver is tested on several benchmark two-phase flow problems to demonstrate its efficacy.</description>

      <title>Nature of frontier quasi-particle states in nitrogen-base systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.23171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding photophysical properties of DNA is important: It can help us elucidate and probe the impact of charges and free radicals in the cellular environment. For example, a photoemission at a given nucleobase means that we both charge it and place an electron right next to a neighboring part of the genetic code. Inverse photoemission means that we trap a free electron (at some empty state or resonance), and instead emit a low-energy photon. This may reduce the damage if it happens at an already charged base, but it can cause extra damage if it arises somewhere else. Predicting the nature of sudden optically-driven excitations, termed quasi-particles (QPs), help us detail interactions and possibly control the damage that might follow. Also, these QPs contain information on the larger DNA assembly because they reflect the fingerprints of nucleobase polarity, the hydrogen bonding in Watson-Crick pairs, and the van der Waals (vdW) interactions in the Watson-Crick-pair stacking that makes up the genome. In this study, we utilize the recently developed (optimally tuned) range-separated hybrid vdW density functional, AHBR-mRSH* [JPCM 37, 211501 (2025)] to analyze the electron-attached and ionized QP states of these DNA components, with a particular focus on dipole- and multipole-trapped empty states (bound or resonances). We also evaluate critical properties such as dipole and quadrupole moments, QP HOMO-LUMO energy gaps, and transition-dipole moments. Finally, we classify the Watson-Crick stacked dimers based on their QP nature. This classification provides the foundation for proposing a model of DNA reactivity and photo-physical activity.</description>

      <title>High fidelity simulations of the multi-species Vlasov-Maxwell system with the Numerical Flow Iteration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Validity of fluid models breaks down for non-thermal or weakly collisional plasmas which often occur e.g. in the solar wind. In these regimes one has to resort to modelling through the first-principle Vlasov-Maxwell system, but its six-dimensional phase-space dynamics, strong filamentation, and multi-scale structure make direct numerical simulation extremely demanding. Particle-In-Cell (PIC) methods remain the standard for ion-scale studies, yet their memory cost and intrinsic noise hinder accurate electron-scale simulations. In this paper, we introduce an alternative method based on an iterative-in-time approximation of characteristics. The approach reconstructs the phase-space dynamics from the time history of the electromagnetic fields and the initial distribution functions, enabling extremely high effective resolution far below the phase-space grid scale without storing or advecting high-dimensional data. Earlier work demonstrated this capability for the multi-species electrostatic Vlasov system. Here we discuss an extension of the method to the full Vlasov-Maxwell equations using a Hamiltonian splitting to advance the solution in a structure-preserving way while retaining the reduced memory footprint.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07392v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an optimized implementation of the recently proposed information geometric regularization (IGR) for unprecedented scale simulation of compressible fluid flows applied to multi-engine spacecraft boosters. We improve upon state-of-the-art computational fluid dynamics (CFD) techniques along computational cost, memory footprint, and energy-to-solution metrics. Unified memory on coupled CPU--GPU or APU platforms increases problem size with negligible overhead. Mixed half/single-precision storage and computation on well-conditioned numerics is used. We simulate flow at 200 trillion grid points and 1 quadrillion degrees of freedom, exceeding the current record by a factor of 20. A factor of 4 wall-time speedup is achieved over optimized baselines. Ideal weak scaling is seen on OLCF Frontier, LLNL El Capitan, and CSCS Alps using the full systems. Strong scaling is near ideal at extreme conditions, including 80% efficiency on CSCS Alps with an 8-node baseline and stretching to the full system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19180v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an extension of the tensor grid method for stray field computation on rectangular domains that incorporates higher-order basis functions. Both the magnetization and the resulting magnetic field are represented using higher-order B-spline bases, which allow for increased accuracy and smoothness. The method employs a super-potential formulation, which circumvents the need to convolve with a singular kernel. The field is represented with high accuracy as a functional Tucker tensor, leveraging separable expansions on the tensor product domain and trained via a multilinear extension of the extreme learning machine methodology. Unlike conventional grid-based methods, the proposed mesh-free approach allows for continuous field evaluation. Numerical experiments confirm the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method, demonstrating exponential convergence of the energy and linear computational scaling with respect to the multilinear expansion rank.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03173v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exploration of complex high-dimensional spaces presents significant challenges in fields such as molecular discovery, process optimization, and supply chain management. Genetic Algorithms (GAs), while offering significant power for creating new candidate spaces, often entail high computational demands due to the need for evaluation of each new proposed solution. On the other hand, Deep Kernel Learning (DKL) efficiently navigates the spaces of preselected candidate structures but lacks generative capabilities. This study introduces an approach that amalgamates the generative power of GAs to create new candidates with the efficiency of DKL-based surrogate models to rapidly ascertain the behavior of new candidate spaces. This DKL-GA framework can be further used to build Bayesian Optimization (BO) workflows. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach through the optimization of the FerroSIM model, showcasing its broad applicability to diverse challenges, including molecular discovery and battery charging optimization.</description>

      <title>Fast Solvers for Discrete Diffusion Models: Theory and Applications of High-Order Algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00234v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Discrete diffusion models have emerged as a powerful generative modeling framework for discrete data with successful applications spanning from text generation to image synthesis. However, their deployment faces challenges due to the high dimensionality of the state space, necessitating the development of efficient inference algorithms. Current inference approaches mainly fall into two categories: exact simulation and approximate methods such as $\tau$-leaping. While exact methods suffer from unpredictable inference time and redundant function evaluations, $\tau$-leaping is limited by its first-order accuracy. In this work, we advance the latter category by tailoring the first extension of high-order numerical inference schemes to discrete diffusion models, enabling larger step sizes while reducing error. We rigorously analyze the proposed schemes and establish the second-order accuracy of the $\theta$-Trapezoidal method in KL divergence. Empirical evaluations on GSM8K-level math-reasoning, GPT-2-level text, and ImageNet-level image generation tasks demonstrate that our method achieves superior sample quality compared to existing approaches under equivalent computational constraints, with consistent performance gains across models ranging from 200M to 8B.

      <title>Enhanced Sampling for Efficient Learning of Coarse-Grained Machine Learning Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11148v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coarse-graining (CG) enables molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of larger systems and longer timescales that are otherwise infeasible with atomistic models. Machine learning potentials (MLPs), with their capacity to capture many-body interactions, can provide accurate approximations of the potential of mean force (PMF) in CG models. Current CG MLPs are typically trained in a bottom-up manner via force matching, which in practice relies on configurations sampled from the unbiased equilibrium Boltzmann distribution to ensure thermodynamic consistency. This convention poses two key limitations: first, sufficiently long atomistic trajectories are needed to reach convergence; and second, even once equilibrated, transition regions remain poorly sampled. To address these issues, we employ enhanced sampling to bias along CG degrees of freedom for data generation, and then recompute the forces with respect to the unbiased potential. This strategy simultaneously shortens the simulation time required to produce equilibrated data and enriches sampling in transition regions, while preserving the correct PMF. We demonstrate its effectiveness on the M\"uller-Brown potential and capped alanine, achieving notable improvements. Our findings support the use of enhanced sampling for force matching as a promising direction to improve the accuracy and reliability of CG MLPs.</description>

      <title>A stochastic branching particle method for solving non-conservative reaction-diffusion equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27615v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a stochastic branching particle-based method for solving nonlinear non-conservative advection-diffusion-reaction equations. The method splits the evolution into an advection-diffusion step, based on a linearized Kolmogorov forward equation and approximated by stochastic particle transport, and a reaction step implemented through a branching birth-death process that provides a consistent temporal discretization of the underlying reaction dynamics. This construction yields a mesh-free, nonnegativity-preserving scheme that naturally accommodates non-conservative systems and remains robust in the presence of singularities or blow-up. We validate the method on two representative two-dimensional systems: the Allen-Cahn equation and the Keller-Segel chemotaxis model. In both cases, the present method accurately captures nonlinear behaviors such as phase separation and aggregation, and achieves reliable performance without the need for adaptive mesh refinement.</description>

Abstract: When simulating multiscale systems, where some fields cannot be fully prescribed despite their effects on the simulation's accuracy, closure models are needed. This phenomenon is observed in turbulent fluid dynamics, where Large Eddy Simulations (LES) depict global behavior while turbulence modeling introduces dissipation correspondent to smaller sub-grid scales. Recently, scientific machine learning techniques have emerged to address this problem by integrating traditional (physics-based) equations with data-driven (machine-learned) models, typically coupling numerical solvers with neural networks. This work presents a comprehensive workflow, encompassing high-fidelity data generation and post-processing, a priori learning, and a posteriori testing, where data-driven models enrich differential equations.</description>

      <title>Physics Steering: Causal Control of Cross-Domain Concepts in a Physics Foundation Model</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in mechanistic interpretability have revealed that large language models (LLMs) develop internal representations corresponding not only to concrete entities but also distinct, human-understandable abstract concepts and behaviour. Moreover, these hidden features can be directly manipulated to steer model behaviour. However, it remains an open question whether this phenomenon is unique to models trained on inherently structured data (ie. language, images) or if it is a general property of foundation models. In this work, we investigate the internal representations of a large physics-focused foundation model. Inspired by recent work identifying single directions in activation space for complex behaviours in LLMs, we extract activation vectors from the model during forward passes over simulation datasets for different physical regimes. We then compute "delta" representations between the two regimes. These delta tensors act as concept directions in activation space, encoding specific physical features. By injecting these concept directions back into the model during inference, we can steer its predictions, demonstrating causal control over physical behaviours, such as inducing or removing some particular physical feature from a simulation. These results suggest that scientific foundation models learn generalised representations of physical principles. They do not merely rely on superficial correlations and patterns in the simulations. Our findings open new avenues for understanding and controlling scientific foundation models and has implications for AI-enabled scientific discovery.</description>

      <title>Direct numerical simulation of thermo-diffusively unstable premixed hydrogen-air flames in a fully-developed turbulent channel flow at $Re_\tau=530$</title>

Abstract: Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) of premixed hydrogen-air flames anchored in a fully-developed turbulent channel flow (TCF) are performed at a friction Reynolds number of $\mathrm{Re}_\tau=530$ and thermochemical conditions susceptible to the emergence of intrinsic thermo-diffusive (TD) phenomena acting on the turbulent flame. Two premixed flames are studied: a slower flame ($\varphi=0.25$), predominantly propagating within the core flow, and a faster one ($\varphi=0.35$), reaching closer to the channel walls and intermittently quenching on it.
  The present DNS database provides new insights into the characteristics of premixed flames susceptible to TD phenomena and propagating in realistic near-wall shear turbulence. The influence of varying turbulence intensity, and of wall-distance dependent time and length scales, on the flame propagation characteristics is evaluated through a detailed analysis of the local stretch factor $I_0$, quantifying reactivity enhancements caused by TD phenomena.
  At $\varphi=0.25$, the flame response to the fluid motions is mainly forced by the weaker turbulence present in the core flow. This results in an augmented $I_0$ compared to the laminar reference value, suggesting reactivity enhancement by the strongly non-linear interaction of TD phenomena with (relatively) weak turbulent motions present within the core flow. At $\varphi=0.35$, as the flame propagates from the core flow towards the channel walls, the flame response is forced by turbulence of increasing intensity, resulting in a corresponding augmentation of the Karlovitz number. Crucially, as the flame propagates into the near-wall region, the peak value of $I_0$ is co-located with the peak Reynolds stresses ($y^+ \sim 10$). This observation suggests a strong (local) synergistic interaction between TD phenomena and wall turbulence, ultimately resulting in significantly enhanced flame speed.</description>
