      <title>The curve-lengthening flow in inversive geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider an invariant gradient flow for the invariant length functional for co-compact curves in inversive geometry, and prove that solutions exist for all time and converge to loxodromic curves, provided the initial curve is admissible (so that the invariant length element is well defined).</description>

      <title>Positive mass theorems on singular spaces and some applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the dimension reduction techniques employed in the study of the geometry of manifolds with positive scalar curvature, we establish several positive mass theorems for certain singular spaces (see Theorem \ref{thm:pmt with singularity4} and Theorem \ref{thm:rigidity with singularity4} below). In these results, we assume only that the scalar curvature is non-negative in a strong spectral sense, which aligns well with the stability condition of a minimal hypersurface in an ambient manifold with non-negative scalar curvature. As an application, we provide a characterization of asymptotically flat (AF) manifolds with arbitrary ends, non-negative scalar curvature, and dimension less than or equal to 8 (see Theorem \ref{thm: 8dim Schoen conj} below). This also leads to positive mass theorems for AF manifolds with arbitrary ends and dimension less than or equal to $8$ without using N.Smale's regularity theorem for minimal hypersurfaces in a compact $8$-dimensional manifold with generic metrics.</description>

      <title>Existence of Constant Mean Curvature Surfaces in Asymptotically Flat and Asymptotically Hyperbolic Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the existence of compact surfaces with prescribed constant mean curvature in asymptotically flat and asymptotically hyperbolic manifolds. More precisely, let $(M^3,g)$ be an asymptotically flat manifold with scalar curvature $R\ge 0$. Then, for each constant $c&gt;0$, there exists a compact, almost-embedded, free boundary constant mean curvature surface $\Sigma \subset M$ with mean curvature $c$. Likewise, let $(M^3,g)$ be an asymptotically hyperbolic manifold with scalar curvature $R\ge -6$. Then, for each constant $c&gt;2$, there exists a compact, almost-embedded, free boundary constant mean curvature surface $\Sigma \subset M$ with mean curvature $c$. The proof combines min-max theory with the following fact about inverse mean curvature flow which is of independent interest: for any $T$ the inverse mean curvature flow emerging out of a point $p$ far enough out in an asymptotically flat (or asymptotically hyperbolic) end will remain smooth for all times $t\in (-\infty,T]$.</description>

Abstract: We derive the stability result of the dual curvature measure with near constant density in the even case. As an application, the uniqueness and existence of solutions to the even dual Minkowski problem in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ are obtained for $n\geq 1$, provided the density of the measure is close to 1 in $C^{\alpha}$ norm with $\alpha\in (0,1)$.</description>

      <title>A Note on Moving Frames along Sobolev Maps and the Regularity of Weakly Harmonic Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this note is twofold. First we show that, for weakly differentiable maps between Riemannian manifolds of any dimension, a smallness condition on a Morrey-norm of the gradient is sufficient to guarantee that the pulled-back tangent bundle is trivialised by a finite-energy frame over simply connected regions in the domain. This is achieved via new structure equations for a connection introduced by Rivi\`ere in the study of weakly harmonic maps, combined with Coulomb-frame methods and the Hardy-BMO duality of Fefferman-Stein. We also prove that for weakly harmonic maps from domains of any dimension into closed homogeneous targets, a smallness condition on the BMO seminorm of the map is sufficient to obtain full regularity.</description>

      <title>A microlocal pathway to spectral asymmetry: curl and the eta invariant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The notion of eta invariant is traditionally defined by means of analytic continuation. We prove, by examining the particular case of the operator curl, that the eta invariant can equivalently be obtained as the trace of the difference of positive and negative spectral projections, appropriately regularised. Our construction is direct, in the sense that it does not involve analytic continuation, and is based on the use of pseudodifferential techniques. This provides a novel approach to the study of spectral asymmetry of non-semibounded (pseudo)differential systems on manifolds which encompasses and extends previous results.</description>

      <title>Compatible almost complex structures on the Hard Lefschetz condition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16948v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a compact K\"ahler manifold, it is well-established that its de Rham cohomology satisfies the Hard Lefschetz condition, which is reflected in the equality between the Betti numbers and the Hodge numbers. A special subclass of symplectic manifolds also adheres to this condition. Cirici and Wilson \cite{CW20} employ the variant Hodge number to propose a sufficient criterion for compact almost K\"ahler manifolds to satisfy this condition. In this paper, we show that this condition is only sufficient by presenting examples of compact almost K\"ahler manifolds that fulfill the Hard Lefschetz condition while violating the equality between the variant Hodge numbers and Betti numbers, that is, \[b^1&gt;2h^{1,0}.\] This phenomenon contrasts with the behavior observed in compact K\"ahler manifolds.</description>

      <title>On the homotopy invariance of the twisted Lie algebroid cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19750v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Twisted Lie algebroid cohomologies, i.e. with values in representations, are shown to be Lie algebroid homotopy-invariant. Several important classes of examples are discussed. As an application, a generalized version of the Poincar\'e lemma is given in the transitive case. Together with the Mayer- Vietoris theorem, which holds in this more general context as well, this leads to a K\"unneth formula for the cohomologies of Lie algebroids with values in representations.</description>

      <title>Parallel spinors for $\mathrm{G}_2^*$ and isotropic structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08553v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain a correspondence between irreducible real parallel spinors on pseudo-Riemannian manifolds $(M,g)$ of signature $(4,3)$ and solutions of an associated differential system for three-forms that satisfy a homogeneous algebraic equation of order two in the K\"ahler-Atiyah bundle of $(M,g)$. Applying this general framework, we obtain an intrinsic algebraic characterization of $\mathrm{G}_2^*$-structures as well as the first explicit description of isotropic irreducible spinors in signature $(4,3)$ that are parallel under a general connection on the spinor bundle. This description is given in terms of a coherent system of mutually orthogonal and isotropic one forms and follows from the characterization of the stabilizer of an isotropic spinor as the stabilizer of a highly degenerate three-form that we construct explicitly. Using this result, we show that isotropic spinors parallel under a metric connection with torsion exist when the connection preserves the aforementioned coherent system. This allows us to construct a natural class of metrics of signature $(4,3)$ on $\mathbb{R}^7$ that admit spinors parallel under a metric connection with torsion.</description>

      <title>Manifold GCN: Diffusion-based Convolutional Neural Network for Manifold-valued Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14381v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose two graph neural network layers for graphs with features in a Riemannian manifold. First, based on a manifold-valued graph diffusion equation, we construct a diffusion layer that can be applied to an arbitrary number of nodes and graph connectivity patterns. Second, we model a tangent multilayer perceptron by transferring ideas from the vector neuron framework to our general setting. Both layers are equivariant under node permutations and the feature manifold's isometries. These properties have led to a beneficial inductive bias in many deep-learning tasks. Numerical examples on synthetic data and an Alzheimer's classification application on triangle meshes of the right hippocampus demonstrate the usefulness of our new layers: While they apply to a much broader class of problems, they perform as well as or better than task-specific state-of-the-art networks.</description>

      <title>The curvature exponent of sub-Finsler Heisenberg groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14619v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The curvature exponent $N_{\mathrm{curv}}$ of a metric measure space is the smallest number $N$ for which the measure contraction property $\mathsf{MCP}(0,N)$ holds. In this paper, we study the curvature exponent of sub-Finsler Heisenberg groups equipped with the Lebesgue measure. We prove that $N_{\mathrm{curv}} \geq 5$, and the equality holds if and only if the corresponding sub-Finsler Heisenberg group is actually sub-Riemannian. Furthermore, we show that for every $N\geq 5$, there is a sub-Finsler structure on the Heisenberg group such that $N_{\mathrm{curv}}=N$.</description>
