      <title>Ancient and expanding spin ALE Ricci flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We classify spin ALE ancient Ricci flows and spin ALE expanding solitons with suitable groups at infinity. In particular, the only spin ancient Ricci flows with groups at infinity in $SU(2)$ and mild decay at infinity are hyperk\"ahler ALE metrics. The main idea of the proof, of independent interest, consists in showing that the large-scale behavior of Perelman's $\mu$-functional on any ALE orbifold with non-negative scalar curvature is controlled by a renormalized $\lambda_{\mathrm{ALE}}$-functional related to a notion of weighted mass.</description>

      <title>Proper quasi-homogeneous domains of the Einstein universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Einstein universe $\mathbf{Ein}^{p,q}$ of signature $(p,q)$ is a pseudo-Riemannian analogue of the conformal sphere; it is the conformal compactification of the pseudo-Riemannian Minkowski space. For $p,q \geq 1$, we show that, up to a conformal transformation, there is only one domain in $\mathbf{Ein}^{p,q}$ that is bounded in a suitable stereographic projection and whose action by its conformal group is cocompact. This domain, which we call a diamond, is a model for the symmetric space of $\operatorname{PO}(p,1) \times \operatorname{PO}(1,q)$. We deduce a classification of closed conformally flat manifolds with proper development.</description>

      <title>Nilmanifolds with non-nilpotent complex structures and their pseudo-K\"ahler geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We classify nilpotent Lie algebras with complex structures of weakly non-nilpotent type in real dimension eight, which is the lowest dimension where they arise. Our study, together with previous results on strongly non-nilpotent structures, completes the classification of 8-dimensional nilpotent Lie algebras admitting complex structures of non-nilpotent type. As an application, we identify those that support a pseudo-K\"ahler metric, thus providing new counterexamples to a previous conjecture and an infinite family of (Ricci-flat) non-flat neutral Calabi-Yau structures. Moreover, we arrive at the topological restriction $b_1(X)\geq 3$ for every pseudo-K\"ahler nilmanifold $X$ with invariant complex structure, up to complex dimension four.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On a spacetime $(M,g)$ endowed with a density function $h$, we consider the vacuum weighted Einstein field equations: \[h\rho-\operatorname{Hes}_h+\Delta h g=0.\] First, it is shown that the equation characterizes critical metrics for an appropriate action. Then, after describing locally conformally flat solutions in arbitrary dimension, four-dimensional solutions with harmonic curvature are classified.</description>

      <title>$L^2$-harmonic forms and spinors on stable minimal hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $f:N\rightarrow (M,g)$ be an oriented (or spin), complete, stable, minimal, immersed hypersurface. In this paper we establish various vanishing theorems for the space of $L^2$-harmonic forms and spinors (in the spin case) under suitable positive curvature assumptions on the ambient manifold. Our results in the setting of forms extend to higher dimensions and more general ambient Riemannian manifolds previous vanishing theorems due to Tanno \cite{Tanno} and Zhu \cite{Zhu}. In the setting of spin manifolds our results allow to conclude, for instance, that any oriented, complete, stable, minimal, immersed hypersurface of $\mathbb{R}^m$ or $\mathbb{S}^m$ carries no non-trivial $L^2$-harmonic spinors. Finally, analogous results are proved for strongly stable constant mean curvature hypersurfaces.</description>

      <title>A note on the regularity and the existence of Riemannian splines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a comprehensive proof concerning the regularity of critical points for the spline energy functional on Riemannian manifolds, even for the general higher-order case. Although this result is widely acknowledged in the literature, a detailed proof was previously absent. Our proof relies on a generalization of the DuBois-Reymond Lemma. Furthermore, we establish the existence of minimizers for the spline energy functional in cases where multiple interpolation points are prescribed alongside just one velocity.</description>

      <title>On the Nirenberg problem on spheres: Arbitrarily many solutions in a perturbative setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a smooth positive function $K$ on the standard sphere $(\mathbb{S}^n,g_0)$, we use Morse theoretical methods and counting index formulae to prove that, under generic conditions on the function $K$, there are arbitrarily many metrics $g$ conformally equivalent to $g_0$ and whose scalar curvature is given by the function $K$ provided that the function is sufficiently close to the scalar curvature of $g_0$. Our approach leverages a comprehensive characterization of blowing-up solutions of a subcritical approximation, along with various Morse relations involving their indices. Notably, this multiplicity result is achieved without relying on any symmetry or periodicity assumptions about the function $K$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that, inside the Shilov boundary of any given Hermitian symmetric space of tube type, there is, up to isomorphism, only one proper domain whose action by its automorphism group is cocompact. This gives a classification of all closed proper manifolds locally modelled on such Shilov boundaries, and provides a positive answer, in the case of flag manifolds admitting a $\Theta$-positive structure, to a rigidity question of Limbeek and Zimmer.</description>

      <title>Prescribing almost constant curvatures on manifolds with boundary</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a boundary case of the classical prescribed curvature problem. We focus on prescribing the scalar curvature function K and the boundary mean curvature H on the standard ball. Our analysis extendes previous studies by considering the scenario where the curvatures K and H are close to constants. Using a perturbative approach and leveraging the ansatz introduced by Han and Li, we establish new existence results for the conformal metric when the prescribed curvatures are near constants</description>

      <title>Analytic theory of Legendre-type transformations for a Frobenius manifold</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.04200v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $M$ be an $n$-dimensional Frobenius manifold. Fix $\kappa\in\{1,\dots,n\}$. Assuming certain invertibility, Dubrovin introduced the Legendre-type transformation $S_\kappa$, which transforms $M$ to an $n$-dimensional Frobenius manifold $S_\kappa(M)$. In this paper, we show that these $S_\kappa(M)$ share the same monodromy data at the Fuchsian singular point of the Dubrovin connection, and that for the case when $M$ is semisimple they also share the same Stokes matrix and the same central connection matrix. A straightforward application of the monodromy identification is the following: if we know the monodromy data of some semisimple Frobenius manifold $M$, we immediately obtain those of its Legendre-type transformations. Another application gives the identification between the $\kappa$th partition function of a semisimple Frobenius manifold $M$ and the topological partition function of $S_{\kappa}(M)$.</description>

Abstract: A new curvature obstruction to the existence of a timelike (resp. causal) Killing or homothetic vector field $X$ on an even-dimensional (odd-dimensional) Lorentzian manifold, in terms of its timelike (resp. null) sectional curvature is given. As a consequence for the compact case, the well-known Gauss-Bonnet-Chern obstruction to the existence of semi-Riemannian metrics is extended from non-zero constant sectional curvature to non-zero timelike sectional curvature on $X$.</description>

Abstract: We study some properties of the $3$-dimensional manifold $\mathbb R^3$ with a diagonal Riemannian metric as an almost $\eta$-Ricci soliton from the following points of view: under certain assumptions, we determine the potential vector field if $\eta$ is given; we get obstructions on the metric when the potential vector field has a particular expression; we compute the defining functions of the soliton when both the potential vector field and the $1$-form are prescribed. Moreover, we find conditions for the manifold to be flat or Ricci-flat. Based on the theoretical results, we provide examples.</description>

      <title>On rigidity of conformal submersions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15493v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conformal submersions are generalizations of Riemannian submersions where the differential of the submersion map is a conformal isometry when restricted to the horizontal distribution. Riemannian submersions have been instrumental in the construction of new Riemannian metrics from existing ones. Therefore, being generalizations of Riemannian submersions, conformal submersions are potential tools for constructing new examples of (special) Riemannian manifolds. A conformal submersion is said to be rigid if it reduces to a Riemannian submersion up to homothety. In this paper, we study curvature conditions that force conformal submersions to be rigid. Moreover, under suitable circumstances, using these rigidity criteria for conformal submersions, we conclude the rigidity of certain quasi-Einstein metrics.</description>

      <title>Sharp Sobolev inequalities on noncompact Riemannian manifolds with ${\sf Ric}\geq 0$ via Optimal Transport theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.03527v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In their seminal work, Cordero-Erausquin, Nazaret and Villani [Adv. Math., 2004] proved sharp Sobolev inequalities in Euclidean spaces via Optimal Mass Transportation, raising the question whether their approach is powerful enough to produce sharp Sobolev inequalities also on Riemannian manifolds. In this paper we affirmatively answer their question for Riemannian manifolds with non-negative Ricci curvature; namely, by using Optimal Mass Transportation with quadratic distance cost, sharp $L^p$-Sobolev and $L^p$-logarithmic Sobolev inequalities (both for $p&gt;1$ and $p=1$) are established, where the optimal constants contain the asymptotic volume growth arising from precise asymptotic properties of the Talentian and Gaussian bubbles. As a byproduct, we give an alternative, elementary proof to the main result of do Carmo and Xia [Compos. Math., 2004] (and subsequent results) concerning the quantitative volume non-collapsing estimates on Riemannian manifolds with non-negative Ricci curvature that support certain Sobolev inequalities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07847v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we define canonical lifts of vector fields to the multisymplectic multimomentum bundles of De Donder-Weyl Hamiltonian first-order field theories and to the appropriate premultisymplectic embedded constraint submanifolds on which singular field theories are studied. These new canonical lifts are used to study the so-called natural Noether symmetries present in both regular and singular Hamiltonian field theories along with their associated conserved quantities obtained from Noether's theorem. The Klein-Gordon field, the Polyakov bosonic string, and Einstein-Cartan gravity in 3 + 1 dimensions are analyzed in depth as applications of these concepts; as a peripheral result obtained in the analysis of the bosonic string, we provide a new geometrical interpretation of the well-known Virasoro constraint.</description>

      <title>Geometric Generative Models based on Morphological Equivariant PDEs and GANs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14897v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Content and image generation consist in creating or generating data from noisy information by extracting specific features such as texture, edges, and other thin image structures. We are interested here in generative models, and two main problems are addressed. Firstly, the improvements of specific feature extraction while accounting at multiscale levels intrinsic geometric features; and secondly, the equivariance of the network to reduce its complexity and provide a geometric interpretability. To proceed, we propose a geometric generative model based on an equivariant partial differential equation (PDE) for group convolution neural networks (G-CNNs), so called PDE-G-CNNs, built on morphology operators and generative adversarial networks (GANs). Equivariant morphological PDE layers are composed of multiscale dilations and erosions formulated in Riemannian manifolds, while group symmetries are defined on a Lie group. We take advantage of the Lie group structure to properly integrate the equivariance in layers, and are able to use the Riemannian metric to solve the multiscale morphological operations. Each point of the Lie group is associated with a unique point in the manifold, which helps us derive a metric on the Riemannian manifold from a tensor field invariant under the Lie group so that the induced metric has the same symmetries. The proposed geometric morphological GAN (GM-GAN) is obtained by using the proposed morphological equivariant convolutions in PDE-G-CNNs to bring nonlinearity in classical CNNs. GM-GAN is evaluated on MNIST data and compared with GANs. Preliminary results show that GM-GAN model outperforms classical GAN.</description>
