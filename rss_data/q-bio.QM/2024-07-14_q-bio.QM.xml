      <title>Microbial and Viral Ecology Analysis for Metagenomic Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The explosion in known microbial diversity in the last two decades has made it abundantly clear that microbes in the environment do not exist in isolation; they are members of communities. Accordingly, omics approaches such as metagenomics have revealed that interactions between diverse groups of community members such as archaea, bacteria, and viruses (bacteriophage) are common and have significant impacts on entire microbiomes. Thus, to have a well-developed understanding of microbes as they naturally exist in the environment, biological entities of all kinds must be studied together. While numerous protocols for metagenome analysis exist, comprehensive published protocols for the simultaneous analysis of viruses and prokaryotes together are scarce. Further, as bioinformatic methods for microbiology rapidly advance, existing metagenomic tools and pipelines require frequent reevaluation. This ensures the adherence of best practices for microbiome and metagenomic data analysis. Here, we offer an expansive approach for the joint analysis of bulk sequence data from a mixed microbial community (metagenomes) and viral-sized fraction communities (viromes). This chapter serves as a beginner's-level guide for researchers with limited bioinformatics expertise who wish to engage in multi-scale metagenome and virome analyses. We cover steps from initial study design to sequence read processing, metagenome assembly, quality control, virus identification, microbial and viral genome binning, taxonomic characterization, species-level clustering, and host-virus predictions. We also provide the bioinformatic scripts used in our workflow for reuse in one's own computational methods. Lastly, we discuss additional approaches a researcher can take after processing data with this workflow.</description>

      <title>Topology-enhanced machine learning model (Top-ML) for anticancer peptide prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, therapeutic peptides have demonstrated great promise for cancer treatment. To explore powerful anticancer peptides, artificial intelligence (AI)-based approaches have been developed to systematically screen potential candidates. However, the lack of efficient featurization of peptides has become a bottleneck for these machine-learning models. In this paper, we propose a topology-enhanced machine learning model (Top-ML) for anticancer peptide prediction. Our Top-ML employs peptide topological features derived from its sequence "connection" information characterized by vector and spectral descriptors. Our Top-ML model has been validated on two widely used AntiCP 2.0 benchmark datasets and has achieved state-of-the-art performance. Our results highlight the potential of leveraging novel topology-based featurization to accelerate the identification of anticancer peptides.</description>

      <title>Parameter Estimation and Identifiability in Kinetic Flux Profiling Models of Metabolism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metabolic fluxes are the rates of life-sustaining chemical reactions within a cell and metabolites are the components. Determining the changes in these fluxes is crucial to understanding diseases with metabolic causes and consequences. Kinetic flux profiling (KFP) is a method for estimating flux that utilizes data from isotope tracing experiments. In these experiments, the isotope-labeled nutrient is metabolized through a pathway and integrated into the downstream metabolite pools. Measurements of proportion labeled for each metabolite in the pathway are taken at multiple time points and used to fit an ordinary differential equations model with fluxes as parameters. We begin by generalizing the process of converting diagrams of metabolic pathways into mathematical models composed of differential equations and algebraic constraints. The scaled differential equations for proportions of unlabeled metabolite contain parameters related to the metabolic fluxes in the pathway. We investigate flux parameter identifiability given data collected only at the steady state of the differential equation. Next, we give criteria for valid parameter estimations in the case of a large separation of timescales with fast-slow analysis. Bayesian parameter estimation on simulated data from KFP experiments containing both irreversible and reversible reactions illustrates the accuracy and reliability of flux estimations. These analyses provide constraints that serve as guidelines for the design of KFP experiments to estimate metabolic fluxes.</description>
