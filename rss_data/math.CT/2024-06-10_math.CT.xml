      <title>Categorical Theory of $(\infty,\omega)$-Categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This text is dedicated to the development of the theory of $(\infty,\omega)$-categories. We present generalizations of standard results from category theory, such as the lax Grothendieck construction, the Yoneda lemma, lax (co)limits and lax Kan extensions, among others.</description>

      <title>Oracle modalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a new formulation of Turing reducibility in terms of higher modalities, inspired by an embedding of the Turing degrees in the lattice of subtoposes of the effective topos discovered by Hyland. In this definition, higher modalities play a similar role to I/O monads or dialogue trees in allowing a function to receive input from an external oracle. However, in homotopy type theory they have better logical properties than monads: they are compatible with higher types, and each modality corresponds to a reflective subuniverse that under suitable conditions is itself a model of homotopy type theory.
  We give synthetic proofs of some basic results about Turing reducibility in cubical type theory making use of two axioms of Markov induction and computable choice. Both axioms are variants of axioms already studied in the effective topos. We show they hold in certain reflective subuniverses of cubical assemblies, demonstrate their use in some simple proofs in synthetic computability theory using modalities, and show they are downwards absolute for oracle modalities. These results have been formalised using cubical mode of the Agda proof assistant.
  We explore some first connections between Turing reducibility and homotopy theory. This includes a synthetic proof that two Turing degrees are equal as soon as they induce isomorphic permutation groups on the natural numbers, making essential use of both Markov induction and the formulation of groups in HoTT as pointed, connected, 1-truncated types. We also give some simple non-topological examples of modalities in cubical assemblies based on these ideas, to illustrate what we expect higher dimensional analogues of the Turing degrees to look like.</description>

      <title>Relative tilting theory in abelian categories I: Auslander-Buchweitz-Reiten approximations theory in subcategories and cotorsion pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.11361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2104.11361v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce a special kind of relative (co)resolutions associated to a pair of classes of objects in an abelian category $\mathcal{C}.$ We will see that, by studying these relative (co)resolutions, we get a possible generalization of a part of the Auslander-Buchweitz approximation theory that is useful for developing $n$-$\mathcal{X}$-tilting theory in [4]. With this goal, new concepts as $\mathcal{X}$-complete and $\mathcal{X}$-hereditary pairs are introduced as a generalization of complete and hereditary cotorsion pairs. These pairs appear in a natural way in the study of the category of representations of a quiver in an abelian category [5]. Our main results will include an existence theorem for relative approximations, among other results related with closure properties of relative (co)resolution classes and relative homological dimensions which are essential in the development of $n$-$\mathcal{X}$-tilting theory in [4].</description>

      <title>Amortized Analysis via Coalgebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03641v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Amortized analysis is a cost analysis technique for data structures in which cost is studied in aggregate, rather than considering the maximum cost of a single operation. Traditionally, amortized analysis has been phrased inductively, in terms of finite sequences of operations. Connecting to prior work on coalgebraic semantics for data structures, we develop the perspective that amortized analysis is naturally viewed coalgebraically in the category of algebras for a cost monad, where a morphism of coalgebras serves as a first-class generalization of potential function suitable for integrating cost and behavior. Using this simple definition, we consider amortization of other sample effects, non-commutative printing and randomization. To support imprecise amortized upper bounds, we adapt our discussion to the bicategorical setting, where a potential function is a colax morphism of coalgebras. We support parallel data structure usage patterns by using coalgebras for an endoprofunctor instead of an endofunctor, combining potential using a monoidal structure on the underlying category. Finally, we compose amortization arguments in the indexed category of coalgebras to implement one amortized data structure in terms of others.</description>

      <title>Gabriel-Ulmer Duality for Topoi, An Introduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04965v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to relate the classical result of Gabriel-Ulmer to the geometry of topoi. The usage of the attribute 'left exact' when dealing with functors involved in this duality is indeed not casual and it is related to the geometrical side of the story, i.e. sheaf theory, as in \cite{SGA}. Thought to be a very basic introduction to the subject, it is mostly self-contained. The reader is assumed to be familiar with the fundamentals of category theory, no further prerequisite knowledge is required. The proof of Gabriel-Ulmer duality follows \cite{MP}.</description>
