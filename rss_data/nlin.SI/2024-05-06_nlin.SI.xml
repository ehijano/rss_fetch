      <title>Tetrahedron duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A certain two-dimensional supersymmetric gauge theory is argued to satisfy a relation that promotes the Zamolodchikov tetrahedron equation to an infrared duality between two quantum field theories. Solutions of the tetrahedron equation with continuous spin variables are obtained from partition functions of this theory and its variants.</description>

      <title>The Ising Model Coupled to 2D Gravity: Higher-order Painlev\'{e} Equations/The $(3,4)$ String Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In continuation of the work [1], we study a higher-order Painlev\'{e}-type equation, arising as a string equation of the $3^{rd}$ order reduction of the KP hierarchy. This equation appears at the multi-critical point of the $2$-matrix model with quartic interactions, and describes the Ising phase transition coupled to 2D gravity. We characterize this equation in terms of the isomonodromic deformations of a particular rational connection on $\mathbb{P}^{1}$. We also identify the (nonautonomous) Hamiltonian structure associated to this equation, and write a suitable $\tau$-differential for this system. This $\tau$-differential can be extended to the canonical coordinates of the associated Hamiltonian system, allowing us to verify Conjectures 1. and 2. of [2] in our case. We also present a fairly general formula for the $\tau$-differential of a special class of resonant connections, which is somewhat simpler than that of [3].

      <title>Potentialisations of a class of fully-nonlinear symmetry-integrable evolution equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05722v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider here the class of fully-nonlinear symmetry-integrable third-order evolution equations in 1+1 dimensions that were proposed recently in the journal Open Communications in Nonlinear Mathematical Physics, vol. 2, 216--228 (2022). In particular, we report all zero-order and higher-order potentialisations for this class of equations using their integrating factors (or multipliers) up to order four. Chains of connecting evolution equations are also obtained by multi-potentialisations.</description>

      <title>Symplectic mechanics of relativistic spinning compact bodies II.: Canonical formalism in the Schwarzschild spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05049v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work constitutes the second part of a series of studies that aim to utilise tools from Hamiltonian mechanics to investigate the motion of an extended body in general relativity. The first part of this work [Refs. [1, 2]] constructed a ten-dimensional, covariant Hamiltonian framework encompassing all the linear-in-spin corrections to the geodesic motion in arbitrary spacetime. This framework was proven to be integrable in the Schwarzschild and Kerr spacetimes, specifically. The present work translates this abstract integrability result into tangible applications for linear-in-spin Hamiltonian dynamics of a compact object in a Schwarzschild spacetime. In particular, a canonical system of coordinates is constructed explicitly, which exploits the spherical symmetry of the Schwarzschild spacetime. These coordinates are based on a relativistic generalization of the classical Andoyer variables of Newtonian rigid body motion. This canonical setup allows us to derive ready-to-use formulae for action-angle coordinates and gauge-invariant Hamiltonian frequencies, which automatically include all linear-in-spin effects. No external parameters or ad hoc choices are necessary, and the framework can be used to find complete solutions by quadrature of generic (bound or unbound), linear-in-spin orbits, including orbital inclination, precession and eccentricity, as well as spin precession. The efficacy of the formalism is demonstrated here in the context of circular orbits with arbitrary spin and orbital precession, with the results validated against known results in the literature.</description>
