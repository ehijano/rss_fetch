      <description>arXiv:2512.11991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advancing the chemical synthesis of crystals is important for both fundamental research and practical applications of quantum materials. While established bulk-phase and thin-film growth methods have enabled enormous progress, synthesizing single crystals suitable for quantum electronic discoveries remains challenging for many emerging materials. Here, we introduce van der Waals (vdW) stacks as nanochemical reactors for single-crystal synthesis and demonstrate their broad applicability in growing both elemental and compound crystals at the micrometer scale. By encapsulating atomically thin reactants that are stacked compactly with inert vdW layers such as hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), we achieve nanoconfined synthesis with the resulting crystals remaining encapsulated. As proof of concept, we synthesized isolated single crystals of elemental tellurium and distinct types of Pd-Te compounds. Structural characterization, including atomic-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy, confirms the high crystalline quality of the products. We confirm the intrinsic semiconducting gap of tellurium and observe that non-stoichiometric PdTe1-x with a significantly reduced Te content (x ~ 0.18, a regime not previously achieved) retains uniform crystallinity and exhibits superconductivity below a critical temperature of 3.8 K. This nanochemical synthesis is broadly generalizable, chip-integrable, well-suited to a wide range of processing conditions, and compatible with nanofabrication routines for constructing devices. The concept of vdW nanoreactors offers a powerful and versatile pathway to expand the accessible landscape of quantum materials.</description>

      <title>In situ Study of p-NiO Film Quality at High Temperatures up to 1100 deg C</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: NiO is a promising p-type material for photovoltaics and power electronics, but its temperature limits remain unclear. Using in situ high-temperature X-ray diffraction (HT-XRD) from 30 to 1100 C, we track the structural evolution of NiO thin films in air. The film crystallizes from an amorphous phase to cubic NiO between 300 and 400 C, where the emergence and growth of the (111) diffraction peak correlate with an increase in electrical resistivity. Further increases in temperature lead to improved crystallinity and higher resistivity. At 1100 C, the formation of Ni2O3 is observed, resulting in a highly resistive film. This study establishes a clear correlation between phase evolution, crystallinity, and resistive behavior in NiO thin films.</description>

      <title>Perturbative second-order optical susceptibility of bulk materials: a symmetry-enforced return to non-orthogonal localized basis sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The second-order optical susceptibility of semiconductors $\chi_{ijk}^{(2)}(-2\omega;\omega,\omega)$ finds application in metrology, spectroscopy, telecommunications, material characterization, and quantum information. Pioneering calculations of $\chi_{ijk}^{(2)}(-2\omega;\omega,\omega)$ utilized non-orthogonal Gaussian orbitals centered at atoms. That formulation transitioned into plane-wave-based algorithms as time went by. As of late, nevertheless, multiple tools for calculating optical susceptibilities have recast the problem using Wannier ({\em i.e.}, {\em localized}) orbitals, making a comeback onto frameworks based on localized basis sets. Here, we present an approach for calculating $\chi_{ijk}^{(2)}(-2\omega;\omega,\omega)$ reliant on numerical pseudoatomic orbitals (PAOs) within perturbation theory in the velocity gauge. Its salient feature is a calculation of `Slater-Koster-like' two-center integrals of the momentum operator in between PAOs identified by symmetry. The approach was successfully tested on paradigmatic cubic silicon carbide (3C-SiC) and gallium arsenide, for which linear responses are contributed as well.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous power generation and cooling using semiconductor-sensitized thermal cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This manuscript reports a semiconductor-sensitized thermal cell (STC) that converts ambient heat into electrical power while simultaneously reducing its own temperature under isothermal conditions. Using a printable semiconductor--electrolyte architecture, we fabricate $4\,\mathrm{cm} \times 4\,\mathrm{cm}$ devices that generate up to approximately $0.2\,\mathrm{mW}$ at temperatures of $40$--$55\,^\circ\mathrm{C}$. During continuous discharge, the STC exhibits a transient temperature decrease followed by thermal equilibration with the environment. In contrast, periodic on--off discharge produces sustained cooling of approximately $1\,^\circ\mathrm{C}$ relative to a non-discharging reference. Notably, parallel integration of four STCs yields a nonlinear enhancement of cooling (approximately $5\,^\circ\mathrm{C}$) without a corresponding increase in electrical output. The observed behavior can be understood within a macroscopic energy-balance framework, in which time modulation of electrochemical heat consumption prevents the establishment of thermal steady state. These results demonstrate sustained isothermal cooling induced by heat-to-electricity conversion at practical device scales, and highlight semiconductor-sensitized thermal cells as a platform for coupled energy harvesting and thermal management.</description>

      <title>Epitaxial Recovery of beta-Ga2O3 after High Dose Implantation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As an ultrawide bandgap semiconductor, beta-Ga2O3 has been attractive for its strong tolerance to irradiation damage and high n-type conductivity through ion implantation. Homoepitaxial (010) \b{eta}-Ga2O3 films grown by MOCVD were implanted with Ge to study the post-implantation damage and lattice recovery after thermal annealing. Box profiles of 100 or 50 nm at concentration of 5*10^19 or 3*10^19 cm^-3 were formed, with maximum displacement per atom (DPA) of 1.2 or 2.0. Lattice recovery was investigated using X-ray diffraction (XRD) for anneals from 100 C to 1050 C. A gamma-phase related peak was observed for all implant conditions. All samples showed strain relaxation of beta-phase peak at temperature below 500 C, with no significant change for the gamma-phase related peak. For lower damage implants, films recovered fully to epitaxial beta-phase after sequential annealing to 900 C. For the higher damage implant, the gamma-phase associated peak annealed out with increasing temperature, but a new diffraction peak formed at slightly smaller lattice spacing; full recovery of the lattice was not observed until annealing at 1050 C. The newly formed diffraction peak is identified as beta-(20-4), beta-(512), or beta-(71-2), each potentially arising from the conversion of gamma-phase to beta-phase via a common oxygen sub-lattice.</description>

      <title>Random Combinatorial Libraries and Automated Nanoindentation for High-Throughput Structural Materials Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accelerating the discovery of structural materials is essential for applications in hard and refractory alloys, hypersonic platforms, nuclear systems, and other extreme environment technologies. Progress is often constrained by slow synthesis and characterization cycles and the need for extensive mechanical testing across large compositional spaces. Here, we propose a rapid screening strategy based on random material libraries, in which thousands of distinct compositions are embedded within a single specimen, mapped by EDS, and subsequently characterized. Using nanoindentation as a representative case, we show that such libraries enable dense composition property mapping while reducing the number of samples required to explore high dimensional composition spaces compared to traditional synthesis and test workflows. An experimentally calibrated Monte Carlo framework is developed to quantify practical limits, including particle size, EDS noise and resolution, positional accuracy, and nanoindenter motion costs. The simulations identify regimes where random libraries provide orders of magnitude acceleration over classical workflows. Finally, we demonstrate experimental navigation of these libraries using automated indentation. Together, these results establish random libraries as a general route to high throughput characterization in structurally critical material systems.</description>

      <title>Anion correlation induced nonrelativistic spin splitting in rutile antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many studies of non-relativistic spin-splitting (NRSS), or altermagnetism, have focused on idealized, perfectly ordered crystals, relying on symmetry-based approaches to identify candidate materials. Here, we theoretically investigate how local short-range ordering (SRO) influences NRSS of energy bands in partially ordered collinear antiferromagnetic iron oxyfluoride (FeOF). Using the cluster expansion method, we identify four nearly degenerate structures (energy difference $\leq 8$ meV per formula unit) that represent distinct snapshots of local plane-to-plane O/F correlations. Our density functional theory (DFT) results show robust NRSS along the $\Gamma$-M direction in all four structures, despite the absence of long-range order. The magnitude and character of the splitting depend sensitively on the specific direction of anion correlations, effects that are not fully captured in high-symmetry average structures. Notably, two configurations ($Pmc2_1$ and $Pm$) exhibit $\Gamma$-point spin splitting absent in ordered FeF$_2$ and a virtual crystal approximation model of FeOF. We further predict distinct magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE) signatures, enabling experimental detection of SRO-driven electronic structure changes. These results highlight heteroanionic compounds as a promising design space for NRSS antiferromagnets, with experimentally synthesized FeOF already exhibiting a substantially higher N\'eel temperature (315\,K) than FeF$_2$ (79\,K).</description>

      <title>Diamond crystal with Y-defects: spectroscopy and transmittion electron microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper presents resutls of investigation of a natural Ib-IaA diamond containing Y-defects. Analysis of spatial distribution of nitrogen-related A and C centers and intensity of Infra-red absorption at Raman frequency (1332 cm-1) reveals anticorrelation between these defects. Transmission electron microscopy of a zone with abundant Y-defects shows presence of dislocations in various configurations and numerous clusters of point defects generated by non-conservative dislocation motion. Extended defects with shape resembling thin (1-3 nm) rhombic plates with the largest dimension up to 20 nm are observed. Analysis of contrast of these defects shows that they represent nanosized voids (vacancy clusters). It is suggested that the defects were formed by annihilation of dislocation dipoles with subsequent growth by consumption of vacancies produced by non-conservative motion of dislocations. Upon excitation by 787 nm laser, numerous narrow photoluminescecne lines are observed between 800-900 nm; their intensity and position show irregular temporal variations. Such behaviour (blinking) was earlier noted for hydrogenated nanodiamonds. It is suggested that unusual behaviour of the luminescence lines may be explained by recombination processes at internal walls of the discovered nanovoids.</description>

      <title>Active learning potentials for first-principles phase diagrams using replica-exchange nested sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of materials phase diagrams from first principles remains a central challenge in computational materials science. Machine-learning interatomic potentials can provide near-DFT accuracy at a fraction of the cost, but their reliability crucially depends on the availability of representative training data that span all relevant regions of the potential-energy surface. Here, we present a fully automated active-learning (AL) strategy based on replica-exchange nested sampling (RENS) for the generation of training data and the computation of complete pressure-temperature phase diagrams. In our framework, RENS acts as both the exploration engine and the acquisition mechanism: its intrinsic diversity and likelihood-constrained sampling ensure that the configurations selected for DFT labeling are both informative and thermodynamically representative. We apply the approach to silicon, germanium, and titanium using potentials trained at the r2SCAN level of theory. For all systems, the AL process converges within 10-15 iterations, yielding transferable potentials that reproduce known phase transitions and thermodynamic trends. These results demonstrate that RENS-based AL provides a general and autonomous route to constructing machine-learning interatomic potentials and predicting first-principles phase diagrams across broad thermodynamic conditions.</description>

      <title>Shape descriptors of equilibrium states in a quantum lattice model with local multi-well potentials: A geometric analysis near the phase transitions in Sn$_2$P$_2$S$_6$ ferroelectric crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the equilibrium states of quantum lattice model with local multi-well potentials for Sn$_2$P$_2$S$_6$ ferroelectric crystals using the mean and Gaussian curvatures ($H$, $K$), curvedness ($C$) and shape index ($S$). From the energy gap, pressure and temperature variations of $H$, $K$, $C$ and $S$, we have reported the geometric construction of the free energy surfaces for the ferroelectric and paraelectric phases. Their behaviors are explicitly observed near the ferroelectric-paraelectric phase transitions. It is found that $H$, $C$ and $S$ display a cusp singularity at the criticality while $K$ converges to zero on both sides of the critical and tricritical points.</description>

      <title>Rational Design Principles for Na- and Li-ion Carbon Anodes from Interlayer Spacing Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphite, the standard commercial anode for Li-ion batteries, is thermodynamically incompatible with Na-ion batteries, leading researchers to search for alternative C-based structures (e.g., hard carbon, expanded graphite). In a simplified picture, the main idea of such search relies on identifying disordered C structures with a large interlayer spacing and distribution of local structural motifs (e.g., pores) with target electrochemical properties. Such exploration is typically done via trial-and-error experimentation, which often does not allow precise understanding of the role of interlayer distance and even Na/Li-ion intercalation in the electrochemical performance. Motivated by this, using density-functional theory and cluster expansion, we establish a structure-property relationship for Li- and Na-intercalation across a range of graphite interlayer spacings and stacking arrangements. We show that Na intercalation becomes thermodynamically possible in large concentrations above 4.21 {\AA} even without a change in interlayer spacing. Conversely, Li intercalation has a narrow optimal window, with maximum capacity (close to the commercial limit) at approximately 3.75 {\AA}, while larger spacings (e.g., 4.58 {\AA}) quickly reduce Li storage capacity. We also find that AA-stacked domains consistently offer stronger ion bonding and higher voltages than AB-stacked domains for both ions. Our results, thus, not only explain the role of metal ion intercalation in the electrochemical performance, but also clarify the fundamental design trade-offs for expanded C anodes, offering practical targets and interlayer distance ranges for the independent optimization of the next generation of negative electrodes for metal-ion batteries.</description>

      <title>Many-Body Correlation Effects in Fr\"ohlich Electron-Phonon Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In compound semiconductors and insulators, the polar electron-phonon coupling diverges at long range, known as the Fr\"ohlich interaction. Modern first-principles electron-phonon calculations treat the Fr\"ohlich interaction in a semiclassical electrostatic formalism based on density-functional perturbation theory. Here, using many-body $GW$ perturbation theory, we reveal important electron correlation effects in the Fr\"ohlich-type electron-phonon coupling, which are missed by the prevailing approaches. Going beyond the electrostatic treatment, we derive and implement the $GW$ self-energy contribution to the long-range polar electron-phonon coupling, and demonstrate its critical role and nontrivial behaviors in properties such as electron linewidth and polaron formation. Our work establishes the many-body generalization of the Fr\"ohlich interaction that is essential for accurate electron-phonon calculations at the full $GW$ level combined with Wannier interpolation techniques.</description>

      <title>Probing Topological Surface States and Conduction via Extended Defects in (Bi$_{1-x}$Sb$_x$)$_2$Te$_3$ Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: (Bi$_{1-x}$Sb$_x$)$_2$Te$_3$ alloys are non-degenerate topological insulators (TIs) whose Dirac point (DP) can be tuned within the bulk bandgap by varying the composition, effectively reducing bulk conduction while allowing surface carrier conduction. Magnetotransport measurements of a series of (Bi$_{1-x}$Sb$_x$)$_2$Te$_3$ thin films indicate electron-dominated conduction, with weak anti-localization attributed to topological surface states (TSSs). Due to the similarity of phase coherence lengths and twin boundary spacings ($\sim$100 nm), we consider the role of twin boundaries as additional conducting paths. Density functional theory calculations reveal an enhanced density of states near the Fermi level at $60^\circ$ twin boundaries, with 2D carrier concentration in excess of $3 \times 10^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$. Furthermore, an analysis of the longitudinal magnetoconductivity yields an upper bound of $7.3 \times 10^{-4}$ S for twin boundary conductivity, resulting in a carrier mobility as high as $142$ cm$^2$/(V$\cdot$s). We discuss the role of twin boundaries in facilitating a transition from a massive Dirac cone dispersion to gapless, topologically protected surface states. Understanding the role of twin boundaries on carrier conduction in non-degenerate TIs is critical for the development of novel TI-based electronic devices.</description>

Abstract: Perovskite oxides ($AB$O$_3$) have long been central to the advancement of modern condensed matter physics, owing to their rich and tunable electronic and magnetic properties. The quest to understand their various entangled phases has spurred the development of both cutting-edge experimental tools and innovative theoretical frameworks. In recent times, the emergence of high entropy oxides - materials in which five or more elements share a single crystallographic site - has introduced a powerful new paradigm in materials design. Embedding such extreme chemical disorder within the perovskite framework has opened vast opportunities for realizing novel physical phenomena inaccessible in conventional oxides. This review surveys the rapid advances in the synthesis, characterization, and exploration of the electronic and magnetic properties of compositionally complex perovskite oxides, offering key insights and highlighting promising avenues for future research.</description>

      <title>Thermoelectric properties of SbXY (X = Se, Te; Y = Br, I) Janus layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a comprehensive investigation of the thermoelectric properties of SbXY (X = Se, Te; Y = Br, I) Janus layers (JL) using spin-polarized first-principles calculations. Ab initio molecular dynamics confirm that the 1T phase ($Pm31$) remains stable up to 1000 K, excluding any phase transitions. The calculated mean-square displacement further evidences the structural robustness. The thermal conductivity is strongly suppressed in Br-containing layers due to enhanced Froehlich interactions between optical and acoustic phonons. Electronic structure calculations reveal indirect band gaps of 1.1 to 1.3 eV, with valence and conduction bands dominated by the $p$-orbitals of halogen/chalcogen and of Sb, respectively. The carrier effective mass highlights anisotropic transport with lighter electrons being more mobile, while holes dominate the power factor, which attains values on the order of mW/mK$^2$. Direction-dependent transport indicates superior thermoelectric performance along the $xx$ direction, with negligible contribution along $yy$. The Figure of Merit reaches 0.6 at 1000 K in hole-doped SbSeBr, demonstrating strong potential for high-temperature applications. Our results reveal that the SbXY JLs, particularly SbSeBr, emerge as promising candidates for next-generation thermoelectric devices at elevated temperatures.</description>

      <title>Plasma engineered Hydroxyl Defects in NiO a DFTSupported-Spectroscopic Analysis of Oxygen Hole States and Implications for Water Oxidation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling lattice oxygen reactivity in earth abundant OER catalysts requires precise tuning of defect chemistry in the oxide lattice. Here, we combine DFT+U calculations with plasma assisted synthesis to show how O2 and H2O in the discharge govern vacancy formation, electronic structure, and catalytic predisposition in NiO thin films. Oxygen rich plasmas generate isolated and clustered Ni vacancies that stabilize oxygen ligand hole states and produce shallow O 2p Ni 3d hybrid levels, enhancing Ni O covalency. In contrast, introducing H2O during growth drives local hydroxylation that compensates vacancy induced Ni3+ centers, restoring Ni2+ like coordination, suppressing deep divacancy derived in gap states, and introducing shallow Ni O H derived valence-band tails. EXAFS confirms that hydroxylation perturbs only the local environment while preserving the medium-range NiO lattice, and Ni L-edge spectroscopy shows a persistent but redistributed ligand-hole population. These complementary vacancy and hydroxylation driven pathways provide a plasma controlled route to pre define electronic defect landscapes in NiO and to tune its activation toward OER relevant NiOOH formation.</description>

      <title>Observation of magnetically coupled electro-optic effect in LiNbO3/LiTaO3 at room temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetoelectric coupling effect serves as a crucial bridge between electrical and magnetic order parameters in condensed matter physics, forming the physical basis for the development of next-generation low-power information storage and sensing technologies. However, material systems exhibiting this effect at room temperature are extremely rare, and the coupling strength is typically very weak, which has long hindered the practical application of such phenomena despite their rich tunability. Here, we break this by reporting a pronounced magnetoelectric phenomenon,the magnetically coupled EO effect in the classic ferroelectric optical materials LiNbO3 and LiTaO3. We trace its origin to an unexpected source,the problematic direct current drift,a major reliability issue in photonic integrated circuits. We unambiguously demonstrate that this drift stems not from mobile ions but from defect-bound unpaired electrons, whose slow polarization relaxation is quenched upon the magnetic-field-induced formation of a room-temperature skyrmion states, as directly visualized by Lorentz transmission electron microscopy. This collective spin ordering not only solves the decades-old drift problem but also transforms the defect states into a magnetically responsive platform, exhibiting an efficiency up to 34 pm/V in LiNbO3 and 15 pm/V in LiTaO3-an orders-of-magnitude enhancement over conventional room-temperature magnetoelectric responses and even surpassing the materials' intrinsic Pockels coefficients. We also measured the magnetic response of this additional electro-optical effect and found that under the condition of applying a magnetic field of 0.1 T, an electro-optical coefficient adjustment of about 8 pm/V can be achieved (0.008 pm/V/Oe), which is equivalent to 30% of the electro-optical coefficient of LiNbO3 itself.</description>

      <title>To crack, or not to crack: How hydrogen favors crack propagation in iron at the atomic scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Steel is a key structural material because of its considerable strength and ductility. However, when exposed to hydrogen, it is prone to embrittlement. Mechanistic understanding of the origin of hydrogen embrittlement is hampered by the lack of reliable interatomic potentials. Here, we perform large-scale molecular dynamics simulations of crack propagation after having developed and validated an efficient yet density-functional-theory-accurate machine-learning potential for hydrogen in iron. Simulations based on our potential reveal that in the absence of H, iron is intrinsically ductile at finite temperatures with crack-tip blunting assisted by dislocation emission. By contrast, minute (part-per-million) hydrogen concentrations can switch the crack-tip behavior from ductile blunting to brittle propagation. Detailed analysis of our molecular dynamics results reveals that the combination of fast hydrogen diffusion and diminished surface energy is at the origin of embrittlement. Our results set the stage for a modified Griffith's criterion for hydrogen-induced brittle fracture, which closely captures the simulations and that can be used to assess embrittlement in iron-based alloys.</description>

      <title>Crossover Dynamics of Non-Fickian Ionic Diffusion in Solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ionic diffusion in solids is central to energy storage, electronics, and catalysis, yet its chemical origins are difficult to resolve because conventional diffusion models struggle with effects of confinement, crystallographic disorder, lattice distortions, and coupling to electronic or phononic carriers. These challenges are especially pronounced in battery materials, where ionic and electronic motion occur together, complicating interpretation of electrochemical measurements. Here we use tracer exchange as a direct, non-electrochemical probe to reveal distinct ion-transport regimes in the one-dimensional conductor olivine Li_xFePO4 (0 &lt;= x &lt;= 1). Lithium isotope exchange validates single-file diffusion governed by strong ion-ion correlations, where 1D confinement suppresses bypassing and preserves spatial order. Kinetic Monte Carlo simulations and chronoamperometry quantify both Faradaic and non-Faradaic surface exchange, identifying electron transport, rather than Li+ mobility, as the rate-limiting step for electrochemical reaction. In addition, Li-Na exchange exhibits apparent superdiffusion, with rates that increase with Na content. Simulations attribute this behavior to surface-exchange limitations and Na-induced lattice strain that enhances cross-channel Li+ hopping and drives a crossover from 1D to quasi-2D transport. Four-dimensional STEM, in situ synchrotron XRD, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, and Mossbauer spectroscopy confirm that lattice softening and concerted polaron motion contribute to the observed dynamics. These results establish tracer exchange as a powerful tool for probing coupled ion-electron transport and provide chemical insight into how lattice mechanics and multicomponent exchange shape ionic diffusion in solids.</description>

      <title>Magnetic field-tuned size and dual annihilation pathways of chiral magnetic bobbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic chiral bobbers (CBs) are three-dimensional (3D) topological spin textures that consist of a tapered skyrmion tube terminating in a Bloch point, promising applications in high-density spintronics. However, the mechanisms controlling their size and the dynamics of their annihilation are still not fully understood. In this study, we present an analytical model that predicts the radius $R$ of the CB as a function of the external magnetic field, the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI), the magnetic anisotropy, and the exchange interaction. The micromagnetic simulations validate this model across a broad range of parameters. We also identify two mechanisms of annihilation of CBs: (i) a droplet-like instability that occurs under rapid changes in the magnetic field, which we describe using a proposed magnetic Weber number $We$ and its critical field step scaling; and (ii) Bloch point depinning mechanism at interfaces, for which we determine the threshold magnetic field $B_{\text{th}}$ for annihilation. Importantly, we uncover a novel fragmentation pathway in which CBs transform into skyrmion tubes, then into half-CBs, and finally into ferromagnetic states. These findings lay the groundwork for understanding and manipulating 3D CBs as next-generation devices.</description>

      <title>Experimental Demonstration and Transformation Mechanism of Quenchable Two-dimensional Diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) diamond has aroused tremendous interest in nanoelectronics and optoelectronics, owing to its superior properties and flexible characteristics compared to bulk diamond. Despite significant efforts, great challenges lie in the experimental synthesis and transformation conditions of 2D diamond. Herein, we have demonstrated the experimental preparation of high quality 2D diamond with controlled thickness and distinguished properties, realized by laser-heating few-layer graphene in diamond anvil cell. The quenched 2D diamond exhibited narrow T2g Raman peak (linewidth ~3.6 cm-1) and intense photoluminescence of SiV- (linewidth ~6.1 nm) and NV0 centers. In terms of transformation mechanism, atomic structures of hybrid phase interfaces suggested that the intermediate rhombohedral phase subtly mediate hexagonal graphite to cubic diamond transition. Furthermore, the tunable optical bandgap and thermal stability of 2D diamond sensitively depend on its sp3 concentration. We believe our results can shed light on the structural design and preparation of many carbon allotropes and further uncover the underlying transition mechanism.</description>

      <title>Phase-field simulation of domain switching in ferroelectric trilayer films under bending-induced strain gradient</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.12943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flexible ferroelectrics possess significant potential for wearable electronics and bio-inspired devices, yet their electromechanical coupling mechanisms under dynamic bending remain elusive. This study employs phase-field simulations to investigate the effects of bending deformation on domain structures and macroscopic ferroelectric responses in (SrTiO3)10/(PbTiO3)10/(SrTiO3)10 trilayer films. By constructing computational models for upward-concave (U-shaped) and downward-concave (N-shaped) configurations, we analyze the regulation of polarization patterns by strain distributions under varying curvature radii. The results demonstrate that the two bending modes generate opposite through-thickness strain gradients: U-shaped bending produces compressive strain in the upper layer and tensile strain in the lower, while N-shaped bending yields the reverse. These inhomogeneous strains drive distinct polarization reconfigurations within the PTO layer. While stable vortex-antivortex pairs persist at moderate curvatures, reducing the bending radius triggers divergent topological transitions -- U-shaped bending transforms vortex pairs into zigzag-like domains, whereas N-shaped bending promotes out-of-plane c-domain evolution. Crucially, bending-induced strain gradients generate transverse flexoelectric fields that markedly modulate hysteresis loops. U-shaped bending introduces a negative flexoelectric field, shifting loops rightward and suppressing maximum polarization Pmax. In contrast, N-shaped bending generates a positive field, shifting loops leftward and enhancing Pmax. Furthermore, analysis of polarization switching reveals that bending mediates domain-evolution pathways and reversal dynamics.</description>

      <title>Enhanced THz emission and exciton transfer in monolayer MoS2/GaAs heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For designing an efficient terahertz (THz) emitter, the defect density of the semiconductors is smartly increased to reduce carrier lifetime, which subsequently lowers the overall power output of the semiconductor. To overcome this fundamental trade-off, this study presents a novel approach, by integrating a direct band gap 2D semiconductor such as monolayer MoS2 (1L-MoS2) with a well-known THz emitter, low-temperature-grown gallium arsenide (GaAs). The fabricated hybrid 2D/3D vertical van der Waals heterostructure showed a 15% higher THz emission compared to bare GaAs due to phase-coherent addition of second-order non-linear susceptibility, and overall enhancement in the electric field of laser. The photoluminescence (PL) enhancement factor of 2.38 in heterostructures at GaAs emission energy of 1.42 eV. However, the substantial quenching of PL emission for 1L-MoS2 at the energy of 1.84 eV, is attributed to the Dexter-type exciton transfer mechanism at type-I band alignment. THz time-domain spectroscopy reveals a significant increase in optoelectronic properties, such as optical conductivity becoming doubled, and a 50% reduction in absorption coefficients. The study introduces a new route for fabricating large-area and compact mixed-dimensional van der Waals heterostructures, which can be used to enhance the efficiency of conventional semiconductor technologies and THz-based optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>3D lattice Monte Carlo modeling of morphology formation of Si/SiOx nanocomposites during phase separation of nonstoichiometric Si oxide films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a three-dimensional lattice model based on the Monte Carlo approach is presented. This model is developed to investigate the kinetics of morphology change during phase separation in nonstoichiometric Si oxide (SiOx, x &lt; 2) films. The model takes into account the SiOx local atomic structure and probabilistic migration of oxygen atoms driven by the tendency of free energy minimization. The influence of the initial SiOx stoichiometry index x and film thickness on the morphology of the precipitated Si phase in the Si oxide matrix is analyzed. The morphology of the Si phase is shown to critically depend on the initial SiOx stoichiometry. Namely, isolated Si nanoparticles form at low excess Si content (x &gt;= 1.4), while interconnected Si networks always appear at x &lt;= 0.8. A dimensional effect on the morphology of the Si phase is revealed. Namely, reducing the film thickness imposes geometric constraints on the Si network formation. The percolation threshold is found to shift from xp ~= 1.35 for the bulk-like SiOx layers to xp ~= 0.85 for the quasi-two-dimensional films. The transition to the bulk material behavior is observed at a SiOx thickness of approximately 4.2 nm.</description>

      <title>Topological descriptor for interpretable thermal transport prediction in amorphous graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding and predicting thermal transport in disordered materials remains a significant challenge due to the absence of periodicity and the complex nature of medium-range structural motifs. In this work, we investigate amorphous graphene and demonstrate that persistent homology, a topological data analysis technique, can serve as a physically interpretable structural descriptor for predicting thermal conductivity. We first show that ridge regression using persistent homology descriptors achieves high prediction accuracy. To gain physical insight into the prediction process, we perform inverse analysis by mapping the regression coefficients back onto the persistence diagrams. This reveals that distorted hexagonal and triangular motifs are strongly correlated with reduced thermal conductivity. A further comparison with the spatial distribution of localized vibrational modes supports the physical interpretation that these motifs suppress thermal transport. Our findings highlight that persistent homology not only enables accurate prediction of physical properties but also uncovers meaningful structure-property relationships in two-dimensional amorphous materials. This approach offers a promising framework for interpretable machine-learning models in materials science.</description>

      <title>Quantum-inspired Chemical Rule for Discovering Topological Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological materials exhibit unique electronic structures that underpin both fundamental quantum phenomena and next-generation technologies, yet their discovery remains constrained by the high computational cost of first-principles calculations and the slow, resource-intensive nature of experimental synthesis. Recent machine-learning approaches, such as the heuristic topogivity rule, offer data-driven alternatives by quantifying each element's intrinsic tendency toward topological behavior. Here, we develop a quantum-classical hybrid artificial neural network (QANN) that extends this rule into a quantum-inspired formulation. Within this framework, the QANN maps compositional descriptors to quantum probability amplitudes, naturally introducing pairwise inter-element correlations inaccessible to classical heuristics. The physical validity of these correlations is substantiated by constructing an equivalent complex-valued neural network (CVNN), confirming both the consistency and interpretability of the formulation. Retaining the simplicity of chemical reasoning while embedding quantum-native features, our quantum-inspired rule enables efficient and generalizable topological classification. High-throughput screening combined with first-principles (DFT) validation reveals five previously unreported topological compounds, demonstrating the enhanced predictive power and physical insight afforded by quantum-inspired heuristics.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three distinct samples were proceed through synthesis utilizing the hydrothermal method to develop tin dioxide (SnO2) nanoparticles. Consistency in all other parameters was ensured by maintaining a constant temperature and time throughout the synthesis. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were used to examine how the surfactant affected the structural, morphological, and crystallographic characteristics. A tetragonal rutile SnO2 phase was confirmed to have formed by XRD investigation, with high crystallinity indicated by strong diffraction peaks. Higher precursor concentration samples showed aggregation, indicating that the smaller size of the nanoparticles caused them to interact. These findings show that changing the surfactant has a major impact on the crystallinity, size, and shape of SnO2 nanoparticles, which makes this technique establish for certain uses, including energy storage, gas sensors, and photocatalysis. Additionally, we examined the photocatalytic activity of the aforementioned samples, indicating from the UV-vis characterization results that the sample containing PEG as a surfactant performs better than others.</description>

      <title>Computational tuning of the elastic properties of low- and high-entropy ultra-high temperature ceramics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-high temperature ceramics (UHTCs) represent a class of crystalline materials for extreme environments. They can withstand extremely high temperatures but are mechanically difficult to work with due to their inherent brittleness. Mixture compounds, in particular high-entropy mixtures, offer a pathway to tune the physical properties of UHTCs such as their elastic constants. Here we fine-tune the MACE-MPA-0 universal machine-learning potential on rocksalt carbide UHTCs containing group IV-V metals and demonstrate that not only do the elastic constants deviate from the rule of mixtures approximation in the high-entropy limit, but also in the low-entropy limit of binary and ternary mixtures. We find that this is caused by distortion imposed by the lattice mismatch, enabling the tuning of the physical properties of UHTC mixtures in both low- and high-entropy compounds. We identify a three-component mixture compound, HfCVCZrC, as the best balance between synthesizability and toughness, and apply our developed MACE-UHTC model to identify a range of non-equimolar candidate compositions of this compound which may enable the synthesis of a mixture UHTC with a Young's modulus up to 40 GPa below that of ZrC.</description>

      <title>Heterostructure Design in Two-Dimensional Perovskites by Sequential Recrystallization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-dimensional metal halide perovskites provide exciting opportunities to fabricate new semiconductor materials. Semiconductor technology relies on electronic heterojunctions, and cost-efficient and flexible approaches to realize functional heterostructures are of fundamental importance. Lateral heterostructures define the energy landscape in the plane of the semiconducting lattice in such 2D materials, representing an ideal platform to tailor energy barriers and to control charge carrier flow. Here, we demonstrate a versatile one-pot synthesis to fabricate a large variety of 2D perovskite heterostructures based on different halides and/or metal cations. Exploiting sequential crystallization of different 2D perovskites, and playing with the composition and injection events of the materials, enables the design of diverse heterostructure architectures including multiple heterojunctions. We obtain crystalline quality of the heterojunctions, multicolor emission, and optical coupling between the different heterostructure regions. We foresee that the design freedom of our method will stimulate the development of novel optoelectronic devices where electronic band engineering is crucial.</description>

      <title>Developing a valence force field model for wurtzite semiconductors by exploiting similarities with [111]-oriented zinc blende systems: The case of wurtzite boron nitride, III-N materials and (B,In,Ga)N alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling the crystal phase and lattice mismatch of semiconductors offers a powerful route to engineer electronic and optical properties of heterostructures. As a consequence, semiconductors in the wurtzite phase are increasingly sought after, superseding the thermodynamically favored cubic zinc blende phase. Empirical atomistic modeling, required for large scale simulations of heterostructures and their properties, relies heavily on valence force field (VFF) methods to find the equilibrium atomic positions in an alloy. For zinc blende crystals, VFF models are well-established. In the case of wurtzite, such parameters are frequently adopted without rigorous analysis, despite subtle but consequential differences from the zinc blende structure. Such an approach can compromise accuracy in describing material properties, since the structural differences between zinc blende and wurtzite directly influence electronic and optical characteristics. Based on the analytical VFF model by Tanner et al., and using structural similarities between wurtzite and [111]-oriented zinc blende, we construct a wurtzite VFF without introducing additional parameters. Our framework relies on analytic expressions and minimization routines to project zinc blende models onto wurtzite systems. Beyond elastic tensors, we train the model to reproduce bond length asymmetries and band gaps by using output of the VFF model in density functional theory calculations. Applied to wurtzite III-N compounds and BN, the model accurately reproduces targeted observables but also properties it has not been trained on, including the internal parameter u. We further validate the model on highly mismatched alloys such as (B,Ga)N and (B,In,Ga)N, exhibiting good agreement between VFF and density functional theory results when using identical supercells in these calculations.</description>

      <title>Computational discovery of ferromagnetic AT6X6 kagome compounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13431v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic high-throughput density-functional-theory investigation of the structural and magnetic stability of 312 substitutional compounds in the magnetic kagome AT6X6 family. Our screening confirms the stability of many previously reported structures and predicts several additional stable candidates. Within collinear spin configurations, we find that Fe-based systems predominantly adopt antiferromagnetic ground states, whereas Mn-based analogues exhibit a more balanced distribution between ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic order. For compounds exhibiting several nearly degenerate collinear configurations, we analyze the nature of their magnetic ground states, assess the possible emergence of non-collinear order, and discuss the limitations and uncertainties inherent to standard density-functional approaches. Our electronic-structure analysis further reveals that newly predicted ferromagnetic kagome systems display characteristic features of topological metals, with rich magnetic configurations that can be tuned by chemical substitution. Overall, these ferromagnetic kagome compounds constitute a broad and still largely unexplored materials platform for the emergence of exciting magneto-transport phenomena.</description>

      <title>Impact of an electron Wigner crystal on exciton propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The strong Coulomb interaction in 2D materials facilitates the formation of tightly bound excitons and charge-ordered phases of matter. A prominent example is the formation of a crystalline phase from free charges due to mutual Coulomb repulsion, known as the Wigner crystal. While exciton-electron interactions have been used as a sensor for Wigner crystallization, its impact on exciton properties has been poorly understood so far. Here, we show that the weak potential induced by periodically ordered Wigner crystal electrons has a major impact on exciton propagation, albeit having only a minor influence on exciton energy. The effect is tunable with carrier density determining the Wigner crystal confinement and temperature via thermal occupation of higher subbands. Our work provides microscopic insights into the interplay between excitons and charge-ordered states identifying key signatures in exciton transport, and establishes a theoretical framework for understanding exciton propagation in the presence of strong electronic correlations.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed study of common intrinsic defects in CuInS$_2$ and CuGaS$_2$ using the Heyd, Scuseria and Ernzerhof (HSE) hybrid functional scheme. The impact of the two HSE parameters, $\alpha$ and $\omega$ on the band gap and compliance with the generalized Koopmans' theorem is investigated. Using the formation energy formalism and calculated thermodynamic charge-transition levels, we assess the electronic properties of the defects and explore the connection of charge-transition levels with optical-transition levels. Calculated Franck-Condon shifts for emission highlight the importance of lattice relaxation for the attribution of defects to luminescence peaks. Our results show that once these effects are included, predictions become closer to photoluminescence measurements available in literature.</description>

      <title>Ferromagnetic resonance in an antiferromagnetic crystal EuSn$_2$As$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report results of electron spin resonance (ESR) measurements in single crystals of EuSn$_2$As$_2$. In the temperature range of antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering of Eu atoms, $T \leq T_N\approx 24$\,K, the ESR signal splits into two resonance lines, one of which, at high-field (or low-frequency), is the conventional acoustic AFM resonance mode that occurs at temperatures below $T_N$. The lower-field (high-frequency) line, as we have proven here, is the ferromagnetic resonance associated with the presence in the layered AFM crystal of a small amount ($\sim 3\%$) of planar nanodefects with a non-zero ferromagnetic (FM) moment. The existence of ferromagnetic nano-inclusions in the bulk of the antiferromagnetic compound makes EuSn$_2$As$_2$ a peculiar example of a natural magnetic metamaterial. We believe that the planar FM nanodefects are also inherent in other layered AFM compounds, which explains often observed increase in their magnetic susceptibility upon cooling at $T&lt; T_N\rightarrow 0$.</description>

      <title>Transition from Population to Coherence-dominated Non-diffusive Thermal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deviations from diffusive heat transport in high thermal conductivity crystalline insulators are generally understood within the framework of the phonon Boltzmann Transport Equation. However, for low thermal conductivity materials with large primitive cells or strong anharmonicity, the recently developed Wigner Transport Equation is more appropriate as it includes tunnelling between overlapping phonon bands. In this work, via solutions to the Wigner Transport Equation, we develop a scheme to obtain the dynamics of the phonon populations and coherences as a function of an arbitrary heat source. The approach is applied to predict size effects and dynamical thermal conductivities in CsPbBr3 and La2Zr2O7 using first-principles data as input. We predict significant deviations from the bulk thermal conductivity in these materials at length scales on the order of hundreds of nanometers to a few microns at room temperature, well within the reach of direct observation using current experimental techniques.</description>

      <title>Rapid synthesis of dual-element isotope-enriched alpha-MoO3 crystals by reactive vapor transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we develop a rapid reactive vapor transport technique to efficiently utilize limited isotopically pure precursors, particularly gaseous 18O2, and synthesize mm-scale, high-quality crystals within few-minute growth durations. We unlock this capability by using metallic molybdenum precursors with high source temperatures (900 C) and total pressures (1 atm) to maximize precursor efficiency and yield. Subsequently, we grow MoO3 single crystals with high and uniform enrichment levels of 98Mo and 18O isotopes in several different permutations. As probed by Raman spectroscopy, modest and significant phonon energy redshifts occur following 98Mo and 18O enrichment, respectively. By demonstrating control over both molybdenum and oxygen isotopic fractions, we establish a powerful tool to advance nanophotonics and thermal management goals using MoO3. This work is motivated by the possibility to enhance and engineer lattice vibrational mode phenomena including thermal conduction and hyperbolic phonon polariton (HPhP) dispersion, with particular interest in comparing the effects of light and heavy element enrichment.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal Transport with Quantum Geometric Origin in Layered Hybrid Perovskite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum geometry quantifies how the electron wavefunction evolves distinctly from conventional transport theory. In noncentrosymmetric materials, nonreciprocal transport with quantum geometric origin remains prominent with localized charge independent of vanished group velocity. The discovery of such nonreciprocal and nonlinear responses was realized by recent advances in two-dimensional materials. As a promising candidate, the electronic structure and symmetry of layered hybrid perovskites can be deliberately designed and manipulated by incorporating selected organic ligands. Despite the observation of exotic photogalvanic effects and chiral optical effects, the underlying mechanism how these nonlinear responses are enabled in the multi-quantum well structures remained unclear. Here we demonstrated the quantum geometric origin for interlayer spontaneous photocurrent in (PEA)2PbI4. Contrary to assumptions that charge transport across the 2D planes is limited, we observed a spontaneous photocurrent along this crystalline orientation. Theoretical analysis using a tight-binding model identifies shift current as the microscopic origin. This quantum geometric effect is enabled by ionic displacements from centrosymmetric coordinates and enhanced by multiband transition high-density bands of the layered hybrid crystal. We anticipate that such unique low-dimensional systems with structure can provide fertile ground for discovering novel optoelectronic functionalities.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This chapter presents an overview of microfluidic devices reported in the literature, used to develop methodologies for nucleation of biomolecules, with crystal size control, and for collecting thermodynamic and kinetic data. Part I is dedicated to the properties of microfluidic devices through materials used for their fabrication and for crystals analysis. Part II describes the variety of microfluidic devices available and how to handle them to produce flows, droplets and/or wells of micrometer size. These devices use crystallization methods inspired by batch processes and they are mainly used for protein crystallization. Part III focuses on fundamental properties of biomolecule crystallization determined using droplet-based microfluidics: nucleation kinetics, nucleation rate and effective interfacial energy crystal/solution. Part IV explains how the kinetic effect of confinement due to micrometer size, and so nanovolumes, leads to isolation of different phases. These latter are characterized by X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) and methods to minimize manual handling of crystals for XRD are also presented, with appropriate equipment to store the crystals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.11935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence is reshaping scientific discovery, yet its use in materials research remains limited by fragmented computational ecosystems, reproducibility challenges, and dependence on commercial large language models (LLMs). Here we introduce AGAPI (AtomGPT.org API), an open-access agentic AI platform that integrates more than eight open-source LLMs with over twenty materials-science API endpoints, unifying databases, simulation tools, and machine-learning models through a common orchestration framework. AGAPI employs an Agent-Planner-Executor-Summarizer architecture that autonomously constructs and executes multi-step workflows spanning materials data retrieval, graph neural network property prediction, machine-learning force-field optimization, tight-binding calculations, diffraction analysis, and inverse design. We demonstrate AGAPI through end-to-end workflows, including heterostructure construction, powder X-ray diffraction analysis, and semiconductor defect engineering requiring up to ten sequential operations. In addition, we evaluate AGAPI using 30+ example prompts as test cases and compare agentic predictions with and without tool access against experimental data. With more than 1,000 active users, AGAPI provides a scalable and transparent foundation for reproducible, AI-accelerated materials discovery. AGAPI-Agents codebase is available at https://github.com/atomgptlab/agapi.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.12234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a spin-(1/2, 5/2) three-leg ladder realized in a radical-Mn polymer, exhibiting an antiferromagnetic transition and magnetization curves accurately described by classical mean-field theory. Although the underlying spin model intrinsically supports strong quantum fluctuations, as confirmed by quantum Monte Carlo simulations, the real system shows an anomalously complete suppression of quantum behavior. These findings provide a key experimental benchmark for the quantum-classical crossover and suggest that lattice topology can play a crucial role in tuning the balance between quantum and classical physics in strongly correlated systems.</description>

      <title>Morphogenesis of bacterial colonies in liquid crystalline environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Natural bacterial habitats are often complex fluids with viscoelastic and anisotropic responses to stress; for example, they can take the form of liquid crystals (LCs), with elongated microscopic constituents that collectively align while still retaining the ability to flow. However, laboratory studies typically focus on cells in simple liquids or complex fluids with randomly-oriented constituents. Here, we show how interactions with LCs shape bacterial proliferation in multicellular colonies. Using experiments, we find that in a nematic LC, cells generically form aligned single-cell-wide "chains" as they reproduce. As these chains lengthen, they eventually buckle in a highly localized manner. By combining our measurements with a continuum mechanical theory, we demonstrate that this distinctive morphogenetic program emerges because cells are kept in alignment due to the LC's elasticity; as each chain lengthens, growth-induced viscous stresses along its contour eventually overcome the elasticity of the surrounding nematic, leading to buckling. Our work thus reveals and provides mechanistic insight into the previously-overlooked role of LCs in sculpting bacterial life in complex environments.</description>

      <title>A Software Package for Generating Robust and Accurate Potentials using the Moment Tensor Potential Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the Plan for Robust and Accurate Potentials (PRAPs), a software package for training and using moment tensor potentials (MTPs) in concert with the Machine Learned Interatomic Potentials (MLIP) software package. PRAPs provides an automated workflow to train MTPs using active learning procedures, and a variety of utilities to ease and improve workflows when utilizing the MLIP software. PRAPs was originally developed in the context of crystal structure prediction, in which one calculates convex hulls and predicts low energy metastable and thermodynamically stable structures, but the potentials PRAPs develops are not limited to such applications. PRAPs produces two potentials, one capable of rough estimates of the energies, forces and stresses of almost any chemical structure in the specified compositional space -- the Robust Potential -- and a second potential intended to provide more accurate descriptions of ground state and metastable structures -- the Accurate Potential. We also present a Python library, mliputils, designed to assist users in working with the chemical structural files used by the MLIP package.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity increase of 3D printed, self-sensing, carbon fibers structures with conductive filament matrix due to flexural loading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The excellent structural and piezoresistive properties of continuous carbon fiber make it suitable for both structural and sensing applications. This work studies the use of 3D printed, continuous carbon fiber reinforced beams as self-sensing structures. It is demonstrated how the sensitivity of these carbon fiber strain gauges can be increased irreversibly by means of a pretreatment by ``breaking-in'' the sensors with a large compressive bending load. The increase in the gauge factor is attributed to local progressive fiber failure, due to the combination of the thermal residual stress from the printing process and external loading. The coextrusion of conductive filament around the carbon fibers is demonstrated as a means of improving the reliability, noise and electrical connection of the sensors. A micrograph of the sensor cross section shows that the conductive filament contacts the various carbon fiber bundles. All-in-all, the use of ``breaking-in'' carbon fiber strain gauges in combination with coextrusion of conductive filament hold promises for 3D printed structural sensors with a high sensitivity.</description>

      <title>Magnetic topological textures in nonorientable surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.12853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological magnetic textures confined to two-dimensional (2D) non-orientable manifolds exhibit behaviors absent in planar systems. We investigate bimerons on M\"obius surfaces and show that the lack of global orientation alters conservation laws, yielding geometry-dependent topology and dynamics. Micromagnetic simulations reveal that the helical twist and non-orientable geometry reshape the effective topological charge and stabilize chiral configurations imposed by the surface. Under spin-polarized currents, bimerons display unconventional transport: the transverse response is locally reversed or globally suppressed due to charge inversion along the manifold. Moreover, we establish an Aharonov-Bohm effect associated with the magnonic modes of the texture; in particular, the translational Goldstone mode implies that a bimeron on a M\"obius strip should exhibit path-dependent quantum interference. These results identify a geometry-driven regime of magnetization dynamics and provide a route to curvature-engineered spintronic functionalities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-harmonic spectroscopy in solids gives insight into the inner workings of solids, such as reconstructing band structures or probing the topological phase of materials. High-harmonic generation (HHG) is a highly non-linear phenomena and simulations guide interpretation of experimental results. These simulations often rely on the electric dipole approximation, even though the driving fields enter regimes that challenge its accuracy. Here, we investigate effects of including nondipole terms in the light-matter coupling in simulations of HHG in materials with both topologically trivial and non-trivial phases. We show how the inclusion of nondipole terms breaks dipole selection rules, allowing for new polarizations of the generated light. Specifically we find that helicity, completely absent in the dipole approximation, is induced by the nondipole extension, and that this helicity is dependent on the topological phase of the material.</description>

      <title>PolySet: Restoring the Statistical Ensemble Nature of Polymers for Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine-learning (ML) models in polymer science typically treat a polymer as a single, perfectly defined molecular graph, even though real materials consist of stochastic ensembles of chains with distributed lengths. This mismatch between physical reality and digital representation limits the ability of current models to capture polymer behaviour. Here we introduce PolySet, a framework that represents a polymer as a finite, weighted ensemble of chains sampled from an assumed molar-mass distribution. This ensemble-based encoding is independent of chemical detail, compatible with any molecular representation and illustrated here in the homopolymer case using a minimal language model. We show that PolySet retains higher-order distributional moments (such as Mz, Mz+1), enabling ML models to learn tail-sensitive properties with greatly improved stability and accuracy. By explicitly acknowledging the statistical nature of polymer matter, PolySet establishes a physically grounded foundation for future polymer machine learning, naturally extensible to copolymers, block architectures, and other complex topologies.</description>

      <title>Chirality Imprinting and Spin-texture Tunability in Conformally Coated 3D Magnetic Nanostructured Metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) magnetic nanostructures offer unprecedented opportunities for engineering emergent spin textures, but controlling their configuration remains a central challenge. Here we show that conformally coated Ni Nanotubes arranged in a woodpile geometry with lattice spacings ranging from 800 to 1200 nm, realised by two-photon lithography and atomic layer deposition, exhibit a geometry-tuneable balance between chiral and axial states. Magnetic force microscopy on the top layer of the 3D woodpile reveals that few-layer systems exhibit a chiral contrast whilst increasing the number of stacked layers drives a transition to an axial configuration with the change in state populations depending strongly on lattice spacing. Micromagnetic simulations demonstrate that chirality is not intrinsic to isolated tubes but is imprinted by spin textures formed in the substrate sheet film, which couple into the 3D network. As the sheet-film influence diminishes with increasing layer number, dipolar interactions dominate and stabilise the axial state. This two-stage mechanism of chirality imprinting followed by increasingly dominant dipolar interactions, provides clear control parameters for tailoring spin-texture populations. Our results establish conformally coated woodpiles as a reconfigurable 3D ferromagnetic metamaterial platform that can be exploited for data storage, magnonics, and neuromorphic computing.</description>

      <title>Transport of Dirac magnons driven by gauge fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a unified quantum field theory for Dirac magnons coupled to emergent gauge fields. At zero temperature, any space- and time-dependent gauge perturbation drives magnons out of equilibrium, generating spin currents and magnon accumulation without conventional thermal or chemical potential gradients. For a honeycomb ferromagnet, we derive closed-form expressions for the induced density and current. In the DC limit, the transverse spin conductivity quantizes to $\sigma^{xy}=\alpha^2\text{sgn}(m)\hbar/4\pi$, a magnonic analog of the quantum Hall effect, where $m$ is the topological magnon mass and $\alpha$ a dimensionless coupling constant. In the AC regime, the conductivity exhibits a sharp resonance when the drive frequency matches the topological gap $\Delta$, signaling interband transitions. Our work establishes gauge fields as a versatile tool for controlling magnon transport and reveals topologically protected quantized responses.</description>

      <title>Gate-Tunable Giant Negative Magnetoresistance in Tellurene Driven by Quantum Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Negative magnetoresistance in conventional two-dimensional electron gases is a well-known phenomenon, but its origin in complex and topological materials, especially those endowed with quantum geometry, remains largely elusive. Here, we report the discovery of a giant negative magnetoresistance, reaching a remarkable $- 90\%$ of the resistance at zero magnetic field, $R_0$, in $n$-type tellurene films. This record-breaking effect persists over a wide magnetic field range (measured up to $35$ T) at cryogenic temperatures and is suppressed when the chemical potential shifts away from the Weyl node in the conduction band, strongly suggesting a quantum geometric origin. We propose two novel mechanisms for this phenomenon: a quantum geometric enhancement of diffusion and a magnetoelectric spin interaction that locks the spin of a Weyl fermion, in cyclotron motion under crossed electric $\boldsymbol{\cal E}$ and magnetic ${\bf B}$ fields, to its guiding-center drift, $(\boldsymbol{\cal E}\times{\bf B})\cdot\sigma$. We show that the time integral of the velocity auto-correlations promoted by the quantum metric between the spin-split conduction bands enhance diffusion, thereby reducing the resistance. This mechanism is experimentally confirmed by its unique magnetoelectric dependence, $\Delta R_{zz}(\boldsymbol{\cal E},{\bf B})/R_0=-\beta_{g}(\boldsymbol{\cal E}\times{\bf B})^2$, with $\beta_{g}$ determined by the quantum metric. Our findings establish a new, quantum geometric and non-Markovian memory effect in magnetotransport, paving the way for controlling electronic transport in complex and topological matter.</description>

      <title>Towards Animate Droplets: Active, Adaptive, and Autonomous</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Droplets, sub-millilitre liquid volumes with at least one interface, have traditionally served as compartments for storing, transporting, and delivering materials. Beyond familiar applications in food, coatings, and consumer goods, they find cutting-edge use in energy storage, sensing, and tissue engineering. The next frontier is their integration into animate matter, emerging materials defined by their levels of activity, adaptiveness, and autonomy. Easy to produce and dispense or print into complex structures, and with enormous chemical versatility, droplets are ideal building blocks for animate matter. In this Perspective, we outline a roadmap for advancing animacy in droplets and call for a more concerted effort to integrate novel mechanisms for motility, sensing, and decision-making into droplet design. Although research on active droplets spans more than a century, achieving true autonomy, where droplets process multiple stimuli and respond without external control, remains a central challenge. We hope to inspire interdisciplinary collaboration towards applications in consumer goods, microfluidics, adaptive optics, tissue engineering, and soft robotics.</description>

      <title>The classical-quantum disproportionation transition and magnetic ordering in RNiO$_3$ nickelates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The insulator-quasi-metal (bad metal) transition observed in Jahn-Teller (JT) magnets orthonickelates RNiO$_3$ (R = rare earth, or yttrium Y) is considered a canonical example of the Mott transition, traditionally described in the framework of Hubbard's $U-t$ model. However, in reality, the insulating phase of nickelates is the result of charge disproportionation (CD) with the formation of a system of spin-triplet ($S = 1$) electron [NiO$_6$]$^{10-}$ and spinless ($S = 0$) hole [NiO$_6$]$^{8-}$ centers, equivalent to a system of effective spin-triplet composite bosons moving in a nonmagnetic lattice. The effective CD-phase Hamiltonian takes into account local ($U$) and nonlocal ($V$) correlations, and the transfer of composite bosons ($t_b$). Within the framework of the effective field approximation, we have shown the existence of two types of CD phases: the high-temperature classical paramagnetic CO-phase of charge ordering of electron and hole centers, and the low-temperature magnetic quantum CDq phase with charge and spin density transfer between electron and hole centers, with ''uncertain valence'' [NiO$_{6}$]$^{(9\pm\delta)-}$ ($0 \le \delta \le 1$) and spin density $(1 \pm \delta)/2$ NiO$_6$-centers. In the classical CO phase, spin-triplet electron centers are surrounded by the nearest nonmagnetic hole centers, which ''turns off'' the strong superexchange interaction of the nearest neighbors. The magnetic ordering in the quantum CDq phase is determined by a strong traditional superexchange and an unusual bosonic double exchange mechanism.</description>

Abstract: The management of thermal effects in plasmonic nanostructures is frequently viewed as a detrimental waste rather than a useful, controllable entity. We show that optical coupling of plasmonic nanoparticles enables precise spatiotemporal control over nanoscale heating. Through numerical investigation of experimentally-achievable systems from individual nanoparticles and dimers to nanolenses and switchable clusters, we demonstrate how plasmon hybridization and near-field coupling dictate the magnitude and spatial distribution of temperature. Our results highlight the critical role of polarization and gap distance in tuning the thermal output of dimers, the ability of a trimer nanolens to focus heat into a sub-diffraction volume, and the pronounced thermal difference in a switchable nanoparticle cluster. This work establishes a framework for designing advanced thermoplasmonic systems where heat is not merely a detriment, but a dynamically controllable element for applications in catalysis, health, or active photonic devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2205.11839v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report a systematic and accurate approach for deriving the bulk free energy surface (FES), a function of temperature, polarization, and strain, from the first-principles density functional theory (DFT) of proper ferroelectrics. The core of our approach is the metadynamics algorithm that extracts the polarization dependence of the FES from all-atom molecular dynamics simulations without an a priori ansatz. The rest of the FES is derived from the metadynamics trajectories that span the relevant phase space. We demonstrate our approach in the case of lead titanate. The errors across the phase transition, due to DFT numerics, all-atom molecular dynamics, and free energy evaluation by enhanced sampling, can be systematically controlled and are of the order of 1meV/atom. The accuracy of the resulting ab initio FES is only limited by the adopted functional approximation of DFT.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21707v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thin film effects on the Magnetocrystalline Anisotropy Energy (MAE) of MnN were studied using density functional theory (DFT). Initially, strain effects on bulk MnN were considered as a proxy for lattice-matching induced strain and a linear relationship between the $c/a$ ratio and the MAE was found. A fundamental explanation for this relationship in terms of the underlying point-group symmetry is given, which we show is applicable to all uniaxial magnetic materials. Strain and charge-transfer effects were then considered for an ultra-thin film. It was found that a Ta seed-layer suppresses the net spin moment on the Mn ions, leading to a reduction of the MAE. Charge transfer is shown to be the cause of this, and hence similar effects may be expected at any magnetic heterostructure interface.</description>

      <title>Wavefunction-Free Approach for Predicting Nonlinear Responses in Weyl Semimetals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09187v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By sidestepping the intractable calculations of many-body wavefunctions, density functional theory (DFT) has revolutionized the prediction of ground states of materials. However, predicting nonlinear responses--critical for next-generation quantum devices--still relies heavily on explicit wavefunctions, limiting computational efficiency. In this letter, using the circular photogalvanic effect (CPGE) in Weyl semimetals as a representative example, we realize a 1000-fold computational speedup by eliminating the explicit dependence on wavefunctions. Our approach leverages the one-to-one correspondence between free parameters of Weyl fermions and the associated responses to obtain precise wavefunction-free formulations. Applying our methodology, we systematically investigated known Weyl semimetals and revealed that Ta$_3$S$_2$ exhibits photocurrents an order of magnitude greater than those observed in TaAs, with potential for an additional order-of-magnitude enhancement under strain. To further demonstrate the generality of our approach, we obtained a wavefunction-free formula for the Berry-curvature dipole in Weyl semimetals. Our work paves the way for substantially more efficient screening and optimization of nonlinear electromagnetic properties in topological quantum materials.</description>

Abstract: Rare earth/transition metal (RE/TM) multilayers with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy are key ingredients for the development of spintronic applications. Their compensation temperature depends on the ratio of the thicknesses of rare earth and transition metal, allowing their magnetic properties to be tuned with temperature while maintaining their anisotropy even in nanometer-scale devices. In this work, we performed a thorough structural characterization and systematically investigate the magnetic properties of a whole family of ferrimagnetic [Tb/Co]$_{\times 5}$ multilayers varying the Tb thickness in the range of 0.4 nm - 1.25 nm. A linear dependence of the compensation temperature on the Tb layer thickness was observed. Moreover, a uniaxial anisotropy constant of 330$\pm$30 kJ/m$^3$, which is close to the values reported by other authors, was estimated. Additionally, we proposed a model to gain a better understanding of the angular dependence of the magnetization loops and the linear dependence of the compensation temperature. We present strong evidence demonstrating that the perpendicular anisotropy must be tilted away from the perpendicular axis in order to explain the observed features, particularly the hysteresis in the in-plane loops. Our work advances the understanding of DC magnetic properties in thin RE/TM ferrimagnetic films, which has the potential to impact different fields where these materials are involved.</description>

      <title>Band Meandering due to Charged Impurity Effects and Carrier Transport in Ternary Topological Insulators</title>

Abstract: Controlling charged impurity disorder is a critical challenge for realizing the promise of topological insulator (TI) surfaces in devices. While doping is often used to tune the chemical potential, its impact on the fundamental disorder landscape remains poorly understood. Here, we investigate this effect in ternary (Bi,Sb)$_2$Te$_3$ (BST) thin films and their indium-doped (IBST) counterparts. Gate-dependent transport reveals that indium doping increases charged impurity density by an order of magnitude, which in turn reduces the characteristic size of disorder-induced charge puddles from $\sim$91 nm to $\sim$38 nm. This amplified disorder enhances Coulomb scattering and suppresses field-effect mobility, directly demonstrating how doping-induced compensation degrades surface transport. Our work establishes doping as a powerful method to probe the limits of topological protection and underscores that defect suppression, not just compensation, is essential for developing high-performance TI devices.</description>

      <title>Solute segregation-induced activation of grain boundary disconnections</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19429v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Disconnections, long recognized as the key mediators of grain boundary (GB) kinetics in polycrystalline materials, have traditionally been understood to nucleate through thermal or mechanical activation. In this work, using atomistic simulations, we reveal a distinct nucleation mechanism driven exclusively by solute interstitial segregation across multiple substitutional binary alloy systems (e.g., Al-Ni, Al-Fe). This process exhibits a zero-nucleation energy barrier, contrasting sharply with the nucleation mechanisms in pure systems. We identify two segregation-induced disconnection types: (i) annihilable disconnections that promote GB migration and annihilate with continuous segregation, and (ii) permanent disconnections that form stable dipoles, which are mechanically robust, suppressing shear-coupled migration and instead resulting in GB amorphization and pure sliding under applied shear loading. The long-range stress fields associated with these permanent disconnections further attract solute atoms and assist the nucleation of precipitates. These solute segregation-activated disconnections, absent in pure materials, follow unique nucleation pathways as confirmed through dichromatic pattern analysis and persist across different alloy chemistries and crystal structures. Our findings demonstrate that solute interstitial segregation provides a powerful and previously unrecognized pathway for barrier-free disconnection formation, thereby fundamentally extending current understanding of GB kinetics in alloy systems.</description>

      <title>Reduced Order Modeling of Energetic Materials Using Physics-Aware Recurrent Convolutional Neural Networks in a Latent Space (LatentPARC)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12401v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Physics-aware deep learning (PADL) has gained popularity for use in complex spatiotemporal dynamics (field evolution) simulations, such as those that arise frequently in computational modeling of energetic materials (EM). Here, we show that the challenge PADL methods face while learning complex field evolution problems can be simplified and accelerated by decoupling it into two tasks: learning complex geometric features in evolving fields and modeling dynamics over these features in a lower dimensional feature space. To accomplish this, we build upon our previous work on physics-aware recurrent convolutions (PARC). PARC embeds knowledge of underlying physics into its neural network architecture for more robust and accurate prediction of evolving physical fields. PARC was shown to effectively learn complex nonlinear features such as the formation of hotspots and coupled shock fronts in various initiation scenarios of EMs, as a function of microstructures, serving effectively as a microstructure-aware burn model. In this work, we further accelerate PARC and reduce its computational cost by projecting the original dynamics onto a lower-dimensional invariant manifold, or 'latent space.' The projected latent representation encodes the complex geometry of evolving fields (e.g. temperature and pressure) in a set of data-driven features. The reduced dimension of this latent space allows us to learn the dynamics during the initiation of EM with a lighter and more efficient model. We observe a significant decrease in training and inference time while maintaining results comparable to PARC at inference. This work takes steps towards enabling rapid prediction of EM thermomechanics at larger scales and characterization of EM structure-property-performance linkages at a full application scale.</description>

      <title>Machine-Learning-Guided Insights into Solid-Electrolyte Interphase Conductivity: Are Amorphous Lithium Fluorophosphates the Key?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.22912v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite decades of study, the identity of the dominant \ce{Li+}-conducting phase within the inorganic SEI of Li-ion batteries remains unresolved. While the mosaic model describes LiF/\ce{Li2O}/\ce{Li2CO3} nanocrystallites within a disordered matrix, these crystalline phases inherently offer limited ionic conductivity. Growing evidence suggests that interfaces, grain boundaries, and amorphous phases may instead host the primary fast-ion pathways. Using diffusion-based generative structure prediction and machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs), we investigate lithium difluorophosphate (\ce{LiPO2F2}), a key mixed-anion decomposition product of phosphorus- and fluorine-containing electrolytes. We identify a stable crystalline polymorph and demonstrate that the amorphous counterpart is conductive, with projected room-temperature $\sigma \approx 0.18$ mS cm$^{-1}$ and $E_\mathrm{a} \approx 0.40$ eV. This enhancement stems from structural disorder flattening the Li site-energy landscape and a low formation energy for Li-interstitial defects, which supplies additional mobile carriers. We propose amorphous mixed-anion Li--P--O--F phases as a promising conducting medium in the SEI, offering a specific target for engineering improved battery interfaces.</description>

      <title>AQCat25: Unlocking spin-aware, high-fidelity machine learning potentials for heterogeneous catalysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22938v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large-scale datasets have enabled highly accurate machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) for general-purpose heterogeneous catalysis modeling. There are, however, some limitations in what can be treated with these potentials because of gaps in the underlying training data. To extend these capabilities, we introduce AQCat25, a complementary dataset of 13.5 million density functional theory (DFT) single point calculations designed to improve the treatment of systems where spin polarization and/or higher fidelity are critical. We also investigate methodologies for integrating new datasets, such as AQCat25, with the broader Open Catalyst 2020 (OC20) dataset to create spin-aware models without sacrificing generalizability. We find that directly tuning a general model on AQCat25 leads to catastrophic forgetting of the original dataset's knowledge. Conversely, joint training strategies prove effective for improving accuracy on the new data without sacrificing general performance. This joint approach introduces a challenge, as the model must learn from a dataset containing both mixed-fidelity calculations and mixed-physics (spin-polarized vs. unpolarized). We show that explicitly conditioning the model on this system-specific metadata, for example by using Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM), successfully addresses this challenge and further enhances model accuracy. Ultimately, our work establishes an effective protocol for bridging DFT fidelity domains to advance the predictive power of foundational models in catalysis.</description>

      <title>Terahertz Time-Domain Spectroscopy and Density Functional Theory Analysis of Low-Frequency Vibrational Modes of a Benzoxazolium-Coumarin Donor-pi-Acceptor Chromophore</title>

Abstract: To elucidate low-frequency vibrational modes, we investigate a benzoxazolium--coumarin (BCO+) donor-pi-acceptor derivative using transmission terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS). The retrieved complex refractive index reveals distinct modes at 0.62, 0.85, 1.30, 1.81, and 2.07 THz. Gas-phase density functional theory (DFT) agrees well with these features and enables assignment of specific intramolecular motions. Together, THz-TDS and DFT identify the characteristic low-frequency modes of BCO+ and suggest their connection to intramolecular charge transfer-relevant nuclear motions, highlighting that THz-TDS can serve as a sensitive probe of vibrational signatures in donor-pi-acceptor systems.</description>

      <title>Robust coherent phonon mode localized at GaP/Si(001) heterointerface</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19840v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultrafast electron and phonon dynamics at a buried interface of GaP/Si(001) are investigated at different growth stages of the GaP layer by combining interface-specific photoexcitation and transient reflectivity detection. A discrete electronic state, which dominates the charge carrier dynamics at the interface of a thin low-temperature nucleation layer, is found to be quenched by the following high-temperature overgrowth. A coherent phonon mode localized at the heterointerface is observed for both the thin nucleation layers and the thicker overgrown layers, and their amplitude exhibits the similar resonance behavior to that of the interface electronic transition at the respective growth stages. The optical polarization-dependence of the phonon amplitude is nearly isotropic for the nucleation layer but becomes anisotropic after the overgrowth, possibly due to the formation of an intermixing layer. Our observations imply that the 2-THz phonon mode itself is robust against the high-temperature overgrowth, but its amplitude is defined by the coupling with the interface electronic transition that is more sensitively affected by the overgrowth.</description>

      <title>A Unified Symmetry Classification of Magnetic Orders via Spin Space Groups: Prediction of Coplanar Even-Wave Phases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08901v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spin space groups (SSGs) impose fundamentally different constraints on magnetic configurations in real and reciprocal spaces. As a consequence, the correspondence between real-space and momentum-space spin arrangements is far richer than traditionally assumed. Building on the complete enumeration of SSGs, we develop a systematic, symmetry-based framework that classifies all possible spin arrangements allowed by these groups. This unified approach naturally incorporates conventional magnetic orders, altermagnetism, and p-wave magnetism as distinct symmetry classes. Crucially, our classification predicts a variety of novel magnetic phases, highlighted by the discovery of the coplanar even-wave magnet: a state that is non-collinear in real space but hosts a collinear even-wave spin polarization in k-space. Analysis of a minimal model reveals that this phase is characterized by non-quantized spin polarization and exhibits a novel mechanism for symmetry-enforced zero polarization on non-degenerate bands. Extending the framework from bulk crystals to layer SSGs appropriate for two-dimensional systems, we further predict layered counterparts and provide symmetry guidelines for designing bilayer coplanar p-wave and even-wave magnets. We further validate this finding through first-principles calculations and propose CoCrO4 as a promising candidate for its experimental realization, thereby demonstrating the completeness and predictive power of the SSG-based classification of magnetic orders.</description>

      <title>Self-consistent tensor network method for correlated super-moir\'e matter beyond one billion sites</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04373v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Moir\'e and super-moir\'e materials provide exceptional platforms to engineer exotic correlated quantum matter. The vast number of sites required to model moir\'e systems in real space remains a formidable challenge due to the immense computational resources required. Super-moir\'e materials push this requirement to the limit, where millions or even billions of sites need to be considered, a requirement beyond the capabilities of conventional methods for interacting systems. Here, we establish a methodology that allows solving correlated states in systems reaching a billion sites, that exploits tensor-network representations of real-space Hamiltonians and self-consistent real-space mean-field equations. Our method combines a tensor-network kernel polynomial method with quantics tensor cross interpolation algorithm, enabling us to solve exponentially large models, including those whose single particle Hamiltonian is too large to be stored explicitly. We demonstrate our methodology with super-moir\'e systems featuring spatially modulated hoppings, many-body interactions and domain walls, showing that it allows access to self-consistent symmetry broken states and spectral functions of real-space models reaching a billion sites. Our methodology provides a strategy to solve exceptionally large interacting problems, providing a widely applicable strategy to compute correlated super-moir\'e quantum matter.</description>

Abstract: Arrays of Rydberg atoms interacting via dipole-dipole interactions offer a powerful platform for probing quantum many-body physics. However, these intrinsic interactions also determine and constrain the models -- and parameter regimes thereof -- for quantum simulation. Here, we propose a systematic framework to engineer arbitrary desired long-range interactions in Rydberg-atom lattices, enabling the realization of fully tunable $J_1$-$J_2$-$J_3$ Heisenberg models. Using site-resolved periodic modulation of Rydberg states, we develop an experimentally feasible protocol to precisely control the interaction ratios $J_2/J_1$ and $J_3/J_1$ in a kagome lattice. This control can increase the effective range of interactions and drive transitions between competing spin-ordered and spin liquid phases. To generalize this approach beyond the kagome lattice, we reformulate the design of modulation patterns through a graph-theoretic approach, demonstrating the universality of our method across all 11 planar Archimedean lattices. Our strategy overcomes the inherent constraints of power-law-decaying dipolar interactions, providing a versatile toolbox for exploring frustrated magnetism, emergent topological phases, and quantum correlations in systems with long-range interactions.</description>

Abstract: Frustrated magnets provide a platform for exploring exotic phases beyond conventional ordering, with potential relevance to functional materials and information technologies. In this work, we use Monte Carlo simulations to map the thermodynamic phase diagram of pyrochlore iridates R2Ir2O7 (R = Dy, Ho) with three stable magnetic ground-state stable phases: frustrated spin-ice 2 in 2 out (2I2O) phase, frustrated fragmented 3 in 1 out/1 in 3 out (3I1O/1I3O) phase, and antiferromagnetic all in all out (AIAO) phase without frustration. We discovered two additional emergent metastable phases at finite temperatures, located between the boundaries separating those stable phases. These metastable phases exhibit high magnetic susceptibility and high entropy without long-range order. Their stabilization arises from entropic minimization of the free energy, where the entropy dominates energetic competition near phase boundaries at finite temperatures. Our results demonstrate a platform to engineer highly susceptible and degenerated states through frustration and thermal activation, offering a foundation for entropy-based design of metastable phases in correlated systems.</description>

Abstract: Oxygen-scavenging at oxide heterointerfaces has emerged as a powerful route for stabilizing metastable phases that exhibit interesting phenomena, including high-mobility two-dimensional electron gases and high T$_{c}$ superconductivity. We investigate structural and chemical interactions at the heterointerface formed between Al or Eu and the charged-ordered insulator, BaBiO$_3$, leading to emergent superconductivity at 6 K. A combination of X-ray diffraction and electron microscopy measurements shows that oxygen scavenging by the Eu and Al adlayers leads to the formation of superconducting intermetallic BaBi$_3$ in nominal Eu/BaBiO$_3$ and Al/BaBiO$_3$ bilayers. Anisotropic magnetotransport measurements and current-voltage signatures of quasi two-dimensional superconductivity are observed. The mechanisms behind quasi-two-dimensional superconductivity and the role of disorder remain to be clarified. These findings highlight the potential for the use of in situ reduction of bismuthate heterostructures as a platform for stabilizing materials with exotic functional properties. Additionally, the strong spin-orbit coupling at the Bi sites may pave the way for the realization of high T$_{c}$ topological superconductivity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13887v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A key challenge in performing experiments with microparticles is controlling their adhesion to substrates. For example, levitation of a microparticle initially resting on a surface requires overcoming the surface adhesion forces to deliver the microparticle into a mechanical potential acting as a trap. By engineering the surface of silicon substrates, we aim to decrease the adhesion force between a metallic microparticle and the silicon surface. To this end, we investigate different methods of surface engineering that are based on chemical, physical, or physio-chemical modifications of the surface of silicon. We give quantitative results on the detachment force, finding a correlation between the water contact angle and the mean detachment force, indicating that hydrophobic surfaces are desired for low microparticle adhesion. We develop surface preparations decreasing the mean detachment force by more than a factor of three compared to an untreated silicon surface. Our results will enable reliable levitation of microparticles and are relevant for experiments requiring low adhesion between microparticles and a surface.</description>

Abstract: This study proposes a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) framework to predict the low-cycle fatigue (LCF) life of irradiated austenitic and ferritic/martensitic (F/M) steels used in nuclear reactors. During operation, these materials undergo cyclic loading and irradiation at elevated temperatures, resulting in complex degradation mechanisms that traditional empirical or purely data-driven models often fail to capture accurately. The developed PINN model incorporates physical fatigue life constraints into its loss function, improving prediction accuracy, reliability, and generalizability. Trained on 495 data points, including both irradiated and unirradiated conditions, the model is more robust than traditional machine learning models, such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, eXtreme Gradient Boosting, and the conventional Neural Network. Model interpretability assessed via SHapley Additive exPlanations analysis revealed that strain amplitude, irradiation dose, and test temperature are the dominant features, each exhibiting a physically consistent inverse correlation with fatigue life. Univariate and multivariate analyses showed that strain amplitude is the primary driver of fatigue degradation in both alloy classes, while irradiation dose and temperature introduce alloy-specific sensitivities. The PINN successfully captured key mechanistic trends, including the comparatively stable irradiation response and dose saturation behaviour of F/M steels, as well as a pronounced reduction in fatigue life at elevated temperatures exceeding the tempering threshold. Overall, the proposed PINN framework offers a reliable and interpretable tool for predicting fatigue life in irradiated structural alloys, thereby supporting informed materials selection and performance assessment for advanced nuclear reactor applications.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Optical Probing of Laser Processing</title>

Abstract: Laser treatment has emerged into a cornerstone of industrial manufacturing. This creates the demand to understand in detail the involved physical processes and their dynamics, to control the process, and to keep guard in-situ the laser manufacturing steps. Given the contactless interaction of light with matter, particularly optical methods appear most suitable for probing laser processing. This chapter reviews the current scientific and technological state of analyzing laser-based material processing by short and ultrashort optical pulses. For that, sequential passive interrogation of material properties (via reflection, absorption, scattering, diffraction, interference, or specific nonlinear responses) can be employed through so-called pump-probe techniques (where the time-resolution is not given by the detector response time but by the duration of an electromagnetic probe pulse that is interrogating the transient scenery at a controlled delay (typ. fs to \mu s) with respect to the arrival of the pump laser pulse). These approaches are capable to analyze on microscopic to macroscopic scales a plethora of different processes involved in laser processing, such as heating, melting, ablation, plasma- and shockwave-formation, optical breakdown in surrounding liquids and gases, shielding and accumulation effects, surface solidification and restructuring, etc. A special focus is set on the variety of ultrafast optical imaging schemes for visualizing the dynamics of laser processing at the surface and in the bulk of the irradiated materials, including photography and microscopy, holography, tomography, ptychography, and coherent diffractive imaging. The chapter provides a historic survey, highlights important scientific and technological developments and breakthroughs, discusses selected applications, explores the requirements and current limitations, and sheds light on emerging future trends.</description>

      <title>How Does Incubation Affect Laser Material Processing?</title>

Abstract: In the last decades, the subject of laser-induced damage (LID) moved from a topic of scientific interest toward laser material processing for technical applications. When using pulsed lasers, the cumulative effect known as incubation is one of the most fundamental features of the processing event. Incubation manifests by the fact that the critical fluence for LID (known as laser-induced damage threshold, LIDT) depends on the number of pulses N exciting one spot on the sample. In most cases, the threshold fluence decreases with N starting from the single-shot ablation threshold and remains constant for large N. No ablation or damage occurs for any N, if the fluence is kept below the multiple-pulse threshold. In contrast, examples where the LIDT increases with N have been reported. The latter effect is known as laser conditioning and is advantageously used when ramping up the power of high-power laser systems. Incubation has been described for many types of solids; the motivation for these comprehensive efforts is twofold. Firstly, one tries to prevent the damage of optical materials in the beam path of high-energy or high-peak-power lasers. Secondly, one deliberately uses this damage for the sculpting of components. In this chapter, we introduce the reader to the mechanisms of incubation. We are going to look at the parameters controlling LID and highlight the peculiarity of the parameter "number of pulses". We will give an overview of the experimental work done in a variety of materials. There are several physical and chemical mechanisms proposed that govern incubation, and there are several mathematical models to describe the behavior of threshold fluence and ablation rate in dependence on the number of pulses. In a few cases, the two classes of mechanisms are even related to each other. Eventually, we will show the implications that incubation has on real-world laser machining.</description>

      <title>Light in Slices: How to Enable Precise Laser Processing?</title>

Abstract: Ultrashort (femtosecond, fs) laser pulses have fascinating properties as they allow to confine optical energy on extreme scales in space and time. Such fs-laser pulsed beams can be seen as spatially thin slices of intense light that are radially and axially constrained to the micrometer scale, while simultaneously propagating at the extremely high speed of light. Their high peak intensities and their short time lapse makes such laser pulses unique tools for materials processing, as their duration is shorter than the time required to transfer absorbed optical energy, via electron-phonon coupling, from the electronic system of the solid to its lattice. Hence, the laser pulse energy remains localized during the interaction and does not spread via diffusion into the area surrounding the irradiated region. As one consequence, the fs-laser thus offers increased precision for material modification or ablation accompanied by a reduced heat-affected zone of only a few hundred nanometers. On the other hand, the high laser peak intensities can enable nonlinear material interactions that are rendering unique material excitation and relaxation pathways possible. In this chapter, we briefly review the reasons for the enormous success of ultrashort pulse lasers in materials processing - both for the processing of the surface or in the bulk of solids. We identify the underlying fundamental processes that can limit the precision or the up-scaling of the laser processing towards large volumes, areas, or processing rates. Strategies to overcome such limitations will be outlined and questions on the ultimate limits of laser material processing will be answered.</description>
