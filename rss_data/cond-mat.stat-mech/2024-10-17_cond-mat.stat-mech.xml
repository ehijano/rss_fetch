      <title>On the time complexity analysis of numerical percolation threshold estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main purpose of percolation theory is to model phase transitions in a variety of random systems, which is highly valuable in fields related to materials physics, biology, or otherwise unrelated areas like oil extraction or even quantum computing. Thus, one of the problems encountered is the calculation of the threshold at which such transition occurs, known as percolation threshold. Since there are no known closed forms to determine the threshold in an exact manner in systems with particular properties, it is decided to rely on numerical methods as the Monte Carlo approach, which provides a sufficiently accurate approximation to serve as a valid estimate in the projects or research where it is involved. However, in order to achieve an exact characterization of the threshold in two-dimensional systems with site percolation, in this work it is performed an analysis of the complexity, both temporal and spatial, of an algorithm that implements its computation from the aforementioned numerical method. Specifically, the conduction of an accurate analysis of the cost of such algorithm implies a deep enough knowledge about certain metrics regarding its duration, or work completed per iteration, which along with its formalization may contribute to the determination of the threshold based on these metrics. Nevertheless, as a result, various bounds are achieved for the best, average and worst cases of the execution on systems spanning several dimensions, revealing that in 1 and 2 the complexity is directly conditioned by the duration, although from 3 onwards no proof for this point has been found, notwithstanding the evidence suggesting its compliance. Furthermore, based on the average case, several methods are proposed that could be applied to characterize the threshold, although they have not been thoroughly explored beyond what is necessary for the complexity analysis.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the interdisciplinary character of negative pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the concept of negative pressure and its relevance in a variety of physical contexts: the expansion of the universe, mixture theory, cavitation, and the capillary effect in plants. Using thermodynamic arguments, we discuss the intricate connection between negative pressure and negative thermal expansion. We highlight the fact that metastable states and competing phases are often associated with the emergence of negative pressure. We also propose a new link between the effective Gr\"uneisen parameter and nucleation theory.</description>

      <title>Increasing the clock speed of a thermodynamic computer by adding noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe a proposal for increasing the effective clock speed of a thermodynamic computer, by altering the interaction scale of the units within the computer and introducing to the computer an additional source of noise. The resulting thermodynamic computer program is equivalent to the original computer program, but runs at a higher clock speed. This approach offers a way of increasing the speed of thermodynamic computing while preserving the fidelity of computation.</description>

      <title>Random sequential covering of a one-dimensional lattice by $k$-mers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In random sequential covering, identical objects are deposited randomly, irreversibly, and sequentially; only attempts that increase coverage are accepted. The process continues indefinitely on an infinite substrate, and we analyze the dynamics of random sequential covering of $\mathbb{Z}$ using $k$-mers. We introduce a method that provides a comprehensive solution to the dynamics of this process. We derive explicit solutions for trimers, tetramers, and pentamers; we study numerically random sequential covering by longer polymers ($k&gt;5$).</description>

      <title>Renormalization-Group Analysis of the Many-Body Localization Transition in the Random-Field XXZ Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the spectral properties of the Heisenberg spin-1/2 chain with random fields in light of recent works of the renormalization-group flow of the Anderson model in infinite dimension. We reconstruct the beta function of the order parameter from the numerical data, and show that it does not admit a one-parameter scaling form and a simple Wilson-Fisher fixed point. Rather, it is compatible with a two-parameter, Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless-like flow with a line of fixed points (the many-body localized phase), which terminates into the localization transition critical point. Therefore, we argue that previous studies, which assumed the existence of an isolated Wilson- Fisher fixed point and performed one-parameter finite-size scaling analysis, could not explain the numerical data in a coherent way.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian bridge: A physics-driven generative framework for targeted pattern control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Patterns arise spontaneously in a range of systems spanning the sciences, and their study typically focuses on mechanisms to understand their evolution in space-time. Increasingly, there has been a transition towards controlling these patterns in various functional settings, with implications for engineering. Here, we combine our knowledge of a general class of dynamical laws for pattern formation in non-equilibrium systems, and the power of stochastic optimal control approaches to present a framework that allows us to control patterns at multiple scales, which we dub the "Hamiltonian bridge". We use a mapping between stochastic many-body Lagrangian physics and deterministic Eulerian pattern forming PDEs to leverage our recent approach utilizing the Feynman-Kac-based adjoint path integral formulation for the control of interacting particles and generalize this to the active control of patterning fields. We demonstrate the applicability of our computational framework via numerical experiments on the control of phase separation with and without a conserved order parameter, self-assembly of fluid droplets, coupled reaction-diffusion equations and finally a phenomenological model for spatio-temporal tissue differentiation. We interpret our numerical experiments in terms of a theoretical understanding of how the underlying physics shapes the geometry of the pattern manifold, altering the transport paths of patterns and the nature of pattern interpolation. We finally conclude by showing how optimal control can be utilized to generate complex patterns via an iterative control protocol over pattern forming pdes which can be casted as gradient flows. All together, our study shows how we can systematically build in physical priors into a generative framework for pattern control in non-equilibrium systems across multiple length and time scales.</description>

      <title>Phase vs coin vs position disorder as a probe for the resilience and revival of single particle entanglement in cyclic quantum walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum states exhibiting single-particle entanglement (SPE) can encode and process quantum information more robustly than their multi-particle analogs. Understanding the vulnerability and resilience of SPE to disorder is therefore crucial. This letter investigates phase, coin, and position disorder via discrete-time quantum walks on odd and even cyclic graphs to study their effect on SPE. The reduction in SPE is insignificant for low levels of phase or coin disorder, showing the resilience of SPE to minor perturbations. However, SPE is seen to be more vulnerable to position disorder. We analytically prove that maximally entangled single-particle states (MESPS) at time step $t=1$ are impervious to phase disorder regardless of the choice of the initial state. Further, MESPS at timestep $t=1$ is also wholly immune to coin disorder for phase-symmetric initial states. Position disorder breaks odd-even parity and distorts the physical time cone of the quantum walker, unlike phase or coin disorder. SPE saturates towards a fixed value for position disorder, irrespective of the disorder strength at large timestep $t$. Furthermore, SPE can be enhanced with moderate to significant phase or coin disorder strengths at specific time steps. Interestingly, disorder can revive single-particle entanglement from absolute zero in some instances, too. These results are crucial in understanding single-particle entanglement evolution and dynamics in a lab setting.</description>

      <title>Control of Probability Flow in Markov Chain Monte Carlo -- Nonreversibility and Lifting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.0258</link>
      <description>arXiv:1207.0258v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method is widely used in various fields as a powerful numerical integration technique for systems with many degrees of freedom. In MCMC methods, probabilistic state transitions can be considered as a random walk in state space, and random walks allow for sampling from complex distributions. However, paradoxically, it is necessary to carefully suppress the randomness of the random walk to improve computational efficiency. By breaking detailed balance, we can create a probability flow in the state space and perform more efficient sampling along this flow. Motivated by this idea, practical and efficient nonreversible MCMC methods have been developed over the past ten years. In particular, the lifting technique, which introduces probability flows in an extended state space, has been applied to various systems and has proven more efficient than conventional reversible updates. We review and discuss several practical approaches to implementing nonreversible MCMC methods, including the shift method in the cumulative distribution and the directed-worm algorithm.</description>

      <title>Flocking in One Dimension: Asters and Reversals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.06671v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the one-dimensional active Ising model in which aligning particles undergo diffusion biased by the signs of their spins. The phase diagram obtained varying the density of particles, their hopping rate and the temperature controlling the alignment shows a homogeneous disordered phase but no homogeneous ordered one, as well as two phases with localized dense structures. In the flocking phase, large ordered aggregates move ballistically and stochastically reverse their direction of motion. In what we termed the "aster" phase, dense immobile aggregates of opposite magnetization face each other, exchanging particles, without any net motion of the aggregates. Using a combination of numerical simulations and mean-field theory, we study the evolution of the shapes of the flocks, the statistics of their reversal times, and their coarsening dynamics. Solving exactly for the zero-temperature dynamics of an aster allows us to understand their coarsening, which shows extremal dynamics, while mean-field equations account for their shape.</description>

      <title>Semiclassical study of diagonal and offdiagonal functions in the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.13183v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The so-called eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), which has been tested in various manybody models by numerical simulations, supplies a way of understanding eventual thermalization and is believed to be important for understanding processes of thermalization. Two functions play important roles in the application of ETH, one for averaged diagonal elements and the other for the variance of offdiagonal elements of an observable addressed by ETH on the energy basis. For the former function, a semiclassical expression is known of the zeroth order of hbar, while, little is known analytically for the latter. In this paper, a semiclassical expression is derived for the former function, which includes higher-order contributions of hbar. And, a semiclassical approximation is derived for the latter function, under the assumption of negligible correlations among energy eigenfuntions on an action basis. Relevance of the analytical predictions are tested numerically in the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model.</description>

      <title>Optimal diffusion of chiral active particles with strategic reorientations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14326v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the competing effects of simultaneous presence of chirality and generalised tumbles in the dynamics of an active Brownian particle. Chiral active particles perform circular motions that give rise to slow transport at late times. By interrupting these circular trajectories at the right time or by performing a tumble at the correct angle, we show that particles can enhance their diffusion. After deriving exact expressions for the orientational propagator and correlations, we use this to calculate the first two moments of displacement. For the effective diffusion coefficient, we study various optimal tumbling strategies. We show that under optimisation of the tumbling rate, the case of symmetrically distributed tumbles always give rise to enhanced diffusion, with an effective diffusion coefficient taking a universal value. Next, two cases are considered in detail, namely directional reversal and tumbles at an arbitrary but fixed angle. We discuss how asymmetric tumbles can enhance diffusion beyond that of symmetric tumbles. Finally, we discuss a situation where the reorientations are realized dynamically in finite time.</description>

      <title>A First Principles Numerical Demonstration of Emergent Decoherent Histories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.10258v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Within the histories formalism the decoherence functional is a formal tool to investigate the emergence of classicality in isolated quantum systems, yet an explicit evaluation of it from first principles has not been reported. We provide such an evaluation for up to five-time histories based on exact numerical diagonalization of the Schr\"odinger equation. We find a robust emergence of decoherence for slow and coarse observables of a generic random matrix model and extract a finite size scaling law by varying the Hilbert space dimension over four orders of magnitude. Specifically, we conjecture and observe an exponential suppression of coherent effects as a function of the particle number of the system. This suggests a solution to the preferred basis problem of the many worlds interpretation (or the set selection problem of the histories formalism) within a minimal theoretical framework -- without relying on environmentally induced decoherence, quantum Darwinism, Markov approximations, low-entropy initial states or ensemble averages.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.10192v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by recent experimental studies of local magnetic moments interacting with a metallic quasicrystal, we study the low-temperature fate of spins placed in two-dimensional tilings. In the diluted local moment limit, we calculate the spin relaxation rate $1/T_{1}$, as measured by electron spin resonance, and show that it displays a marked dependence on the system size $N$ and the filing $n$ of the electronic bath. For a finite concentration of spins, we integrate out the conduction electrons and generate an effective magnetic coupling between the local moments, which we treat as Ising spins. Despite the strongly frustrating nature of the magnetic couplings and the lack of periodicity in the problem, we find long-range orders for finite $N$ in our large-scale Monte Carlo simulations. However, the resulting magnetically state is fragile, as clusters of essentially free spins fluctuate down to very low temperatures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17884v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Controlling many-body quantum systems is a highly challenging task required to advance quantum technologies. Here, we report progress in controlling gapless many-body quantum systems described by the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL). To do so, we investigate the exact dynamics of the TLL induced by an interaction quench, making use of the $SU(1,1)$ dynamical symmetry group and the Schr\"odinger picture. First, we demonstrate that this approach is useful to perform a shortcut to adiabaticity, that cancels the final non-adiabatic residual energy of the driven TLL and is experimentally implementable in the semiclassical limit of the sine-Gordon model. Second, we apply this framework to analyze various driving schemes in finite time, including linear ramps and smooth protocols.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07090v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a comprehensive analytical benchmark, relying on Fokker-Planck formalism, to study microbial dynamics in presence of both biotic and abiotic forces. In equilibrium, we observe a balance between the two kinds of forces, leading to no correlations between species abundances. This implies that real microbiomes, where correlations have been observed, operate out of equilibrium. Therefore, we analyze non-equilibrium dynamics, presenting an ansatz for an approximate solution that embodies the complex interplay of forces in the system. This solution is consistent with Taylor's law as a coarse-grained approximation of the relation between species abundance and variance, but implies subtler effects, predicting unobserved structure beyond Taylor's law. Motivated by this theoretical prediction, we refine the analysis of existing metagenomic data, unveiling a novel universal macroecological pattern. Finally, we speculate on the physical origin of Taylor's law: building upon an analogy with Brownian motion theory, we propose that Taylor's law emerges as a Fluctuation-Growth relation resulting from equipartition of environmental resources among microbial species.</description>

Abstract: We study multiscalar theories with $\text{O}(N) \times \text{O}(2)$ symmetry. These models have a stable fixed point in $d$ dimensions if $N$ is greater than some critical value $N_c(d)$. Previous estimates of this critical value from perturbative and non-perturbative renormalization group methods have produced mutually incompatible results. We use numerical conformal bootstrap methods to constrain $N_c(d)$ for $3 \leq d &lt; 4$. Our results show that $N_c&gt; 3.78$ for $d = 3$. This favors the scenario that the physically relevant models with $N = 2,3$ in $d=3$ do not have a stable fixed point, indicating a first-order transition. Our result exemplifies how conformal windows can be rigorously constrained with modern numerical bootstrap algorithms.</description>

      <title>Effect of noise on quantum circuit realization of non-Hermitian time crystals</title>

Abstract: Non-Hermitian quantum dynamics lie in an intermediate regime between unitary Hamiltonian dynamics and trace-preserving non-unitary open quantum system dynamics. Given differences in the noise tolerance of unitary and non-unitary dynamics, it is interesting to consider implementing non-Hermitian dynamics on a noisy quantum computer. In this paper, we do so for a non-Hermitian Ising Floquet model whose many-body dynamics gives rise to persistent temporal oscillations, a form of time crystallinity. In the simplest two qubit case that we consider, there is an infinitely long-lived periodic steady state at certain fine-tuned points. These oscillations remain reasonably long-lived over a range of parameters in the ideal non-Hermitean dynamics and for the levels of noise and imperfection expected of modern day quantum devices. Using a generalized Floquet analysis, we show that infinitely long-lived oscillations are generically lost for arbitrarily weak values of common types of noise and compute corresponding damping rate. We perform simulations using IBM's Qiskit platform to confirm our findings; however, experiments on a real device (ibmq-lima) do not show remnants of these oscillations.</description>

      <title>Non-Universality from Conserved Superoperators in Unitary Circuits</title>

Abstract: An important result in the theory of quantum control is the "universality" of $2$-local unitary gates, i.e. the fact that any global unitary evolution of a system of $L$ qudits can be implemented by composition of $2$-local unitary gates. Surprisingly, recent results have shown that universality can break down in the presence of symmetries: in general, not all globally symmetric unitaries can be constructed using $k$-local symmetric unitary gates. This also restricts the dynamics that can be implemented by symmetric local Hamiltonians. In this paper, we show that obstructions to universality in such settings can in general be understood in terms of superoperator symmetries associated with unitary evolution by restricted sets of gates. These superoperator symmetries lead to block decompositions of the operator Hilbert space, which dictate the connectivity of operator space, and hence the structure of the dynamical Lie algebra. We demonstrate this explicitly in several examples by systematically deriving the superoperator symmetries from the gate structure using the framework of commutant algebras, which has been used to systematically derive symmetries in other quantum many-body systems. We clearly delineate two different types of non-universality, which stem from different structures of the superoperator symmetries, and discuss its signatures in physical observables. In all, our work establishes a comprehensive framework to explore the universality of unitary circuits and derive physical consequences of its absence.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed renormalisation group flows</title>

Abstract: The physics of strongly correlated systems offers some of the most intriguing physics challenges such as competing orders or the emergence of dynamical composite degrees of freedom. Often, the resolution of these physics challenges is computationally hard, but can be simplified enormously by a formulation in terms of the dynamical degrees of freedom and within an expansion about the physical ground state. Importantly, such a formulation does not only reduce or minimise the computational challenges, it also facilitates the access to the physics mechanisms at play. The tasks of finding the dynamical degrees of freedom and the physical ground state can be systematically addressed within the functional renormalisation group approach with flowing fields which accommodates both, emergent composites as well as the physical ground state.
  In the present work we use this approach to set up physics-informed renormalisation group flows (PIRG flows): Scale-dependent coordinate transformations in field space induce emergent composites, and the respective flows for the effective action generate a large set of target actions, formulated in these emergent composite fields. This novel perspective on RG flows bears a great potential both for conceptual as well as computational applications: to begin with, PIRG flows allow for a systematic search of the dynamical degrees of freedom and the respective ground state that leads to the most rapid convergence of expansion schemes, thus minimising the computational effort. Secondly, the resolution of the remaining computational tasks within a given expansion scheme can be further reduced by optimising the physics content within a given approximation. Thirdly, the maximal variability of PIRG flows can be used to reduce the analytic and numerical effort of solving the flows within a given approximation.</description>
