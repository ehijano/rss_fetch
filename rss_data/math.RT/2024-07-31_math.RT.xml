      <title>Bounding regularity of $FI^m$-modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $FI$ be a skeleton of the category of finite sets and injective maps, and $FI^m$ the product of $m$ copies of $FI$. We prove that if an $FI^m$-module is generated in degree $\leqslant d$ and related in degree $\leqslant r$, then its regularity is bounded above by a function of $m$, $d$, and $r$.</description>

      <title>Geometric Langlands for Irregular Theta Connections and Epipelagic Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From a stable vector of a stable grading on a simple Lie algebra, Yun defined a rigid automorphic datum that encodes a epipelagic representation, and also an irregular connection on the projective line called $\theta$-connection. We show that under geometric Langlands correspondence, $\theta$-connection corresponds to the Hecke eigensheaf attached the rigid automorphic datum, assuming the stable grading is inner and its Kac coordinate $s_0$ is positive. We provide numerous applications of the main result including physical and cohomological rigidity of $\theta$-connections, global oper structures, and a de Rham analog of Reeder-Yu's predictions on epipelagic Langlands parameters.</description>

      <title>On the operator-valued Fourier transform of the Harish-Chandra Schwartz Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a $K-$type decomposition of the Harish-Chandra Schwartz algebra $\mathcal{C}^{p}(G),$ for any real-rank $1$ reductive group $G$ with a maximal compact subgroup $K$ and $0&lt;p\leq2.$ This decomposition is then used to give an infinite-matrix-realization of the operator-valued Fourier image $$\mathfrak{F}:\mathcal{C}^{p}(G)\rightarrow \mathcal{C}^{p}(\hat{G})$$ of $\mathcal{C}^{p}(G)$ as a Fr$\acute{e}$chet multiplication algebra in which every member of $\mathcal{C}^{p}(\hat{G})$ consists of a countable block-matrices of the form $$((\mathfrak{F}_{B}(\breve{\alpha})_{(\gamma,m)}(\Lambda)\otimes\mathfrak{F}_{H}(\breve{\alpha})_{(\gamma,l)}(Q:\chi:\nu))_{\gamma\in F, (l,m)\in\mathbb{Z}^{2}})_{F\subset \hat{K},|F|&lt;\infty}$$ for every $\alpha\in \mathcal{C}^{p}(G).$ This proves Trombi's conjecture for $G$ of real rank $1$ and the technique leads to a proof of the fundamental theorem of harmonic analysis for any arbitrary real-rank reductive group $G.$</description>

      <title>Hom-orthogonal modules and brick-Brauer-Thrall conjectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For finite dimensional algebras over algebraically closed fields, we study the sets of pairwise Hom-orthogonal modules and obtain new results on some open conjectures on the behaviour of bricks and several related problems, which we generally refer to as brick-Brauer-Thrall (bBT) conjectures. Using some algebraic and geometric tools, and in terms of the notion of Hom-orthogonality, we find necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of infinite families of bricks of the same dimension. This sheds new lights on the bBT conjectures and we prove many of them for some new families of algebras. Our results imply some interesting algebraic and geometric characterizations of brick-finite algebras as conceptual generalizations of local algebras. We also verify the bBT conjectures for any algebra whose Auslander-Reiten quiver has a generalized standard component. On the one hand, our work relates and develops some recent studies of the bBT conjectures which are conducted in several directions. On the other hand, it extends some earlier results of Chindris-Kinser-Weyman, where the algebras with preprojective components were treated.</description>

      <title>Deformation of moduli spaces of meromorphic $G$-connections on $\mathbb{P}^{1}$ via unfolding of irregular singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The unfolding of singular points of linear differential equations is a classical technique to study the properties of irregular singular points from those of regular singular points. In this paper, we propose a general framework for the unfolding of unramified irregular singularities of meromorphic $G$-connections on $\mathbb{P}^{1}$. As one of main results, we give a description for the unfolding of singularities of connections as the deformation of moduli spaces of them, and show that every moduli space of irreducible meromorphic $G$-connections with unramified irregular singularities on $\mathbb{P}^{1}$ has a deformation to a moduli space of irreducible Fuchsian $G$-connections on $\mathbb{P}^{1}$. Furthermore, we can consider the unfolding of additive Delinge-Simpson problems, namely, the unfolding of irregular singularities generates a family of additive Deligne-Simpson problems. Then as an application of our main result, we show that a Deligne-Simpson problem for $G$-connections with unramified irregular singularities has a solution if and only if every other unfolded Deligne-Simpson problem simultaneously has a solution. Also we give a combinatorial and diagrammatic description of the unfolding of irregular singularities via spectral types and unfolding diagrams, and then consider a conjecture proposed by Oshima which asks the existence of irreducible $G$-connections realizing the given spectral types and their unfolding. Our main result gives an affirmative answer of this conjecture.</description>

      <title>Full runner removal theorem for Ariki-Koike algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.08156v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the representation theory of the Ariki-Koike algebra, a $q$-deformation of the group algebra of the complex reflection group $C_r \wr S_n$. We define the addition of a runner full of beads for the abacus display of a multipartition and investigate some combinatorial properties of this operation. We focus our attention on the $q$-decomposition numbers, i.e. the polynomials arising from the Fock space representation of the quantum group $U_q(\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}}_e)$. Using Fayers' LLT-type algorithm for Ariki-Koike algebras, we relate $q$-decomposition numbers for different values of $e$ for the class of $e$-multiregular multipartitions, by adding a full runner of beads to each component of the abacus displays for the labelling multipartitions.</description>

      <title>Simple tilts of length hearts and simple-minded mutation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.02947v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We characterise when a simple Happel-Reiten-Smalo tilt of a length heart is again a length heart in terms of approximation theory and the existence of a stability condition with a phase gap. We apply simple-minded reduction to provide a sufficient condition for infinite iterability of simple-minded mutation/simple tilting. We use simple-minded mutation pairs to provide a common framework to show that mutation of simple-minded collections (resp. $w$-simple-minded systems, for $w \geq 1$) gives simple-minded collections (resp. $w$-simple-minded systems) under mild conditions, in the process providing a unified proof of results of A. Dugas and P. Jorgensen. Finally, we show that under mild conditions, mutation of simple-minded collections is compatible with mutation of $w$-simple-minded systems via a singularity category construction due to H. Jin.</description>

      <title>$G$-complete reducibility and saturation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16927v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $H \subseteq G$ be connected reductive linear algebraic groups defined over an algebraically closed field of characteristic $p&gt; 0$. In our first main theorem we show that if a closed subgroup $K$ of $H$ is $H$-completely reducible, then it is also $G$-completely reducible in the sense of Serre, under some restrictions on $p$, generalising the known case for $G = GL(V)$. Our proof uses R.W. Richardson's notion of reductive pairs to reduce to the $GL(V)$ case. We study Serre's notion of saturation and prove that saturation behaves well with respect to products and regular subgroups. Our second main theorem shows that if $K$ is $H$-completely reducible, then the saturation of $K$ in $G$ is completely reducible in the saturation of $H$ in $G$ (which is again a connected reductive subgroup of $G$), under suitable restrictions on $p$, again generalising the known instance for $G = GL(V)$. We also study saturation of finite subgroups of Lie type in $G$. We show that saturation is compatible with standard Frobenius endomorphisms, and we use this to generalise a result due to Nori from 1987 in case $G = GL(V)$.</description>

      <title>Decompositions of hyperbolic Kac-Moody algebras with respect to imaginary root groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17737v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel way to define imaginary root subgroups associated with (timelike) imaginary roots of hyperbolic Kac-Moody algebras. Using in an essential way the theory of unitary irreducible representation of covers of the group SO(2,1), these imaginary root subgroups act on the complex Kac-Moody algebra viewed as a Hilbert space. We illustrate our new view on Kac-Moody groups by considering the example of a rank-two hyperbolic algebra that is related to the Fibonacci numbers. We also point out some open issues and new avenues for further research, and briefly discuss the potential relevance of the present results for physics and current attempts at unification.</description>

Abstract: The aim of this paper is to define and study the constructions of alternating and symmetric (super)powers of metric generalized Jordan (super)pairs. These constructions are obtained by transference via the Faulkner construction. The construction of tensor (super)products for metric generalized Jordan (super)pairs is revisited. We assume that the base field $\mathbb{F}$ has characteristic different from $2$.</description>

      <title>Quantum Algebra of Chern-Simons Matrix Model and Large $N$ Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.14046v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the algebra of quantum observables of the Chern-Simons matrix model which was originally proposed by Susskind and Polychronakos to describe electrons in fractional quantum Hall effects. We establish the commutation relations for its generators and study the large $N$ limit of its representation. We show that the large $N$ limit algebra is isomorphic to the uniform in $N$ algebra studied by Costello, which is isomorphic to the deformed double current algebra studied by Guay. Under appropriate scaling limit, we show that the large $N$ limit algebra degenerates to a Lie algebra which admits a surjective map to the affine Lie algebra of $\mathfrak{u}(p)$. This leads to a complete proof of the large $N$ emergence of the $\mathfrak{u}(p)$ current algebra as proposed by Dorey, Tong and Turner. This also suggests a rigorous derivation of edge excitation of a fractional quantum Hall droplet.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06970v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This research comprehensively describes the basic theory of transversally Heisenberg elliptic operators, and investigates the index theory of Heisenberg elliptic and transversally Heisenberg elliptic operators from the perspective of $KK$-theory, applying Kasparov's methodology. Moreover, the analysis methodically examines specific conditions, with a focus on the Fourier transform of the nilpotent group $C^{\ast}$-algebra. We demonstrate enhanced methods for analyzing the hypoellipticity of operators, presenting a robust framework for defining and understanding transversal Heisenberg ellipticity in a $KK$-theoretic context. This work provides a solid foundation for future research into the properties of differential operators in complicated manifolds.</description>

      <title>On diagonal digraphs, Koszul algebras and triangulations of homology spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04748v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The article is devoted to the study of diagonal digraphs, i.e. digraphs whose magnitude homology is concentrated on the diagonal. For a digraph $G$ and $\ell\geq 2,$ we describe a condition, denoted by $(\mathcal{V}_\ell)$, equivalent to vanishing of the second magnitude homology group ${\rm MH}_{2,k}(G,\mathbb{Z})$ for all $k&gt;\ell.$ In particular, diagonal digraphs satisfy $(\mathcal{V}_2).$ As a corollary we obtain that the 2-dimensional CW-complex obtained from a diagonal undirected graph by attaching 2-cells to all squares and triangles of the graph is simply connected. We also give an interpretation of diagonality in terms of Koszul algebras: a digraph $G$ is diagonal if and only if the distance algebra $\sigma G$ is Koszul for any ground field; and if and only if $G$ satisfies $(\mathcal{V}_2)$ and the path cochain algebra $\Omega^\bullet(G)$ is Koszul for any ground field. To obtain a source of examples of digraphs, we study the extended Hasse diagram $\hat G_K$ of a pure simplicial complex $K$. For a triangulation $K$ of a topological manifold $M,$ we express the non-diagonal part of the magnitude homology of $\hat G_K$ via the homology of $M$. As a corollary we obtain that, if $K$ is a triangulation of a closed manifold $M$, then $\hat G_K$ is diagonal if and only if $M$ is a homology sphere.</description>

Abstract: If $H$ is a Hall subgroup of a finite group $G$, it was proven in 1989 using the classification of finite simple groups that all the irreducible complex characters of $H$ extend to $G$ if and only if there is $N\trianglelefteq G$ such that $HN=G$ and $H\cap N=1$. In this note we offer a modular version of this result under more general hypothesis.</description>

      <title>Singular loci of Schubert varieties and the Lookup Conjecture in type $\tilde A_{2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02338v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe the loci of non-rationally smooth (nrs) points and of singular points for any non-spiral Schubert variety of $\tilde{A}_2$ in terms of the geometry of the (affine) Weyl group action on the plane $\mathbb{R}^2$. Together with the results of Graham and Li for spiral elements, this allows us to explicitly identify the maximal singular and nrs points in any Schubert variety of type $\tilde{A}_2$. Comparable results are not known for any other infinite-dimensional Kac-Moody flag variety (except for type $\tilde{A}_1$, where every Schubert variety is rationally smooth). As a consequence, we deduce that if $x$ is a point in a non-spiral Schubert variety $X_w$, then $x$ is nrs in $X_w$ if and only if there are more than $\dim X_w$ curves in $X_w$ through $x$ which are stable under the action of a maximal torus, as is true for Schubert varieties in (finite) type $A$. Combined with the work of Graham and Li for spiral Schubert varieties, this implies the Lookup Conjecture for $\tilde{A}_2$.</description>
