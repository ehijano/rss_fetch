      <title>Multivariate Functional Data Analysis Uncovers Behavioral Fingerprints in Invertebrate Locomotor Response to Micropollutants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The need for effective biomonitoring in wastewater has become clear due to the impracticality of continuously tracking all chemicals and emerging contaminants in the aquatic exposome. Effect-based biomonitoring provides a cost-effective solution. The ToxMate device, which uses videotracking of locomotor behavior in aquatic invertebrates, has proven efficient for real-time detection of micropollutant surges in effluents. To extend the approach, this proof-of-concept study evaluates the potential to formalize behavioral fingerprints from real-time videotracking data to characterize qualitative variations in effluent contamination. We present the first application of a functional data analysis (FDA) framework in ecotoxicology. Data were obtained by simultaneously tracking three sentinel organisms from distinct taxa (a crustacean, an annelid, and a gastropod) during pulse exposures to four chemicals in the laboratory (two metals, one pharmaceutical, and one insecticide). Individual and multispecies responses were analy-zed to determine whether combining species enhances the resolution of contamination fingerprints through multidimensional FDA. Applying the same data-driven approach to field data from a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) revealed four recurring types of micropollution events. This proof of concept demonstrates the potential of behavioral fingerprints to improve wastewater monitoring and reduce pollutant transfer to the environment.</description>

      <title>Automated Histopathologic Assessment of Hirschsprung Disease Using a Multi-Stage Vision Transformer Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hirschsprung Disease is characterized by the absence of ganglion cells in the myenteric plexus. Therefore, their correct identification is crucial for diagnosing Hirschsprung disease. We introduce a three-stage segmentation framework based on a Vision Transformer (ViT-B/16) that mimics the pathologist's diagnostic approach. The framework sequentially segments the muscularis propria, delineates the myenteric plexus, and identifies ganglion cells within anatomically valid regions. 30 whole-slide images of colon tissue were used, each containing expert manual annotations of muscularis, plexus, and ganglion cells at varying levels of certainty. A 5-fold cross-validation scheme was applied to each stage, along with resolution-specific tiling strategies and tailored postprocessing to ensure anatomical consistency. The proposed method achieved a Dice coefficient of 89.9% and a Plexus Inclusion Rate of 100% for muscularis segmentation. Plexus segmentation reached a recall of 94.8%, a precision of 84.2% and a Ganglia Inclusion Rate of 99.7%. For high-certainty ganglion cells, the model achieved 62.1% precision and 89.1% recall, while joint certainty scores yielded 67.0% precision. These results indicate that ViT-based models are effective at leveraging global tissue context and capturing cellular morphology at small scales, even within complex histological tissue structures. This multi-stage methodology has great potential to support digital pathology workflows by reducing inter-observer variability and assisting in the evaluation of Hirschsprung disease. The clinical impact will be evaluated in future work with larger multi-center datasets and additional expert annotations.</description>

      <title>A statistical framework for comparing epidemic forests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inferring who infected whom in an outbreak is essential for characterising transmission dynamics and guiding public health interventions. However, this task is challenging due to limited surveillance data and the complexity of immunological and social interactions. Instead of a single definitive transmission tree, epidemiologists often consider multiple plausible trees forming \textit{epidemic forests}. Various inference methods and assumptions can yield different epidemic forests, yet no formal test exists to assess whether these differences are statistically significant. We propose such a framework using a chi-square test and permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA). We assessed each method's ability to distinguish simulated epidemic forests generated under different offspring distributions. While both methods achieved perfect specificity for forests with 100+ trees, PERMANOVA consistently outperformed the chi-square test in sensitivity across all epidemic and forest sizes. Implemented in the R package \textit{mixtree}, we provide the first statistical framework to robustly compare epidemic forests.</description>

      <title>Stabilizing Fractional Dynamical Networks Suppresses Epileptic Seizures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medically uncontrolled epileptic seizures affect nearly 15 million people worldwide, resulting in enormous economic and psychological burdens. Treatment of medically refractory epilepsy is essential for patients to achieve remission, improve psychological functioning, and enhance social and vocational outcomes. Here, we show a state-of-the-art method that stabilizes fractional dynamical networks modeled from intracranial EEG data, effectively suppressing seizure activity in 34 out of 35 total spontaneous episodes from patients at the University of Pennsylvania and the Mayo Clinic. We perform a multi-scale analysis and show that the fractal behavior and stability properties of these data distinguish between four epileptic states: interictal, pre-ictal, ictal, and post-ictal. Furthermore, the simulated controlled signals exhibit substantial amplitude reduction ($49\%$ average). These findings highlight the potential of fractional dynamics to characterize seizure-related brain states and demonstrate its capability to suppress epileptic activity.</description>

      <title>Automated Protein Motif Localization using Concept Activation Vectors in Protein Language Model Embedding Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an automated approach for identifying and annotating motifs and domains in protein sequences, using pretrained Protein Language Models (PLMs) and Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs), adapted from interpretability research in computer vision. We treat motifs as conceptual entities and represent them through learned CAVs in PLM embedding space by training simple linear classifiers to distinguish motif-containing from non-motif sequences. To identify motif occurrences, we extract embeddings for overlapping sequence windows and compute their inner products with motif CAVs. This scoring mechanism quantifies how strongly each sequence region expresses the motif concept and naturally detects multiple instances of the same motif within the same protein. Using a dataset of sixty-nine well-characterized motifs with curated positive and negative examples, our method achieves over 85\% F1 Score for segments strongly expressing the concept and accurately localizes motif positions across diverse protein families. As each motif is encoded by a single vector, motif detection requires only the pretrained PLM and a lightweight dictionary of CAVs, offering a scalable, interpretable, and computationally efficient framework for automated sequence annotation.</description>

      <title>A software-based focus system for wide-field optical microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long-term time-lapse imaging of biological samples requires correcting for focal drift, which would otherwise gradually push the sample out of focus. We present a software-based method that eliminates this time-dependent blur using only a motorized Z-drive, with no additional hardware. The method relies on imaging marks made on the side of the coverslip opposite to the sample. We provide a Beanshell script implementation, evaluate its performance across multiple objectives, and benchmark it against a hardware autofocus system, finding comparable results. Finally, we demonstrate its effectiveness in live imaging of growing bacterial colonies.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Models at the Drug Discovery Frontier: A Review on Generating Small Molecules versus Therapeutic Peptides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00209v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a leading framework in generative modeling, poised to transform the traditionally slow and costly process of drug discovery. This review provides a systematic comparison of their application in designing two principal therapeutic modalities: small molecules and therapeutic peptides. We dissect how the unified framework of iterative denoising is adapted to the distinct molecular representations, chemical spaces, and design objectives of each modality. For small molecules, these models excel at structure-based design, generating novel, pocket-fitting ligands with desired physicochemical properties, yet face the critical hurdle of ensuring chemical synthesizability. Conversely, for therapeutic peptides, the focus shifts to generating functional sequences and designing de novo structures, where the primary challenges are achieving biological stability against proteolysis, ensuring proper folding, and minimizing immunogenicity. Despite these distinct challenges, both domains face shared hurdles: the scarcity of high-quality experimental data, the reliance on inaccurate scoring functions for validation, and the crucial need for experimental validation. We conclude that the full potential of diffusion models will be unlocked by bridging these modality-specific gaps and integrating them into automated, closed-loop Design-Build-Test-Learn (DBTL) platforms, thereby shifting the paradigm from mere chemical exploration to the on-demand engineering of novel~therapeutics.</description>
