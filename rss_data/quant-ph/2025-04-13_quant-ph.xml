      <title>Unifying adiabatic state-transfer protocols with $(\alpha, \beta)$-hypergeometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adiabatic optimal control schemes are essential for advancing the practical implementation of quantum technologies. However, the vast array of possible adiabatic protocols, combined with their dependence on the particular quantum system and function-specific parameter ranges, complicates the task of discerning their respective strengths and limitations in arbitrary operations. In this work, we provide a unifying framework, called $(\alpha,\beta)$-hypergeometries, that allows for flexible, noise-resistant, and easy-to-use implementation of enforced adiabatic dynamics for any multi-level quantum system. Moreover, this framework provides a comprehensive mapping of all adiabatic protocols through a universal cost function and offers an exact analytical characterization of the adiabatic dynamics. In particular, we derive precise expressions for infidelity resonances and establish performance guarantees in the adiabatic limit for any choice of $(\alpha,\beta)$. We also discuss in detail the experimental feasibility of the resulting pulse shapes through analytical and numerical methods. Finally, we test our method for the optimal control of coherent information transfer through spin shuttling in silicon quantum dots with small valley splittings.</description>

      <title>Higher order tensor factorizations for block encoding vibrational and vibronic Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fault tolerant quantum simulation via the phase estimation algorithm and qubitization has a T-gate count that scales proportionally to the 1-norm of the Hamiltonian, the cost of block encoding the Hamiltonian, and inversely proportionally to the desired accuracy. Tensor factorization methods have been successfully used to reduce T-gate counts in the ground state electronic structure problem. Here we introduce the use of tensor factorization methods to reduce the T-gate count of quantum phase estimation. In particular, we show how Canonical Polyadic and Tucker decompositions of the tensors representing the vibrational and vibronic Hamiltonians can be utilized to rewrite the Hamiltonian in terms of linear combination of bosonic position operators representing nuclear vibrations. We demonstrate the use of these factorization methods on the water and monodeutered methane molecules.</description>

      <title>Testing bath correlation functions for open quantum dynamics simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate simulations of thermalization in open quantum systems require a reliable representation of the bath correlation function (BCF). Numerical approaches, such as the hierarchical equations of motion and the pseudomode method, inherently approximate the BCF using a finite set of functions, which can impact simulation accuracy. In this work, we propose a practical and rigorous testing framework to assess the validity of approximate BCFs in open quantum dynamics simulations. Our approach employs a harmonic oscillator system, where the dynamics can be benchmarked against known exact solutions. To enable practical testing, we make two key methodological advancements. First, we develop numerical techniques to evaluate these exact solutions efficiently across a wide range of BCFs for broad applicability. Second, we introduce a moment-based state representation that significantly simplifies computations by exploiting the Gaussian nature of the system. Application to a two-spin system demonstrates that our testing procedure yields reliable error estimates for thermalization simulations. Using this methodology, we assess the performance of recently proposed BCF construction methods, highlighting both their strengths and a notable challenge posed by sub-Ohmic spectral densities at finite temperatures.</description>

      <title>Semicontinuity bounds for the von Neumann entropy and partial majorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider families of tight upper bounds on the difference $S(\rho)-S(\sigma)$ with the rank/energy constraint imposed on the state $\rho$ which are valid provided that the state $\rho$ partially majorizes the state $\sigma$ and is close to the state $\sigma$ w.r.t. the trace norm.
  The upper bounds within these families depend on the parameter $m$ of partial majorization. The upper bounds corresponding to $m=1$ coincide with the optimal semicontinuity bounds for the von Neumann entropy with the rank/energy constraint obtained in [Lett.Math.Phys.,113,121,35] and [arXiv:2410.02686].
  We also consider classical versions of the above results formulated in terms of probability distributions and the Shannon entropy.</description>

      <title>An easily computable measure of Gaussian quantum imaginarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The resource-theoretic frameworks for quantum imaginarity have been developed in recent years. Within these frameworks, many imaginarity measures for finite-dimensional systems have been proposed. However, for imaginarity of Gaussian states in continuous-variable (CV) systems, there are only two known Gaussian imaginarity measures, which exhibit prohibitive computational complexity when applied to multi-mode Gaussian states. In this paper, we propose a computable Gaussian imaginarity measure $\mathcal I^{G_n}$ for $n$-mode Gaussian systems. The value of $\mathcal I^{G_n}$ is simply formulated by the displacement vectors and covariance matrices of Gaussian states. A comparative analysis of $\mathcal{I}^{G_n}$ with existing two Gaussian imaginarity measures indicates that $\mathcal{I}^{G_n}$ can be used to detect imaginarity in any $n$-mode Gaussian states more efficiently. As an application, we study the dynamics behaviour of $(1+1)$-mode Gaussian states in Gaussian Markovian noise environments for two-mode CV system by utilizing ${\mathcal I}^{G_2}$. Moreover, we prove that, ${\mathcal I}^{G_n}$ can induce a quantification of any $m$-multipartite multi-mode CV systems which satisfies all requirements for measures of multipartite multi-mode Gaussian correlations, which unveils that, $n$-mode Gaussian imaginarity can also be regarded as a kind of multipatite multi-mode Gaussian correlation and is a multipartite Gaussian quantum resource.</description>

      <title>Optimizing QUBO generation parameters for NP problems and their impact on D-Wave convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: NP problems are closely related to practical optimization challenges but often suffer from exponential increases in computation time as problem sizes grow. Quantum annealing offers a promising approach to solve NP problems faster than classical methods, requiring cost functions and constraints to be expressed in QUBO format. However, setting QUBO coefficients often relies on empirical methods, particularly in scheduling problems where large values and intuition are needed. In this study, we analyzed QUBO formulas for three coloring-related problems: the graph coloring problem, the clique vertex cover problem, and the integer-length job scheduling problem. We identified the need for independent parameters for complex problems and derived relationships between formula characteristics and optimal QUBO parameter values. Using D-Wave quantum annealing, we validated these parameters and visualized the effects of parameter changes on states and eigenvalues in small spin problems. Additionally, we demonstrated how independent Ising coefficients enhance convergence to correct states based on optimal parameter adjustments.</description>

      <title>Quantum-assured magnetic navigation achieves positioning accuracy better than a strategic-grade INS in airborne and ground-based field trials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern navigation systems rely critically on GNSS, which in many cases is unavailable or unreliable (e.g. due to jamming or spoofing). For this reason there is great interest in augmenting backup navigation systems such as inertial navigation systems (INS) with additional modalities that reduce positioning error in the absence of reliable GNSS. Magnetic-anomaly navigation is one such approach, providing passive, non-jammable navigation through periodic position fixes obtained by comparing local measurements of Earth's crustal field against known anomaly maps. Despite its potential, existing MagNav efforts have been limited by magnetometer performance and platform noise; solutions addressing these problems have proven either too brittle or impractical for realistic deployment. Here we demonstrate a quantum-assured MagNav solution based on proprietary quantum magnetometers with by a novel denoising and map-matching algorithms. The system fits on fixed-wing drones or in the avionics bay of a commercial airliner. We present trials at altitudes up to 19000 feet, testing onboard and outboard quantum magnetometers comparing against a strategic-grade INS. Our MagNav solution achieves superior performance, delivering up to 46x better positioning error than the velocity-aided INS; the best final positioning accuracy we achieve is 22m or 0.006% of the flight distance. Airborne trials consistently achieve at least 11x advantage over the INS across varying conditions, altitudes, and flight patterns. The system learns model parameters online without special vehicle maneuvers providing robustness to various configuration changes (e.g. changing payload or latitude). Our trials also include the first successful MagNav performed in a ground vehicle using publicly-available anomaly maps, delivering bounded positioning error 7x lower than the INS, with both systems in strapdown configuration.</description>

      <title>Efficient measurement of neutral-atom qubits with matched filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computers require high-fidelity measurement of many qubits to achieve a quantum advantage. Traditional approaches suffer from readout crosstalk for a neutral-atom quantum processor with a tightly spaced array. Although classical machine learning algorithms based on convolutional neural networks can improve fidelity, they are computationally expensive, making it difficult to scale them to large qubit counts. We present two simpler and scalable machine learning algorithms that realize matched filters for the readout problem. One is a local model that focuses on a single qubit, and the other uses information from neighboring qubits in the array to prevent crosstalk among the qubits. We demonstrate error reductions of up to 32% and 43% for the site and array models, respectively, compared to a conventional Gaussian threshold approach. Additionally, our array model uses two orders of magnitude fewer trainable parameters and four orders of magnitude fewer multiplications and nonlinear function evaluations than a recent convolutional neural network approach, with only a minor (3.5%) increase in error across different readout times. Another strength of our approach is its physical interpretability: the learned filter can be visualized to provide insights into experimental imperfections. We also show that a convolutional neural network model for improved can be pruned to have 70x and 4000x fewer parameters, respectively, while maintaining similar errors. Our work shows that simple machine learning approaches can achieve high-fidelity qubit measurements while remaining scalable to systems with larger qubit counts.</description>

      <title>CDJ-Pontryagin Optimal Control for General Continuously Monitored Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Chantasri-Dressel-Jordan (CDJ) stochastic path integral formalism (Chantasri et al. 2013 and 2015) characterizes the statistics of the readouts and the most likely conditional evolution of a continuously monitored quantum system. In our work, we generalize the CDJ formalism to arbitrary continuously monitored systems by introducing a costate operator. We then prescribe a generalized Pontryagin's maximum principle for quantum systems undergoing arbitrary evolution and find conditions on optimal control protocols. We show that the CDJ formalism's most likely path can be cast as a quantum Pontryagin's maximum principle, where the cost function is the readout probabilities along a quantum trajectory. This insight allows us to derive a general optimal control equations for arbitrary control parameters to achieve a given task. We apply our results to a monitored oscillator in the presence of a parametric quadratic potential and variable quadrature measurements. We find the optimal potential strength and quadrature angle for fixed-end point problems. The optimal parametric potential is analytically shown to have a "bang-bang" form. We apply our protocol to three quantum oscillator examples relevant to Bosonic quantum computing. The first example considers a binomial codeword preparation from an error word, the second looks into cooling to the ground state from an even cat state, and the third investigates a cat state to cat state evolution. We compare the statistics of the fidelities of the final state with respect to the target state for trajectories generated under the optimal control with those generated under a sample control. Compared to the latter case, we see a 40-196% increase in the number of trajectories reaching more than 95% fidelities under the optimal control. Our work provides a systematic prescription for finding quantum optimal control for continuously monitored systems.</description>

      <title>Downloading many-qubit entanglement from continuous-variable cluster states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many-body entanglement is an essential resource for many quantum technologies, but its scalable generation has been challenging on qubit platforms. However, the generation of continuous-variable (CV) entanglement can be extremely efficient, but its utility is rather limited. In this work, we propose a scheme to combine the best of both qubit and CV approaches: a systematic method to download useful many-qubit entanglement from the efficiently generated CV cluster states. Our protocol is based on one-bit teleportation of the qubit correlation encoded in the displaced Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill basis. To characterize the practical performance of our scheme, we develop an equivalent circuit to map dominant CV errors to single-qubit preparation errors. Particularly, we relate finite squeezing error to qubit erasure, and show that only 5.4 dB squeezing is sufficient to implement robust qubit memory or quantum computation (QC), and 11.9 dB for fault-tolerant QC. Our protocol can be implemented with the operations that are common in many bosonic platforms.</description>

      <title>Scalable universal quantum gates between nitrogen-vacancy centers in levitated nanodiamonds arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in nanodiamond offer a promising platform for quantum information processing due to their room-temperature spin coherence and optical addressability. However, scalable quantum processors remain limited by the challenge of achieving strong, controllable interactions between distant NV spins. Here, we propose a scalable architecture utilizing optically levitated nanodiamond arrays, where torsional vibrations mediate the coherent coupling between the embedded NV centers. By optimizing the shape of ellipsoidal nanoparticles, we achieve a light-induced coupling strength exceeding 119 kHz between torsional modes of the distant levitated nanodiamonds, which are two orders of magnitude larger than the typical decoherence rates in this system. This strong interaction, combined with magnetic field-enabled spin-torsion coupling, establishes an effective interaction between the spatially separated NV centers in the distant nanodiamonds. Numerical simulations confirm that dynamic decoupling can suppress both thermal noise and spin dephasing, enabling two-qubit gates with fidelity exceeding 99\%. This work provides a foundation for reconfigurable quantum hybrid systems, with potential applications in rotational sensing and programmable quantum processing.</description>

      <title>Rational Extension of Quantum Anisotropic Oscillator Potentials with Linear and/or Quadratic Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of the rational extension of the quantum anisotropic harmonic oscillator (QAHO) potentials with linear and/or quadratic perturbations. For the one-dimensional harmonic oscillator plus imaginary linear perturbation ($i\lambda x$), we show that the rational extension is possible not only for the even but also for the odd co-dimensions $m$. In two-dimensional case, we construct the rational extensions for QAHO potentials with quadratic ($\lambda \, xy$) perturbation both when $\lambda$ is real or imaginary and obtain their solutions. Finally, we extend the discussion to the three-dimensional QAHO with linear and quadratic perturbations and obtain the corresponding rationally extended potentials. For all these cases, we obtain the conditions under which the spectrum remains real and also when there is degeneracy in the system.</description>

      <title>Hybrid quantum optimization in the context of minimizing traffic congestion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traffic optimization on roads is a highly complex problem, with one important aspect being minimization of traffic congestion. By mapping to an Ising formulation of the traffic congestion problem, we benchmark solutions obtained from the Quantum Approximate optimization Algorithm (QAOA), a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm. In principle, as the number of QAOA layers approaches infinity, the solutions should reach optimality. On the other hand, short-depth QAOA circuits are known to have limited performance. We show that using tailored initialization techniques encourages the convergence to the desired solution state at lower circuit depths with two and three QAOA layers, thus highlighting the importance of adapting quantum algorithms in the noisy intermediate scale (NISQ) quantum computing era. Moreover, for NISQ devices with limited qubit connectivity and circuit depth, we introduce a heuristic noise-resilient variant of QAOA predicated on the elimination of long-range 2-qubit interactions in the QAOA layers whilst the cost function is unaltered. Our results show that this QAOA variant is surprisingly effective, outperforming QAOA on a physical IBM Quantum computer device.</description>

Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) provides information-theoretic security guaranteed by the laws of quantum mechanics, making it resistant to future computational threats, including quantum computers. While QKD technology shows great promise, its widespread adoption depends heavily on its usability and viability, with key rate performance and cost-effectiveness serving as critical evaluation metrics. In this work, we report an integrated silicon photonics-based QKD system that achieves a secret key rate of 1.213 Gbit per second over a metropolitan distance of 10 km with polarization multiplexing. Our contributions are twofold. First, in the quantum optical layer, we developed an on-chip quantum transmitter and an efficient quantum receiver that operate at 40 Gbaud/s at room temperature. Second, we designed a discrete-modulated continuous variable (DM CV) QKD implementation with efficient information reconciliation based on polar codes, enabling potentially high-throughput real-time data processing. Our results demonstrate a practical QKD solution that combines high performance with cost efficiency. We anticipate this research will pave the way for large-scale quantum secure networks.</description>

      <title>DeQompile: quantum circuit decompilation using genetic programming for explainable quantum architecture search</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Demonstrating quantum advantage using conventional quantum algorithms remains challenging on current noisy gate-based quantum computers. Automated quantum circuit synthesis via quantum machine learning has emerged as a promising solution, employing trainable parametric quantum circuits to alleviate this. The circuit ansatz in these solutions is often designed through reinforcement learning-based quantum architecture search when the domain knowledge of the problem and hardware are not effective. However, the interpretability of these synthesized circuits remains a significant bottleneck, limiting their scalability and applicability across diverse problem domains.
  This work addresses the challenge of explainability in quantum architecture search (QAS) by introducing a novel genetic programming-based decompiler framework for reverse-engineering high-level quantum algorithms from low-level circuit representations. The proposed approach, implemented in the open-source tool DeQompile, employs program synthesis techniques, including symbolic regression and abstract syntax tree manipulation, to distill interpretable Qiskit algorithms from quantum assembly language. Validation of benchmark algorithms demonstrates the efficacy of our tool. By integrating the decompiler with online learning frameworks, this research potentiates explainable QAS by fostering the development of generalizable and provable quantum algorithms.</description>

      <title>Towards a Digital Twin of Noisy Quantum Computers: Calibration-Driven Emulation of Transmon Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a parametric error model to construct a digital twin of a superconducting transmon qubit device. The model parameters are extracted from hardware calibration data and supplementary benchmarking circuits, providing a dynamic, system-specific representation of noise and gate imperfections. Given the strong dependence of qubit performance on calibration procedures, our approach captures real-time device fluctuations. By incorporating predominant noise sources derived from underlying physical processes, we enhance the emulation's accuracy while reducing the data required for model fitting. Finally, we validate our model by comparing its predictions with experimental results from a 5-qubit QPU, achieving a mean total variation distance of 0.15 between the shot distributions. This digital twin can be leveraged for predictive performance analysis, error mitigation strategies, and the optimization of quantum protocols, contributing to more reliable quantum computations.</description>

      <title>Scalable Conflict-free Decision Making with Photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum optics utilizes the unique properties of light for computation or communication. In this work, we explore its ability to solve certain reinforcement learning tasks, with a particular view towards the scalability of the approach. Our method utilizes the Orbital Angular Momentum (OAM) of photons to solve the Competitive Multi-Armed Bandit (CMAB) problem while maximizing rewards. In particular, we encode each player's preferences in the OAM amplitudes, while the phases are optimized to avoid conflicts. We find that the proposed system is capable of solving the CMAB problem with a scalable number of options and demonstrates improved performance over existing techniques. As an example of a system with simple rules for solving complex tasks, our OAM-based method adds to the repertoire of functionality of quantum optics.</description>

      <title>Manifestation of critical effects in environmental parameter estimation using a quantum sensor under dynamical control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum probes offer a powerful platform for exploring environmental dynamics, particularly through their sensitivity to decoherence processes. In this work, we investigate the emergence of critical behavior in the estimation of the environmental memory time $\tau_c$, modeled as an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process characterized by a Lorentzian spectral density. Using dynamically controlled qubit-based sensors -- realized experimentally via solid-state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and supported by numerical simulations -- we implement tailored filter functions to interrogate the environmental noise spectrum and extract $\tau_c$ from its spectral width. Our results reveal a sharp transition in estimation performance between short-memory (SM) and long-memory (LM) regimes, reflected in a non-monotonic estimation error that resembles a phase transition. This behavior is accompanied by an avoided-crossing-like structure in the estimated parameter space, indicative of two competing solutions near the critical point. These features underscore the interplay between control, decoherence, and inference in open quantum systems. Beyond their fundamental significance, these critical phenomena offer a practical diagnostic tool for identifying dynamical regimes and optimizing quantum sensing protocols. By exploiting this criticality, our findings pave the way for adaptive control strategies aimed at enhancing precision in quantum parameter estimation -- particularly in complex or structured environments such as spin networks, diffusive media, and quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Generalization Bounds in Hybrid Quantum-Classical Machine Learning Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid classical-quantum models aim to harness the strengths of both quantum computing and classical machine learning, but their practical potential remains poorly understood. In this work, we develop a unified mathematical framework for analyzing generalization in hybrid models, offering insight into how these systems learn from data. We establish a novel generalization bound of the form $O\big( \sqrt{\frac{T\log{T}}{N}} + \frac{\alpha}{\sqrt{N}}\big)$ for $N$ training data points, $T$ trainable quantum gates, and bounded fully-connected layers $||F|| \leq \alpha$. This bound decomposes cleanly into quantum and classical contributions, extending prior work on both components and clarifying their interaction. We apply our results to the quantum-classical convolutional neural network (QCCNN), an architecture that integrates quantum convolutional layers with classical processing. Alongside the bound, we highlight conceptual limitations of applying classical statistical learning theory in the hybrid setting and suggest promising directions for future theoretical work.</description>

      <title>Quality Diversity for Variational Quantum Circuit Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimizing the architecture of variational quantum circuits (VQCs) is crucial for advancing quantum computing (QC) towards practical applications. Current methods range from static ansatz design and evolutionary methods to machine learned VQC optimization, but are either slow, sample inefficient or require infeasible circuit depth to realize advantages. Quality diversity (QD) search methods combine diversity-driven optimization with user-specified features that offer insight into the optimization quality of circuit solution candidates. However, the choice of quality measures and the representational modeling of the circuits to allow for optimization with the current state-of-the-art QD methods like covariance matrix adaptation (CMA), is currently still an open problem. In this work we introduce a directly matrix-based circuit engineering, that can be readily optimized with QD-CMA methods and evaluate heuristic circuit quality properties like expressivity and gate-diversity as quality measures. We empirically show superior circuit optimization of our QD optimization w.r.t. speed and solution score against a set of robust benchmark algorithms from the literature on a selection of NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems.</description>

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel device-independent quantum self-testing protocol designed specifically for multipartite quantum communication. By exploiting the quantum rigidity in Bell nonlocality, the protocol enables the certification of genuinely entangled subspaces without reliance on device assumptions. Additionally, we investigate its potential to enhance the security of the Global Positioning System (GPS) against malicious cyberattacks. The study concludes with a comprehensive analysis of the experimental requirements, comparing superconducting and trapped-ion qubit architectures in terms of full-circuit fidelity and total gate time for generating a five-qubit code in the context of the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era.</description>

      <title>The inherent convolution property of quantum neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum neural networks (QNNs) represent a pioneering intersection of quantum computing and deep learning. In this study, we unveil a fundamental convolution property inherent to QNNs, stemming from the natural parallelism of quantum gate operations on quantum states. Notably, QNNs are capable of performing a convolutional layer using a single quantum gate, whereas classical methods require 2^n basic operations. This essential property has been largely overlooked in the design of existing quantum convolutional neural networks (QCNNs), limiting their ability to capture key structural features of classical CNNs, including local connectivity, parameter sharing, and multi-channel, multi-layer architectures. To address these limitations, we propose novel QCNN architectures that explicitly harness the convolutional nature of QNNs. We validate the effectiveness of these architectures through extensive numerical experiments focused on multiclass image classification. Our findings provide deep insights into the realization of convolutional mechanisms within QNNs, marking a substantial advancement in the development of QCNNs and broadening their potential for efficient data processing.</description>

      <title>Spin-state energetics of heme-related models with the variational quantum eigensolver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present numerical calculations of the energetic separation between different spin states (singlet, triplet and quintet) for a simplified model of a deoxy-myoglobin protein using the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithm. The goal is to gain insight into the workflow and challenges of VQE simulations for transition metal complexes, with emphasis on methodology over hardware-specific implementation. The numerical calculations are performed using an in-house statevector simulator with single- and multi-reference trial wavefunctions based on the k-unitary pair coupled-cluster generalized singles and doubles or k-UpCCGSD ansatz. The spin-state energetics for active spaces of increasing size up to 10 spatial orbitals (20 spin orbitals or qubits) are computed with VQE and were found to agree with the classical complete active self-consistent field or CASSCF method to within 1-4 kcal/mol. We evaluate relevant multi-reference diagnostics and show that the spin states computed with VQE possess a sufficient degree of multi-reference character to highlight the presence of strong electron correlation effects. Our numerical simulations show that in the ideal case, the VQE algorithm is capable of reproducing spin-state energetics of strongly correlated systems such as transition metal complexes for both single- and multi-reference trial wavefunctions, asymptotically achieving good agreement with results from classical methods as the number of active orbitals increases.</description>

      <title>Violation of steering inequality for generalized equiangular measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study bipartite quantum steering using a general class of measurement operators known as the generalized equiangular measurement (GEAM). Our approach allows for the construction of steering inequalities that are applicable not only to informationally complete measurements but also to incomplete or lossy scenarios, where the resulting quantum assemblages may be subnormalized. We develop a method to analytically bound the value of steering functionals under local hidden state (LHS) models by employing a generalized inequality for the eigenvalues of positive semidefinite operators, extending classical results such as the Samuelson inequality. This yields universal upper bounds on the LHS value in terms of the parameters defining the frame. Furthermore, we analyze the asymptotic behavior of these bounds in high-dimensional Hilbert spaces and demonstrate the possibility of unbounded quantum violations of steering inequalities. Our formalism encompasses previously known results for mutually unbiased bases (MUBs) and mutually unbiased measurements (MUMs) as special cases, showing that these are particular instances within a unified and more general framework.</description>

      <title>Efficient Two Photon Generation from an Atom in a Cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-photon states are essential for quantum technologies such as metrology, lithography, and communication. One of the main methods of two-photon generation is based on parametric down-conversion, but this suffers from low efficiency and a large footprint. This work is a detailed investigation of an alternative approach: two-photon generation from an atom in a doubly resonant cavity. The system, consisting of an atom interacting with two modes of the cavity, is modelled by the Lindblad Master Equation. An approximate analytical solution is derived, using a novel approximation method, to determine the practically achievable limits on efficiency and brightness. The model also predicts the optimal cavity parameters for achieving these limits. For experimentally feasible parameters, the maximum efficiency turns out to be approximately $0.1\%$, which is about three orders of magnitude greater than that of parametric down-conversion-based methods. The optimal rate and efficiency for two-photon generation are achieved when the outcoupling rate of the cavity mode at the two-photon emission frequency matches the single-photon atom-field coupling strength. Moreover, the outcoupling rate of the cavity mode at the one-photon emission frequency for single photons should be minimized. The cavity field properties are also examined by studying the second-order correlation function at zero time delay and the Fano Factor. The quantum-jump framework, combined with Monte Carlo simulations, is used to characterize the mechanism of two-photon emission and the emission spectra of the cavity. Two-photon emission is demonstrated to be a rapid cascade process of quantum jumps, and the spectrum exhibits distinct peaks that correspond to transitions between the manifolds of the system.</description>

      <title>Nonclassical states of light induced via measurement in a bimodalsystem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate generation of nonclassical photon states via conditional measurement process in a two mode coupled waveguide. Interaction of the fields takes place in a waveguide beamsplitter due to the overlap between normal modes supported therein. A quadratic Hamiltonian of two degrees of freedom describes the hopping interaction. An initial two mode squeezed state undergoes a unitary evolution governed by the interaction Hamiltonian for a specified time. Following this the bipartite state is subjected to a projective measurement that detects $n$-th Fock state in one subsystem. The post-measurement excitation rendered in the residual subsystem depends on the prior time of interaction between the modes as well as the interaction strength. The Wigner quasiprobability distribution of an arbitrary post-selection state is computed. Its nonclassicality is examined via the negativity of the Wigner distribution. The sub-Poissonian nature of the photon statistics is revealed by the Mandel parameter. The dynamically generated squeezing is evidenced in the post-measurement state. In the ultrastrong coupling regime the parity even and odd states display markedly \textit{different} nonclassical properties. The nonclassicality of the post-measurement states obtained here may be \textit{controlled} by varying the interaction strength and the time span of interaction between the modes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a quantum metrological protocol operating in a non-Markovian environment by employing the quantum Brownian motion (QBM) model, in which the system is linearly coupled to a reservoir of harmonic oscillators. Specifically, we use a position-momentum (PM) correlated Gaussian state as a probe to examine how memory effects influence the evolution of the system's covariance matrix in the weak coupling regime under both high- and low-temperature conditions. To confirm the presence of non-Markovian behavior, we apply two well-established non-Markovianity quantifiers. Furthermore, we estimate both the channel's sample temperature and its non-Markovianity parameter. Our results demonstrate that non-Markovianity and PM correlations can jointly be valuable resources to enhance metrological performance.</description>

      <title>Extrapolation method to optimize linear-ramp QAOA parameters: Evaluation of QAOA runtime scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) has been suggested as a promising candidate for the solution of combinatorial optimization problems. Yet, whether - or under what conditions - it may offer an advantage compared to classical algorithms remains to be proven. Using the standard variational form of QAOA requires a high number of circuit parameters that have to be optimized at a sufficiently large depth, which constitutes a bottleneck for achieving a potential scaling advantage. The linear-ramp QAOA (LR-QAOA) has been proposed to address this issue, as it relies on only two parameters which have to be optimized. Based on this, we develop a method to estimate suitable values for those parameters through extrapolation, starting from smaller problem sizes (number of qubits) towards larger problem sizes. We apply this method to several use cases such as portfolio optimization, feature selection and clustering, and compare the quantum runtime scaling with that of classical methods. In the case of portfolio optimization, we demonstrate superior scaling compared to the classical runtime.</description>

      <title>Graph Coloring via Quantum Optimization on a Rydberg-Qudit Atom Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutral atom arrays have emerged as a versatile candidate for the embedding of hard classical optimization problems. Prior work has focused on mapping problems onto finding the maximum independent set of weighted or unweighted unit disk graphs. In this paper we introduce a new approach to solving natively-embedded vertex graph coloring problems by performing coherent annealing with Rydberg-qudit atoms, where different same-parity Rydberg levels represent a distinct label or color. We demonstrate the ability to robustly find optimal graph colorings for chromatic numbers up to the number of distinct Rydberg states used, in our case $k=3$. We analyze the impact of both the long-range potential tails and residual inter-state interactions, proposing encoding strategies that suppress errors in the resulting ground states. We discuss the experimental feasibility of this approach and propose extensions to solve higher chromatic number problems, providing a route towards direct solution of a wide range of real-world integer optimization problems using near-term neutral atom hardware.</description>

      <title>Quantum memory in spontaneous emission processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum memory effects are essential in understanding and controlling open quantum systems, yet distinguishing them from classical memory remains challenging. We introduce a convex geometric framework to analyze quantum memory propagating in non-Markovian processes. We prove that classical memory between two time points is fundamentally bounded and introduce a robustness measure for quantum memory based on convex geometry. This admits an efficient experimental characterization by linear witnesses of quantum memory, bypassing full process tomography. We prove that any memory effects present in the spontaneous emission process of two- and three-level atomic systems are necessarily quantum, suggesting a pervasive role of quantum memory in quantum optics. Giant artificial atoms are discussed as a readily available test platform.</description>

      <title>IF-QAOA: A Penalty-Free Approach to Accelerating Constrained Quantum Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional methods for handling (inequality) constraints in the Quantum Approximate Optimization Ansatz (QAOA) typically rely on penalty terms and slack variables, which increase problem complexity and expand the search space. More sophisticated mixer-based QAOA variants restrict the search within the feasible assignments but often suffer from prohibitive circuit complexity. This paper presents a low-complexity formalism for incorporating inequality constraints into the cost function of QAOA using an oracle-based subroutine that evaluates constraint satisfaction in an additional register, subsequently called Indicator Function QAOA (IF-QAOA). The IF-QAOA cost function consists of a step-function but does not require a penalty term with additional parameters. Applied to the Knapsack problem, we demonstrate the superior performance of IF-QAOA over conventional penalty-based approaches in simulated experiments. Using advanced QAOA simulation techniques with instances consisting of up to 22 items, we find that IF-QAOA achieves significantly higher solution quality and a faster time-to-solution in 82% of our benchmark cases. Analysis of the scaling behavior shows favorable scaling of IF-QAOA compared to penalty-based methods. Also, benchmarked against the recently developed Quantum Tree Generator QAOA for Knapsack Problems, we demonstrate higher solution quality for circuits of similar complexity. Additionally, the paper introduces a method for approximate indicator function when the number of ancillary qubits is limited. With a specialized simulation algorithm based on projective measurements, we empirically demonstrate that a fixed number of ancillary qubits is sufficient to encode general inequality constraints.</description>

      <title>Computational Stochastic Mechanics of a Simple Bound State</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic mechanics is based on the hypothesis that all matter is subject to universal modified Brownian motion. In this report, we calculated probability density distributions using concepts of stochastic mechanics independent of bootstrapping with a known wave function. We calculate a velocity field directly from the potential and total energy and then use the resultant velocity field to do a stochastic Langevin integration over histories to create the probability density distribution for particle position. Using the harmonic oscillator as a minimally sufficient system for our exposition, we explored the effects of spatial and time discretization on solution noise. We explore the effect of energy defect off of the ground state energy on the velocity field, which dictates how a particle interacts with the background of stochastic fluctuations in position, and describes how repulsive drift (negative defect) and constructive oscillation (positive defect) end a stable state as its basin of stability in the velocity field shrinks with increasing energy defect. The results suggest a pathway for future development of stochastic mechanics as a numerical strategy to describe the structure of physical quantum systems for applications in chemistry, materials and information sciences.</description>

      <title>Optimization of optomechanical cooling and entanglement using semi-analytic solutions to the Lindblad master equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We solve the Lindblad master equation for the quantum state of a pumped optomechanical system coupled to a thermal bath. We show that when the microwave pump field frequency is on the red sideband of the cavity resonance, the exact form of the state is a beam-split thermal state, and when it is on the blue sideband, it is a two-mode squeezed thermal state. These solutions allow us to determine the mechanical cooling and the entanglement between the microwave and mechanical modes. We find that we can entangle the modes in a thermal environment by activating the two fields sequentially. In this scheme, after cooling the mechanical mode via the red sideband pump, we determine the optimal blue sideband pump field to achieve the maximum entanglement time and the maximum time below a desired correlation variance threshold as a function of the loss rates and equilibrium temperatures of the two modes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In quantum metrology, entangled states of many-particle systems are investigated to enhance measurement precision of the most precise clocks and field sensors. While single-parameter quantum metrology is well established, many metrological tasks require joint multiparameter estimation, which poses new conceptual challenges that have so far only been explored theoretically. We experimentally demonstrate multiparameter quantum metrology with an array of entangled atomic ensembles. By splitting a spin-squeezed ensemble, we create an atomic sensor array featuring inter-sensor entanglement that can be flexibly configured to enhance measurement precision of multiple parameters jointly. Using an optimal estimation protocol, we achieve significant gains over the standard quantum limit in key multiparameter estimation tasks, thus grounding the concept of quantum enhancement of field sensor arrays and imaging devices.</description>

      <title>Decomposition of Sparse Amplitude Permutation Gates with Application to Preparation of Sparse Clustered Quantum States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we consider a novel heuristic decomposition algorithm for $n$-qubit gates that implement specified amplitude permutations on sparse states with $m$ non-zero amplitudes. These gates can be useful as an algorithmic primitive for higher-order algorithms. We demonstrate this by showing how it can be used as a building block for a novel sparse state preparation algorithm, Cluster Swaps, which is able to significantly reduce CX gate count compared to alternative methods of state preparation considered in this paper when the target states are clustered, i.e. such that there are many pairs of non-zero amplitude basis states whose Hamming distance is 1. Cluster Swaps can be useful for amplitude encoding of sparse data vectors in quantum machine learning applications.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are a machine learning technique capable of producing high-quality synthetic images. In the field of materials science, when a crystallographic dataset includes inadequate or difficult-to-obtain images, synthetic images can be used for image augmentation to mitigate data scarcity and streamline the preparation of datasets for high-throughput analysis. We integrate quantum computing with GANs into a hybrid quantum-classical GAN to generate complex 5-channel electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) images of two distinct microstructure phases of steel. By training a quantum circuit at the input layer of a large classical Wasserstein GAN (WGAN) model, we mitigate mode collapse and achieve higher image quality compared to a baseline classical GAN. We generate images from both ferrite and bainite microstructure phases in an end-to-end workflow. With respect to maximum mean discrepancy score, we find that the hybrid quantum-classical WGAN improves over classical Bernoulli GANs in 70% of samples. As the quantum computer is part of the training procedure, our method has potential to scale to larger number of qubits. Our results indicate that the WGAN model based on the quantum circuit ansatz may be effectively leveraged to enhance the quality of synthetic EBSD images on both quantum simulators and actual quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Quantum Large Language Model Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a hybrid quantum-classical deep learning architecture for large language model fine-tuning. The classical portion of the architecture is a sentence transformer that is powerful enough to display significant accuracy for complex tasks such as sentiment prediction. The quantum portion of the architecture consists of parameterized quantum circuits that utilize long-range connections between qubits.
  We analyze the performance of the hybrid models for various settings of hyperparameters, including the number of qubits, the depth of the quantum circuits, learning rate, number of re-uploading steps, etc. Based on a screening study of main effects, we show an overall improvement in prediction accuracy over a comparable classical baseline, with a trend of increasing accuracy with number of qubits. We observe up to $3.14\%$ improvements in accuracy over classical architectures of comparable model size, within the set of hyperparameters probed in this study.
  We demonstrate the contribution of each module in our architecture through ablation studies. Our studies are based on finite shot-counts and include simulations based on noisy quantum gates.</description>

      <title>Variational quantum and neural quantum states algorithms for the linear complementarity problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) are promising hybrid quantum-classical methods designed to leverage the computational advantages of quantum computing while mitigating the limitations of current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware. Although VQAs have been demonstrated as proofs of concept, their practical utility in solving real-world problems -- and whether quantum-inspired classical algorithms can match their performance -- remains an open question. We present a novel application of the variational quantum linear solver (VQLS) and its classical neural quantum states-based counterpart, the variational neural linear solver (VNLS), as key components within a minimum map Newton solver for a complementarity-based rigid body contact model. We demonstrate using the VNLS that our solver accurately simulates the dynamics of rigid spherical bodies during collision events. These results suggest that quantum and quantum-inspired linear algebra algorithms can serve as viable alternatives to standard linear algebra solvers for modeling certain physical systems.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking and contrasting exchange-correlation functional differences in response to static correlation in unrestricted Kohn-Sham and a hybrid 1-electron reduced density matrix functional theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A hybrid Kohn-Sham Density Functional Theory (KS-DFT) and 1-electron Reduced Density Matrix Functional Theory (1-RDMFT) has recently been developed to describe strongly correlated systems at mean-field computational cost. This approach relies on combining a Reduced Density Matrix Functional to capture strong correlation effects with existing exchange correlation (XC) functionals to capture the remaining dynamical correlation effects. In this work, we systematically benchmark the performance of nearly 200 different XC functionals available within LibXC in this DFA 1-RDMFT framework, contrasting it with their performance in unrestricted KS-DFT. We identify optimal XC functionals for use within DFA 1-RDMFT and elucidate fundamental trends in the response of different XC functionals to strong correlation in both DFA 1-RDMFT and UKS-DFT.</description>

      <title>Molecular Axis Distribution Moments in Ultrafast Transient Absorption Spectroscopy: A Path Towards Ultrafast Quantum State Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In ultrafast experiments with gas phase molecules, the alignment of the molecular axis relative to the polarization of the interacting laser pulses plays a crucial role in determining the dynamics following this light-matter interaction. The molecular axis distribution is influenced by the interacting pulses and is intrinsically linked to the electronic coherences of the excited molecules. However, in typical theoretical calculations of such interactions, the signal is either calculated for a single molecule in the molecular frame or averaged over all possible molecular orientations to compare with the experiment. This averaging leads to the loss of information about anisotropy in the molecular-axis distribution, which could significantly affect the measured experimental signal. Here, we calculate the laboratory frame transient electronic first-order polarization ($P^{(1)}$) spectra in terms of separated molecular frame and laboratory frame quantities. The laboratory frame polarizations are compared with orientation-averaged Quantum Master Equation (QME) calculations, demonstrating that orientation-averaging captures only the isotropic contributions. We show that our formalism allows us to also evaluate the anisotropic contributions to the spectrum. Finally, we discuss the application of this approach to achieve ultrafast quantum state tomography using transient absorption spectroscopy and field observables in nonlinear spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Nonadiabatic Field: A Conceptually Novel Approach for Nonadiabatic Quantum Molecular Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reliable trajectory-based nonadiabatic quantum dynamics methods at the atomic level are critical for understanding many important processes in real systems. The paper reports latest progress of nonadiabatic field (NaF), a conceptually novel approach for nonadiabatic quantum dynamics with independent trajectories. Substantially different from the mainstreams of Ehrenfest-like dynamics and surface hopping methods, the nuclear force in NaF involves the nonadiabatic force arising from the nonadiabatic coupling between different electronic states, in addition to the adiabatic force contributed by a single adiabatic electronic state. NaF is capable of faithfully describing the interplay between electronic and nuclear motion in a broad regime, which covers where the relevant electronic states keep coupled in a wide range or all the time and where the bifurcation characteristic of nuclear motion is essential. NaF is derived from the exact generalized phase space formulation with coordinate-momentum variables, where constraint phase space (CPS) is employed for discrete electronic-state degrees of freedom. We propose efficient integrators for the equations of motion of NaF in both adiabatic and diabatic representations. Since the formalism in the CPS formulation is not unique, NaF can in principle be implemented with various phase space representations of the time correlation function (TCF) for the time-dependent property. They are applied to a suite of representative gas-phase and condensed-phase benchmark models where numerically exact results are available for comparison. It is shown that NaF is relatively insensitive to the phase space representation of the electronic TCF and will be a potential tool for practical and reliable simulations of the quantum mechanical behavior of both electronic and nuclear dynamics of nonadiabatic transition processes in real systems.</description>

      <title>Dynamics and fragmentation of bosons in an optical lattice inside a cavity using Wannier and position bases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The atom-cavity system is a versatile platform for emulating light-matter systems and realizing dissipation-induced phases, such as limit cycles (LCs) and time crystals. Here, we study the dynamics of a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) inside an optical cavity with transverse pumping and an additional intracavity optical lattice along the cavity axis. Specifically, we explore the theoretical predictions obtained from expanding the atomic field operators of the second-quantized Hamiltonian in two ways: (i) position basis and (ii) single-band Wannier basis. Both bases agree on the existence of most types of static and dynamical phases. However, matter-wave superradiance, captured within the position basis, is absent in the Wannier basis. Moreover, we show that they predict different types of LCs due to the inherent limitation of the single-band Wannier expansion, highlighting the importance of including higher energy bands to correctly capture certain phenomena. Using truncated Wigner approximation (TWA), we investigate the fragmentation dynamics of the BEC. We demonstrate that both position and Wannier bases qualitatively agree on the photon-mediated fragmentation dynamics of the BEC in the density-wave (DW) phase, despite the absence of interatomic interactions. The presence of interatomic interaction leads to further fragmentation, which can only be observed in larger system sizes. Finally, we predict a sudden increase in the fragmentation behavior for larger pump intensities, which may hint at an eventual transition to a Mott insulating (MI) phase.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish direct evidence for the perturbative distinguishability between black hole microstates and thermal states using the AdS/CFT correspondence. In two-dimensional holographic conformal field theories, we obtain the short interval expansion of subsystem fidelity and quantum Jensen-Shannon divergence, both of which provide rigorous lower and upper bounds for trace distance. This result demonstrates that quantum gravity corrections break semiclassical indistinguishability, thereby supporting the recovery of information even from a small amount of the Hawking radiation.</description>

      <title>Two-media laser threshold magnetometry: A magnetic-field-dependent laser threshold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond are a promising platform for high-precision magnetometry. In contrast to the use of spontaneous emission in a number of NV-magnetometers, laser threshold magnetometry (LTM) exploits stimulated emission of NV centers by placing an NV-doped diamond inside an optical cavity. The NV laser system is predicted to reach a high magnetic contrast and strong coherent signal strength, leading to an improved magnetic field sensitivity combined with a high linearity. Here, we consider a two-media setup where the cavity additionally includes a vertical external cavity surface emitting laser. This optically active material compensates cavity losses at 750 nm while still allowing for magnetic-field-dependent effects from the NV-diamond. We demonstrate a magnetic-field-dependent laser threshold and investigate the effects of pump laser induced absorption of the diamond. The experimental data is supported by an analytical simulation based on a rate model. Furthermore, we derive a generalized formula to compute the magnetic field sensitivity in the regime of high contrast yielding 33.79(23) pT/$\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ for the present setup. Simulations with an optimized diamond suggest that values down to 4.9 fT/$\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ are possible.</description>

      <title>Probes of Full Eigenstate Thermalization in Ergodicity-Breaking Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) is the leading interpretation in our current understanding of quantum thermalization. Recent results uncovered strong connections between quantum correlations in thermalizing systems and the structure of free probability theory, leading to the notion of full ETH. However, most studies have been performed for ergodic systems and it is still unclear whether or how full ETH manifests in ergodicity-breaking models. We fill this gap by studying standard probes of full ETH in ergodicity-breaking quantum circuits, presenting numerical and analytical results for interacting integrable systems. These probes can display distinct behavior and undergo a different scaling than the ones observed in ergodic systems. For the analytical results we consider an interacting integrable dual-unitary model and present the exact eigenstates, allowing us to analytically express common probes for full ETH. We discuss the underlying mechanisms responsible for these differences and show how the presence of solitons dictates the behavior of ETH-related quantities in the dual-unitary model. We show numerical evidence that this behavior is sufficiently generic away from dual-unitarity when restricted to the appropriate symmetry sectors.</description>

      <title>Symmetries, Conservation Laws and Entanglement in Non-Hermitian Fermionic Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian quantum many-body systems feature steady-state entanglement transitions driven by the competition between unitary dynamics and dissipation. In this work, we reveal the fundamental role of conservation laws in shaping this competition. Focusing on translation-invariant non-interacting fermionic models with U(1) symmetry, we present a theoretical framework to understand the structure of the steady-state of these models and their entanglement content based on two ingredients: the nature of the spectrum of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian and the constraints imposed on the steady-state single-particle occupation by the conserved quantities. These emerge from an interplay between Hamiltonian symmetries and initial state, due to the non-linearity of measurement back-action. For models with complex energy spectrum, we show that the steady state is obtained by filling single-particle right eigenstates with the largest imaginary part of the eigenvalue. As a result, one can have partially filled or fully filled bands in the steady-state, leading to an entanglement entropy undergoing a filling-driven transition between critical sub volume scaling and area-law, similar to ground-state problems. Conversely, when the spectrum is fully real, we provide evidence that local observables can be captured using a diagonal ensemble, and the entanglement entropy exhibits a volume-law scaling independently on the initial state, akin to unitary dynamics. We illustrate these principles in the Hatano-Nelson model with periodic boundary conditions and the non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, uncovering a rich interplay between the single-particle spectrum and conservation laws in determining the steady-state structure and the entanglement transitions. These conclusions are supported by exact analytical calculations and numerical calculations relying on the Faber polynomial method.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping Shape Invariance: Numerical Bootstrap as a Detector of Solvable Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Determining the solvability of a given quantum mechanical system is generally challenging. We discuss that the numerical bootstrap method can help us to solve this question in one-dimensional quantum mechanics. We analytically show that the bootstrap method can derive exact energy eigenvalues in systems with shape invariance, which is a sufficient condition for solvability and which many solvable systems satisfy. The information of the annihilation operators is also obtained naturally, and thus the bootstrap method tells us why the system is solvable. We numerically demonstrate this explicitly for shape invariant potentials: harmonic oscillators, Morse potentials, Rosen-Morse potentials and hyperbolic Scarf potentials. Therefore, the numerical bootstrap method can determine the solvability of a given unknown system if it satisfies shape invariance.</description>

      <title>Frequency-bin interferometry for reconstructing electric fields with low intensity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultrafast single-photon pulses with tailored time-frequency properties are highly attractive for quantum information science, offering high-dimensional encoding and compatibility with integrated optics platforms. However, accurate characterization of such pulses, including spectral coherence, remains challenging because current methods require substantial experimental resources and complex reconstruction algorithms. Here, we introduce frequency-bin interferometry for reconstructing electric fields with low intensity (FIREFLY), a technique that directly provides spectral amplitude, phase, and coherence profiles of single-photon pulses without requiring intensive reconstruction algorithms. Our approach measures the two-point spectral correlation function of the pulse by interfering its different frequency components using a quantum pulse gate (QPG) driven by a reference pump pulse. We demonstrate its compatibility with quantum light by characterizing partially coherent pulses generated by a type-0 parametric down-conversion process. We also overcome this requirement of a known pump pulse by introducing spectral shear into our interferometric scheme using a multi-output QPG (mQPG). This enables simultaneous characterization of a single-photon-level input pulse alongside an unknown pump pulse. Notably, our method achieves theory-experiment similarity above 95\% across all retrieved profiles, which demonstrates the reliability of this scheme for quantum information applications based on time-frequency encodings.</description>

      <title>Imaginary gauge potentials in a non-Hermitian spin-orbit coupled quantum gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1996, Hatano and Nelson proposed a non-Hermitian lattice model containing an imaginary Peierls phase [Phys. Rev. Lett. 77 570-573 (1996)], which subsequent analyses revealed to be an instance of a new class of topological systems. Here, we experimentally realize a continuum analog to this model containing an imaginary gauge potential using a homogeneous spin-orbit coupled Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). Non-Hermiticity is introduced by adding tunable spin-dependent loss via microwave coupling to a subspace with spontaneous emission. We demonstrate that the resulting Heisenberg equations of motion for position and momentum depend explicitly on the system's phase-space distribution. First, we observe collective nonreciprocal transport in real space, with a "self-acceleration" that decreases with the BEC's spatial extent, consistent with non-Hermitian Gross-Pitaevskii simulations. We then examine localized edge states: the relatively strong interactions in our BEC suppress the formation of topological edge states, yielding instead highly excited states localized by an interplay between self-acceleration and wavefunction spreading. Finally, we confirm that our non-Hermitian description remains valid at all times by comparing to a multi-level master-equation treatment.</description>

      <title>Schottky anomaly in a cavity-coupled double quantum well</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a theoretical study of a mesoscopic two-dimensional electron gas confined in a double quantum well that is coupled to a uniform quasi-static cavity mode via fluctuations of the dipole moment. We focus on the regime of large number of electrons participating in the virtual inter-subband transitions. In this regime, the effective photonic potential is no longer quadratic but, instead, it contains large number of minima. Each minimum represents a nearly harmonic oscillator with the renormalized cavity frequency that is much greater than its bare value. The energy offset of a minimum scales quadratically with respect to the photon coordinate corresponding to this minimum. These energy offsets determine the statistical weight of each minimum, and altogether they result in the additive correction to the heat capacity of the system. This correction exhibits a Schottky anomaly and a 0.5k_B plateau at low temperatures. This behavior can be associated with the emergence of a new degree of freedom. This degree of freedom does not manifest in the optical conductivity and can only be observed via the heat capacity measurement.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Resolved Entanglement with $U(1)$ Symmetry: Some Closed Formulae for Excited States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we revisit a problem we addressed in previous publications with various collaborators, that is, the computation of the symmetry resolved entanglement entropies of zero-density excited states in infinite volume. The universal nature of the charged moments of these states has already been noted previously. Here, we investigate this problem further, by writing general formulae for the entropies of excited states consisting of an arbitrary number of subsets of identical excitations. When the initial state is written in terms of qubits with appropriate probabilistic coefficients, we find the final formulae to be of a combinatorial nature too. We analyse some of their features numerically and analytically and find that for qubit states consisting of particles of the same charge, the symmetry resolved entropies are independent of region size relative to system size, even if the number and configuration entropies are not.</description>

      <title>Holographic duality from Howe duality: Chern-Simons gravity as an ensemble of code CFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the holographic correspondence between 3d "Chern-Simons gravity" and an ensemble of 2d Narain code CFTs. Starting from 3d abelian Chern-Simons theory, we construct an ensemble of boundary CFTs defined by gauging all possible maximal subgroups of the bulk one-form symmetry. Each maximal non-anomalous subgroup is isomorphic to a classical even self-dual error-correcting code over $\mathbb Z_p\times \mathbb Z_p$, providing a way to define a boundary "code CFT." The average over the ensemble of such theories is holographically dual to Chern-Simons gravity, a bulk theory summed over 3d topologies sharing the same boundary. In the case of prime $p$, the sum reduces to that over handlebodies, i.e. becomes the Poincar\'e series akin to that in semiclassical gravity. As the main result of the paper, we show that the mathematical identity underlying this holographic duality can be understood and rigorously proven using the framework of Howe duality over finite fields. This framework is concerned with the representation theory of two commuting groups forming a dual pair: the symplectic group of modular transformations of the boundary, and an orthogonal group mapping codes to each other. Finally, we reformulate the holographic duality as an identity between different averages over quantum stabilizer states, providing an interpretation in terms of quantum information theory.</description>

Abstract: Quantum computing is an emerging computing paradigm that can potentially transform several application areas by solving some of the intractable problems from classical domain. Similar to classical computing systems, quantum computing stack including software and hardware rely extensively on third parties many of them could be untrusted or less-trusted or unreliable. Quantum computing stack may contain sensitive Intellectual Properties (IP) that requires protection. From hardware perspective, quantum computers suffer from crosstalk that couples two programs in a multi-tenant setting to facilitate traditionally known fault injection attacks. Furthermore, third party calibration services can report incorrect error rates of qubits or mis-calibrate the qubits to degrade the computation performance for denial-of-service attacks. Quantum computers are expensive and access queue is typically long for trusted providers. Therefore, users may be enticed to explore untrusted but cheaper and readily available quantum hardware which can enable stealth of IP and tampering of quantum programs and/or computation outcomes. Recent studies have indicated the evolution of efficient but untrusted compilation services which presents risks to the IPs present in the quantum circuits. The untrusted compiler can also inject Trojans and perform tampering. Although quantum computing can involve sensitive IP and private information and can solve problems with strategic impact, its security and privacy has received inadequate attention. This paper provides comprehensive overview of the basics of quantum computing, key vulnerabilities embedded in the quantum systems and the recent attack vectors and corresponding defenses. Future research directions are also provided to build a stronger community of quantum security investigators.</description>

Abstract: Recently, the dynamics of quantum systems that involve both unitary evolution and quantum measurements have attracted attention due to the exotic phenomenon of measurement-induced phase transitions. The latter refers to a sudden change in a property of a state of $n$ qubits, such as its entanglement entropy, depending on the rate at which individual qubits are measured. At the same time, quantum complexity emerged as a key quantity for the identification of complex behaviour in quantum many-body dynamics. In this work, we investigate the dynamics of the quantum state complexity in monitored random circuits, where $n$ qubits evolve according to a random unitary circuit and are individually measured with a fixed probability at each time step. We find that the evolution of the exact quantum state complexity undergoes a phase transition when changing the measurement rate. Below a critical measurement rate, the complexity grows at least linearly in time until saturating to a value $e^{\Omega(n)}$. Above, the complexity does not exceed $\operatorname{poly}(n)$. In our proof, we make use of percolation theory to find paths along which an exponentially long quantum computation can be run below the critical rate, and to identify events where the state complexity is reset to zero above the critical rate. We lower bound the exact state complexity in the former regime using recently developed techniques from algebraic geometry. Our results combine quantum complexity growth, phase transitions, and computation with measurements to help understand the behavior of monitored random circuits and to make progress towards determining the computational power of measurements in many-body systems.</description>

Abstract: Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) have emerged as pivotal strategies for attaining quantum advantage in diverse scientific and technological domains, notably within Quantum Neural Networks. However, despite their potential, VQAs encounter significant obstacles, chief among them being the vanishing gradient problem, commonly referred to as barren plateaus. In this article, through meticulous analysis, we demonstrate that existing literature implicitly suggests the intrinsic influence of qudit dimensionality on barren plateaus. To instantiate these findings, we present numerical results that exemplify the impact of qudit dimensionality on barren plateaus. Therefore, despite the proposition of various error mitigation techniques, our results call for further scrutiny about their efficacy in the context of VQAs with qudits.</description>

Abstract: While quantum correlations between two spacelike-separated systems are fully encoded by the bipartite density operator associated with the joint system, there does not exist an analogous operator representing general quantum correlations across space and time. This is in stark contrast to the case of classical random variables, which make no distinction between spacelike and timelike correlations. Despite this, we show that spatiotemporal correlations between light-touch observables (i.e., observables whose eigenvalues are all equal in magnitude) admit a unique operator representation for arbitrary timelike-separated quantum systems. A special case of our result reproduces generalized Pauli observables and pseudo-density matrices, which have, up until now, only been defined for multi-qubit systems. In the case of qutrit systems, we use our results to illustrate an intriguing connection between light-touch observables and symmetric, informationally complete, positive operator-valued measures (SIC-POVMs).</description>

      <title>Realizing string-net condensation: Fibonacci anyon braiding for universal gates and sampling chromatic polynomials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12820v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The remarkable complexity of the vacuum state of a topologically-ordered many-body quantum system encodes the character and intricate braiding interactions of its emergent particles, the anyons.} Quintessential predictions exploiting this complexity use the Fibonacci string-net condensate (Fib-SNC) and its Fibonacci anyons to go beyond classical computing. Sampling the Fib-SNC wavefunction is expected to yield estimates of the chromatic polynomial of graph objects, a classical task that is provably hard. At the same time, exchanging anyons of Fib-SNC is expected to allow fault-tolerant universal quantum computation. Nevertheless, the physical realization of Fib-SNC and its anyons remains elusive. Here, we introduce a scalable dynamical string-net preparation (DSNP) approach, suitable even for near-term quantum processors, which dynamically prepares Fib-SNC and its anyons through reconfigurable graphs. Using a superconducting quantum processor, we couple the DSNP approach with composite error-mitigation on deep circuits to successfully create, measure, and braid anyons of Fib-SNC in a scalable manner. We certify the creation of anyons by measuring their `anyon charge', finding an average experimental accuracy of $94\%$. Furthermore, we validate that exchanging these anyons yields the { expected} golden ratio~$\phi$ with~$98\%$ average accuracy and~$8\%$ measurement uncertainty. Finally, we sample the Fib-SNC to estimate the chromatic polynomial at~$\phi+2$ for {several} graphs. Our results establish the proof of principle for using Fib-SNC and its anyons for fault-tolerant universal quantum computation and {for aiming at} a classically-hard problem.</description>

      <title>Liouvillian skin effect in quantum neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14112v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the field of dissipative systems, the non-Hermitian skin effect has generated significant interest due to its unexpected implications. A system is said to exhibit a skin effect if its properties are largely affected by the boundary conditions. Despite the burgeoning interest, the potential impact of this phenomenon on emerging quantum technologies remains unexplored. In this work, we address this gap by demonstrating that quantum neural networks can exhibit this behavior and that skin effects, beyond their fundamental interest, can also be exploited in computational tasks. Specifically, we show that the performance of a given complex network used as a quantum reservoir computer is dictated solely by the boundary conditions of a dissipative line within its architecture. The closure of one (edge) link is found to drastically change the performance in time-series processing, proving the possibility of exploiting skin effects for machine learning.</description>

      <title>HAM-Schr\"{o}dingerisation: a generic framework of quantum simulation for any nonlinear PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15821v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, Jin et al. proposed a quantum simulation technique for ANY linear partial differential equations (PDEs), called Schr\"{o}dingerisation [1,2,3]. In this paper, the Schr\"{o}dingerisation technique for quantum simulation is expanded to ANY nonlinear PDEs by combining it with the homotopy analysis method (HAM). The HAM can transfer a nonlinear PDE into a series of linear PDEs with guaranteeing convergence of the series. In this way, ANY nonlinear PDEs can be solved by quantum simulation using a quantum computer. For simplicity, we call the procedure ``HAM-Schr\"{o}dingerisation quantum algorithm''. Quantum computing is a groundbreaking technique. Hopefully, the ``HAM-Schr\"{o}dingerisation quantum algorithm'' can open a door to highly efficient simulation of complicated turbulent flows by means of quantum computing in future.</description>

      <title>Limitations to Dynamical Error Suppression and Gate-Error Virtualization from Temporally Correlated Nonclassical Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04766v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Realistic multi-qubit noise processes often result in error mechanisms that are not captured by the probabilistic, Markovian error models commonly employed in circuit-level analyses of quantum fault-tolerance. By working within an open-quantum system Hamiltonian formulation, we revisit the validity of the notion of a constant gate error in the presence of noise that is both temporally correlated and nonclassical, and whose impact is mitigated through perfect instantaneous dynamical decoupling subject to finite timing constraints. We study a minimal exactly solvable single-qubit model under Gaussian quantum dephasing noise, showing that the fidelity of a dynamically protected idling gate can depend strongly on its location in the circuit and the history of applied control, even when the system-side error propagation is fully removed through perfect reset operations. For digital periodic control, we prove that, under mild conditions on the low-frequency behavior of the nonclassical noise spectrum, the gate fidelity saturates at a value that is strictly smaller than the one attainable in the absence of control history; the presence of high-frequency noise peaks is also found as especially harmful, due to the possible onset of control-induced resonance effects. We explicitly relate these features to the evolution of the bath statistics during the computation, which has not been fully accounted for in existing treatments. We find that only if decoupling can keep the qubit highly pure over a timescale larger than the correlation time of the noise, the bath approximately converges to its original statistics and a stable-in-time control performance is recovered. Implications of this costly re-equilibration of the quantum bath statistics for layered quantum fault-tolerant architectures are discussed.</description>

      <title>An iterative transversal CNOT decoder</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20976v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern platforms for potential qubit candidates, such as trapped ions or neutral atoms, allow long range connectivity between distant physical qubits through shuttling. This opens up an avenue for transversal logical CNOT gates between distant logical qubits, whereby physical CNOT gates are performed between each corresponding physical qubit on the control and target logical qubits. However, the transversal CNOT can propagate errors from one logical qubit to another, leading to correlated errors between logical qubits. We have developed a multi-pass iterative decoder that decodes each logical qubit separately to deal with this correlated error. We show that under circuit-level noise and only $\mathcal{O}(1)$ code cycles, a threshold can still persist, and the logical error rate will not be significantly degraded, matching the sub-threshold logical error rate scaling of $p^{\lfloor\frac{d}{2}\rfloor}$ for a distance $d$ rotated surface code.</description>

      <title>Spin-Dependent Force and Inverted Harmonic Potential for Rapid Creation of Macroscopic Quantum Superpositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11909v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Creating macroscopic spatial superposition states is crucial for investigating matter-wave interferometry and advancing quantum sensor technology. Currently, two potential methods exist to achieve this objective. The first involves using inverted harmonic potential (IHP) to spatially delocalize quantum states through coherent inflation [1]. The second method employs a spin-dependent force to separate two massive wave packets spatially [2]. The disadvantage of the former method is the slow initial coherent inflation, while the latter is hindered by the diamagnetism of spin-embedded nanocrystals, which suppresses spatial separation. In this study, we integrate two methods: first, we use the spin-dependent force to generate initial spatial separation, and second, we use IHP to achieve coherent inflating trajectories of the wavepackets. This approach enables the attainment of massive large spatial superposition in minimal time. For instance, a spatial superposition with a mass of $10^{-15}$ kg and a size of 50 $\mu$m is realized in $0.1$ seconds. We also calculate the evolution of wave packets in both harmonic potential (HP) and IHP using path integral approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13880v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the relationship between advice in the form of a training set and classical advice. We do this by analyzing the class \textbf{BPP/samp} and certain variants of it. Specifically, our main result demonstrates that \textbf{BPP/samp} is a proper subset of the class \textbf{P/poly}. This result remains valid when considering quantum advice and a quantum generalization of the training set. Finally, leveraging the insights gained from these proofs, we identify sufficient and necessary complexity assumptions for the existence of concept classes that exhibit a quantum learning speed-up in the worst-case scenario, i.e., when accurate results are required for all inputs, and in the average-case scenario.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Impact of Qubit Velocity on Quantum Synchronization Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01429v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the quantum synchronization dynamics of a moving qubit interacting with a dissipative cavity environment, using the Husimi $Q$-function to analyze its phase space evolution. Unlike conventional synchronization between separate subsystems, we focus on self-synchronization phenomena, where the qubit's phase dynamics exhibit locking to its initial phase distribution. We explore the effects of varying qubit velocity and system detuning across weak and strong coupling regimes. In the weak coupling regime, the system rapidly decoheres with minimal phase preference. In contrast, strong coupling leads to the emergence and persistence of a distinct phase peak, indicating phase locking and enhanced synchronization. These results offer insight into how motion and detuning can regulate coherence and phase stability in open quantum systems. Our approach aligns with recent studies that generalize synchronization concepts to single quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Non-local resources for error correction in quantum LDPC codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05818v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum low density parity check (qLDPC) codes are an attractive alternative to the surface code due to their relatively high code rate and distance. However, unlike the surface code which has simple, geometrically local, stabilizer checks, high performing qLDPC codes have non-local stabilizers that are challenging to measure. Recent advancements have shown how to deterministically perform high-fidelity, cavity mediated many-body gates, enabling the encoding and decoding of non-local GHZ states. We integrate this non-local resource into the DiVincenzo-Aliferis method of fault-tolerant stabilizer measurement for quantum hypergraph product and lifted product codes. Using circuit-level noise simulations, including the noise optimized cavity mediated gate, we find promising thresholds of $0.84 \%-0.60 \%$ for the hypergraph product code and psuedo-threshold of $0.3\%-0.4\%$ for the lifted product codes, with cavity cooperativities in the range $C\sim 10^4-10^6$. We propose a compatible tri-layer architectural layout for scheduling stabilizer measurements, enhancing circuit parallelizability.</description>

Abstract: Quantum computing has emerged as a promising tool for transforming the landscape of computing technology. Recent efforts have applied quantum techniques to classical database challenges, such as query optimization, data integration, index selection, and transaction management. In this paper, we shift focus to a critical yet underexplored area: data management for quantum computing. We are currently in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era, where qubits, while promising, are fragile and still limited in scale. After differentiating quantum data from classical data, we outline current and future data management paradigms in the NISQ era and beyond. We address the data management challenges arising from the emerging demands of near-term quantum computing. Our goal is to chart a clear course for future quantum-oriented data management research, establishing it as a cornerstone for the advancement of quantum computing in the NISQ era.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03358v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that there exists an oracle relative to which quantum commitments exist but no (efficiently verifiable) one-way state generators exist. Both have been widely considered candidates for replacing one-way functions as the minimal assumption for cryptography: the weakest cryptographic assumption implied by all of computational cryptography. Recent work has shown that commitments can be constructed from one-way state generators, but the other direction has remained open. Our results rule out any black-box construction, and thus settles this crucial open problem, suggesting that quantum commitments (as well as its equivalency class of EFI pairs, quantum oblivious transfer, and secure quantum multiparty computation) appear to be strictly weakest among all known cryptographic primitives.</description>

Abstract: We present a novel waveguide design that incorporates a split-diode structure, allowing independent electrical control of transition energies of multiple emitters over a wide range with minimal loss in waveguide coupling efficiency. We use this design to systematically map out the transition from superradiant to independent emission from two quantum dots. We perform both lifetime as well as Hanbury Brown-Twiss measurements on the device, observing anti-dips in the photon coincidences indicating collective emission while at the same time observing a drop in lifetime around zero detuning, indicating superradiant behaviour. Performing both measurement types allows us to investigate detuning regions which show both superradiant rate enhancement and inter-emitter coherence, as well as regions in which correlations persist in the absence of rate enhancement.</description>

      <title>Quantum Simulation of Spin-1 XXZ-Heisenberg Models and the Haldane Phase with Dysprosium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22216v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dysprosium atoms have proven to be a promising platform for quantum simulation due to their strong magnetic moment and high tunability of interactions. In this work, we propose Dysprosium atoms for simulating the one-dimensional spin-1 XXZ-Heisenberg model, which is known to have a rich phase diagram including the famous Haldane phase. To realize the model, we make use of the strong dipolar exchange interactions that naturally occur in the ground state of Dysprosium due to its large electron angular momentum of J=8. To implement spin-1 particles, we encode the spin degree of freedom into three Zeeman sublevels, which are energetically isolated by applying a magnetic field. Using the density-matrix renormalization group, we analyze the ground-state properties of the resulting effective model. We find that a chain of fermionic Dysprosium atoms in a suitable magnetic field can form a Haldane state with the characteristic spin-1/2 edge modes. Furthermore, we discuss the use of AC Stark shifts and Raman-type schemes for bosonic Dysprosium to isolate effective spin-1 systems and to increase the tunability of model parameters.</description>

Abstract: Random circuits giving rise to unitary designs are key tools in quantum information science and many-body physics. In this work, we investigate a class of random quantum circuits with a specific gate structure. Within this framework, we prove that one-dimensional structured random circuits with non-Haar random local gates can exhibit substantially more global randomness compared to Haar random circuits with the same underlying circuit architecture. In particular, we derive all the exact eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the second-moment operators for these structured random circuits under a solvable condition, by establishing a link to the Kitaev chain, and show that their spectral gaps can exceed those of Haar random circuits. Our findings have applications in improving circuit depth bounds for randomized benchmarking and the generation of approximate unitary 2-designs from shallow random circuits.</description>

      <title>Towards a universal gateset for $\mathsf{QMA}_1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02681v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: $\mathsf{QMA}_1$ is $\mathsf{QMA}$ with perfect completeness, i.e., the prover must accept with a probability of exactly $1$ in the YES-case. Whether $\mathsf{QMA}_1$ and $\mathsf{QMA}$ are equal is still a major open problem. It is not even known whether $\mathsf{QMA}_1$ has a universal gateset; Solovay-Kitaev does not apply due to perfect completeness. Hence, we do not generally know whether $\mathsf{QMA}_1^G=\mathsf{QMA}_1^{G'}$ (superscript denoting gateset), given two universal gatesets $G,G'$. In this paper, we make progress towards the gateset question by proving that for all $k\in\mathbb N$, the gateset $G_{2^k}$ (Amy et al., RC 2024) is universal for all gatesets in the cyclotomic field $\mathbb{Q}(\zeta_{2^k}),\zeta_{2^k}=e^{2\pi i/2^k}$, i.e. $\mathsf{QMA}_1^G\subseteq\mathsf{QMA}_1^{G_{2^k}}$ for all gatesets $G$ in $\mathbb{Q}(\zeta_{2^k})$. For $\mathsf{BQP}_1$, we can even show that $G_2$ suffices for all $2^k$-th cyclotomic fields. We exhibit complete problems for all $\mathsf{QMA}_1^{G_{2^k}}$: Quantum $l$-SAT in $\mathbb{Q}(\zeta_{2^k})$ is complete for $\mathsf{QMA}_1^{G_{2^k}}$ for all $l\ge4$, and $l=3$ if $k\ge3$, where quantum $l$-SAT is the problem of deciding whether a set of $l$-local Hamiltonians has a common ground state. Additionally, we give the first $\mathsf{QMA}_1$-complete $2$-local Hamiltonian problem: It is $\mathsf{QMA}_1^{G_{2^k}}$-complete (for $k\ge3$) to decide whether a given $2$-local Hamiltonian $H$ in $\mathbb{Q}(\zeta_{2^k})$ has a nonempty nullspace. Our techniques also extend to sparse Hamiltonians, and so we can prove the first $\mathsf{QMA}_1(2)$-complete (i.e. $\mathsf{QMA}_1$ with two unentangled provers) Hamiltonian problem. Finally, we prove that the Gapped Clique Homology problem defined by King and Kohler (FOCS 2024) is $\mathsf{QMA}_1^{G_2}$-complete, and the Clique Homology problem without promise gap is PSPACE-complete.</description>

      <title>A decompositional framework for process theories in spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08266v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There has been a recent surge of interest within the field of quantum foundations regarding incorporating ideas from general relativity and quantum gravity. However, many quantum information tools remain agnostic to the underlying spacetime. For instance, whenever we draw a quantum circuit the effective spacetime imposed by the connectivity of the physical qubits which will realize this circuit is not taken into account. In this work, we aim to address this limitation by extending the framework of process theories to include a background causal structure arising from a fixed spacetime. We introduce the notion of process implementations, i.e., decompositions of a process. A process is then embeddable if and only if one of its implementations can be embedded in such a way that all the component processes are localized and all wires follow timelike paths. While conceptually simple, checking for embeddability is generally computationally intractable. We therefore work towards simplifying this problem as much as possible, identifying a canonical subset of implementations that determine both the embeddability of a process and the causal structures distinguishable at least in some process theory. Notably, we discover countably infinite ``zigzag'' causal structures beyond those typically considered. While these can be ignored in classical theory, they seem to be essential in quantum theory, as the quantum CNOT gate can be implemented by all zigzag structures but not in a standard causal structure, except in the trivial undecomposed way. These zigzags could be significant for quantum causal modeling and the study of novel quantum resources.</description>

      <title>Spikes in Poissonian quantum trajectories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11760v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the dynamics of a continuously monitored qubit in the limit of strong measurement rate where the quantum trajectory is described by a stochastic master equation with Poisson noise. Such limits are expected to give rise to quantum jumps between the pointer states associated with the non-demolition measurement. A surprising discovery in earlier work [Tilloy et al., Phys. Rev. A 92, 052111 (2015)] on quantum trajectories with Brownian noise was the phenomena of spikes observed in between the quantum jumps. Here, we show that spikes are observed also for Poisson noise. We consider three cases where the non-demolition is broken by adding, to the basic strong measurement dynamics, either unitary evolution or thermal noise or additional measurements. We present a complete analysis of the spike and jump statistics for all three cases using the fact that the dynamics effectively corresponds to that of stochastic resetting. We provide numerical results to support our analytic results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16967v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this short review we describe the process of designing a superconducting circuit device for quantum information applications. We discuss the factors that must be considered to implement a desired effective Hamiltonian on a device. We describe the translation between a device's physical layout, the circuit graph, and the effective Hamiltonian. We go over the process of electromagnetic simulation of a device layout to predict its behavior. We also discuss concerns such as connectivity, crosstalk suppression, and radiation shielding, and how they affect both on-chip design and enclosure structures. This paper provides an overview of the challenges in superconducting quantum circuit design and acts as a starter document for researchers working on any of these challenges.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09070v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Certain unitary-invariants, known as Bargmann invariants or multivariate traces of quantum states, have recently gained attention due to their applications in quantum information theory. However, determining the boundaries of sets of Bargmann invariants remains a theoretical challenge. In this study, we address the problem by developing a unified, dimension-independent formulation that characterizes the sets of the 3rd and 4th Bargmann invariants.In particular, our result for the set of 4th Bargmann invariants confirms the conjecture given by Fernandes \emph{et al.} [Phys.Rev.Lett.\href{https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.133.190201}{\textbf{133}, 190201 (2024)}]. Based on the obtained results, we conjecture that the unified, dimension-independent formulation of the boundaries for sets of 3rd-order and 4th-order Bargmann invariants may extend to the general case of the $n$th-order Bargmann invariants. These results deepen our understanding of the fundamental physical limits within quantum mechanics and pave the way for novel applications of Bargmann invariants in quantum information processing and related fields.</description>

      <title>WaveguideQED.jl: An Efficient Framework for Simulating Non-Markovian Waveguide Quantum Electrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13332v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a numerical framework designed to solve problems within the emerging field of Waveguide Quantum Electrodynamics (WQED). The framework is based on collision quantum optics, where a localized quantum system interacts sequentially with individual time-bin modes. This approach provides a physically intuitive model that allows researchers familiar with tools such as QuTiP in Python, Quantum Optics Toolbox for Matlab, or QuantumOptics.jl in Julia to efficiently set up and execute WQED simulations. Despite its conceptual simplicity, we demonstrate the framework's robust ability to handle complex WQED scenarios. These applications include the scattering of single- or two-photon pulses by quantum emitters or cavities, as well as the exploration of non-Markovian dynamics, where emitted photons are reflected back, thereby introducing feedback mechanisms.</description>

Abstract: We report a method for the evaluation of the one-loop self-energy, to all orders in the external binding field, using a Gaussian basis set expansion. This choice of basis is motivated by its widespread use in molecular calculations. For a one-electron atom, our results show excellent agreement with those obtained using the exact Dirac--Coulomb wave functions. The developed method can be of interest for high-precision studies of heavy few-electron molecular systems, where the rigorous computation of QED corrections is currently a formidable task.</description>

      <title>Optimal control in phase space applied to minimal-time transfer of thermal atoms in optical traps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10494v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an optimal control procedure for the non-adiabatic transport of ultracold neutral thermal atoms in optical tweezers arranged in a one-dimensional array, with focus on reaching minimal transfer time. The particle dynamics are modeled first using a classical approach through the Liouville equation and second through the quantum Wigner equation to include quantum effects. Both methods account for typical experimental noise described as stochastic effects through Fokker-Planck terms. The optimal control process is initialized with a trajectory computed for a single classical particle and determines the phase-space path that minimizes transport time and ensures high transport fidelity to the target trap. This approach provides the fastest and most efficient method for relocating atoms from an initial configuration to a desired target arrangement, minimizing time and energy costs while ensuring high fidelity. Such an approach may be highly valuable to initialize large atom arrays for quantum simulation or computation experiments.</description>

      <title>Transfer of Knowledge through Reverse Annealing: A Preliminary Analysis of the Benefits and What to Share</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15865v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Being immersed in the NISQ-era, current quantum annealers present limitations for solving optimization problems efficiently. To mitigate these limitations, D-Wave Systems developed a mechanism called Reverse Annealing, a specific type of quantum annealing designed to perform local refinement of good states found elsewhere. Despite the research activity around Reverse Annealing, none has theorized about the possible benefits related to the transfer of knowledge under this paradigm. This work moves in that direction and is driven by experimentation focused on answering two key research questions: i) is reverse annealing a paradigm that can benefit from knowledge transfer between similar problems? and ii) can we infer the characteristics that an input solution should meet to help increase the probability of success? To properly guide the tests in this paper, the well-known Knapsack Problem has been chosen for benchmarking purposes, using a total of 34 instances composed of 14 and 16 items.</description>

      <title>Optimal sensing on an asymmetric exceptional surface</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09064v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the connection between exceptional points (EPs) and optimal parameter estimation, in a simple system consisting of two counter-propagating traveling wave modes in a microring resonator. The unknown parameter to be estimated is the strength of a perturbing cross-coupling between the two modes. Partially reflecting the output of one mode into the other creates a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian which exhibits a family of EPs, creating an exceptional surface (ES). We use a fully quantum treatment of field inputs and noise sources to obtain a quantitative bound on the estimation error by calculating the quantum Fisher information (QFI) in the output fields, whose inverse gives the Cram\'er-Rao lower bound on the mean-squared-error of any unbiased estimator. We determine the bounds for two input states, namely, a semiclassical coherent state and a highly nonclassical NOON state. We find that the QFI is enhanced in the presence of an EP for both of these input states and that both states can saturate the Cram\'er-Rao bound. We then identify idealized yet experimentally feasible measurements that achieve the minimum bound for these two input states. We also investigate how the QFI changes for parameter values that do not lie on the ES, finding that these can have a larger QFI, suggesting alternative routes to optimize the parameter estimation for this problem.</description>

      <title>Quantum Error Detection For Early Term Fault-Tolerant Quantum Algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10790v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum error detection (QED) offers a promising pathway to fault tolerance in near-term quantum devices by balancing error suppression with minimal resource overhead. However, its practical utility hinges on optimizing design parameters-such as syndrome measurement frequency-to avoid diminishing returns from detection overhead. In this work, we present a comprehensive framework for fault-tolerant compilation and simulation of quantum algorithms using [[n, n-2, 2]] codes, which enable low-qubit-overhead error detection and a simple nearly fault-tolerant universal set of operations. We demonstrate and analyze our pipeline with a purely statistical interpretation and through the implementation of Grover's search algorithm. Our results are used to answer the question is quantum error detection a worthwhile avenue for early-term fault tolerance, and if so how can we get the most out of it? Simulations under the circuit-level noise model reveal that finding optimal syndrome schedules improves algorithm success probabilities by an average of 6.7x but eventual statistical limits from post-selection in noisy/resource-limited regimes constrain scalability. Furthermore, we propose a simple data-driven approach to predict fault tolerant compilation parameters, such as optimal syndrome schedules, and expected fault tolerant performance gains based on circuit and noise features. These results provide actionable guidelines for implementing QED in early-term quantum experiments and underscore its role as a pragmatic, constant-overhead error mitigation layer for shallow algorithms. To aid in further research, we release all simulation data computed for this work and provide an experimental QED compiler at https://codeqraft.xyz/qed.</description>

      <title>Quantum algorithms for simulating systems coupled to bosonic modes using a hybrid resonator-qubit quantum computer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11507v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modeling composite systems of spins or electrons coupled to bosonic modes is of significant interest for many fields of applied quantum physics and chemistry. A quantum simulation can allow for the solution of quantum problems beyond classical numerical methods. However, implementing this on existing noisy quantum computers can be challenging due to the mapping between qubits and bosonic degrees of freedom, often requiring a large number of qubits or deep quantum circuits. In this work, we discuss quantum algorithms to solve composite systems by augmenting conventional superconducting qubits with microwave resonators used as computational elements. This enables direct representation of bosonic modes by resonators. We derive efficient algorithms for typical models and propose a device connectivity that allows for feasible scaling of simulations with linear overhead. We also show how the dissipation of resonators can be a useful parameter for modeling continuous bosonic baths. Experimental results demonstrating these methods were obtained on the IQM Resonance cloud platform, based on high-fidelity gates and tunable couplers. These results present the first digital quantum simulation including a computational resonator on a commercial quantum platform.</description>

      <title>QCPINN: Quantum-Classical Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Solving PDEs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16678v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have emerged as promising methods for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) by embedding physical laws within neural architectures. However, these classical approaches often require a large number of parameters to achieve reasonable accuracy, particularly for complex PDEs. In this paper, we present a quantum-classical physics-informed neural network (QCPINN) that combines quantum and classical components, allowing us to solve PDEs with significantly fewer parameters while maintaining comparable accuracy and convergence to classical PINNs. We systematically evaluated two quantum circuit architectures across various configurations on five benchmark PDEs to identify optimal QCPINN designs. Our results demonstrate that the QCPINN achieves stable convergence and comparable accuracy, while requiring approximately 10% of the trainable parameters used in classical approaches. It also results in a 40% reduction in the relative error L2 for the convection-diffusion equation. These findings demonstrate the potential of parameter efficiency as a measurable quantum advantage in physics-informed machine learning, significantly reducing model complexity while preserving solution quality. This approach presents a promising solution to the computational challenges associated with solving PDEs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20873v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-stabilizerness is a key resource for fault-tolerant quantum computation, yet its interplay with entanglement in dynamical settings remains underexplored. We study a well-controlled, analytically tractable setup that isolates entanglement generation from magic injection. We analytically and numerically demonstrate that stabilizer entanglement functions as a highway that facilitates the spreading of locally injected magic throughout the entire system. Specifically, for an initial stabilizer state with bipartite entanglement $E$, the total magic growth, quantified by the linear stabilizer entropy $Y$, follows $\overline{Y}\propto 2^{-|A|-E}$ under a Haar random unitary on a local subregion $A$. Moreover, when applying a tensor product of local Haar random unitaries, the resulting state's global magic approaches that of a genuine Haar random state if the initial stabilizer state is sufficiently entangled by a system-size-independent amount. Similar results are also obtained for tripartite stabilizer entanglement. We further extend our analysis to non-stabilizer entanglement and magic injection via a shallow-depth brickwork circuit, and find that the qualitative picture of our conclusion remains unchanged.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23610v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Executing quantum logic in cryogenic quantum computers requires a continuous energy supply from room-temperature control electronics. This dependence on external energy sources creates scalability limitations due to control channel density and heat dissipation. Here, we propose quantum batteries (QBs) as intrinsic energy sources for quantum computation, enabling the fundamental limit of zero dissipation for unitary gates. Unlike classical power sources, QBs maintain quantum coherence with their load - a property that has been explored theoretically, albeit without practical implications in quantum technologies so far. We demonstrate that a bosonic Fock-state QB can supply the energy required for all unitary gates via quantum field recycling, enable all-to-all qubit connectivity, and support a universal gate set controlled by a single parameter per qubit: its resonant frequency. We simulate quantum-error-correction encoding with more than 98% fidelity solely by qubit resonance tuning, executing energy-changing gates when on-resonance with the QB and enabling a single-step multi-qubit parity probing when including off-resonance interactions. Implementing this scheme on cryogenic platforms eliminates the need for a dedicated drive line per qubit, which quadruples the qubit count within the cryogenic system, offering a promising architecture for scalable quantum computing.</description>

Abstract: We study entangled resource state recycling after one round of probabilistic port-based teleportation. We analytically characterize its degradation and, for the case of the resource state consisting of $N$ EPR pairs, we demonstrate the possibility of reusing it for a subsequent round of teleportation in the $N \to \infty$ limit. For the case of an optimized resource state, we compare the protocol's performance to multi-port-based teleportation, indicating that the resource state reuse is possible. An analogous comparison is made in the case of the deterministic scheme.</description>

Abstract: Quantum Transformer models represent a significant research direction in quantum machine learning (QML), leveraging the parallelism and entanglement properties of quantum computing to overcome the computational complexity and expressive limitations of classical Transformers. Parameterized quantum circuit (PQC)-based Transformer models are the primary focus of current research, employing PQCs to achieve varying degrees of quantumization, including strategies such as QKV-only Quantum mapping, Quantum Pairwise Attention, Quantum Global Attention, and Quantum-Assisted Acceleration. These approaches are well-suited to Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices, demonstrating potential in small-scale tasks to reduce complexity or enhance performance. The strength of PQC-based methods lies in their compatibility with existing quantum hardware, positioning them as the main pathway toward the practical implementation of quantum Transformers. However, these methods face challenges such as limited scalability, the absence of standardized testing benchmarks, and the "barren plateau" problem during training. As a complementary approach, Quantum Linear Algebra (QLA)-based Transformer models rely on future fault-tolerant quantum computing, utilizing techniques like block-encoding and Quantum Singular Value Transformation (QSVT) to achieve efficient matrix operations and theoretically significant complexity reductions, though they remain in the theoretical exploration stage. Future research should prioritize optimizing PQC-based hybrid architectures and quantum global attention models, establishing unified evaluation frameworks, and addressing training difficulties, while also exploring hybrid PQC-QLA approaches to advance the development of quantum Transformers.</description>

      <title>More-efficient Quantum Multivariate Mean Value Estimator from Generalized Grover Gate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06940v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we present an efficient algorithm for multivariate mean value estimation. Our algorithm outperforms previous work by polylog factors and nearly saturates the known lower bound. More formally, given a random vector $\vec{X}$ of dimension $d$, we find an algorithm that uses $O\left(n \log \frac{d}{\delta}\right)$ samples to find a mean estimate that $\vec{\tilde{\mu}}$ that differs from the true mean $\vec{\mu}$ by $\frac{\sqrt{\text{tr } \Sigma}}{n}$ in $\ell^\infty$ norm and hence $\frac{\sqrt{d \text{ tr } \Sigma}}{n}$ in $\ell^2$ norm, where $\Sigma$ is the covariance matrix of the components of the random vector. We also presented another algorithm that uses smaller memory but costs an extra $d^\frac{1}{4}$ in complexity. Consider the Grover gate, the unitary operator used in Grover's algorithm. It contains an oracle that uses a $\pm 1$ phase for each candidate for the search space. Previous work has demonstrated that when we substitute the oracle in Grover gate with generic phases, it ended up being a good mean value estimator in some mathematical notion. We used this idea to build our algorithm. Our result remains not exactly optimal due to a $\log \frac{d}{\delta}$ term in our complexity, as opposed to something nicer such as $\log \frac{1}{\delta}$; This comes from the phase estimation primitive in our algorithm. So far, this primitive is the only major known method to tackle the problem, and moving beyond this idea seems hard. Our results demonstrates that the methodology with generalized Grover gate can be used develop the optimal algorithm without polylog overhead for different tasks relating to mean value estimation.</description>

      <title>Ergotropy-Based Quantum Thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07200v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce an ergotropy-based formulation of quantum thermodynamics, which provides a strong connection between average heat and von Neumann entropy. By adopting this formulation, we can reinterpret the infinitesimal average heat in terms of the infinitesimal change of the passive state associated with the density operator behind the quantum dynamics. Such as entropy, this leads to a heat concept that is invariant under passive state transformations. As an application, the average heat can be used as a general non-Markovinity measure for unital maps. Moreover, a positive-semidefinite temperature naturally emerges in an out-of-equilibrium ergotropy-based scenario. Concerning the infinitesimal average work, it arises as the infinitesimal variation of ergotropy, as well as an extra passive work contribution in the case of a time-dependent Hamiltonian. As illustrations, we consider the thermodynamics of a single-qubit open system in the cases of generalized amplitude-damping and phase-damping channels.</description>

      <title>Nanoscale Casimir Force Softening Originated from Quantum Surface Responses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11849v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Strong coupling between vacuum fields and quantum matter occurs at the nanoscale and broadens the horizon of light-matter interaction. Nanoscale Casimir force, as an exhibition of vacuum fields, inevitably experiences the influence of surface electrons due to their quantum character, which are ignorable in micron Casimir force. Here, we develop a three-dimensional conformal map method to tackle typical experimental configurations with surface electron contributions to Casimir force purposely and delicately included. Based on this method, we reveal that surface electrons can either enhance or suppress the nanoscale Casimir force, depending on materials and crystal facets. The mechanism is demonstrated to be the Casimir force softening, which results from surface electrons effectively altering the distance seen by the Casimir interaction. Our findings not only highlight the interaction between surface electrons and vacuum fields but also provide a recipe for theoretical and experimental investigation of nanoscale fluctuation-type problems.</description>

      <title>Exact real time dynamics with free fermions in disguise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20832v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider quantum spin chains with a hidden free fermionic structure, distinct from the Jordan-Wigner transformation and its generalizations. We express selected local operators with the hidden fermions. This way we can exactly solve the real time dynamics in various physical scenarios, including the computation of selected dynamical two point functions, in continuous or discrete time. In the latter case we build a quantum circuit that can be implemented on a quantum computer. With this we extend the family of classically simulable quantum many-body processes.</description>

      <title>Exceptional Second-Order Topological Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06898v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Point-gap topological phases of non-Hermitian systems exhibit exotic boundary states that have no counterparts in Hermitian systems. Here, we develop classification of second-order point-gap topological phases protected by reflection symmetry. Based on this classification, we propose exceptional second-order topological insulators, exhibiting second-order boundary states stabilized by point-gap topology. As an illustrative example, we uncover a two-dimensional exceptional second-order topological insulator with point-gapless corner states. Furthermore, we identify a three-dimensional exceptional second-order topological insulator that features hinge states with isolated exceptional points, representing second-order topological phases intrinsic to non-Hermitian systems. Our work enlarges the family of point-gap topological phases in non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <title>Systematic discrepancies between reference methods for non-covalent interactions within the S66 dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16405v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The accurate treatment of non-covalent interactions is necessary to model a wide range of applications, from molecular crystals to surface catalysts to aqueous solutions and many more. Quantum diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) and coupled cluster theory with single, double and perturbative triple excitations [CCSD(T)] are considered two widely-trusted methods for treating non-covalent interactions. However, while they have been well-validated for small molecules, recent work has indicated that these two methods can disagree by more than 7.5 kcal/mol for larger systems. The origin of this discrepancy remains unknown. Moreover, the lack of systematic comparisons, particularly for medium-sized complexes, has made it difficult to identify which systems may be prone to such disagreements and the potential scale of these differences. In this work, we leverage the latest developments in DMC to compute interaction energies for the entire S66 dataset, containing 66 medium-sized complexes with a balanced representation of dispersion and electrostatic interactions. Comparison to previous CCSD(T) references reveals systematic trends, with DMC predicting stronger binding than CCSD(T) for electrostatic-dominated systems, while the binding becomes weaker for dispersion-dominated systems. We show that the relative strength of this discrepancy is correlated to the ratio of electrostatic and dispersion interactions, as obtained from energy decomposition analysis methods. Finally, we have pinpointed model systems: the hydrogen-bonded acetic acid dimer (ID 20) and dispersion-dominated uracil-cyclopentane dimer (ID 42), where these discrepancies are particularly prominent. These systems offer cost-effective benchmarks to guide future developments in DMC, CCSD(T) as well as the wider electronic structure theory community.</description>

      <title>EDA-Q: Electronic Design Automation for Superconducting Quantum Chip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15386v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electronic Design Automation (EDA) plays a crucial role in classical chip design and significantly influences the development of quantum chip design. However, traditional EDA tools cannot be directly applied to quantum chip design due to vast differences compared to the classical realm. Several EDA products tailored for quantum chip design currently exist, yet they only cover partial stages of the quantum chip design process instead of offering a fully comprehensive solution. Additionally, they often encounter issues such as limited automation, steep learning curves, challenges in integrating with actual fabrication processes, and difficulties in expanding functionality. To address these issues, we developed a full-stack EDA tool specifically for quantum chip design, called EDA-Q. The design workflow incorporates functionalities present in existing quantum EDA tools while supplementing critical design stages such as device mapping and fabrication process mapping, which users expect. EDA-Q utilizes a unique architecture to achieve exceptional scalability and flexibility. The integrated design mode guarantees algorithm compatibility with different chip components, while employing a specialized interactive processing mode to offer users a straightforward and adaptable command interface. Application examples demonstrate that EDA-Q significantly reduces chip design cycles, enhances automation levels, and decreases the time required for manual intervention. Multiple rounds of testing on the designed chip have validated the effectiveness of EDA-Q in practical applications.</description>

      <title>Critical Unstable Qubits: an Application to $B^0\bar{B}^0$-Meson System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15625v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend our previous work on a novel class of unstable qubits which we have identified recently and called them Critical Unstable Qubits (CUQs). The characteristic property of CUQs is that the energy-level and decay-width vectors, ${\bf E}$ and ${\bf \Gamma}$, are orthogonal to one another, and the key parameter $r = |{\bf \Gamma}|/|2{\bf E}|$ is less than 1. Most remarkably, CUQs exhibit two atypical behaviours: (i) they display coherence-decoherence oscillations in a co-decaying frame of the system described by a unit Bloch vector ${\bf b}$, and (ii) the unit Bloch vector ${\bf b}$ describing a pure CUQ sweeps out unequal areas during equal intervals of time, while rotating about the vector ${\bf E}$. The latter anharmonic phenomenon emerges beyond the usual oscillatory pattern due to the energy-level difference of the two-level quantum system, which governs an ordinary qubit. By making use of a Fourier series decomposition, we define anharmonicity observables that quantify the degree of non-sinusoidal oscillation of a CUQ. We apply the results of our formalism to the $B^0\bar{B}^0$-meson system and derive, for the first time, generic upper limits on these new observables.</description>

      <title>Many-body quantum geometry in time-dependent quantum systems with emergent quantum field theory instantaneously</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18396v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study many-body quantum geometric effects in time-dependent system with emergent quantum integrable field theory instantaneously. We establish a theorem stating that the Berry connection matrix thus all associated geometric quantities of the system can be precisely characterized by excitations up to two particles from the initial quantum integrable system. To illustrate the many-body geometric influence, we analyze an Ising chain subjected to both a small longitudinal field and a slowly rotating transverse field, whose low-energy physics in the scaling limit is instantaneously governed by the quantum $E_8$ integrable field theory. Focusing on the quantum geometric potential (QGP), we show the QGP continuously suppresses the instantaneous energy gaps with decreasing longitudinal field, thereby enhancing many-body Landau-Zener tunneling as evidenced by the Loschmidt echo and its associated spectral entropy. The critical threshold for the longitudinal field strength is determined,where the spectral entropy linearly increases with system size and exhibits hyperscaling behavior when approaching to the threshold. As the longitudinal field passes the threshold and decreases toward zero, the QGP continuously leads to vanishing instantaneous energy gaps involving more low-energy excitations, resulting in increasing spectral entropy indicative of many-body Landau-Zener tunneling.Our results unveil telltale quantum geometric signatures in time-dependent many-body systems, elucidating the intricate interplay between quantum geometry and dynamics.</description>
