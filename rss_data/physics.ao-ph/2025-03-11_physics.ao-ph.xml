      <title>On the Importance of Clearsky Model in Short-Term Solar Radiation Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Clearsky models are widely used in solar energy for many applications such as quality control, resource assessment, satellite-base irradiance estimation and forecasting. However, their use in forecasting and nowcasting is associated with a number of challenges. Synchronization errors, reliance on the Clearsky index (ratio of the global horizontal irradiance to its cloud-free counterpart) and high sensitivity of the clearsky model to errors in aerosol optical depth at low solar elevation limit their added value in real-time applications. This paper explores the feasibility of short-term forecasting without relying on a clearsky model. We propose a Clearsky-Free forecasting approach using Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) models. ELM learns daily periodicity and local variability directly from raw Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI) data. It eliminates the need for Clearsky normalization, simplifying the forecasting process and improving scalability. Our approach is a non-linear adaptative statistical method that implicitely learns the irradiance in cloud-free conditions removing the need for an clear-sky model and the related operational issues. Deterministic and probabilistic results are compared to traditional benchmarks, including ARMA with McClear-generated Clearsky data and quantile regression for probabilistic forecasts. ELM matches or outperforms these methods, providing accurate predictions and robust uncertainty quantification. This approach offers a simple, efficient solution for real-time solar forecasting. By overcoming the stationarization process limitations based on usual multiplicative scheme Clearsky models, it provides a flexible and reliable framework for modern energy systems.</description>

      <title>ClimDetect: A Benchmark Dataset for Climate Change Detection and Attribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15993v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Detecting and attributing temperature increases driven by climate change is crucial for understanding global warming and informing adaptation strategies. However, distinguishing human-induced climate signals from natural variability remains challenging for traditional detection and attribution (D&amp;A) methods, which rely on identifying specific "fingerprints" -- spatial patterns expected to emerge from external forcings such as greenhouse gas emissions. Deep learning offers promise in discerning these complex patterns within expansive spatial datasets, yet the lack of standardized protocols has hindered consistent comparisons across studies.
  To address this gap, we introduce ClimDetect, a standardized dataset comprising 1.17M daily climate snapshots paired with target climate change indicator variables. The dataset is curated from both CMIP6 climate model simulations and real-world observation-assimilated reanalysis datasets (ERA5, JRA-3Q, and MERRA-2), and is designed to enhance model accuracy in detecting climate change signals. ClimDetect integrates various input and target variables used in previous research, ensuring comparability and consistency across studies. We also explore the application of vision transformers (ViT) to climate data -- a novel approach that, to our knowledge, has not been attempted before for climate change detection tasks. Our open-access data serve as a benchmark for advancing climate science by enabling end-to-end model development and evaluation. ClimDetect is publicly accessible via Hugging Face dataset repository at: https://huggingface.co/datasets/ClimDetect/ClimDetect.</description>

      <title>Quasiannealed Monte Carlo method for light transport in strongly heterogeneous media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07859v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Random-walk Monte Carlo simulations are widely used to predict the optical properties of complex, disordered materials. In presence of large heterogeneities (e.g., spatially-extended nonscattering regions in a turbid environment), an explicit description of the micro and macrostructures and of the light propagation therein is generally required, in addition to a statistical average over a representative set of microstructures, thereby making simulations in so-called ``quenched'' disorder particularly time-consuming. We explore here the possibility to model light transport in finite-size strongly heterogeneous media without an explicit description of the underlying microstructure but from the knowledge of typical random-walk trajectories in infinite-size media, that take correlations between successive interaction events into account. Simulations may thus be performed for media of any macroscopic shape and size more efficiently. We illustrate this approach, coined ``quasiannealed'', with the case of a two-phase emulsion consisting of transparent spherical droplets dispersed in a turbid medium. Good agreement with predictions from simulations in quenched disorder on the reflectance of finite-thickness slab is found for a large set of microstructure properties and thicknesses with typical errors on the reflectance on the order of a percent.</description>
