      <title>Fourier coefficients and rapid decay in reduced groupoid C*-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Sigma \rightarrow G$ be a twist over a locally compact Hausdorff \'{e}tale groupoid $G$. Given $f$ in the reduced C$^*$-algebra $C_r^*(\Sigma;G)$ with open support $U \subseteq G$ we ask when $f$ lies in the closure of the compactly supported sections on $U$. Suppose $G$ satisfies the rapid decay property with respect to a length function $L$. We give a positive answer to our question in two instances: when $L$ is conditionally negative-definite, and when $L$ is the square-root of a locally negative type function on $G$.</description>

      <title>Strict comparison in reduced group $C^*$-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that for every $n\geq 2$, the reduced group $C^*$-algebras of the countable free groups $C^*_r(\mathbb{F}_n)$ have strict comparison. Our method works in a general setting: for $G$ in a large family of non-amenable groups, including hyperbolic groups, free products, mapping class groups, right-angled Artin groups etc., we have $C^*_r(G)$ have strict comparison. This work also has several applications in the theory of $C^*$-algebras including: resolving Leonel Robert's selflessness problem for $C^*_r(G)$; uniqueness of embeddings of the Jiang-Su algebra $\mathcal{Z}$ up to approximate unitary equivalence into $C^*_r(G)$; full computations of the Cuntz semigroup of $C^*_r(G)$ and future directions in the $C^*$-classification program.</description>

      <title>Universal C*-algebras generated by doubly non-commuting isometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give an explicit injective representation of the universal $\mathrm{C}^\ast$-algebra that is generated by doubly non-commuting isometries. This injectivity allows us to prove that such universal algebras embed naturally into each other and also, when combined with Rieffel's theory of deformation, to show that they are nuclear and to compute their K-theory.</description>

      <title>An Operator Theoretic Approach to Birkhoff's Problem 111</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1946, Garrett Birkhoff proved that the $n\times n$ doubly stochastic matrices comprise the convex hull of the $n\times n$ permutation matrices, which in turn make up the extreme points of this polytope. He proposed his problem 111, which asks whether there exists a topology on infinite matrices for which this applies to the closed convex hull of the $\mathbb{N}\times\mathbb{N}$ permutation matrices. As Isbell showed in 1955, this equality is not achieved in the line-sum norm. In this paper, we use the domain of operator theory, and its many topologies, to improve on his negative result by showing that Birkhoff's problem is not solved in any of these topologies. In Kendall's 1960 paper on this problem, he gave an answer to the affirmative, as well as a topology for which closed convex hull comprises the doubly substochastic matrices. We also show that Kendall's secondary theorem also applies for all the locally convex Hausdorff topologies finer than than Kendall's (namely that of entry-wise convergence) which make the continuous dual of the matrix space no larger than the predual of the von Neumann algebra containing them. We then show that this is a theoretical upper limit topologies with this closure property. We also discuss the exposed points of this hull for these several topologies. Moreover, we show that, in these topologies, the closed affine hull of these permutation matrices comprise all operators with real-entry matrix coefficients.</description>

      <title>Factoriality of groupoid von Neumann algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04449v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a characterisation of factoriality of the groupoid von Neumann algebra $L(\mathcal{G})$ associated to a discrete measured groupoid $(\mathcal{G},\mu)$. We introduce the notion of groupoids with `infinite conjugacy classes' and show that this property together with ergodicity of the groupoid is equivalent to factoriality of $L(\mathcal{G})$.</description>

      <title>$L^p$-spectral triples and $p$-quantum compact metric spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13735v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we generalize the concept of classical spectral triples by extending the framework from Hilbert spaces to $L^p$-spaces, and from C*-algebras to $L^p$-operator algebras, $p \in [1, \infty)$. Specifically, we construct $L^p$-spectral triples for reduced group $L^p$-operator algebras and for $L^p$ UHF-algebras of infinite tensor product type. Furthermore, inspired by Christensen and Ivan's construction of a Dirac operator on AF C*-algebras, we provide an $L^p$ version of this construction for $L^p$ UHF-algebras. This leads to the construction of a $p$-quantum compact metric space structure on the state space of the $L^p$ UHF-algebra.</description>
