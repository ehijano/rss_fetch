      <title>On spatial decay for coherent states of the Benjamin-Ono equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider solutions to the Benjamin-Ono equation
  $$\partial_t u - H \partial_x^2 u = -\partial_x(u^2)$$
  which are localized in a reference frame moving to the right with constant speed. We show that any such solution that decays at least like $\langle x\rangle^{-1-\epsilon}$ for some $\epsilon &gt; 0$ in a comoving coordinate frame must in fact decay like $\langle x\rangle^{-2}$. In view of the explicit soliton solutions, this decay rate is sharp. Our proof has two main ingredients. The first is microlocal dispersive estimates for the Benjamin-Ono equation in a moving frame, which allow us to prove spatial decay of the solution provided the nonlinearity has sufficient decay. The second is a careful normal form analysis, which allows us to obtain rapid decay of the nonlinearity for a transformed equation assuming only modest decay of the solution. Our arguments are entirely time dependent, and do not require the solution to be an exact traveling wave.</description>

      <title>On the existence of stationary solutions for certain systems of integro-differential equations with the double scale anomalous diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The work deals with establishing the solvability of a system of integro-differential equations in the situation of the double scale anomalous diffusion. Each equation of such system involves the sum of the two negative Laplace operators raised to two distinct fractional powers in the space of three dimensions. The proof of the existence of solutions is based on a fixed point technique. We use the solvability conditions for the non-Fredholm elliptic operators in unbounded domains.</description>

      <title>Classical solutions to a mixed-type PDE with a Keldysh-type degeneracy and accelerating transonic solutions to the Euler-Poisson system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we first prove the existence of classical solutions to a class of Keldysh-type equations. Next, we apply this existence result to prove the structural stability of one-dimensional smooth transonic solutions to the steady Euler-Poisson system.
  Most importantly, the solutions constructed in this paper are classical solutions to the Euler-Poisson system, thus their sonic interfaces are not weak discontinuities in the sense that all the flow variables, such as density, velocity and pressure, are at least $C^1$ across the interfaces.</description>

      <title>Critical mean field equations for equilibrium turbulence with sign-changing prescribed functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(M,g)$ be a compact Riemann surface with unit area. We investigate the mean field equation for equilibrium turbulence: \begin{align} \begin{cases} -\Delta u = \rho_1\left(\frac{h_1e^{u}}{\int_Mh_1e^udv_g}-1\right) - \rho_2\left(\frac{h_2e^{-u}}{\int_Mh_2e^{-u}dv_g}-1\right), \\ \int_Mudv_g=0, \end{cases} \end{align} where $\rho_1=8\pi$ and $\rho_2\in(0,8\pi]$ are parameters, and $h_1, h_2$ are smooth functions on $M$ that are positive somewhere. By employing a refined Brezis-Merle type analysis, we establish sufficient conditions of Ding-Jost-Li-Wang type for the existence of solutions to this equation in critical cases, particularly when $h_1$ and $h_2$ may change signs. Our results extend Zhou's existence theorems (Nonlinear Anal. 69 (2008), no.~8, 2541--2552) for the case $h_1=h_2\equiv 1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article investigates an energy balance model coupled to the primitive equations by a dynamic boundary condition with and without noise on the boundary. It is shown that this system is globally strongly well-posed both in the deterministic setting for arbitrary large data in $W^{2(1-\frac{1}{p}),p}$ for $p \in [2,\infty)$ and in the stochastic setting for arbitrary large data in $H^1$.</description>

      <title>On equivalence of weak and viscosity solutions to nonlocal double phase problems with nonhomogeneous data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work focuses on the nonhomogeneous nonlocal double phase problem \begin{align*}
  L_au(x)=f(x,u,D_s^p u, D_{a,t}^q u) \text{ in } \Omega, \end{align*} where $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^N$ is a bounded domain with Lipschitz boundary, $0&lt;s,t&lt;1&lt;p\leq q&lt;\infty$ with $tq\leq sp$ and the operator $L_a$ is defined as \begin{align*}
  L_a u(x)&amp;=2\operatorname{P.V.}\int_{\mathbb{R}^N}|u(x)-u(y)|^{p-2}(u(x)-u(y))K_{s,p}(x,y)
  &amp;\ \ \ +2\operatorname{P.V.}\int_{\mathbb{R}^N}a(x,y)|u(x)-u(y)|^{q-2}(u(x)-u(y))K_{t,q}(x,y)dy. \end{align*} We establish the equivalence between weak and viscosity solutions under boundedness and continuity assumptions. In addition, the local boundedness of weak solutions in some special cases on $f$ is also obtained using the notion of De Giorgi classes.</description>

      <title>Approximation of the Solutions to Quasilinear Parabolic Problems with Perturbed $VMO_x$ Coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Cauchy-Dirichlet problem for second-order quasilinear non-divergence form operators of parabolic type. The data are Cara\-th\'e\-o\-dory functions, and the principal part is of $VMO_x$-type with respect to the variables $ (x,t).$ Assuming the existence of a strong solution $u_0,$ we apply the Implicit Function Theorem in a small domain of this solution to show that small bounded perturbations of the data, locally in time, lead to small perturbations of the solution $u_0$. Additionally, we apply the Newton Iteration Procedure to construct an approximating sequence converging to the solution $u_0$ in the corresponding Sobolev space.</description>

      <title>Remarks on elliptic equations degenerating on lower dimensional manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper continues the analysis started in [Cora-Fioravanti-Vita-25,Fioravanti-24] on the local regularity theory for elliptic equations having coefficients which are degenerate or singular on some lower dimensional manifold. The model operator is given by $L_au(z)=\mathrm{div}(|y|^a\nabla u)(z)$, where $z=(x,y)\in\mathbb R^{d-n}\times\mathbb R^n$, $2\leq n\leq d$ are two integers and $a\in\mathbb R$. The weight term is degenerate/singular on the (possibly very) thin characteristic manifold $\Sigma_0=\{|y|=0\}$ of dimension $0\leq d-n\leq d-2$. Whenever $a+n&gt;0$, we prove smoothness of the axially symmetric $L_a$-harmonic functions. In the mid-range $a+n\in(0,2)$, we deal with regularity estimates for solutions with inhomogeneous conormal boundary conditions prescribed at $\Sigma_0$, and we establish the connection with fractional Laplacians on very thin flat manifolds via Dirichlet-to-Neumann maps, as a higher codimensional analogue of the extension theory developed by Caffarelli and Silvestre. Finally, whenever $a+n&lt;2$ we complement the study in [Fioravanti-24], providing some regularity estimates for solutions having a homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition prescribed at $\Sigma_0$ by a boundary Harnack type principle.</description>

      <title>Bochner-Riesz commutators for Grushin Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the boundedness of Bochner-Riesz commutator $$[b, S^{\alpha}(\mathcal{L})](f) = b S^{\alpha}(\mathcal{L})(f) - S^{\alpha}(\mathcal{L})(bf)$$ of a $BMO^{\varrho}(\mathbb{R}^d)$ function $b$ and the Bochner-Riesz operator $S^{\alpha}(\mathcal{L})$ associated to the Grushin operator $\mathcal{L}$ on $\mathbb{R}^d$ with $d:= d_1 +d_2$. We prove that for $1\leq p \leq \min \{2d_1/(d_1 +2), 2(d_2 +1)/(d_2+3)\}$ and $\alpha &gt; d(1/p - 1/2) - 1/2$, if $b \in BMO^{\varrho}(\mathbb{R}^d)$, then $[b, S^{\alpha}(\mathcal{L})]$ is bounded on $L^q(\mathbb{R}^d)$ whenever $p &lt; q &lt; p'$. Moreover, if $b \in CMO^{\varrho}(\mathbb{R}^d)$, then we show that $[b, S^{\alpha}(\mathcal{L})]$ is a compact operator on $L^q(\mathbb{R}^d)$ in the same range.</description>

      <title>Sampling and equidistribution theorems for elliptic second order operators, lifting of eigenvalues, and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider elliptic second order partial differential operators with Lipschitz continuous leading order coefficients on finite cubes and the whole Euclidean space. We prove quantitative sampling and equidistribution theorems for eigenfunctions. The estimates are scale-free, in the sense that for a sequence of growing cubes we obtain uniform estimates. These results are applied to prove lifting of eigenvalues as well as the infimum of the essential spectrum, and an uncertainty relation (aka spectral inequality) for short energy interval spectral projectors. Several application including random operators are discussed. In the proof we have to overcome several challenges posed by the variable coefficients of the leading term.</description>

      <title>Characterizations and properties of solutions to parabolic problems of linear growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider notions of weak solutions to a general class of parabolic problems of linear growth, formulated independently of time regularity. Equivalence with variational solutions is established using a stability result for weak solutions. A key tool in our arguments is approximation of parabolic BV functions using time mollification and Sobolev approximations. We also prove a comparison principle and a local boundedness result for solutions. When the time derivative of the solution is in $L^2$ our definitions are equivalent with the definition based on the Anzellotti pairing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the regularity of minimizers of a two-phase energy functional in periodic media. Our main result is a large scale Lipschitz estimate. We also establish improvement-of-flatness for non-degenerate minimizers, which is a key ingredient in the proof of the Lipschitz estimate. As a consequence, we obtain a Liouville property for entire non-degenerate minimizers.</description>

      <title>On the steadiness of symmetric solutions to higher order perturbations of KdV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the traveling structure of symmetric solutions to the Rosenau-Kawahara-RLW equation and the perturbed R-KdV-RLW equation. Both equations are higher order perturbations of the classical KdV equation. For the Rosenau-Kawahara-RLW equation, we prove that classical and weak solutions with a priori symmetry must be traveling solutions. For the more complicated perturbed R-KdV-RLW equation, we classify all symmetric traveling solutions, and prove that there exists no nontrivial symmetric traveling solution of solitary type once dissipation or shoaling perturbations exist. This gives a new perspective for evaluating the suitableness of a model for water waves. In addition, this result illustrates the sharpness of the symmetry principle in [Int. Math. Res. Not. IMRN, 2009; Ehrnstrom, Holden \&amp; Raynaud] for solitary waves.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply the characterization of global hypoellipticity for $G$-invariant operators on homogeneous vector bundles obtained by Cardona and Kowacs [J. Pseudo-Differ. Oper. Appl. 16, 23 (2025)] to obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for an arbitrary system of left-invariant operators on a compact Lie group to be globally hypoelliptic, providing a full proof independent of the bundle structure of that paper. We then prove alternative sufficient conditions for globally hypoellipticity for a large class of particular cases of systems making use of lower bounds for the smallest singular value of complex matrices.</description>

      <title>A Lee-Huang-Yang type expansion for the thermodynamic energy density of a dilute mixture of Bose gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a dilute gas in 3D composed of two species of bosons interacting through positive inter-species and intra-species pairwise potentials. We prove a second order expansion for the energy density in the thermodynamic limit. For the case of compactly supported, integrable potentials, we derive the correct second order of the expansion. If we make the further assumption of having soft potentials, we also derive the correct coefficient of the second order and the resulting formula is coherent with the physics literature. If we let the density and scattering length of one of the species go to zero, we obtain the Lee-Huang-Yang formula for one species of bosons. The paper also contains a proof of BEC for a mixture of bosons in a box with length scale larger than the Gross-Pitaevskii one.</description>

      <title>Sharp Brezis--Seeger--Van Schaftingen--Yung Formulae for Higher-Order Gradients in Ball Banach Function Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a ball Banach function space on $\mathbb{R}^n$, $k\in\mathbb{N}$, $h\in\mathbb{R}^n$, and $\Delta^k_h$ denote the $k${\rm th} order difference. In this article, under some mild extra assumptions about $X$, the authors prove that, for both parameters $q$ and $\gamma$ in \emph{sharp} ranges which are related to $X$ and for any locally integrable function $f$ on ${\mathbb{R}^n}$ satisfying $|\nabla^k f|\in X$, $$ \sup_{\lambda\in(0,\infty)}\lambda \left\|\left[\int_{\{h\in\mathbb{R}^n:\ |\Delta_h^k f(\cdot)|&gt;\lambda|h|^{k+\frac{\gamma}{q}}\}} \left|h\right|^{\gamma-n}\,dh\right]^\frac{1}{q}\right\|_X \sim \left\|\,\left|\nabla^k f\right|\,\right\|_{X} $$ with the positive equivalence constants independent of $f$. As applications, the authors establish the Brezis--Seeger--Van Schaftingen--Yung (for short, BSVY) characterization of higher-order homogeneous ball Banach Sobolev spaces and higher-order fractional Gagliardo--Nirenberg and Sobolev type inequalities in critical cases. All these results are of quite wide generality and can be applied to various specific function spaces; moreover, even when $X:= L^{q}$, these results when $k=1$ coincide with the best known results and when $k\ge 2$ are completely new. The first novelty is
  to establish a sparse characterization of dyadic cubes in level sets related to the higher-order local approximation, which, together with the well-known Whitney inequality in approximation theory, further induces a higher-order weighted variant of the remarkable inequality obtained by A. Cohen, W. Dahmen, I. Daubechies, and R. DeVore; the second novelty is to combine this weighted inequality neatly with a variant higher-order Poincar\'e inequality to establish the desired upper estimate of BSVY formulae in weighted Lebesgue spaces.</description>

      <title>Difference and Wavelet Characterizations of Distances from Functions in Lipschitz Spaces to Their Subspaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\Lambda_s$ denote the Lipschitz space of order $s\in(0,\infty)$ on $\mathbb{R}^n$, which consists of all $f\in\mathfrak{C}\cap L^\infty$ such that, for some constant $L\in(0,\infty)$ and some integer $r\in(s,\infty)$, \begin{equation*} \label{0-1}\Delta_r f(x,y): =\sup_{|h|\leq y} |\Delta_h^r f(x)|\leq L y^s, \ x\in\mathbb{R}^n, \ y \in(0, 1]. \end{equation*} Here (and throughout the article) $\mathfrak{C}$ refers to continuous functions, and $\Delta_h^r$ is the usual $r$-th order difference operator with step $h\in\mathbb{R}^n$. For each $f\in \Lambda_s$ and $\varepsilon\in(0,L)$, let $ S(f,\varepsilon):= \{ (x,y)\in\mathbb{R}^n\times [0,1]: \frac {\Delta_r f(x,y)}{y^s}&gt;\varepsilon\}$, and let $\mu: \mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R}_+^{n+1})\to [0,\infty]$ be a suitably defined nonnegative extended real-valued function on the Borel $\sigma$-algebra of subsets of $\mathbb{R}_+^{n+1}$. Let $\varepsilon(f)$ be the infimum of all $\varepsilon\in(0,\infty)$ such that $\mu(S(f,\varepsilon))&lt;\infty$. The main target of this article is to characterize the distance from $f$ to a subspace $V\cap \Lambda_s$ of $\Lambda_s$ for various function spaces $V$ (including Sobolev, Besov--Triebel--Lizorkin, and Besov--Triebel--Lizorkin-type spaces) in terms of $\varepsilon(f)$, showing that \begin{equation*} \varepsilon(f)\sim \mathrm{dist} (f, V\cap \Lambda_s)_{\Lambda_s}: = \inf_{g\in \Lambda_s\cap V} \|f-g\|_{\Lambda_s}.\end{equation*} Moreover, we present our results in a general framework based on quasi-normed lattices of function sequences $X$ and Daubechies $s$-Lipschitz $X$-based spaces.</description>

      <title>On the Lebesgue Component of Semiclassical Measures for Abelian Quantum Actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a large class of symplectic integer matrices, the action on the torus extends to a symplectic $\mathbb{Z}^r$-action with $r\geq 2$. We apply this to the study of semiclassical measures for joint eigenfunctions of the quantization of the symplectic matrices of the $\mathbb{Z}^r$-action. In the irreducible setting, we prove that the resulting probability measures are convex combinations of the Lebesgue measure with weight $\geq 1/2$ and a zero entropy measure. We also provide a general theorem in the reducible case showing that the Lebesgue components along isotropic and symplectic invariant subtori must have total weight $\geq 1/2$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a damped/driven cubic NLS equation on a torus under the limit when first the amplitude of solutions goes to zero and then the period of the torus goes to infinity. We suggest another proof of the kinetic approximation for the energy spectrum under a subcritical scaling, extending to the exact solutions result obtained in [Dymov, Kuksin, Maiocchi, Vladuts '2023] for quasisolutions which were defined as the second order truncations of decompositions for the solutions in amplitude. The proof does not involve Feynman diagrams, instead relying on a robust inductive analysis of cumulants.</description>

      <title>Low-energy eigenstates in a vanishing magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is dedicated to the spectral analysis of the semiclassical purely magnetic Laplacian on the plane in the situation where the magnetic field $B$ vanishes nondegenerately on an open smooth curve $\Gamma$. We prove the existence of a discrete spectrum for energy windows of the scale $h^{4/3}$ and give complete asymptotics in the semiclassical paramater $h$ for eigenvalues in such windows. Our strategy relies on the microlocalization of the corresponding eigenfunctions close to the zero locus $\Gamma$ and on the implementation of a Born-Oppenheimer strategy through the use of operator-valued pseudodifferential calculus and superadiatic projectors. This allows us to reduce our spectral analysis to that of effective semiclassical pseudodifferential operators in dimension 1 and apply the well-known semiclassical techniques \`a la Helffer-Sj\"ostrand.</description>

      <title>Boundedness and decay of waves on spatially flat decelerated FLRW spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the linear wave equation on a class of spatially homogeneous and isotropic Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) spacetimes in the decelerated regime with spatial topology $\mathbb{R}^3$. Employing twisted $t$-weighted multiplier vector fields, we establish uniform energy bounds and derive integrated local energy decay estimates across the entire range of the decelerated expansion regime. Furthermore, we obtain a hierarchy of $r^p$-weighted energy estimates \`a la the Dafermos-Rodnianski $r^p$-method, which leads to energy decay estimates. As a consequence, we demonstrate pointwise decay estimates for solutions and their derivatives. In the wave zone, this pointwise decay is optimal in the "radiation" and "sub-radiation" cases, and almost optimal around the radiation case.</description>

      <title>On some connections between Kobayashi geometry and pluripotential theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore some connections between Kobayashi geometry and the Dirichlet problem for the complex Monge--Amp\`ere equation. Among the results we obtain through these connections are: $(i)$~a theorem on the continuous extension up to $\partial{D}$ of a proper holomorphic map $F: D\longrightarrow \Omega$ between domains with $\dim_{\mathbb{C}}(D) &lt; \dim_{\mathbb{C}}(\Omega)$, and $(ii)$~a result that establishes the existence of bounded domains with ``nice'' boundary geometry on which H\"older regularity of the solutions to the complex Monge--Amp\`ere equation fails. The first, a result in Kobayashi geometry, relies upon an auxiliary construction that involves solving the complex Monge--Amp\`ere equation with H\"older estimates. The second result relies crucially on a bound for the Kobayashi metric.</description>

Abstract: We consider the well-posedness of the initial-boundary value problem for a time-fractional partial differential equation with the fractional order lying in (1,2]. For the case of time-dependent coefficients, it is difficult to give an explicit solution formula by the eigenfunction expansion method. In order to deal with the case of time-varying coefficients, we first show the unique existence and regularity of solution to a system of time-fractional ordinary differential equations. Then the unique existence of the weak solution to the time-fractional partial differential equation and improved regularity are derived by using the Galerkin method.</description>

Abstract: For the evolutionary Stokes problem with dynamic boundary conditions, we show the maximal regularity of weak solutions in time. Due to the characterization of $R$-sectorial operators on Hilbert spaces, the proof reduces to identifying the appropriate functional analytic setting and proving that the corresponding operator is sectorial, i.e., that it generates an analytic semigroup.</description>

      <title>Rotating Rayleigh-Benard convection: Attractors, bifurcations and heat transport via a Galerkin hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14724v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the need for energetically consistent climate models, the Boussinessq-Coriolis (BC) equations are studied with a focus on the averaged vertical heat transport, ie the Nusselt number. A set of formulae are derived by which arbitrary Fourier truncations of the BC model can be explicitly generated, and Criteria are given which precisely guarantee that such truncated models obey energy relations consistent with the PDE. The Howard-Krishnamurti-Coriolis (HKC) hierarchy of such energetically consistent ODE models is then implemented in MATLAB, with code available on GitHub. Several theoretical results are proven to support a numerical analysis. Well-posedness and convergence of the HKC hierarchy toward the BC model are proven, as well as the existence of an attractor for the BC model. Since the rate of convergence is unknown, explicit upper and lower bounds on the attractor dimension are proven so as to provide guidance for the required spatial resolution for an accurate approximation of the Nusselt number. Finally, a series of numerical studies are performed using MATLAB, which investigate the required spatial resolution and indicate the presence of multiple stable values of the Nusselt number, setting the stage for an energetically consistent analysis of convective heat transport.</description>

      <title>Gradient Flows and Riemannian Structure in the Gromov-Wasserstein Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11800v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Wasserstein space of probability measures is known for its intricate Riemannian structure, which underpins the Wasserstein geometry and enables gradient flow algorithms. However, the Wasserstein geometry may not be suitable for certain tasks or data modalities. Motivated by scenarios where the global structure of the data needs to be preserved, this work initiates the study of gradient flows and Riemannian structure in the Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) geometry, which is particularly suited for such purposes. We focus on the inner product GW (IGW) distance between distributions on $\mathbb{R}^d$. Given a functional $\mathsf{F}:\mathcal{P}_2(\mathbb{R}^d)\to\mathbb{R}$ to optimize, we present an implicit IGW minimizing movement scheme that generates a sequence of distributions $\{\rho_i\}_{i=0}^n$, which are close in IGW and aligned in the 2-Wasserstein sense. Taking the time step to zero, we prove that the discrete solution converges to an IGW generalized minimizing movement (GMM) $(\rho_t)_t$ that follows the continuity equation with a velocity field $v_t\in L^2(\rho_t;\mathbb{R}^d)$, specified by a global transformation of the Wasserstein gradient of $\mathsf{F}$. The transformation is given by a mobility operator that modifies the Wasserstein gradient to encode not only local information, but also global structure. Our gradient flow analysis leads us to identify the Riemannian structure that gives rise to the intrinsic IGW geometry, using which we establish a Benamou-Brenier-like formula for IGW. We conclude with a formal derivation, akin to the Otto calculus, of the IGW gradient as the inverse mobility acting on the Wasserstein gradient. Numerical experiments validating our theory and demonstrating the global nature of IGW interpolations are provided.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16549v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $N\ge 3$. We are concerned with a Cauchy problem of the semilinear heat equation \[ \begin{cases} \partial_tu-\Delta u=f(u), &amp; x\in\mathbb{R}^N,\ t&gt;0,\\ u(x,0)=u_0(x), &amp; x\in\mathbb{R}^N, \end{cases} \] where $f(0)=0$, $f$ is nonnegative, increasing and convex, $\log f(u)$ is convex for large $u&gt;0$ and some additional assumptions are assumed. We establish a positive radial singular stationary solution $u^*$ such that $u^*(x)\to\infty$ as $|x|\to 0$. Then, we prove the following: The problem has a nonnegative global-in-time solution if $0\le u_0\le u^*$ and $u_0\not\equiv u^*$, while the problem has no nonnegative local-in-time solutions $u$ such that $u\ge u^*$ if $u_0\ge u^*$ and $u_0\not\equiv u^*$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01322v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish two complementary results about the regularity of the solution of the periodic initial value problem for the linear Benjamin-Ono equation. We first give a new simple proof of the statement that, for a dense countable set of the time variable, the solution is a finite linear combination of copies of the initial condition and of its Hilbert transform. In particular, this implies that discontinuities in the initial condition are propagated in the solution as logarithmic cusps. We then show that, if the initial condition is of bounded variation (and even if it is not continuous), for almost every time the graph of the solution in space is continuous but fractal, with upper Minkowski dimension equal to 3/2. In order to illustrate this striking dichotomy, in the final section we include accurate numerical evaluations of the solution profile, as well as estimates of its box-counting dimension for two canonical choices of irrational time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17136v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the global stability of large solutions to the compressible isentropic Navier-Stokes equations in a three-dimensional (3D) bounded domain with Navier-slip boundary conditions. It is shown that the strong solutions converge to an equilibrium state exponentially in the $L^2$-norm provided the density is essentially uniform-in-time bounded from above. Moreover, we obtain that the density converges to its equilibrium state exponentially in the $L^\infty$-norm if additionally the initial density is bounded away from zero. Furthermore, we derive that the vacuum states will not vanish for any time provided vacuum appears (even at a point) initially. This is the first result concerning the global stability for large strong solutions of compressible Navier-Stokes equations with vacuum in 3D general bounded domains.</description>

Abstract: We study the Cauchy problem for the reduced Maxwell-Bloch equations with initial data for the electric field in weighted Sobolev spaces, assuming that all atoms initially reside in their ground state. Using the d-bar steepest descent method, we derive long-time asymptotic expansions of the solutions, including both the electric field and the components of the Bloch vector, within any fixed cone. In particular, we formulate the inverse scattering transform as a properly posed Riemann-Hilbert problem, avoiding singularities in the scattering data by modifying the time evolution of the reflection coefficient. Under assumptions that allow only soliton generation, the leading-order asymptotics are determined by solitons inside the cone, while soliton-radiation interactions appear in lower-order terms. These results extend the applicability of the nonlinear steepest descent method to integrable systems with singularities in the associated Lax pair.</description>

      <title>Existence of free boundary disks with constant mean curvature in $\mathbb{R}^3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.16323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.16323v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a surface $\Sigma$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$ diffeomorphic to $S^2$, Struwe (Acta Math., 1988) proved that for almost every $H$ below the mean curvature of the smallest sphere enclosing $\Sigma$, there exists a branched immersed disk which has constant mean curvature $H$ and boundary meeting $\Sigma$ orthogonally. We reproduce this result using a different approach and improve it under additional convexity assumptions on $\Sigma$. Specifically, when $\Sigma$ itself is convex and has mean curvature bounded below by $H_0$, we obtain existence for all $H \in (0, H_0)$. Instead of the heat flow used by Struwe, we use a Sacks-Uhlenbeck type perturbation. As in previous joint work with Zhou (arXiv:2012.13379), a key ingredient for extending existence across the measure zero set of $H$'s is a Morse index upper bound.</description>

      <title>Second-order estimates for the $p$-Laplacian in RCD spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09982v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish quantitative second-order Sobolev regularity for functions having a $2$-integrable $p$-Laplacian in bounded RCD spaces, with $p$ in a suitable range. In the finite-dimensional case, we also obtain Lipschitz regularity under the assumption that $p$-Laplacian is sufficiently integrable. Our results cover both $p$-Laplacian eigenfunctions and $p$-harmonic functions having relatively compact level sets.</description>

      <title>Interface motion from Glauber-Kawasaki dynamics of non-gradient type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18364v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the Glauber-Kawasaki dynamics on a $d$-dimensional periodic lattice of size $N$, that is, a stochastic time evolution of particles performing random walks with interaction subject to the exclusion rule (Kawasaki part), in general, of non-gradient type, together with the effect of the creation and annihilation of particles (Glauber part) whose rates are set to favor two levels of particle density, called sparse and dense. We then study the limit of our dynamics under the hydrodynamic space-time scaling, that is, $1/N$ in space and a diffusive scaling $N^2$ for the Kawasaki part and another scaling $K=K(N)$, which diverges slower, for the Glauber part in time. In the limit as $N\to\infty$, we show that the particles autonomously make phase separation into sparse or dense phases at the microscopic level, and an interface separating two regions is formed at the macroscopic level and evolves under an anisotropic curvature flow.
  In the present article, we show that the particle density at the macroscopic level is well approximated by a solution of a reaction-diffusion equation with a nonlinear diffusion term of divergence form and a large reaction term. Furthermore, by applying the results of Funaki, Gu and Wang [arXiv:2404.12234] for the convergence rate of the diffusion matrix approximated by local functions, we obtain a quantitative hydrodynamic limit as well as the upper bound for the allowed diverging speed of $K=K(N)$.
  The above result for the derivation of the interface motion is proved by combining our result with that in a companion paper by Funaki and Park [arXiv:2403.01732], in which we analyzed the asymptotic behavior of the solution of the reaction-diffusion equation obtained in the present article and derived an anisotropic curvature flow in the situation where the macroscopic reaction term determined from the Glauber part is bistable and balanced.</description>

      <title>The high resolution sampling methods for acoustic sources from multi-frequency far field patterns at sparse observation directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10829v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work is dedicated to novel uniqueness results and high resolution sampling methods for source support from multi-frequency sparse far field patterns. With a single pair of observation directions $\pm\hat{x}$, we prove that the lines $\{z\in\mathbb R^2|\, \hat{x}\cdot z = \hat{x}\cdot y, \,y\in A_{\hat{x}}\}$ can be determined by multi-frequency far field patterns at the directions $\pm\hat{x}$, where $A_{\hat{x}}$ denotes a set containing the corners of the boundary and points whose normal vector to the boundary is parallel to $\hat{x}$. Furthermore, if the source support is composed of polygons and annuluses, then we prove that the support can be determined by multi-frequency far field patterns at sparse directions. Precisely, the lowest number of the observation directions is given in terms of the number of the corners and the annuluses. Inspired by the uniqueness arguments, we introduce two novel indicators to determine the source support. Numerical examples in two dimensions are presented to show the validity and robustness of the two indicators for reconstructing the boundaries of the source support with a high resolution. The second indicator also shows its powerful ability to determine the unknown source function.</description>

      <title>Interacting Twisted Bilayer Graphene with Systematic Modeling of Structural Relaxation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03479v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) has drawn significant interest due to recent experiments which show that TBG can exhibit strongly correlated behavior such as the superconducting and correlated insulator phases. Much of the theoretical work on TBG has been based on analysis of the Bistritzer-MacDonald model which includes a phenomenological parameter to account for lattice relaxation. In this work, we use a newly developed continuum model which systematically accounts for the effects of structural relaxation. In particular, we model structural relaxation by coupling linear elasticity to a stacking energy that penalizes disregistry. We compare the impact of the two relaxation models on the corresponding many-body model by defining an interacting model projected to the flat bands. We perform tests at charge neutrality at both the Hartree-Fock and Coupled Cluster Singles and Doubles (CCSD) level of theory and find the systematic relaxation model gives quantitative differences from the simplified relaxation model.</description>

      <title>Architecture independent generalization bounds for overparametrized deep ReLU networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05695v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that overparametrized neural networks are able to generalize with a test error that is independent of the level of overparametrization, and independent of the Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimension. We prove explicit bounds that only depend on the metric geometry of the test and training sets, on the regularity properties of the activation function, and on the operator norms of the weights and norms of biases. For overparametrized deep ReLU networks with a training sample size bounded by the input space dimension, we explicitly construct zero loss minimizers without use of gradient descent, and prove that the generalization error is independent of the network architecture.</description>
