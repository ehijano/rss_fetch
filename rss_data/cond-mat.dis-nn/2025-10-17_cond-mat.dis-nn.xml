      <title>DC Current Generation in the Driven Damped Haldane Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay between topological phenomena and nonequilibrium dynamics in open quantum systems represents a rapidly developing frontier in condensed matter physics. In this work, we investigate the nonequilibrium steady states of the Haldane model driven by a continuous-wave laser and coupled to a thermal reservoir. Dissipation is modeled within the Lindblad formalism adapted for quadratic fermionic systems, enabling us to study both the relaxation dynamics and the emergence of quasi-steady states. While conventional topological invariants and the bulk-boundary correspondence do not directly apply to such nonequilibrium settings, we introduce an occupation-weighted Chern number that captures the residual topological character of this quasi-steady state. We additionally examine the charge transport of this system under simultaneous driving and damping, showing that inversion symmetry breaking via a staggered sublattice potential generates a finite DC current. The magnitude and direction of this DC current are sensitive to the driving strength, highlighting the intricate interplay between topology, symmetry, and dissipation in open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Evidence of de Almeida--Thouless line below six dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the critical behavior of the Ising spin glass in five spatial dimensions through large-scale Monte Carlo simulations and finite-size scaling analysis. Numerical evidence for a phase transition is found both with and without an externally applied magnetic field. The critical exponents are computed in both cases. We compute with a 10\% accuracy the lower critical dimension at zero magnetic field, finding a result consistent with estimates obtained with entirely different methods, by combining our estimates of critical exponents in five dimensions with previous results for other spatial dimensions. When the results in a magnetic field are compared with previous results in six spatial dimensions, qualitative differences emerge in the scaling behavior of the correlation functions at zero external momentum. This anomalous scaling does not extend to other wavevectors. We do not find indications of a quasi first-order phase transition in a magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Subdimensional Disorder and Logarithmic Defect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study quenched disorder localized on a $p$-dimensional subspacetime in a $d$-dimensional conformal field theory. Motivated by the logarithmic behavior often associated with disorder, we introduce a defect setup in which bulk local operators transform in ordinary conformal representations, while defect local operators assemble into logarithmic multiplets. We refer to such objects as logarithmic defects and investigate their model-independent properties dictated solely by conformal symmetry and its representation theory, including correlation functions, logarithmic defect operator expansions, and conformal blocks. As a concrete example, we analyze the free scalar theory with a generalized pinning defect subject to random coupling fluctuations, and we identify a half-line of fixed points describing the corresponding logarithmic conformal defects. Along the way, we propose a candidate monotone governing defect renormalization group flows induced by subdimensional disorder. We comment on various generalizations and the broader program of bootstrapping logarithmic defects.</description>

      <title>Universal energy-space localization and stable quantum phases against time-dependent perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stability against perturbation is a highly nontrivial property of quantum systems and is often a requirement to define new phases. In most systems where stability can be rigorously established, only static perturbations are considered; whether a system is stable against generic time-dependent perturbations remains largely elusive. In this work, we identify a universal phenomenon in $q$-local Hamiltonians called energy-space localization and prove that it can survive under generic time-dependent perturbations, where the evolving state is exponentially localized in an energy window of the instantaneous spectrum. The property holds ubiquitously, and the leakage bounds remain invariant under arbitrarily monotonic rescaling of evolution time. This flexibility enables the energy-space localization to be a powerful tool in proving the stability of systems. For spin glass models where the configuration spaces are separated by large energy barriers, the localization in energy space can induce a true localization in the configuration space and robustly break ergodicity. We then demonstrate the applications of our results in several systems with such barriers. For certain LDPC codes, we show that the evolving state is localized near the original codeword for an exponentially long time even under generic time-dependent perturbations. We also extend the stability of LDPC codes against static $q$-local perturbations to quasi-$q$-local. In addition, we show that for some classical hard optimization problems with clustered solution space, the stability becomes an obstacle for quantum Hamiltonian-based algorithms to drive the system out of local minima. Our work provides a new lens for analyzing the non-equilibrium dynamics of generic quantum systems, and versatile mathematical tools for stability proving and quantum algorithm design.</description>

      <title>The Tracy-Widom distribution at large Dyson index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Tracy-Widom (TW) distribution $f_\beta(a)$ in the limit of large Dyson index $\beta \to +\infty$. This distribution describes the fluctuations of the rescaled largest eigenvalue $a_1$ of the Gaussian (alias Hermite) ensemble (G$\beta$E) of (infinitely) large random matrices. We show that, at large $\beta$, its probability density function takes the large deviation form $f_\beta(a) \sim e^{-\beta \Phi(a)}$. While the typical deviation of $a_1$ around its mean is Gaussian of variance $O(1/\beta)$, this large deviation form describes the probability of rare events with deviation $O(1)$, and governs the behavior of the higher cumulants. We obtain the rate function $\Phi(a)$ as a solution of a Painlev\'{e} II equation. We derive explicit formula for its large argument behavior, and for the lowest cumulants, up to order 4. We compute $\Phi(a)$ numerically for all $a$ and compare with exact numerical computations of the TW distribution at finite $\beta$. These results are obtained by applying saddle-point approximations to an associated problem of energy levels $E=-a$, for a random quantum Hamiltonian defined by the stochastic Airy operator (SAO). We employ two complementary approaches: (i) we use the optimal fluctuation method to find the most likely realization of the noise in the SAO, conditioned on its ground-state energy being $E$ (ii) we apply the weak-noise theory to the representation of the TW distribution in terms of a Ricatti diffusion process associated to the SAO. We extend our results to the full Airy point process $a_1&gt;a_2&gt;\dots$ which describes all edge eigenvalues of the G$\beta$E, and correspond to (minus) the higher energy levels of the SAO, obtaining large deviation forms for the marginal distribution of $a_i$, the joint distributions, and the gap distributions.</description>

      <title>The fate of disorder in twisted bilayer graphene near the magic angle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In disordered lattices, itinerant electrons typically undergo Anderson localization due to random phase interference, which suppresses their motion. By contrast, in flat-band systems where electrons are intrinsically localized owing to their vanishing group velocity, the role of disorder remains elusive. Twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) at the magic angle $\sim 1.1^\circ$ provides a representative flat-band platform to investigate this problem. Here, we perform an atomistic tight-binding quantum transport calculation on the interplay between disorder and flat-bands in TBG devices. This non-phenomenological approach provides direct evidence that moderate disorder enhances conductance, whereas stronger disorder restores localization, revealing a disorder-driven delocalization-to-localization transport behavior. The underlying physical mechanism is understood by an effective inter-moir{\'e} tunneling strength via spectral flow analysis of a disordered TBG cylinder. Moreover, by comparing magic-angle and large-angle TBG, we demonstrate qualitatively distinct disorder responses tied to the presence of flat-bands. Our quantitative results highlight the unconventional role of disorder in flat-band moir{\'e} materials and offer insights into the observation of the fractional quantum anomalous Hall effect in disordered moir{\'e} systems.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Learning to Recognize Quantum Phases of Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Drawing the quantum phase diagram of a many-body system in the parameter space of its Hamiltonian can be seen as a learning problem, which implies labelling the corresponding ground states according to some classification criterium that defines the phases. In this work we adopt unsupervised learning, where the algorithm has no access to any priorly labeled states, as a tool for determining quantum phase diagrams of many-body systems. The algorithm directly works with quantum states: given the ground-state configurations for different values of the Hamiltonian parameters, the process uncovers the most significant way of grouping them based on a similarity criterion that refers to the fidelity between quantum states, that can be easily estimated, even experimentally. We benchmark our method with two specific spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ chains, with states determined via tensor network techniques. We find that unsupervised learning algorithms based on spectral clustering, combined with ``silhouette'' and ``elbow'' methods for determining the optimal number of phases, can accurately reproduce the phase diagrams. Our results show how unsupervised learning can autonomously recognize and possibly unveil novel phases of quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Disorder-assisted Spin-Filtering at Metal/Ferromagnet Interfaces: An Alternative Route to Anisotropic Magnetoresistance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a minimal interface-scattering mechanism that produces a sizable anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) in metal/ferromagnet bilayers (e.g., Pt/YIG) without invoking bulk spin or orbital Hall currents. In a $\delta$-layer model with interfacial exchange and Rashba spin-orbit coupling, charge transfer at a high-quality interface creates a spin-selective phase condition (interfacial spin filtering) that suppresses backscattering for one spin projection while enhancing momentum relaxation for the other. The resulting resistance anisotropy peaks at an optimal metal thickness of a few nanometers, quantitatively reproducing the thickness and angular dependences typically attributed to spin Hall magnetoresistance (SMR), as well as its characteristic magnitude. Remarkably, the maximal AMR scales linearly with the smaller of the two coupling strengths - exchange or spin-orbit, highlighting a mechanism fundamentally distinct from SMR. Our scattering formulation maps onto Boltzmann boundary conditions and predicts other clear discriminants from SMR, including strong sensitivity to interfacial charge transfer and disorder.</description>

      <title>Ruelle-Pollicott Decay of Out-of-Time-Order Correlators in Many-Body Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC) quantifies information scrambling in quantum systems and serves as a key diagnostic of quantum chaos. In one-body systems with a classical counterpart, the relaxation of the OTOC is governed by Ruelle-Pollicott resonances. For many-body systems lacking a semiclassical limit, recent studies have identified an analogous role played by the Liouvillian spectrum of weakly open extensions of the dynamics, where the slowest decay rate -- the Liouvillian gap -- encodes relaxation. Here we study the kicked Ising spin chain and show that the long-time exponential decay of the OTOC in the isolated system occurs at a rate equal to twice this intrinsic gap. This correspondence persists even in crossover regimes between integrability and chaos, demonstrating that the Liouvillian spectrum provides a unified framework for understanding relaxation and irreversibility in closed many-body quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Tunable resonant s-p mixing of excitons in van der Waals heterostructures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11927v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Excitonic states of tightly-bound electron-hole pairs dominate the optical response in a growing class of two-dimensional (2D) materials and their van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures. In transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) a useful guidance for the excitonic spectrum is the analogy with the states in the 2D hydrogen atom. From our symmetry analysis and solving the Bethe-Salpeter equations we find a much richer picture for excitons and predict their tunable resonant s-p mixing. The resonance is attained when the subband splitting matches the energy difference between the 1s and 2p+ (or 2p-) excitons, resulting in the anticrossing of the spectral lines in the absorption as a function of the subband splitting. By focusing on TMDs modified by magnetic proximity, and gated 3R-stacked bilayer TMD, we corroborate the feasibility of such tunable spin splitting. The resulting tunable and bright s-p excitons provide unexplored opportunities for their manipulation and enable optical detection of Rashba or interlayer coupling in vdW heterostructures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12188v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Information processing in the brain is coordinated by the dynamic activity of neurons and neural populations at a range of spatiotemporal scales. These dynamics, captured in the form of electrophysiological recordings and neuroimaging, show evidence of time-irreversibility and broken detailed balance suggesting that the brain operates in a nonequilibrium stationary state. Furthermore, the level of nonequilibrium, measured by entropy production or irreversibility appears to be a crucial signature of cognitive complexity and consciousness. The subsequent study of neural dynamics from the perspective of nonequilibrium statistical physics is an emergent field that challenges the assumptions of symmetry and maximum-entropy that are common in traditional models. In this review, we discuss the plethora of exciting results emerging at the interface of nonequilibrium dynamics and neuroscience. We begin with an introduction to the mathematical paradigms necessary to understand nonequilibrium dynamics in both continuous and discrete state-spaces. Next, we review both model-free and model-based approaches to analysing nonequilibrium dynamics in both continuous-state recordings and neural spike-trains, as well as the results of such analyses. We briefly consider the topic of nonequilibrium computation in neural systems, before concluding with a discussion and outlook on the field.</description>

      <title>Superuniversal Statistics with Topological Origins for non-Hermitian Scattering Singularities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14373v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vortex singularities in speckle patterns formed from random superpositions of waves are an inevitable consequence of destructive interference and are consequently generic and ubiquitous. Singularities are topologically stable, meaning they persist under small perturbations and can only be removed via pairwise annihilation. They have applications including sensing, imaging and energy transfer in multiple fields such as optics, acoustics, and elastic or fluid waves. We generalize the concept of speckle patterns to arbitrary parameter spaces and any complex scalar function that describes wave phenomena involving complicated scattering. In scattering systems specifically, we are often concerned with singularities associated with complex zeros of various functions of the scattering matrix S, such as Coherent Perfect Absorption, Reflectionless Scattering Modes, Transmissionless Scattering Modes, and Exceptional Points. Experimentally, we find that all singularities share a universal statistical property: any quantity that diverges as a simple pole at a singularity has a probability distribution function with a -3 power law tail. The tail of the distribution provides an estimate for the likelihood of finding a given singularity in a generic system. We use these universal statistical results to determine that homogeneous system loss is the most important parameter determining singularity density in a given parameter space of an absorptive scattering system. Finally, we discuss events where distinct singularities coincide in parameter space, which result in higher order singularities that are not topologically protected, and we do not find universal statistical properties for them. We support our empirical results from microwave experiments with Random Matrix Theory simulations and conclude that the statistical results presented hold for all generic non-Hermitian scattering systems.</description>

      <title>A One-Particle Density Matrix Framework for Mode-Shell Correspondence: Characterizing Topology in Amorphous Higher-Order Topological Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03632v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a framework for characterizing higher-order topological phases directly from the one-particle density matrix, without any reference to an underlying Hamiltonian. Our approach extends the mode-shell correspondence, originally formulated for single-particle Hamiltonians, to Gaussian states subject to chiral constraints. In this correspondence, the mode index counts topological boundary modes, while the shell index quantifies the bulk topology in a region surrounding the modes, providing a bulk-boundary diagnostic. In one-dimensional topological insulators, the shell index reduces to the local chiral marker, recovering the winding number in the translation-invariant limit. We apply the mode-shell correspondence to a $C_4$-symmetric higher-order topological insulator with a chiral constraint and show that a fractional shell index implies that the higher-order phase is intrinsic. The one-particle density matrix is formulated in real space, so the mode-shell correspondence also applies to models without translation invariance. By introducing structural disorder into the $C_4$-symmetric higher-order insulator, we show that the mode-shell correspondence remains a meaningful diagnostic in amorphous structures. The mode-shell correspondence generalizes to interacting states with a gapped bulk spectrum in the one-particle density matrix, providing a practical and diverse route to characterize higher-order topology from the quantum state itself.</description>

Abstract: The two-star random graph is the simplest exponential random graph model with nontrivial interactions between the graph edges. We propose a set of auxiliary variables that control the thermodynamic limit where the number of vertices N tends to infinity. Such `master variables' are usually highly desirable in treatments of `large N' statistical field theory problems. For the dense regime when a finite fraction of all possible edges are filled, this construction recovers the mean-field solution of Park and Newman, but with an explicit control over the 1/N corrections. We use this advantage to compute the first subleading correction to the Park-Newman result, which encodes the finite, nonextensive contribution to the free energy. For the sparse regime with a finite mean degree, we obtain a very compact derivation of the Annibale-Courtney solution, originally developed with the use of functional integrals, which is comfortably bypassed in our treatment.</description>
