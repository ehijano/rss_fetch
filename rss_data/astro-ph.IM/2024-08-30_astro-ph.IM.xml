      <title>IAU CPS Tools to Address Satellite Constellation Interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The IAU Centre for the Protection of the Dark and Quiet Sky from Satellite Constellation Interference (CPS), established in early 2022 and co-hosted by NSF's NOIRLab and the SKA Observatory, was created to unify efforts to work towards mitigating some of the effects of satellite constellations on astronomy. SatHub, one of the four sub-groups of CPS, focuses on software and related tools to aid observers and industry partners in addressing some of the issues caused by commercial satellite constellations.</description>

      <title>$\texttt{MEDEA}$: A New Model for Emulating Radio Antenna Beam Patterns for 21-cm Cosmology and Antenna Design Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 21-cm experimental cosmology, accurate characterization of a radio telescope's antenna beam response is essential to measure the 21-cm signal. Computational electromagnetic (CEM) simulations estimate the antenna beam pattern and frequency response by subjecting the EM model to different dependencies, or beam hyper-parameters, such as soil dielectric constant or orientation with the environment. However, it is computationally expensive to search all possible parameter spaces to optimize the antenna design or accurately represent the beam to the level required for use as a systematic model in 21-cm cosmology. We therefore present $\texttt{MEDEA}$, an emulator which rapidly and accurately generates farfield radiation patterns over a large hyper-parameter space. $\texttt{MEDEA}$ takes a subset of beams simulated by CEM software, spatially decomposes them into coefficients in a complete, linear basis, and then interpolates them to form new beams at arbitrary hyper-parameters. We test $\texttt{MEDEA}$ on an analytical dipole and two numerical beams motivated by upcoming lunar lander missions, and then employ $\texttt{MEDEA}$ as a model to fit mock radio spectrometer data to extract covariances on the input beam hyper-parameters. We find that the interpolated beams have RMS relative errors of at most $10^{-2}$ using 20 input beams or less, and that fits to mock data are able to recover the input beam hyper-parameters when the model and mock derive from the same set of beams. When a systematic bias is introduced into the mock data, extracted beam hyper-parameters exhibit bias, as expected. We propose several future extensions to $\texttt{MEDEA}$ to potentially account for such bias.</description>

      <title>Six Maxims of Statistical Acumen for Astronomical Data Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The production of complex astronomical data is accelerating, especially with newer telescopes producing ever more large-scale surveys. The increased quantity, complexity, and variety of astronomical data demand a parallel increase in skill and sophistication in developing, deciding, and deploying statistical methods. Understanding limitations and appreciating nuances in statistical and machine learning methods and the reasoning behind them is essential for improving data-analytic proficiency and acumen. Aiming to facilitate such improvement in astronomy, we delineate cautionary tales in statistics via six maxims, with examples drawn from the astronomical literature. Inspired by the significant quality improvement in business and manufacturing processes by the routine adoption of Six Sigma, we hope the routine reflection on these Six Maxims will improve the quality of both data analysis and scientific findings in astronomy.</description>

      <title>The MICADO first light imager for the ELT: overview and current Status</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: MICADO is a first light instrument for the Extremely Large Telescope (ELT), set to start operating later this decade. It will provide diffraction limited imaging, astrometry, high contrast imaging, and long slit spectroscopy at near-infrared wavelengths. During the initial phase operations, adaptive optics (AO) correction will be provided by its own natural guide star wavefront sensor. In its final configuration, that AO system will be retained and complemented by the laser guide star multi-conjugate adaptive optics module MORFEO (formerly known as MAORY). Among many other things, MICADO will study exoplanets, distant galaxies and stars, and investigate black holes, such as Sagittarius A* at the centre of the Milky Way. After their final design phase, most components of MICADO have moved on to the manufacturing and assembly phase. Here we summarize the final design of the instrument and provide an overview about its current manufacturing status and the timeline. Some lessons learned from the final design review process will be presented in order to help future instrumentation projects to cope with the challenges arising from the substantial differences between projects for 8-10m class telescopes (e.g. ESO-VLT) and the next generation Extremely Large Telescopes (e.g. ESO-ELT). Finally, the expected performance will be discussed in the context of the current landscape of astronomical observatories and instruments. For instance, MICADO will have similar sensitivity as the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), but with six times the spatial resolution.</description>

      <title>Investigations on assembly and coverage for modular focal planes of multiplexed telescopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiplexed surveys have the ambition to grow larger for the next generation of focal plane instruments. Future projects such as Spec-S5, MUST, and WST have an ever-growing need for multi-object spectroscopy (13,000 - 20,000 simultaneous objects) which demands further investigations of novel focal plane instrumentation. In this paper, we present a rigorous study of focal plane coverage optimization and assembly of triangular modules of alpha-beta fiber positioners with a 6.2 mm pitch. The main focus here is to examine different module arrangements namely, framed, semi-frameless, and fullyframeless assemblies. Framed and semi-frameless describe here the usage of a manufactured focal plate to hold the modules together and provide the correct focus and tilt to the fibers. Work on automatically generating such focal plates for project adaptability and ease of manufacturing will also be presented. On the other hand, the frameless approach proposes a connection method freed from the need of a focal plate. The following paper will also present their capabilities to meet the requirements for focal plane assembly such as focus, tilt and coverage.</description>

      <title>FRAM Next Generation at the Pierre Auger Observatory: cloud monitoring in the age of CMOS cameras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The visibility of stars is often used for cloud detection using all-sky cameras, which have however only a limited reach and resolution near the horizon due to the lack of detectable stars. At the Pierre Auger Observatory, it is also used by the current generation of FRAM robotic telescopes, but -- due to their limited field of view -- only for a small number of selected showers. Thanks to the recent development in astronomical CMOS cameras, we are able to propose a new type of device, specifically tailored to the field of view of the fluorescence detectors (FD) of the Pierre Auger Observatory. The sub-second readout times available with CMOS cameras allows the efficient use of short exposures, and so the field of view of one FD can be covered within half a minute with a resolution and reach sufficient to detect small clouds with a setup that is significantly smaller, simpler and cheaper than the current FRAMs. The FRAM Next Generation (framNG) device will be able not only to detect clouds, but also to assess their optical thickness, provide information on aerosol extinction, sky brightness and possibly even record atmospheric phenomena and astrophysical transients. The main challenge lies in the large data volume produced which necessitates reliable real-time data processing.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking with Supernovae: A Performance Study of the FLASH Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Astrophysical simulations are computation, memory, and thus energy intensive, thereby requiring new hardware advances for progress. Stony Brook University recently expanded its computing cluster "SeaWulf" with an addition of 94 new nodes featuring Intel Sapphire Rapids Xeon Max series CPUs. We present a performance and power efficiency study of this hardware performed with FLASH: a multi-scale, multi-physics, adaptive mesh-based software instrument. We extend this study to compare performance to that of Stony Brook's Ookami testbed which features ARM-based A64FX-700 processors, and SeaWulf's AMD EPYC Milan and Intel Skylake nodes. Our application is a stellar explosion known as a thermonuclear (Type Ia) supernova and for this 3D problem, FLASH includes operators for hydrodynamics, gravity, and nuclear burning, in addition to routines for the material equation of state. We perform a strong-scaling study with a 220 GB problem size to explore both single- and multi-node performance. Our study explores the performance of different MPI mappings and the distribution of processors across nodes. From these tests, we determined the optimal configuration to balance runtime and energy consumption for our application.</description>

      <title>A machine learning approach for computing solar flare locations in X-rays on-board Solar Orbiter/STIX</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Spectrometer/Telescope for Imaging X-rays (STIX) on-board the ESA Solar Orbiter mission retrieves the coordinates of solar flare locations by means of a specific sub-collimator, named the Coarse Flare Locator (CFL). When a solar flare occurs on the Sun, the emitted X-ray radiation casts the shadow of a peculiar "H-shaped" tungsten grid over the CFL X-ray detector. From measurements of the areas of the detector that are illuminated by the X-ray radiation, it is possible to retrieve the $(x,y)$ coordinates of the flare location on the solar disk.
  In this paper, we train a neural network on a dataset of real CFL observations to estimate the coordinates of solar flare locations. Further, we apply a post-training quantization technique specifically tailored to the adopted model architecture. This technique allows all computations to be in integer arithmetic at inference time, making the model compatible with the STIX computational requirements. We show that our model outperforms the currently adopted algorithm for estimating the flare locations from CFL data regarding prediction accuracy while requiring fewer parameters. We finally discuss possible future applications of the proposed model on-board STIX.</description>

      <title>On the first test of the Weak Equivalence Principle in low Earth orbit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.06400v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Weak Equivalence Principle is the founding pillar of General Relativity and as such should be verified as precisely as possible. The Microscope experiment tested it in low Earth orbit, finding that Pt and Ti test masses fall toward Earth with the same acceleration to about 1e-15, an improvement of about two orders of magnitude over ground tests. Space missions, even if small, are expensive and hard to replicate; yet, the essence of physics is repeatability. This work is an assessment of the Microscope results based on the laws of physics and knowledge from previous experiments, focusing on the limiting thermal noise and the treatment of acceleration outliers. Thermal noise reveals anomalies that we explain by stray sub-microVolt potentials caused by patch charges, giving rise to an unstable zero. The measurements were affected by numerous acceleration spikes occurring at the synodic frequencies relative to the Earth (the signal frequency) and the Sun, which we interpret as evidence of a thermal origin. In Microscope authors' analysis, the spikes were removed and the resulting gaps replaced with artificial data (up to 35, 40 per cent of the sessions data), which retain memory of the gaps and may simulate or cancel an effect (signal or systematic). An alternative approach based exclusively on real measured data would avoid any ambiguity. The lessons of Microscope are crucial to any futures improved mission.</description>

      <title>Anomaly detection with flow-based fast calorimeter simulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11618v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, several normalizing flow-based deep generative models have been proposed to accelerate the simulation of calorimeter showers. Using CaloFlow as an example, we show that these models can simultaneously perform unsupervised anomaly detection with no additional training cost. As a demonstration, we consider electromagnetic showers initiated by one (background) or multiple (signal) photons. The CaloFlow model is designed to generate single photon showers, but it also provides access to the shower likelihood. We use this likelihood as an anomaly score and study the showers tagged as being unlikely. As expected, the tagger struggles when the signal photons are nearly collinear, but is otherwise effective. This approach is complementary to a supervised classifier trained on only specific signal models using the same low-level calorimeter inputs. While the supervised classifier is also highly effective at unseen signal models, the unsupervised method is more sensitive in certain regions and thus we expect that the ultimate performance will require a combination of these approaches.</description>

      <title>Neural Simulation-Based Inference of the Neutron Star Equation of State directly from Telescope Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00287v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutron stars provide a unique opportunity to study strongly interacting matter under extreme density conditions. The intricacies of matter inside neutron stars and their equation of state are not directly visible, but determine bulk properties, such as mass and radius, which affect the star's thermal X-ray emissions. However, the telescope spectra of these emissions are also affected by the stellar distance, hydrogen column, and effective surface temperature, which are not always well-constrained. Uncertainties on these nuisance parameters must be accounted for when making a robust estimation of the equation of state. In this study, we develop a novel methodology that, for the first time, can infer the full posterior distribution of both the equation of state and nuisance parameters directly from telescope observations. This method relies on the use of neural likelihood estimation, in which normalizing flows use samples of simulated telescope data to learn the likelihood of the neutron star spectra as a function of these parameters, coupled with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo methods to efficiently sample from the corresponding posterior distribution. Our approach surpasses the accuracy of previous methods, improves the interpretability of the results by providing access to the full posterior distribution, and naturally scales to a growing number of neutron star observations expected in the coming years.</description>

      <title>Across the soft gamma-ray regime: utilizing simultaneous detections in the Compton Spectrometer and Imager (COSI) and the Background and Transient Observer (BTO) to understand astrophysical transients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07155v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Compton Spectrometer and Imager (COSI) is a NASA funded Small Explorer (SMEX) mission slated to launch in 2027. COSI will house a wide-field gamma-ray telescope designed to survey the entire sky in the 0.2--5 MeV range. Using germanium detectors, the instrument will provide imaging, spectroscopy, and polarimetry of astrophysical sources with excellent energy resolution and degree-scale localization capabilities. In addition to the main instrument, COSI will fly with a student collaboration project known as the Background and Transient Observer (BTO). BTO will extend the COSI bandpass to energies lower than 200 keV, thus enabling spectral analysis across the shared band of 30 keV--2 MeV range. The BTO instrument will consist of two NaI scintillators and student-designed readout electronics. Using spectral information from both the COSI and BTO instruments, physics such as the energy peak turnover in gamma-ray bursts, the characteristics of magnetar flares, and the event frequency of a range of transient phenomena will be constrained. In this paper, we present the expected science returnables from BTO and comment on the shared returnables from the COSI and BTO missions. We include simulations of gamma-ray bursts, magnetar giant flares, and terrestrial gamma-ray flashes using BTO's spectral response.
