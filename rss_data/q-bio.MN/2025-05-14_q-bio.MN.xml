      <title>An Exact Moment-Based Approach for Chemical Reaction-Diffusion Networks: From Mass Action to Hill Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biochemical systems are inherently stochastic, particularly those with small-molecule populations. The spatial distribution of molecules plays a critical role and requires the inclusion of spatial coordinates in their analysis. Stochastic models such as the chemical master equation are commonly used to study these systems. However, analytical solutions are limited to specific cases, and stochastic simulations require significant computational resources. To mitigate these challenges, approximation methods, such as the moment approach, reduce the system to a set of ordinary differential equations, thereby lowering the computational requirements. This study investigates the conditions under which the second-moment approach yields exact results during the dynamic evolution of chemical reaction-diffusion networks. The analysis encompasses second-order or higher-order reactions and Hill functions without relying on higher-order moment estimations or closure approximations. Starting with stationary states, we extended the analysis to a dynamic evolution. An enzymatic process and an antithetic feedback system were examined for purely reactive systems, demonstrating the approach's accuracy in capturing system behavior and quantifying errors. The study was further extended to genetic regulatory networks governed by Hill functions, including both purely reactive and reaction-diffusion systems, validating the method in spatially distributed contexts. This framework enables precise characterization of biochemical systems, avoiding information loss typically associated with approximations and allowing for stability analysis under fluctuations. These findings optimize computational strategies while providing insights into intracellular signaling and regulatory processes, paving the way for efficient and accurate stochastic modeling in biochemical systems.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Machine Learning Systems via Category Theory: Applications to Spherical Attention for Gene Regulatory Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How do we enable artificial intelligence models to improve themselves? This is central to exponentially improving generalized artificial intelligence models, which can improve their own architecture to handle new problem domains in an efficient manner that leverages the latest hardware. However, current automated compilation methods are poor, and efficient algorithms require years of human development. In this paper, we use neural circuit diagrams, based in category theory, to prove a general theorem related to deep learning algorithms, guide the development of a novel attention algorithm catered to the domain of gene regulatory networks, and produce a corresponding efficient kernel. The algorithm we propose, spherical attention, shows that neural circuit diagrams enable a principled and systematic method for reasoning about deep learning architectures and providing high-performance code. By replacing SoftMax with an $L^2$ norm as suggested by diagrams, it overcomes the special function unit bottleneck of standard attention while retaining the streaming property essential to high-performance. Our diagrammatically derived \textit{FlashSign} kernel achieves comparable performance to the state-of-the-art, fine-tuned FlashAttention algorithm on an A100, and $3.6\times$ the performance of PyTorch. Overall, this investigation shows neural circuit diagrams' suitability as a high-level framework for the automated development of efficient, novel artificial intelligence architectures.</description>
