      <title>Figuring Out Gas &amp; Galaxies In Enzo (FOGGIE). XIV. The Observability of Emission from Accretion and Feedback in the Circumgalactic Medium with Current and Future Instruments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observing the circumgalactic medium (CGM) in emission lines from ionized gas enables direct mapping of its spatial and kinematic structure, offering new insight into the gas flows that regulate galaxy evolution. Using the high-resolution Figuring Out Gas &amp; Galaxies In Enzo (FOGGIE) simulations, we generate mock emission-line maps for six Milky Way-mass halos. Different ions (e.g., HI, OVI) trace distinct CGM phases and structures, highlighting the importance of observations in multiple species. We quantify the observable CGM mass fraction as a function of instrument spatial resolution and surface brightness sensitivity, finding that sensitivity is the dominant factor limiting detectability across all ions. At fixed sensitivity, higher spatial resolution reveals more structures; at fixed spatial resolution, higher sensitivity recovers a higher percentage of the total mass. We explore CGM kinematics by constructing emissivity-weighted projected velocity maps and comparing line-of-sight velocities between ions. OVI shows the largest kinematic deviation from HI, while MgII and SiII most closely follow HI velocities. Distinguishing these phases out to 50kpc from the galaxy center requires spectral resolution better than 30km/s for most ion pairs. Additionally, separating inflowing from outflowing gas based on projected kinematics also requires high spectral resolution: at 30km/s, more than 80% of gas above the emission detection threshold can be distinguished kinematically, but this fraction drops to &lt;40% with a resolution of 200km/s. Our results provide predictions for future UV and optical instruments, showing that recovering the multiphase structure and kinematics of circumgalactic emission will require both high sensitivity and fine kinematic resolution.</description>

      <title>Not all protoclusters host evolved galaxies: Evidence for reduced environmental effects in a lower halo mass protocluster at $z = 7.66$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The progenitors of present-day galaxy clusters offer crucial insight into how galaxies and large-scale structure co-evolve in the early Universe. We present JWST/NIRCam grism spectroscopy of the photometrically identified $z=7.66$ protocluster core in the SMACS J0723.3-7327 lensing field, SMACS-PC-z7p7. Six [O III]-emitters and five additional photometric candidates are found within a 0.3 arcmin$^2$ ($1.5\ {\rm cMpc}^2$) region, corresponding to an overdensity of $\delta \sim 200$. Despite the extreme overdensity, the resident galaxies exhibit star-formation histories, UV-slopes and neutral hydrogen column densities that are consistent with those of field galaxies at similar redshifts. This is in stark contrast with the consistently high neutral hydrogen column densities, old stellar populations and large dust masses of galaxies within a $z=7.88$ protocluster in the Abell 2744 field. Comparison with the TNG-Cluster and TNG300 simulations indicates a halo mass of ${\rm log_{10}}(M_{200{\rm c}}[{\rm M_{\odot}}]) = 11.4\pm0.2$, and implies that, on average, SMACS-PC-z7p7 will evolve into a present-day Fornax-like cluster (${\rm log_{10}}(M_{200{\rm c},\ z=0}[{\rm M_{\odot}}]) = 13.7\pm0.6$). The uniformly young, highly star-forming nature of the galaxy population of SMACS-PC-z7p7 suggests that environmental effects only become significant above halo masses of ${\rm log_{10}}(M_{200{\rm c}}[{\rm M_{\odot}}]) \gtrsim 11.5$. Comparison to other $z\gtrsim7$ protoclusters reveals that vigorous star formation persists in lower-mass protoclusters, whereas accelerated evolution and suppression of star formation emerge in more massive haloes. SMACS-PC-z7p7 therefore represents an early stage of protocluster assembly, where residence within an overdense environment still enhances star formation, and feedback processes have yet to exert a significant influence.</description>

      <title>Dynamical mirages: how bar-induced resonant trapping can mimic substructure clustering in dynamical parameter spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The complex task of unraveling the assembly history of the Milky Way is in constant evolution with new substructures identified continuously. To properly validate and characterise the family of galactic progenitors, it is important to take into account all the effects that can shape the distribution of tracers in the Galaxy. First among the often overlooked actors of galactic dynamics is the rotating bar of the Milky Way that can affect orbital tracers in multiple ways. We want to fully characterise the effect of the rotating bar of the Milky Way on the distribution of galactic tracers, provide diagnostics helpful in identifying its effect and explore the implications for the search and identification of substructures. We use the in-house Orbital Integration Tool (OrbIT), built to include the full effect of the bar and exploit its multidimensional output to perform a complete dynamical characterisation of a large sample of carefully selected Milky Way stars with very precise astrometry. We identify conspicuous overdensities in several orbital parameter spaces and verify that they are caused by the bar-induced resonances. We also show how contamination by trapped tracers provides local density enhancements that mimic the clumping usually attributed to genuine substructures. We provide a new and expedite way of identifying resonant loci and, consequently, to estimate the contribution of stars trapped into orbital resonances to phase-space overdensities previously identified as candidate relics of past merging events. Among those analysed here, we found that the detections of Cluster 3 and Shakti seem to have gained a non-negligible boost from resonance-trapped stars. Nyx is the most extreme case, with 70% of assigned member stars lying on resonant orbit, strongly suggesting that it is not the genuine relic of a merger event but an overdensity caused by bar-induced resonances</description>

      <title>Continuum Reverberation Mapping of 18 AGN Over Four Years</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuum reverberation mapping probes the size scale of the optical continuum-emitting region in active galactic nuclei (AGN). The source of this emission has long been thought to originate from the accretion disk, but recent studies suggest the broad line region (BLR) may significantly contribute to both the observed flux and continuum interband delays. We monitored 18 AGN over four years of observations to acquire high quality optical continuum light curves, measuring time lags between different photometric bands and determining continuum emission sizes for each AGN. We add this sample to existing lag measurements to test the correlation between continuum lags at $5100\r{A}$ ($\tau_{5100}$) and $5100\r{A}$ luminosity ($L_{5100}$). We observe that $\tau_{5100} \propto L_{5100}^{0.4}$, broadly consistent with the theoretical expectations of $\tau \propto L^{1/2}$ expected for continuum reverberation from either the accretion disk or the BLR.</description>

      <title>EDGE-INFERNO: How chemical enrichment assumptions impact the individual stars of a simulated ultra-faint dwarf galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The chemical abundances of stars in galaxies are a fossil record of the star formation and stellar evolution processes that regulate galaxy formation, including the stellar initial mass function, the fraction and timing of type Ia supernovae (SNeIa), and nucleosynthesis inside massive stars. In this paper, we systematically explore uncertainties associated with modeling chemical enrichment in dwarf galaxies. We repeatedly simulate a single EDGE-INFERNO dwarf ($M_{\star} \approx 10^5 \, M_{\odot}$), varying the chemical yields of massive stars, the timing and yields of SNeIa, and the intrinsic stochasticity that arises from sampling individual stars and galaxy formation chaoticity. All simulations are high-resolution (3.6 pc), cosmological zoom-in hydrodynamical simulations that track the stellar evolution of all individual stars with masses $&gt;0.5\,{\rm M}_{\odot}$. We find that variations in SNIa assumptions make the largest difference in mean abundance ratios and [Fe/H], highlighting the importance of detailed SNIa modeling even in such low-mass reionization-limited galaxies. In contrast, different massive star yields, accounting (or not) for stellar rotation, result in mean abundances comparable to those arising from stochasticity. Nonetheless, they significantly affect the shape of abundance trends with [Fe/H], for example, through the existence (or not) of a bimodality in the [X/Fe] - [Fe/H] planes, particularly in [Al/Fe]. Finally, we find that the variance arising from random sampling severely limits the interpretation of single galaxies. Our analysis showcases the power of star-by-star cosmological models to unpick how both systematic uncertainties (e.g., assumptions in low-metallicity chemical enrichment) and statistical uncertainties (e.g., averaging over enough galaxies and stars within a galaxy) affect the interpretation of chemical observables in ultra-faint dwarf galaxies.</description>

      <title>The UV/optical Continuum Reverberation Mapping of Eight Active Galactic Nuclei with Swift: Further Evidence for the Outer Component</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In our previous work, we applied the ICCF-Cut method to the continuum reverberation mapping (CRM) of six active galactic nuclei (AGNs) based on the published Swift data. Extending this work, we perform a systematic AGN CRM study utilizing the Swift archive. We enlarge our sample with eight additional AGNs at $z&lt;0.05$ with high-cadence ($&lt;3$ days) and multiband photometric observations. Time series analysis of these light curves shows two main results: (1) The interband lags are broadly consistent with $\tau \propto \lambda^{4/3}$, while the average interband lags are larger than those predicted by the standard thin accretion disk model. (2) For most targets, there exists a $U$ band lag excess, which is probably due to the diffuse continuum emission from the broad-line region (BLR). We employ the ICCF-Cut method to extract the possible diffuse continuum component from the $U$ band light curves and calculate the diffuse continuum lags ($\tau_{\rm cut}$), which are generally consistent with the lags ($\tau_{\rm jav}$) derived by the JAVELIN Photometric Reverberation Mapping Model. Further analysis with our sample indicates a positive correlation between the diffuse continuum region size and the BLR size ($R_{\rm DCR}-R_{\rm BLR}$ relation), as well as another correlation with the luminosity ($R_{\rm DCR}-L$ relation). These findings provide further evidence for a significant contribution of diffuse continuum emission from the BLR to the AGN continuum lags.</description>

      <title>ALMASOP: Inner-Envelope Structures of Protostars Driving Nascent Jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protostellar jets provide valuable insight into the evolutionary stage and formation history of star-forming cores in their earliest phases. We investigated the inner envelope structures of three extremely young protostars, selected for having the shortest dynamical timescales in their outflows and jets. Our analysis is based on Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations of the N2D+, DCO+, DCN, C18O, CH3OH, and H2CO lines, along with 1.3 mm continuum data, obtained at two spatial resolutions of ~500 AU and 150 AU. By examining molecular depletion and sublimation patterns, emission extents at core-scale and outflow rotational temperatures, we assessed the relative evolutionary stages of the three sources. In G208.68-19.20N1, the absence of N2D+ toward the core-despite a semi-ring-like distribution-and the presence of bright DCN and DCO+ emission cospatial with C18O indicate a warmer envelope, possibly suggesting a more advanced evolutionary state. In contrast, G208.68-19.20N3 shows no dense central structures in C18O, DCN, DCO+, or N2D+, with emission instead appearing scattered around the continuum and along large-scale filaments, consistent with a likely younger stage than G208.68-19.20N1. The third source, G215.87-17.62M, exhibits compact C18O emission at the continuum peak, but spatially extended N2D+, DCN, and DCO+ along the continuum, pointing to a cooler envelope and likely the youngest stage among the three. This comparative analysis across three protostars demonstrates the effectiveness of molecular tracers for evolutionary staging, though variations in luminosity or accretion may also shape chemical morphologies. These results highlight the promise of broader surveys for advancing our understanding of early protostellar evolution.</description>

      <title>Supermassive Black Hole and Broad-line Region in NGC 5548: 2023 Reverberation Mapping Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results of the 2023 spectroscopic reverberation mapping (RM) campaign for active galactic nuclei (AGN) of NGC 5548, continuing our long-term monitoring program. Using the Lijiang 2.4-meter telescope, we obtained 74 spectra with a median cadence of 1.9 days. Through detailed spectral decomposition, we measured the light curves of the optical continuum at 5100~\AA\ and the broad He~{\sc ii}, He~{\sc i}, H$\gamma$, and H$\beta$ emission lines. The time lags of these lines relative to the continuum are measured as $1.3^{+1.6}_{-0.6}$, $2.3^{+1.5}_{-2.1}$, $10.0^{+2.0}_{-1.8}$, and $15.6^{+2.6}_{-2.9}$ days (rest-frame), respectively. Velocity-resolved lag profiles for H$\gamma$ and H$\beta$ were constructed. Combined with data from previous seasons (2015$-$2021), we find that the radial ionization stratification of the broad-line region (BLR) is stable; the average virial mass of the supermassive black hole in NGC~5548 is $(2.6\pm1.1)\times 10^{8}M_{\odot}$, consistent with the $M_{\rm BH}-\sigma_*$ relation; the broad He~{\sc ii} line exhibits the largest responsivity, followed by broad He~{\sc i} (or H$\gamma$) and H$\beta$ lines; the BLR kinematics show significant temporal evolution, transitioning from virialized motions to signatures of inflow and outflow. Furthermore, an analysis of 35 years of historical data confirms a 3.5-year time lag between variations in the optical luminosity and the BLR radius, potentially implicating the role of radiation pressure or dynamical structure changes in the inner accretion disk. Long-term campaign demonstrates that the BLR in NGC 5548 is a robust yet dynamically evolving entity, providing crucial insights into AGN structure and accretion physics.</description>

      <title>An XMM-Newton View of the ANdromeda Galaxy as Explored in a Legacy Survey (New-ANGELS) II: Luminosity Function of X-ray Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As part of the New-ANGELS program, we systematically investigate the X-ray luminosity functions (XLFs) of 4506 X-ray sources projected within a radius of 2.5 deg centering on M31. We construct XLFs for different regions in the disk and halo of M31, accounting for the incompleteness with an effective sensitivity map. Assuming that the halo regions contain (mostly) foreground stars and background active galactic nuclei, they are taken as "background" for deriving the XLFs of the sources in the disk. Through modeling XLFs, we decompose the X-ray sources into distinct populations for each region. We find that low-mass X-ray binaries are the dominant X-ray population throughout the disk of M31. The XLFs of M31 reveal a consistently lower integrated LMXB luminosity per stellar mass ($\alpha_\mathrm{LMXB}$) compared to other galaxies, likely due to M31's prolonged period of quiescent star formation. Variations in the XLF shape and $\alpha_\mathrm{LMXB}$ across different regions of M31 suggest that the relationship between integrated luminosity and stellar mass may vary within the galaxy. Additionally, the relatively low integrated luminosity observed in the inner-arm region provides crucial evidence for a rapid fading of M31's LMXBs around 1 Gyr, a finding consistent with recent observations of other nearby galaxies.</description>

      <title>Dissecting the Perseus-Pisces supercluster observed with CFHT-MegaCam: Investigating environmental effects on galaxy morphology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of the large-scale structure has transformed our view of galaxy formation and evolution. Filaments of the cosmic web provide key environments that channel the growth of structures. Guided by predictions from cosmological simulations, we study the morphological distribution of galaxies in the Perseus-Pisces Supercluster, a prominent filamentary complex at 70 Mpc. We focus on how galaxy morphology and structural disturbances relate to position within the filament network and to proximity to dense nodes. Our sample is built from a spectroscopic catalogue cross-matched with deep r-band CFHT/MegaCam imaging from UNIONS and additional time, enabling the detection of low-surface-brightness features and extended outer structures. Morphologies are determined both visually and through structural parameters extracted from surface-brightness profiles using AutoProf and AstroPhot. The 3D filamentary skeleton of Perseus-Pisces is reconstructed with the DisPerSE algorithm, providing distances from each galaxy to the nearest filament and to group or cluster centres. The 3D mapping reveals a network of interconnected sub-filaments converging around the Pisces cluster, forming a complex, multi-branched structure that likely shapes environmental effects on galaxy evolution. We observe clear morphological and stellar-mass segregation: massive early-type galaxies (E/S0) concentrate along filament spines and near dense nodes, while late-type and irregular systems are more broadly dispersed. About 10-13% of galaxies show strong signs of gravitational interaction, with stellar-halo asymmetries particularly common in filaments and groups. These findings underline the dual influence of filamentary environments, which both host evolved early-type systems and foster local tidal interactions and pre-processing that modify galaxy morphology.</description>

      <title>AGN-Driven Biconical Outflows as the Origin of the Double-Peaked [O~{\sc iii}] doublet in SDSS J134733.36+121724.27</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we recheck the spectroscopic properties of SDSS J134733.36+121724.27 (4C+12.50), confirming the presence of the double-peaked [O~{\sc iii}]$\lambda\lambda4959,5007$\AA\ doublet and a broad H$\alpha$. The former likely results from AGN-driven biconical outflows, while the absence of a broad H$\beta$ supports a classification of the source as a Type-1.9 AGN. We analyze its high-quality Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) optical spectrum after robustly subtracting host galaxy and AGN continuum contributions through a simple stellar population fitting method employing 39 templates and a power-law continuum. Each narrow line of the [O~{\sc iii}]$\lambda\lambda4959,5007$\AA\ doublet is better described by two Gaussian components (blue-shifted and red-shifted) than by a single Gaussian, as confirmed by the F-test. Broad components are included for both H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$, but only H$\alpha$ reveals a significant detection, further supported by a comparison between the SDSS spectrum and that previously reported. These results support that the object is highly consistent with a Type-1.9 AGN classification, and the double-peaked [O~{\sc iii}] profiles are most likely produced by AGN-driven biconical outflows rather than by a rotating narrow-line region or a dual AGN merger system. Additional observations are still needed to strengthen these conclusions.</description>

      <title>Is M31 at the center of its satellite system ?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The arrangement of M31's dwarf galaxies exhibits anisotropy, with the majority located in the hemisphere between the Milky Way and the host galaxy. This study aims to investigate whether M31's present location is aligned with the center of its distribution of dwarf galaxies. We use forward modeling to infer the center of the M31 satellite 3D spatial distribution, folding in the completeness of dwarf galaxy searches. We observe a displacement of the center of the satellite distribution, relative to the center of M31, of approximately 10--50 kpc towards the Milky Way. Nonetheless, the center of M31 remains compatible with the center of the dwarf galaxy distribution given the broad constraints on its position, with the significance of the shift ranging from $\leq 1\sigma$ to $1.9\sigma$, depending on the assumed form of the volumetric spatial distribution of satellites. If M31 is truly offset from its satellite system, a quadrupling of the number of known satellites would be necessary to infer a significant ($3\sigma$) offset. Hence, expanding the number of known dwarf galaxies is crucial to deepen our understanding of the distribution of M31 satellites and further shed on its peculiar structure.</description>

      <title>Radio AGN feedback sustains quiescence only in a minority of massive galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio active galactic nuclei (AGNs) eject a huge amount of energy into the surrounding medium and are thought to potentially prevent gas cooling and maintain the quiescence of massive galaxies. The short-lived, sporadic, and anisotropic nature of radio activities, coupled with the detection of abundant cold gas around some massive quiescent galaxies, raise questions about the efficiency of radio feedback in massive galaxies. Here we present an innovative method rooted in artificial intelligence to separate galaxies in which radio feedback is effective (RFE), regardless of current radio emission, from those in which radio feedback is ineffective (RFI), according to their optical images. Galaxies categorized as RFE are all dynamically hot, whereas quiescent RFI (RFI-Q) galaxies usually have extended cold-disk components. At given stellar mass, dark matter halos hosting RFE galaxies are between four to ten times more massive than those of RFI-Q galaxies. We find, for the first time, that almost all RFE galaxies have scant cold gas, irrespective of AGN activity. In contrast, many RFI-Q galaxies are surrounded by substantial amounts of condensed atomic gas, indicating a different evolutionary path from RFE galaxies. Our finding provides direct and compelling evidence that a radio AGN has gone through about 300 on-off cycles and that radio feedback can prevent gas cooling over a timescale much longer than that of radio activity. Contrary to general belief, our analysis shows that only a small fraction of massive galaxies are influenced by strong radio AGNs, suggesting that current galaxy formation models need serious revision.</description>

      <title>A JWST/NIRSpec Integral Field Unit Survey of Luminous Quasars at z ~ 5-6 (Q-IFU): Rest-frame Optical Nuclear Properties and Extended Nebulae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It remains debatable how billion-solar-mass supermassive black holes (SMBHs) form and evolve within the first billion years. We report results from a James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)/NIRSpec integral field unit (IFU) survey of 27 luminous quasars at $z \sim 5$-$6$, enabling a systematic investigation of their key physical properties and the associated, extended line emission. Our sample hosts SMBHs with $\log(M_{\mathrm{BH}}/M_\odot) \sim 8.6$-$9.7$ and Eddington ratios of $\sim 0.1$-$2.6$ based on H$\beta$, and the H$\beta$-based and H$\alpha$-based BH mass are broadly consistent with each other. Our sample may have a slightly smaller median BH mass and larger median Eddington ratio than lower-redshift quasars within the same luminosity range, although the difference could still be explained by statistical uncertainties. They generally follow the empirical correlations between [O III] $\lambda$5007 equivalent width and bolometric luminosities or Eddington ratios formed by lower-redshift quasars. The majority of them fall within the Eigenvector~1 planes formed by lower-redshift quasars. Nevertheless, a subset of the sample shows enhanced, blueshifted [O III] emission associated with fast outflows. Spatially extended [O III] line emission is detected in 6 objects and shows morphologies and kinematics consistent with merging activities and/or turbulent and clumpy interstellar media (ISM). Tentative evidence of quasar radiative feedback shaping the ISM of a merging companion galaxy is seen in the object with the most extended [O III] emission. Our results provide crucial insight into the rapid growth of SMBHs and the gaseous environments they reside in at z$\sim$5-6.</description>

      <title>Damping of dynamical friction force in self-interacting ultralight dark matter and Fornax timing problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of globular clusters in the Fornax dwarf galaxy pose a challenge for the standard cold dark matter (CDM) and can be used to test other models of dark matter. We study this dynamics in the context of ultralight bosonic dark matter model, accounting for the damping term in a generalized Gross-Pitaevskii equation. Employing analytic formulas for the dynamical friction force, the infall time and evolution of globular clusters are compared in the cases with and without the damping term. It is argued that the damping term plays an important role for the Fornax timing problem in ultralight dark matter models.</description>

      <title>NbodyCP:A direct N-body simulation code for composite stellar populations of single and binary star clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well-known that some star clusters contain composite stellar populations (CSPs), in which the metallicities or (and) ages of stars are different. The formation and evolution of such clusters and their stellar populations remain unclear. Both single and binary cluster channels may lead to such CSPs. In order to simulate the formation and evolution of such CSPs in star clusters, this work develops a code of direct N-body simulation of CSPs, NbodyCP. It is applied to different clusters, in particular, to binary clusters. It shows that CSPs and different kinds of cluster pairs can be formed via dynamical processes. This will help to partially explain the formation of CSPs and various clusters. Some special cluster structures, e.g., two cores or bar-like shape, are shown to be the results of evolution of some binary clusters. The simulation also shows that the separation between the members of a binary cluster affects the time of two member clusters to combine or move away significantly.</description>

      <title>MeerKAT observations of the spiral galaxy NGC 2997 in the S band. Detection of high dynamo modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We seek to exploit the expanded observational range of the MeerKAT radio telescope with the new S-band receivers (2.0-2.8 GHz). To showcase its enhanced capabilities, we conducted new S-band observations of the galaxy NGC 2997 in full polarization. The S band is ideal for studying magnetic fields in spiral galaxies due to the weak Faraday depolarization. Performing a rotation measure (RM) synthesis allowed us to measure Faraday RMs in the galaxy, a signature of regular magnetic fields. A fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm was used to study the various azimuthal modes found in the RM data of the galaxy. The RM synthesis analysis indicates the direction of the magnetic field along the line of sight throughout the entire disk. Leveraging the sensitivity and high resolution provided by MeerKAT's S-band capability, this study achieves an unprecedented level of detail of the magnetic field structure. Our sector-based analysis of the RMs across azimuthal regions reveals the existence of modes of the large-scale magnetic field in NGC 2997. The variations in the RM values along the azimuthal angle reveal smoothly changing phase shifts between the rings, without the previously reported field reversal at about 3 kpc radius between the central region and disk. In this work, for the first time, a Fourier analysis has been applied to RM data averaged in sectors of rings in the disk plane of a spiral galaxy. Our Fourier analysis of the RM map shows three different large-scale field modes detected in the disk of NGC 2997. After applying a geometric modification, even multiples of the first mode were detected, as predicted from theoretical studies of dynamo action in a spiral galaxy with symmetric spiral structure. Our new method opens up new possibilities for investigating magnetic fields in spiral galaxies.</description>

      <title>The Calibration of Short Wavelength Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon Emission as Star Formation Rate Indicators with JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use JWST/NIRCam and MIRI imaging acquired by the Feedback in Emerging extrAgalactic Star clusTers (FEAST) program along with archival HST imaging to map ionized gas (Pa$\alpha$, Br$\alpha$, and H$\alpha$) and Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon (PAH) emission (3.3 and 7.7 $\mu$m) across a sample of four nearby galaxies (NGC 5194, 5236, 628, and 4449). These maps are utilized to calibrate the PAH features as star formation rate (SFR) indicators in 40 pc size regions around massive emerging young star clusters (eYSCs). We find a tight, sub-linear (power-law exponent, $\alpha{\,}{\sim}{\,}0.8$) relation between the PAH luminosities (3.3 and 7.7 $\mu$m) and SFR (extinction corrected Pa$\alpha$) in near solar metallicity environments. PAH destruction in more intense ionizing environments and/or variations in the age of our sources may drive the deviation from a linear relation. In the metal-poor environment of NGC 4449 (${\sim}$1/3 Z$_{\odot}$), we see substantial deficits in the PAH feature strengths at fixed SFR and significantly higher scatter in the PAH-SFR relations. We determine that the 3.3/7.7 $\mu$m PAH luminosity ratio increases towards lower metallicity environments. This is interpreted as a result of a shift in the size distribution towards smaller PAHs at lower metallicities, possibly due to inhibited grain growth. Focusing on the regions in NGC 4449, we observe a decreasing 3.3/7.7 $\mu$m ratio towards higher SFR, which could indicate that small PAHs are preferentially destroyed relative to larger PAHs in significantly sub-solar metallicity conditions. We estimate that ${\sim}$2/3 of the PAH emission in typical local star-forming galaxies is excited by older stars and unrelated to recent ($&lt;$10 Myr) star formation.</description>

      <title>Resolved Schmidt-Kennicutt relation in a binary hyperluminous infrared galaxy at $z=2.41$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperluminous infrared galaxies (HyLIRGs; SFRs up to about 1000 Msun yr-1), though rare, provide key constraints on galaxy evolution. H-ATLAS J084933.4+021443, a z = 2.41 binary HyLIRG (galaxies W and T) with two additional luminous companions (C and M), offers an ideal laboratory for studying star formation during "cosmic noon". We use ALMA to obtain resolved imaging and kinematics of CO J:7-6, [C I] 2-1, H2O, and rest-frame 340-1160 GHz continuum emission in all four galaxies. Each system is spatially resolved within ~0.3 arcsec (2.5 kpc) apertures. Gas kinematics in W and T are rotation-dominated, with galaxy T showing emission extended along its kinematic minor axis due to lensing magnification. Spatially resolved SEDs indicate that W is well fitted by single-temperature greybody dust despite hosting a luminous AGN, while T requires an additional hot-dust component and extra millimetre emission. We confirm [C I] J:2-1 as a tracer of warm/dense molecular gas in these extreme systems, though its luminosity ratio with CO J:7-6 rises sub-linearly. We derive resolved (2.5 kpc-scale) Schmidt-Kennicutt (SK) relations for W and T using both cold and warm/dense gas, finding depletion times of about 50-100 Myr (W) and about 100-500 Myr (T). Both galaxies follow a steep SK relation with power-law index n ~ 1.7, significantly above the n ~ 1 observed in normal star-forming galaxies.</description>

      <title>Globular clusters of the Gaia Enceladus/Sausage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated Gaia-Enceladus/Sausage globular cluster samples and studied their orbital and dynamical evolution over cosmological timescales in external time-variable potential. We estimated the limits of distribution of the escaped stars from the globular clusters' orbital evolution in energy angular momentum space. To reconstruct the orbital evolution of the known globular clusters of the dwarf galaxy Gaia-Enceladus/Sausage, we used the parallel $N$-body code $\varphi$-GPU. We investigated the relationship between globular clusters and their progenitor by analysing their orbital parameters and phase-space distribution during 9 Gyr of evolution in the past. We created a $N$-body model of Gaia-Enceladus/Sausage globular clusters and analysed their dynamical evolution and distribution of the escaped stars today. We summarised the samples of the Gaia-Enceladus/Sausage globular clusters and created two main categories: `most probable' and `tentative', with 15 and 9 clusters, respectively. We analysed the evolution of their kinematic, orbital, and phase-space parameters in the external time-variable potential. We defined phase-space distribution limits of stars that escape from globular clusters during 9 Gyr of evolution: a specific energy from -18 to -12.2 $\times10^4$ km$^2$ s$^{-2}$, L$_{\rm z}$ from -0.98 to 0.72 $\times10^3$ kpc km s$^{-1}$, and L$_{\rm perp}$ from 0 to 1.8 $\times10^3$ kpc km s$^{-1}$. The limits of the GE/S debris in Galactic area based on orbital parameters of the GC's escaped stars are: for apocentre and pericetre distances of 10--28 and 1--4 kpc, &lt; 18 kpc in Galactocentric radius and &lt; |15| kpc in the Z direction. Generally we compared the phase-space distribution of escaped stars from the GCs GE/S debris energy-angular momentum limits with the observed very metal-poor stars, which belong to the GE/S itself and produce consistent results.</description>

      <title>PHANGS-JWST: the largest extragalactic molecular cloud catalog traced by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-resolution JWST images of nearby spiral galaxies reveal polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission structures that trace molecular gas, including CO-dark regions. We identify ISM cloud structures in PHANGS-JWST 7.7 $\mu$m PAH maps for 66 galaxies, smoothed to 30 pc and at native resolution, extracting 108,466 and 146,040 clouds, respectively. Molecular properties were inferred using a linear conversion from PAH to CO. Given the tendency for clouds in galaxy centers to overlap in velocity space, we opted to flag these and omit them from the analysis in this work. The remaining clouds correspond to giant molecular clouds, such as those detected in CO(2-1) emission by ALMA, or lower surface density clouds that either fall below the ALMA detection limits of existing maps or genuinely have no molecular counterpart. Cross-matching with ALMA CO maps at 90 pc in 27 galaxies shows that 41 % of PAH clouds have CO associations. The converted molecular properties vary little across environments, but the most massive clouds are preferentially found in spiral arms. Fitting lognormal mass distributions down to $2\times10^{3} M_{\odot}$ shows that spiral arms host the highest-mass clouds, consistent with enhanced formation in arm gravitational potentials. Cloud molecular surface densities decline by a factor of $\sim 1.5-2$ toward $2 - 3 R_{e}$. However, the trend largely varies in individual galaxies, with flat, decreasing, and even no trend as a function of galactocentric radius. Factors like large-scale processes and morphologies might influence the observed trends. We publish two catalogs online, one at the common resolution of 30 pc and another at the native resolution. We expect them to have broad utility for future PAH clouds, molecular clouds, and star formation studies.</description>

      <title>SDSS-ALMA Legacy Value Archival Gas Exploration (SALVAGE) - I: global star formation is governed by central (not global) molecular gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Star-forming galaxies form tight relations between their stellar mass, star-formation rate, and molecular gas reservoir on global and resolved scales. On the path to quiescence, the exchange between gas and stars must inevitably be broken. Understanding the mechanisms governing star formation and quenching therefore requires observations of both the stellar and molecular gas components. To this end, we have assembled a sample of 277 galaxies ($0.02 \lesssim z \lesssim 0.25$) with semi-resolved optical and millimetre $^{12}$CO(1-0) data, wherein the properties of the inner $\thicksim$2 kpc can be distinguished from the outer regions. This effort was made possible by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) catalogues and the maturing archive of the Atacama Large (sub-)Millimetre Array (ALMA). We call this dataset the SDSS-ALMA Legacy Value Archival Gas Exploration (SALVAGE). In this work, we leverage SALVAGE to provide a semi-resolved perspective on global scaling relations and why some galaxies deviate from them. In agreement with previous work, we find that the offset of a galaxy from the global star-forming main sequence (SFMS) is driven by its inner star formation rate. With the relative inner and outer distributions of molecular gas fraction and star formation efficiency, we investigate whether the central star formation driving global changes is due to fuel availability or efficiency. We find that the position of a galaxy within the SFMS is largely due to the inner star-formation efficiency, while departure from the SFMS is driven by availability of central gas. The central few kpc are thus the most consequential region for galaxy evolution at low redshift.</description>

      <title>APOGEE Chemical Abundances of Stars in the MW Satellites Fornax, Sextans, Draco and Carina</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During its evolution, the Milky Way (MW) incorporated numerous dwarf galaxies, particularly low-mass systems. The surviving dwarf galaxies orbiting the MW serve as exceptional laboratories for studying the unique properties of these systems. Their metal-poor environments and shallow gravitational potentials likely drive significant differences in star formation and star cluster properties compared to those in the MW. Using high-quality near-infrared spectra from the APOGEE survey, we determined abundances of Fe, C, N, O, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Ti, Cr, Mn, Ni, and Ce for 74 stars in four MW satellite dwarf galaxies: Fornax, Sextans, Draco, and Carina. Our analysis reveals that the distribution of $\alpha$ elements (e.g., [Si/Fe]) strongly correlates with galaxy luminosity (and hence mass), underscoring the critical role of galaxy mass in shaping chemical evolution. These dwarf galaxies exhibit [Al/Fe$]\sim -0.5$, which is comparable to those of the metal-poor stars in the MW. Additionally, we identified nitrogen-rich field stars in the Fornax dwarf galaxy, which display distinct metallicities compared to its known globular clusters (GCs). If these stars originated in GCs and subsequently escaped, their presence suggests we are observing relics of destroyed GCs, offering possible evidence of cluster disruption.</description>

      <title>Deep imaging of the very isolated dwarf galaxy NGC6789</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present deep optical imaging of the extremely isolated dwarf galaxy NGC 6789, obtained with the new 2-meter Two-meter Twin Telescope (TTT3) at Teide Observatory. Despite its location in the Local Void, NGC 6789 exhibits surprising recent central star formation equivalent to approximately 4% of its total stellar mass. The origin of the gas necessary for this level of star formation remains unknown. Our data reach surface brightness limits of 29.8, 29.4, and 28.9 mag arcsec$^{-2}$ in the Sloan g, r, and i filters, respectively, and reveal no evidence of tidal features or merger remnants down to $\sim$30 mag arcsec$^{-2}$ (or equivalently, at a radial distance larger than 1.6 kpc). The galaxy's undisturbed outer elliptical morphology suggests that its recent central star formation was likely produced by either in-situ residual gas or by the accretion of external pristine gas not associated with a minor merging activity.</description>

      <title>Stellar Populations in Satellite Galaxies in Close Pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Satellite galaxies that are near to massive primary galaxies in close pairs can have stellar population ages that are more similar to their primaries than expected. This is one way in which close pairs of galaxies show galactic conformity, which is thought to be driven by assembly bias. Such conformity is seen in ages, morphologies and star formation rates in different samples. This paper revisits a high signal-to-noise SDSS spectroscopic sample, by spectral fitting of new stellar population models, to investigate satellite galaxy properties of age, metallicity and alpha-element abundance. We find the clear signature of age conformity, as previously seen, but no clear evidence for conformity in metallicity or abundance ratios. The offsets showing age conformity are not caused by age-metallicity degeneracies. There is a suggestion in these data that lower velocity dispersion satellites have increased [alpha/Fe] compared to a control sample of passive galaxies, however this needs further observations to be verified. Our results also suggest an intriguing turnover in the age trends of the satellites at the highest velocity dispersion, perhaps reflecting the onset of environment-related processes in the most massive groups.</description>

      <title>Relativistic MOND Theory from Modified Entropic Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive a relativistic extension of Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) within the framework of entropic gravity by introducing temperature-dependent corrections to the equipartition law on a holographic screen. Starting from a Debye-like modification of the surface degrees of freedom and employing the Unruh relation between acceleration and temperature, we obtain modified Einstein equations in which the geometric sector acquires explicit thermal corrections. Solving these equations for a static, spherically symmetric spacetime in the weak-field, low-temperature regime yields a corrected metric that smoothly approaches Minkowski space at large radii and naturally contains a characteristic acceleration scale. In the very-low-acceleration regime, the model reproduces MOND-like deviations from Newtonian dynamics while providing a relativistic underpinning for that phenomenology. We confront the theory with rotation-curve data for NGC~3198 and perform a Bayesian parameter inference, comparing our relativistic MOND (RMOND) model with both a baryons-only Newtonian model and a dark-matter halo model. We find that RMOND and the dark-matter model both fit the data significantly better than the baryons-only Newtonian prediction, and that RMOND provides particularly improved agreement at $r\gtrsim 20\,\mathrm{kpc}$. These results suggest that temperature-corrected entropic gravity provides a viable relativistic framework for MOND phenomenology, motivating further observational tests, including gravitational lensing and extended galaxy samples.</description>

      <title>A New Phase of Optical Activity of BL Lacertae in the Fall of 2024: Intra-Night Flux and Polarization Variations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: BL Lacertae is not only archetypical of an entire class of jet-dominated active galactic nuclei, blazars, but also one of the most active and rapidly changing objects in this class. In the fall of 2024 (September--November), BL Lacertae underwent another episode of strong optical activity, reaching an R-band magnitude of about 12 and showing extremely rapid and large-amplitude inter- and intra-night flux and polarization variations. During this period, the object was monitored over 40 nights using telescopes with an aperture of up to 2 m at three observatories: Rozhen and Belogradchik in Bulgaria and Skinakas in Greece. The results from this study include some of the most spectacular intra-night variability episodes detected in a blazar. These rapid variations, combined with high photometric accuracy and high time resolution, allowed for confirmation of consistency between different optical bands with zero time delays, down to a minute scale. Unlike previous activity reports, polarization was relatively stable on these short time-scales. Possible connections between polarization, flux, and intra-night variability were explored in order to better model or constrain the physical processes and emission mechanisms in the relativistic jets.</description>

      <title>Particle loads for cosmological simulations with equal-mass dark matter and baryonic particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional cosmological hydrodynamical simulations usually assume equal-numbered but unequal-mass dark matter and baryonic particles, which can lead to spurious collisional heating due to energy equipartition. To avoid such a numerical heating effect, a simulation setup with equal-mass dark matter and baryonic particles, which corresponds to a particle number ratio of $N_{\rm DM}:N_{\rm gas} = \Omega_{\rm cdm} / \Omega_{\rm b}$, is preferred. However, previous studies have typically used grid-based particle loads to prepare such initial conditions, which can only reach specific values for $N_{\rm DM}:N_{\rm gas}$ due to symmetry requirements. In this study, we propose a method based on the glass approach that can generate two-component particle loads with more general $N_{\rm DM}:N_{\rm gas}$ ratios. The method simultaneously relaxes two Poisson particle distributions by introducing an additional repulsive force between particles of the same component. We show that the final particle load closely follows the expected minimal power spectrum, $P(k) \propto k^{4}$, exhibits good homogeneity and isotropy properties, and remains sufficiently stable under gravitational interactions. Both the dark matter and gas components individually also exhibit uniform and isotropic distributions. We apply our method to two-component cosmological simulations and demonstrate that an equal-mass particle setup effectively mitigates the spurious collisional heating that arises in unequal-mass simulations. Our method can be extended to generate multi-component uniform and isotropic distributions. Our code based on Gadget-2 is available at https://github.com/liaoshong/gadget-2glass .</description>

      <title>Alexander Dalgarno and the development of astrochemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interdisciplinary field of astrochemistry arose during the 1970s as observations in previously unexplored parts of the electromagnetic spectrum began to reveal the extent of a molecular component of interstellar matter with a surprisingly rich chemistry. Astrochemistry expanded further in order to explain the role of atomic and molecular processes in a broad range of phenomena in the universe. It is instructive to describe the current scope of astrochemistry using the career and accomplishments of Alexander Dalgarno as an organizing principle. Dalgarno helped to establish a self-sustaining community of astrochemists around the world. His own research interests highlight the early development of astrochemistry and anticipate much of its later evolution. His theoretical investigations of fundamental atomic and molecular processes lie at the heart of the subject.</description>

      <title>Redshift-Frame Systematics and Their Impact on the Hubble Constant from Pantheon+ Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a full-sky covariance-weighted analysis of redshift-frame consistency in the Pantheon+ Type~Ia supernova sample. Using 1,543 unique objects with heliocentric ($z_{\rm HEL}$) and cosmic microwave background ($z_{\rm CMB}$) redshifts, we quantify residual differences between frames. A statistically significant but physically small mean offset $\langle z_{\rm CMB} - z_{\rm HEL} \rangle = (-3.8 \pm 0.1)\times10^{-4}$ is found, exhibiting a sign reversal between low- and high-redshift subsets ($p = 3.8\times10^{-15}$). A dipole fit to the residuals yields an amplitude $A = (1.5 \pm 0.1)\times10^{-3}$ directed toward $(\mathrm{RA},\mathrm{Dec}) = (167.1^\circ, -1.6^\circ)$, consistent within $1^\circ$ of the CMB dipole. When propagated through a covariance-weighted Hubble fit, these effects shift the inferred Hubble constant by only $\Delta H_0 = 0.07~\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}$ (about $1.3\%$ of the current Hubble tension). The recovered dipole aligns with the known solar motion relative to the CMB, validating the kinematic frame corrections in Pantheon+ and establishing a systematic floor for future bulk-flow searches.</description>

      <title>A Census of Pulsars in Possible Association with Galactic Open Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Among the $\sim 4000$ known pulsars in our Galaxy, $\lesssim 10\%$ are found in globular clusters, but none has been confirmed in any open clusters yet, although they outnumber globular clusters by about 20 times. In this work, we make use of the Gaia DR3 catalog of Galactic open clusters and conduct a pulsar census, in order to identify pulsars that are either 1) current members of open clusters, or 2) escaped from open clusters to the field. Among 164 pulsars with independent distance measurements and 3530 open clusters, we find that 4 pulsars are likely residing in open clusters. In particular, we find compelling evidence that the binary pulsar J1302$-$6350 (B1259$-$63) is a member of the open cluster UBC~525; based on Gaia data, we update its distance to be $2.26\pm 0.07$~kpc and measure the mass of its companion Be star LS 2883 to be $16.8 M_\odot$. For 145 pulsars with both distance and proper motion measurements and 2967 open clusters with full kinematic parameters, we trace the past trajectories of both pulsars and open clusters in the Galactic gravitational potential, and find pulsars that were within 3 times the radius of a cluster. This results in 19 pulsars that were likely born in open clusters. We discuss implications for the formation history of PSR J1302$-$6350 and highlight the scientific potential of searching for pulsars in open clusters.</description>

      <title>Mock Observations for the CSST Mission: Integral Field Spectrograph--GEHONG: A Package for Generating Ideal Datacubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We developed a Python package GEHONG to mock the three-dimensional spectral data cube under the observation of an ideal telescope for the Integral Field Spectrograph of the Chinese Space Station Telescope (CSST-IFS). This package can generate one-dimensional spectra corresponding to local physical properties at specific positions according to a series of two-dimensional distributions of physical parameters of target sources. In this way, it can produce a spatially resolved spectral cube of the target source. Two-dimensional distributions of physical parameters, including surface brightness, stellar population, and line-of-sight velocity, can be modeled using the parametric model or based on real observational data and numerical simulation data. For the generation of one-dimensional spectra, we have considered four types of spectra, including the stellar continuum spectra, ionized gas emission lines, AGN spectra, and stellar spectra. That makes GEHONG able to mock various types of targets, including galaxies, AGNs, star clusters, and HII regions.</description>

      <title>Mock Observations for the CSST Mission: Multi-Channel Imager--The Cluster Field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Multi-Channel Imager (MCI), one of the instruments aboard the China Survey Space Telescope (CSST), is designed to simultaneously observe the sky in three filters, covering wavelengths from the near-ultraviolet (NUV) to the near-infrared (NIR). With its large field of view ($7.5^{\prime}\times7.5^{\prime}$), MCI is particularly well-suited for observing galaxy clusters, providing a powerful tool for investigating galaxy evolution, dark matter and dark energy through gravitational lensing. Here we present a comprehensive simulation framework of a strong lensing cluster as observed by MCI, aiming to fully exploit its capabilities in capturing lensing features. The framework simulates a strong lensing cluster from the CosmoDC2 catalog, calculating the gravitational potential and performing ray-tracing to derive the true positions, shapes and light distribution of galaxies within the cluster field. Additionally, the simulation incorporates intra-cluster light (ICL) and spectral energy distributions (SEDs), enabling further strong lensing analyses, such as ICL seperation from galaxy light and mass reconstruction combining strong and weak lensing measurements. This framework provides a critical benchmark for testing the MCI data pipeline and maximizing its potential in galaxy cluster research.</description>

      <title>A Gas-Phase Kinetic Study of the N(2D) + CH3CCH and N(2D) + CH3CN Reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The chemistry of planetary atmospheres containing molecular nitrogen as a major atmospheric component is strongly influenced by the reactions of atomic nitrogen. Although nitrogen atoms in their ground electronic state N(4S) are mostly unreactive towards stable molecules, electronically excited nitrogen atoms N(2D) are much more reactive and could play an important role in the formation of nitriles and other nitrogen bearing organic molecules in planetary atmospheres such as Titan. Despite this, few kinetic studies of N(2D) reactions have been performed over the appropriate low temperature range. Here, we report the results of an experimental study of the reactions N(2D) + methylacetylene, CH3CCH, and N(2D) + acetonitrile, CH3CN, using a supersonic flow reactor at selected temperatures between 50 K and 296 K. N(2D) atoms, which were generated indirectly as a product of the C(3P) + NO reaction, were subsequently detected by laser induced fluorescence in the vacuum ultraviolet wavelength region. The measured rate constants are significantly larger than the estimated values in current photochemical models and do not display large variations as a function of temperature. The new rate constants are included in a 1D coupled ion-neutral model of Titans atmosphere to test their influence on the simulated species abundances. In addition, the overall description of both reactions is improved by considering the results of recent experimental and theoretical work examining the product channels of these processes. These simulations indicate that while the N(2D) + CH3CCH reaction has only a limited overall influence on Titans atmospheric chemistry, the N(2D) + CH3CN reaction could lead to the formation of significant relative abundances of cyanomethamine, HNCHCN, in the upper atmosphere.</description>

      <title>Mock Observations for the CSST Mission: Main Surveys--An Overview of Framework and Simulation Suite</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Chinese Space Station Survey Telescope (CSST) is a flagship space-based observatory. Its main survey camera is designed to conduct high spatial resolution near-ultraviolet to near-infrared imaging and low-resolution spectroscopic surveys. To maximize the scientific output of CSST, we have developed a comprehensive, high-fidelity simulation pipeline for reproducing both imaging and spectroscopic observations. This paper presents an overview of the simulation framework, detailing its implementation and components. Built upon the GalSim package and incorporating the latest CSST instrumental specifications, our pipeline generates pixel-level mock observations that closely replicate the expected instrumental and observational conditions. The simulation suite integrates realistic astrophysical object catalogs, instrumental effects, point spread function (PSF) modeling, and observational noises to produce accurate synthetic data. We describe the key processing stages of the simulation, from constructing the input object catalogs to modeling the telescope optics and detector responses. Furthermore, we introduce the most recent release of simulated datasets, which provide a crucial testbed for data processing pipeline developments, calibration strategies, and scientific analyses, ensuring that CSST will meet its stringent requirements. Our pipeline serves as a vital tool for optimizing CSST main survey strategies and ensuring robust cosmological measurements.</description>

Abstract: The Fermi Bubbles are gamma-ray structures extending from the center of the Milky Way to +/-50 degree Galactic latitude that were discovered in data obtained by the Fermi/LAT instrument. Their origin and power source remain uncertain. To help address this uncertainty, here we use a template-free reconstruction of ten years of all-sky Fermi/LAT data provided by Platz et al. (2023) to carry out a pixel-by-pixel spectral analysis of the Bubbles. We recover the position-dependent spectral shape and normalization that would be required for parent proton or electron cosmic ray populations to produce the Bubbles' observed gamma-ray spectra. We find that models in which the gamma-ray emission is driven by either hadronic or leptonic processes can explain the data equally well. The cosmic ray population driving the emission must have either broken power-law or exponentially cut-off spectra, with break or cutoff energies that are almost constant with latitude but spectral indices below the break that harden towards the Bubbles' southern tip. For the leptonic channel, reproducing the observed position-dependent gamma-ray spectrum also requires a cosmic ray electron energy density that grows with distance from the Galactic plane and increases towards the edges of the Bubbles. This finding disfavors scenarios for the origin of the Bubbles where a population of cosmic ray electrons is accelerated near the Milky Way center and subsequently advected out to the extremities of the Bubbles.</description>

      <title>Near-infrared Variability Detected in the Young Star-Forming Dwarf Galaxy SBS 0335-052E</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.03726v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: SBS~0335-052E is a young star-forming dwarf galaxy with a total stellar mass of $M_{*} \lesssim 10^{8}~M_{\odot}$ and an extremely low metallicity ($Z \sim 1/40~Z_{\odot}$), which has long been considered to be devoid of an active galactic nucleus (AGN). Here we report the detection of temporal flux variability of SBS~0335-052E in near-infrared (NIR) 3-4\ ${\rm \mu}$m bands on timescales of several years, showing dimming and brightening of up to 50\% over 14~years, based on archival data from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer. Our spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting of archival ultraviolet (UV)-NIR photometry, including AGN SED models, indicates that the variable NIR emission arises from an edge-on AGN dust torus. The UV-optical emission from the accretion disk is obscured and does not reach us, leading to the dominance of the host galaxy's young stellar population in the UV-optical wavelengths. This analysis favors the presence of a Compton-thick, heavily obscured AGN in SBS~0335-052E, consistent with its observed X-ray weakness. From the SED fitting, we estimate an AGN bolometric luminosity of $L_{\rm bol} = 1.2\times10^{43}\ {\rm erg\ s^{-1}}$, which implies a black hole mass of $M_{\rm BH} \simeq 10^{5}\ M_\odot$ if the AGN is accreting at the Eddington limit. If confirmed, SBS~0335-052E would be the least massive galaxy known to host an AGN, likely harboring an intermediate-mass black hole.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13244v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present results from a high-resolution interstellar turbulence simulation and show that it closely reproduces recent $Planck$ measurements. Our model captures the scaling of $EE$ and $BB$ spectra, and the $EE/BB$ ratio in the inertial range. The probability density function of the dust polarization fraction is also consistent with observations. The $TE$ cross-correlation is in broad agreement with the $Planck$ sky. This simulation provides new insights into the physical origins of the observed $E/B$ asymmetry and positive $TE$ signal, facilitating the development of advanced Galactic dust emission models for current and future cosmic microwave background experiments.</description>

      <title>Microlensing of lensed supernovae Zwicky &amp; iPTF16geu: constraints on the lens galaxy mass slope and dark compact object fraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01578v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To date, only two strongly lensed type Ia supernovae (SNIa) have been discovered with an isolated galaxy acting as the lens: iPTF16geu and SN Zwicky. The observed image fluxes for both lens systems were inconsistent with predictions from a smooth macro lens model. A potential explanation for the anomalous flux ratios is microlensing: additional (de)magnification caused by stars and other compact objects in the lens galaxy. In this work, we combine observations of iPTF16geu and SN Zwicky with simulated microlensing magnification maps, leveraging their standardizable candle properties to constrain the lens galaxy mass slope, $\eta$, and the fraction of dark compact objects, $f_{\rm dc}$. The resulting mass slopes are $\eta = 1.70 \pm 0.07$ for iPTF16geu and $\eta = 1.81 \pm 0.10$ for SN Zwicky. Our results indicate no evidence for a population of dark compact objects, placing upper limits at the $95\%$ confidence level of $f_{\rm dc} &lt; 0.25$ for iPTF16geu and $f_{\rm dc} &lt; 0.47$ for SN Zwicky (for compact objects with masses above $ 0.02 M_{\odot}$). Assuming a constant fraction of dark compact objects for both lensed SNe, we obtain $f_{\rm dc} &lt; 0.19$. These results highlight the potential of strongly lensed SNIa to probe the innermost parts of lens galaxies and learn about compact matter.</description>

      <title>PAC in DESI. I. Galaxy Stellar Mass Function into the $10^{6}{\rm M}_{\odot}$ Frontier</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01948v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Photometric Objects Around Cosmic Webs (PAC) method integrates cosmological photometric and spectroscopic surveys, offering valuable insights into galaxy formation. PAC measures the excess surface density of photometric objects, $\bar{n}_2w_{\rm{p}}$, with specific physical properties around spectroscopic tracers. In this study, we improve the PAC method to make it more rigorous and eliminate the need for redshift bins. We apply the enhanced PAC method to the DESI Y1 BGS Bright spectroscopic sample and the deep DECaLS photometric sample, obtaining $\bar{n}_2w_{\rm{p}}$ measurements across the complete stellar mass range, from $10^{5.3}{\rm M}_{\odot}$ to $10^{11.5}{\rm M}_{\odot}$ for blue galaxies, and from $10^{6.3}{\rm M}_{\odot}$ to $10^{11.9}{\rm M}_{\odot}$ for red galaxies. We combine $\bar{n}_2w_{\rm{p}}$ with $w_{\rm{p}}$ measurements from the BGS sample, which is not necessarily complete in stellar mass. Assuming that galaxy bias is primarily determined by stellar mass and colour, we derive the galaxy stellar mass functions (GSMFs) down to $10^{5.3}{\rm M}_{\odot}$ for blue galaxies and $10^{6.3}{\rm M}_{\odot}$ for red galaxies, while also setting lower limits for smaller masses. The blue and red GSMFs are well described by single and double Schechter functions, respectively, with low-mass end slopes of $\alpha_{\rm{blue}}=-1.54^{+0.02}_{-0.02}$ and $\alpha_{\rm{red}}=-2.50^{+0.08}_{-0.08}$, resulting in the dominance of red galaxies below $10^{7.6}{\rm M}_{\odot}$. Stage-IV cosmological photometric surveys, capable of reaching 2-3 magnitudes deeper than DECaLS, present an opportunity to explore the entire galaxy population in the local universe with PAC. This advancement allows us to address critical questions regarding the nature of dark matter, the physics of reionization, and the formation of dwarf galaxies.</description>

      <title>Probing Reionization-Era Galaxies with JWST UV Luminosity Functions and Large-Scale Clustering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07590v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: JWST has transformed our understanding of early galaxy formation, providing an unprecedented view of the first billion years of cosmic history. In this work, we build upon our previously developed semi-analytical framework that self-consistently models the evolving UVLF of galaxies and the global reionization history while incorporating the effects of radiative feedback. Comparing our predictions with JWST and HST data, we identify a fundamental tension: models that match the UVLF fail to reproduce the observed evolution of galaxy clustering (bias) with redshift, and vice versa. To resolve this, we introduce a redshift- and mass-dependent duty cycle linked to the duration of star formation. This duty cycle increases towards higher redshifts, requiring either an enhanced production of UV radiation or increased star formation efficiency at z&gt;10 to match the JWST UVLFs, but declines at lower redshifts (5&lt;z&lt;=9) and towards low-mass halos to remain consistent with the bias and HST UVLF measurements. Reconciling theory with observations requires the characteristic star formation timescale to be longer in massive halos, and to decrease with redshift at fixed halo mass, evolving from ~ 85 Myr at z=6 to ~ 45 Myr at z=14 for $10^{10} M_\odot$ halos. Finally, our extended model, assuming a halo mass-dependent escaping ionizing efficiency ($\varepsilon_{\rm esc} \equiv f_{\rm esc} \times \xi_{\rm ion}$), whose population-averaged value gradually increases with redshift and corresponds to $\langle f_{\rm esc} \rangle \sim$ 15% at z=5 for a fixed value of $\xi_{\rm ion} = 10^{25.23}$ erg$^{-1}$ Hz across all galaxies, produces a reionization history consistent with current constraints. These findings underscore the importance of jointly constraining high-redshift galaxy models using both UVLF and bias statistics to accurately interpret JWST data and refine our understanding of early cosmic evolution.</description>

      <title>Backlighting extended gas halos around luminous red galaxies: kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect from DESI Y1 x ACT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19870v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The gas density profile around galaxies, shaped by feedback and affecting the galaxy lensing signal, is imprinted on the cosmic microwave background (CMB) by the kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (kSZ). We precisely measure this effect ($S/N\approx 10$) via velocity stacking with more than 800,000 spectroscopically confirmed luminous red galaxies (LRG) from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Y1 survey, which overlap with the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) Data Release 6 temperature maps over $\geq$ 4,000 deg$^2$. We explore the kSZ dependence with various galaxy parameters and find no significant trend with redshift, but clear trends with stellar mass and absolute magnitude in $g$, $r$, and $z$ bands. Our analysis suggests that the gas extends beyond the dark matter halo (99.5\% confidence, i.e. PTE = 0.005). We find a tentative preference for hydrodynamical simulation models with stronger feedback that drives gas further out (Illustris $z=0.5$, PTE = 0.37) over weaker-feedback cases (IllustrisTNG $z=0.8$, PTE = 0.045), though with limited statistical significance. In all cases, a free multiplicative amplitude was fit to the simulated profiles, and further modeling work is required to firm up these conclusions. We find consistency between kSZ profiles around spectroscopic and photometric LRG, with comparable statistical power, thus increasing our confidence in the photometric analysis. Additionally, we present the first kSZ measurement around DESI Y1 bright galaxy sample (BGS) and emission-line galaxies (ELG), whose features match qualitative expectations. Finally, we forecast $S/N \sim 50$ for future stacked kSZ measurements using data from ACT, DESI Y3, and Rubin Observatory. These measurements will serve as an input for galaxy formation models and baryonic uncertainties in galaxy lensing.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Waves from Massive Black Hole Mergers in ASTRID: Predictions for LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24304v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use the ASTRID cosmological simulation to forecast massive black hole (MBH) mergers detectable by Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) down to $z=0$. ASTRID directly models MBH dynamical friction, allowing a realistic tracking of their trajectory. It also incorporates relatively low-mass MBH seeds down to $5\times10^{4} M_{\odot}$, providing a more complete picture of LISA MBH mergers. We find that LISA MBH mergers initially have high eccentricities, peaking around $e_0 = 0.8$ across all redshifts. Accounting for this boosts the event rate from 5.6 yr$^{-1}$ (if circular orbits are assumed) to 10.5 yr$^{-1}$. This enhancement is largely due to additional inspiral sources that will coalesce after LISA's observation, which constitute $46\%$ of detected events.This underscores the importance of LISA's sensitivity to the early inspiral phase, especially for eccentric binaries that emit gravitational waves across a wider frequency band. Most LISA events in ASTRID arise from $M_{\mathrm{BH}}\sim10^{5-6}\ M_\odot$, low-redshift ($z&lt;2$) and low mass-ratio ($q\sim0.01$-$0.1$) mergers. Accounting for eccentricity broadens the detectable MBH mass range up to $10^{9} M_\odot$ and shifts the peak of detectable mergers to a lower redshift $z_{\rm peak}=0.8$. This implies that the most massive LISA events may also be PTA sources. We predict LISA events to be in various galaxy environments, including many low-mass satellite galaxies. The electromagnetic (EM) counterparts of most LISA sources have active galactic nuclei (AGN) luminosities $L_{\rm bol}&gt;10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$, albeit only $1\%$ with $&gt;10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$. The brightest AGN are those associated with the rare LISA/PTA events with $M_{\rm BH}&gt;10^{8} M_\odot$.</description>

      <title>Stellar CoRGI in MaNGA: Stellar Counterrotating Galaxies Identified in the MaNGA Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02925v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stellar counterrotating (CR) galaxies are systems hosting two large-scale stellar components rotating in opposite directions -- a main, preexisting galaxy body with an older stellar population and a younger CR stellar disk likely formed from externally accreted gas. Such systems offer a unique opportunity to study disk assembly by analyzing the stellar populations of each component. Using integral field spectroscopic data from the SDSS-IV Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory survey, we identified a sample of 120 CR disk galaxies (65 reliable and 55 probable systems) by inspecting their kinematic maps and analyzing the shape of the stellar line-of-sight velocity distribution, which was recovered nonparametrically. Of these, 74 CR galaxies have not been reported in previous studies. For one-third of our sample, we further derived the ages and metallicities of stars for both disks via a spectral decomposition technique. We show that the observed spatial bimodality -- where the CR disk either is concentrated in the central region (inner counterrotation) or dominates the outer part of the galaxy (outer counterrotation) -- is driven by differences in the stellar mass and angular momentum of the CR disk. The wide range of stellar metallicities observed in CR disks suggests that no single source of external material is solely responsible for the formation of counterrotation in all galaxies; instead, proposed mechanisms such as merger with gas-rich satellites, accretion from cosmic filaments, and exchange of gas between neighboring galaxies can dominate in individual cases.</description>

      <title>SHELLQs-JWST Unveils the Host Galaxies of 12 Quasars at z&gt;6</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03876v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The advent of JWST has opened new horizons in the study of quasar host galaxies during the reionization epoch (z&gt;6). Building upon our previous initial measurements of stellar light from two quasar host galaxies at these redshifts, we now report the detection of the stellar light from the full Cycle 1 sample of 12 distant moderate-luminosity quasar (M1450&gt;-24 mag) host galaxies at z&gt;6 from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP). Using JWST/NIRCam observations at 1.5 and 3.6 um combined with 2D image decomposition analysis, we successfully detect the host galaxies in 11 of the 12 targets, underscoring the high detection rates achievable with moderate-luminosity quasars. Based on two-band photometry and SED fitting, we find that our host galaxies are massive, with logM*/M_sun = 9.5-11.0. The effective radii range from 0.6 to 3.2 kpc, comparable to the sizes of inactive galaxies with similar masses at z~6 as measured with imaging from COSMOS-Web.Intriguingly, the two quasar hosts with post-starburst features, which reside at the high-mass end of our sample and exhibit relatively compact morphologies, have similar size and stellar mass surface densities to quiescent galaxies at z~4-5. These findings suggest that the so-called galaxy compaction scenario is already in place at the reionization epoch, in which gas inflows during starburst phases drive centrally concentrated star formation followed by rapid quenching, bridging the structural transition of massive galaxies from relatively extended star-forming disks to compact quiescent systems.</description>

Abstract: Quasar sightline observations reveal that low-ionization-state gas corotates with the galaxy disk and often at sub-centrifugal velocities, suggesting that the gas is spiraling towards the galaxy disk. However, while observations ubiquitously detect O VI absorption around low-redshift, $\sim L^*$ star-forming galaxies, the relationship between O VI and the galaxy disk, especially the kinematics, is not well-established. This work focuses on the O VI kinematics and its comparison with that of the low ions and galactic disk rotation. We present observations of 18 pairs of quasars and $z\approx0.2$ star-forming galaxies. All quasar sightlines intersect the circumgalactic medium (CGM) within 45$^\circ$ from the galaxy major axes. We show that while individual O VI velocity components do not correlate with disk rotation, the bulk of O VI gas in individual sightlines rarely counter-rotates. We then match O VI velocity components with those of low ions by minimizing the difference of their velocity centroids. The O VI velocity components with successful low-ion matches are typically found at small sightline impact parameters and are more likely to corotate with the disk. We suggest that the low-ion-matched O VI velocity components trace the gas co-spatial with the low ions near the extended disk plane in the inner CGM, whereas those without low-ion matches represent the gas at large 3D radii. While the gas at large radii is theoretically expected to kinematically correlate with the disk angular momentum, this correlation is expected to be weaker due to the higher turbulent to mean rotation velocity ration at large radii, consistent with our results.</description>

      <title>Constraining star formation in M87 using deep HST UV data</title>

Abstract: We analyzed the deepest Hubble Space Telescope (HST) F275W ultraviolet (UV) imaging of M87 to obtain the most robust constraints on its star formation rate (SFR) and star formation history (SFH). After removing the galaxy continuum and globular clusters, we detected an excess of UV point sources near the center. By comparing their colors to young stellar source (YSS) colors generated by stochastically simulated star formation (SF) for various SFRs and SFHs, we ruled out their origin as a UV-upturn population and identified them as YSS. We found an extremely low SFR of $\sim 2\times10^{-5}$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ in M87, with evidence of a weak starburst $\sim$125 Myr ago that formed $\sim 1000$ M$_\odot$ of stars. Unlike other cool-core clusters where SF is stronger and directly linked to cooling gas, we found no spatial correlation between YSS and H$\alpha$ filaments. Comparing SF activity with M87's AGN outburst history suggests that recent AGN feedback events ($\lesssim$12 Myr ago) neither triggered nor were associated with any detectable SF, however, earlier outbursts may have triggered weak starbursts. We detected UV filaments co-spatial with H$\alpha$ filaments with similar lengths and widths, though they are obscured by dust near the center. These filaments are likely powered by metal-line emission from collisional ionization, suggesting ongoing low-level precipitation of the intracluster medium. Our results indicate that AGN feedback has quenched SF significantly in M87 for at least 200 Myr, even though some precipitation persists. Additionally, we identified a hotspot created by the counterjet, with the spectral index also constrained.</description>

      <title>The Size Evolution and the Size-Mass Relation of Lyman-Alpha Emitters across $3 \lesssim z &lt; 7$ as Observed by JWST</title>

Abstract: Understanding the morphological structures of Lyman-alpha emitters (LAEs) is crucial for unveiling their formation pathways and the physical origins of Ly$\alpha$ emission. However, the evolution of their sizes and structural scaling relations remains debated. In this study, we analyze a large sample of 876 spectroscopically confirmed LAEs at $3 \lesssim z &lt; 7$, selected from the MUSE, VANDELS, and CANDELSz7 surveys in the GOODS-S, UDS, and COSMOS fields. Utilizing James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) NIRCam imaging data, we measure their rest-frame UV and optical V-band effective radii ($R_{\rm e}$) through two-dimensional S\'{e}rsic profile fitting. Our results show that these LAEs are generally compact, with a median $R_{\rm e,UV}$ of 0.50$^{+0.30}_{-0.24}$ kpc and a median $R_{\rm e,V}$ of 0.57$^{+0.33}_{-0.24}$ kpc. The size evolution follows $R_{\rm e,UV} \propto (1 + z)^{-0.91 \pm 0.10}$ and $R_{\rm e,V} \propto (1 + z)^{-0.93 \pm 0.18}$, respectively. Their UV and optical sizes are statistically comparable, indicating negligible UV-to-optical color gradients. For the first time, we establish the rest-frame optical size-mass relation for LAEs at $z&gt;3$, finding slopes comparable to typical star-forming galaxies (SFGs), but with slightly smaller sizes at a given stellar mass. These results provide important clues for understanding structural evolution of LAEs in the early universe.</description>

      <title>The causal structure of galactic astrophysics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01112v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data-driven astrophysics currently relies on the detection and characterisation of correlations between objects' properties, which are then used to test physical theories that make predictions for them. This process fails to utilise information in the data that forms a crucial part of the theories' predictions, namely which variables are directly correlated (as opposed to accidentally correlated through others), the directions of these determinations, and the presence or absence of confounders that correlate variables in the dataset but are themselves absent from it. We propose to recover this information through causal discovery, a well-developed methodology for inferring the causal structure of datasets that is however almost entirely unknown to astrophysics. We develop a causal discovery algorithm suitable for large astrophysical datasets and illustrate it on $\sim$5$\times10^5$ low-redshift galaxies from the Nasa Sloan Atlas, demonstrating its ability to distinguish physical mechanisms that are degenerate on the basis of correlations alone.</description>

      <title>Ly-alpha emission reveals two satellite halos around massive groups at z ~ 3: the puzzling case of a quiescent central galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01421v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the discovery and characterisation of two Ly$\alpha$ nebulae (LANs), RO-1001-Sat and RO-0959-Sat, as satellite structures of two giant LANs at $z=2.920$ and 3.092. They are found neighbouring two out of four known giant LANs at $z\sim3$ in our MUSE follow-up observations, reinforcing the idea that Ly$\alpha$ emission can be used to trace massive dark matter halos at high-$z$. This high occurrence of massive satellite halos agrees with simulations. With sizes of $\simeq80\times160$ and $80\times100~\mathrm{pkpc}^2$, the two nebulae are both $\sim$300pkpc from the main LANs. The Ly$\alpha$ emission is only shifted by $\simeq100-300$ km s$^{-1}$ between each of the two pairs, suggesting connections via large-scale structure. RO-1001-Sat and RO-0959-Sat are estimated to have log$(M_\mathrm{h}/M_\odot)\simeq13.2\pm0.3$ and $12.8\pm0.3$, putting them potentially close to the regime of cold-mode accretion. The central brightest galaxies in the two halos are morphologically distinct despite having similar stellar mass $\sim10^{11}M_\odot$, one being an elliptical quiescent galaxy in RO-1001-Sat and the other being a dusty star-forming spiral in RO-0959-Sat. Intriguingly, the quiescent galaxy aligns well with the peak of the LAN as well as the potential well of the host halo, making it the first clear-cut case where the cold gas ought to be accreting onto the galaxy but with no observable star formation, either due to morphological quenching or, more likely, radio-mode feedback from an active galactic nucleus. Finally, we show a tentative detection of a Ly$\alpha$ filament connecting RO-1001 and RO-1001-Sat. This work shows how panoramic MUSE (and in the future, BlueMUSE) observations of massive halo seeds can be used to efficiently search for additional halos, unveiling their large-scale structure and enabling the study of Ly$\alpha$-selected galaxy groups.</description>

      <title>The mass-metallicity relation of bulges</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25642v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context. Bulges, located at the central regions of galaxies, are complex structures, expected to be shaped by the physical processes involved in the assembly history of their host galaxy, such as gravitational collapse, mergers, interactions, and bars. As a consequence a variety of bulges with distinct morphology and chemistry could be produced. Aim. We aim at exploring the existence of a stellar mass-metallicity relation of bulges, MZ*R, and analyze the possible imprint of characteristics features by accretion and migration of stars, which could store information on their assembly histories. Methods. We use 44 central galaxies from the CIELO cosmological simulations. Their stellar masses are within the range of [10^7.6, 10^10.6] Msun. We decomposed the galaxy into bulge and disk using the circularity and binding energies. We track the stellar populations in bulges back in time to their birth location, classifying them as bulge-born in-situ, and disk-born stars and accreted. Results. We find that most of the stars in our bulges are formed in-situ, but 33% of our bulges show a non-negligible contribution of stellar accretion from satellites, which could add to about 35% of the population. The accreted material is generally contribute by two or three satellites at most. In some bulges, we also find up to a 32% of stars that migrated from the disk due to secular evolution, with a median of 10%. Regardless of the formation histories, we found a clear MZ*R for bulges, which is more enriched by about 0.4 dex than the corresponding relation of the disk components, and about 0.15 dex more enriched than the galaxy MZ*R. We find evidence that the dispersion in the bulge MZ*R is influenced by both stellar accretion from satellites and migration from the disk, such that, at a fixed bulge mass, bulges with higher fraction of accreted and migrated stars tend to be less metal-rich (abridged).</description>

      <title>A semi-analytical mock galaxy catalog for the CSST extragalactic surveys from the Jiutian simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03281v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a mock galaxy catalog built for the CSST extragalactic surveys using the primary runs of the Jiutian $N$-body simulation suites. The catalogs are built by coupling the GAlaxy Evolution and Assembly (GAEA) semi-analytical model of galaxy formation with merger trees extracted from the simulations using the Hierarchical Bound-Tracing (HBT+) algorithm. The spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and broadband magnitudes are computed using the neural-network-based stellar population synthesizer StarDuster, which is trained on radiative transfer simulations to account for detailed galaxy geometry in modeling dust obscuration. Galaxy light-cones up to $z=5$ are subsequently generated with the BLiC light-cone builder which interpolates the properties of galaxies over time using an optimized interpolation scheme. The resulting catalogs exhibit good convergence in many statistical properties of the galaxy population produced from two different resolution simulations. The catalogs reproduce a number of observed galaxy properties across a range of galaxy mass and redshift, including the stellar mass functions, the luminosity function, gas mass fraction, galaxy size-mass relation and galaxy clustering. We also present the photometric and redshift distributions of galaxies expected to be observed in the CSST surveys.</description>

Abstract: Recent observations from JWST have revealed unexpectedly luminous galaxies, exhibiting stellar masses and luminosities significantly higher than predicted by theoretical models at Cosmic Dawn. In this study, we present a suite of cosmological zoom-in simulations targeting high-redshift ($z \geq 10$) galaxies with dark matter halo masses in the range $10^{10} - 10^{11}\ {\rm M}_{\odot}$ at $z=10$, using state-of-the-art galaxy formation simulation codes (Enzo, Ramses, Changa, Gadget-3, Gadget-4, and Gizmo). This study aims to evaluate the convergence of the participating codes and their reproducibility of high-redshift galaxies with the galaxy formation model calibrated at relatively low redshift, without additional physics for high-redshift environments. The subgrid physics follows the AGORA CosmoRun framework, with adjustments to resolution and initial conditions to emulate similar physical environments in the early universe. The participating codes show consistent results for key galaxy properties (e.g., stellar mass), but also reveal notable differences (e.g., metallicity), indicating that galaxy properties at high redshifts are highly sensitive to the feedback implementation of the simulation. Massive halos (${\rm M}_{\rm halo}\geq5\times10^{10}\,{\rm M}_{\odot}$ at $z=10$) succeed in reproducing observed stellar masses, metallicities, and UV luminosities at $10\leq z\leq12$ without requiring additional subgrid physics, but tend to underpredict those properties at higher redshift. We also find that varying the dust-to-metal ratio modestly affects UV luminosity of simulated galaxies, whereas the absence of dust significantly enhances it. In future work, higher-resolution simulations will be conducted to better understand the formation and evolution of galaxies at Cosmic Dawn.</description>

      <title>Dynamical friction and measurements of the splashback radius in galaxy clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18468v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The splashback radius is one popular method of constraining the size of galaxy clusters, often measured through the logarithmic derivative of the galaxy number density profile. However, measuring the splashback radius through the galaxy number density has consistently produced smaller values of the splashback radius than those inferred from the underlying gravitational potential in simulations. Dynamical friction has been posited as one possible reason that splashback radii measured through galaxy number densities are reduced, since it decays the orbits of subhaloes within the halo. Dynamical friction is an emergent process, and as such, cannot be isolated or removed within N-body simulations. Here, we present simulations starting with isolated galaxy clusters drawn from the IllustrisTNG cosmological simulation, where we explicitly control dynamical friction through an idealized model. We show that although dynamical friction can reduce measurements of the splashback radius, it does not have a significant effect on clusters with $M_\mathrm{200,mean} &gt; 10^{14} \mathrm{M_\odot}$, and thus cannot account for previously measured discrepancies.</description>

      <title>Regulating Sommerfeld resonances for multi-state systems and higher partial waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18168v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Long-range attractive interactions between dark matter particles can significantly enhance their annihilation, particularly at low velocities. This ``Sommerfeld enhancement'' is typically computed by evaluating the deformation of the two-particle wavefunction due to the long-range potential, while ignoring the physics associated with the annihilation, and then scaling the appropriate annihilation matrix elements by factors that depend on the wavefunction in the limit where the particles approach zero relative separation. It has long been recognized that this approach is a valid approximation only in the limit where the annihilation rate is small, and breaks down in the regime where the enhanced annihilation rate approaches the unitarity bound, in which case ignoring the impact of the annihilation physics on the two-particle wavefunction cannot be justified and leads to apparent violations of unitarity. In the case where the physics relevant to annihilation occurs at a parametrically shorter distance scale (higher energy scale) compared with the long-range potential, we provide a simple prescription for correcting the Sommerfeld enhancement for the effects of the short-range physics, valid for all partial waves and for systems where multiple states are coupled by the long-range potential.</description>

      <title>Robustness of Neural Ratio and Posterior Estimators to Distributional Shifts for Population-Level Dark Matter Analysis in Strong Gravitational Lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05905v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the robustness of Neural Ratio Estimators (NREs) and Neural Posterior Estimators (NPEs) to distributional shifts in the context of measuring the abundance of dark matter subhalos using strong gravitational lensing data. While these data-driven inference frameworks can be accurate on test data from the same distribution as the training sets, in real applications, it is expected that simulated training data and true observational data will differ in their distributions. We explore the behavior of a trained NRE and trained sequential NPEs to estimate the population-level parameters of dark matter subhalos from a large sample of images of strongly lensed galaxies with test data presenting distributional shifts within and beyond the bounds of the training distribution in the nuisance parameters (e.g., the background source morphology). While our results show that NREs and NPEs perform well when tested perfectly in distribution, they exhibit significant biases when confronted with slight deviations from the examples seen in the training distribution. This indicates the necessity for caution when applying NREs and NPEs to real astrophysical data, where high-dimensional underlying distributions are not perfectly known.</description>

Abstract: We present a new rotating black hole solution to the Einstein equations as an extension of the Kerr spacetime. Interestingly, the solution we find may not be uniquely characterized by asymptotic parameters such as mass, angular momentum, and charge, thereby it would be the additional hair. We also analyze in detail how this additional characteristics or this hair affects the thermodynamic properties of the black hole.</description>

      <title>Fully Relativistic Treatment of Extreme Mass-Ratio Inspirals in Collisionless Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09715</link>

Abstract: Future mHz gravitational wave (GW) interferometers will precisely probe massive black hole environments, such as accretion discs, cold dark matter overdensities, and clouds of ultralight bosons, as long as we can accurately model the dephasing they induce on the waveform of extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs). Most existing models rely on extrapolations from Newtonian results to model the interaction of the small black hole in an EMRI system with the environment surrounding the massive black hole. Here, we present a fully relativistic formalism to model such interaction with collisionless environments, focusing on the case of cold dark matter overdensities, like 'spikes' and 'mounds'. We implement our new formalism in the FastEMRIWaveforms framework and show that the resulting waveforms are significantly different from those based on a Newtonian treatment of environmental effects. Our results indicate that a fully relativistic treatment is essential to capture the environmental dephasing of GW signals from EMRIs accurately.</description>

      <title>Hadronic origin of the very high-energy gamma-ray emission from the low-luminosity AGN in NGC 4278</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02326v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory has detected very high-energy (VHE) gamma rays from NGC 4278, which is known to host a low-luminosity active galactic nucleus (AGN). Having only very weak radio jets, the origin of its VHE gamma rays is unclear. In this paper we first show that NGC 4278 has a massive molecular cloud surrounding the nucleus by analyzing data taken with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. We then assume that cosmic ray protons are accelerated in a radiatively inefficient accretion flow around the supermassive black hole, which diffuse into the molecular cloud and produce gamma rays and neutrinos via $pp$ interactions. We model the gamma-ray spectra and find that the observations can be explained by such hadronic processes if the AGN activity was higher in the past than at present, and the diffusion coefficient in the molecular cloud is appreciably smaller than in the Milky Way interstellar medium. We also show that although the high-energy neutrinos co-produced with the gamma rays are unlikely to be detectable even with IceCube-Gen2, the accompanying synchrotron X-ray emission due to pion-decay secondary electrons and positrons may be detectable in the future, providing a valuable test of our hadronic model.</description>

      <title>An optical to infrared study of type II SN2024ggi at nebular times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05803v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present 0.3-21mic observations at ~275d and ~400d for Type II supernova (SN) 2024ggi, combining ground-based optical and near-infrared data from the Keck I/II telescopes and space-based infrared data from the James Webb Space Telescope. Although the optical regions dominate the observed flux, SN2024ggi is bright at infrared wavelengths (65%/35% falls each side of 1mic). SN2024ggi exhibits a plethora of emission lines from H, He, intermediate-mass elements (O, Na, Mg, S, Ar, Ca), and iron-group elements (IGEs; Fe, Co, and Ni) -- all lines have essentially the same width, suggesting efficient macroscopic chemical mixing of the inner ejecta at &lt;~2000km/s and little mixing of 56Ni at larger velocities. Molecular emission in the infrared range is dominated by the CO fundamental, which radiates about 5% of the total SN luminosity. A molecule-free radiative-transfer model based on a standard red-supergiant star explosion (i.e., ~1e51erg, 0.06Msun of 56Ni from a 15.2Msun progenitor) yields a satisfactory match throughout the optical and infrared at both epochs. The SN2024ggi CO luminosity is comparable to the fractional decay-power absorbed in the model C/O-rich shell -- accounting for CO cooling would likely resolve the model overestimate of the [OI]0.632mic flux. The relative weakness of the molecular emission in SN2024ggi and the good overall match obtained with our molecule-free model suggests negligible microscopic mixing -- about 95% of the SN luminosity is radiated by atoms and ions. Lines from IGEs, which form from explosion ashes at such late times, are ideal diagnostics of the magnitude of 56Ni mixing in core-collapse SN ejecta. Stable Ni, clearly identified in SN2024ggi (e.g., [NiII]6.634mic), is probably a common product of massive-star explosions.</description>

      <title>Exciting Stellar Eccentricity in Gaia BH3 via a Hidden Black Hole Binary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20806v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose that the high eccentricity of the stellar orbit in Gaia BH3 system could be excited through a secular resonance effect if the inner dark object is, in effect, a tight and eccentric black hole binary (BHB). During the orbital decay of the inner BHB, the apsidal precession rate of the inner binary matches that of the outer stellar orbit, and this resonance advection can drive the outer eccentricity into some extreme values. For a Gaia BH3-like system, we show that a near equal-mass ($q=0.8$) BHB with an initial semi-major axis of 1--3 au and an initial eccentricity $\gtrsim 0.95$ is able to excite the outer orbit to the observed value, leaving a current BHB with semi-major axis 0.25--0.5 au and eccentricity $\sim 0.8$. The eccentric inner BHB imprints two observable signatures on the outer star: (1) short-term RV modulations with an amplitude $\lesssim 100$ m/s and (2) long-term apsidal precession with a rate $\lesssim 0.1^{\circ}$/yr. Although neither of these is detected in the currently available astrometry and RV data, we show that these signals are detectable with the full Gaia astrometry data and dedicated high-precision and/or long-term RV observations. Our work provides a new perspective on the dynamical formation of Gaia BH3, and the methodology is readily applicable to similar systems such as HD 130298, Gaia BH1, and Gaia BH2.</description>

      <title>Hadronic Processes in Advection-Dominated Accretion Flow as the Origin of TeV Excesses in BL Lac Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04202v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of certain BL Lac objects (BL Lacs) exhibit an additional hard $\gamma$-ray component in the TeV energy range that surpasses the predictions of the one-zone leptonic jet model. The origin of this excess emission remains unclear. In this study, we selected five BL Lacs whose SEDs display a very hard intrinsic spectrum in the TeV band and successfully reproduced their broadband SEDs using a two-zone lepto-hadronic model. Within this framework, the emission observed in the optical, X-ray, GeV $\gamma$-ray, and sub-TeV $\gamma$-ray bands is modeled using the synchrotron and synchrotron self-Compton radiation processes of the relativistic electrons in the jets. Meanwhile, the TeV excess is attributed to $\gamma$-ray emission resulting from the photomeson ($p\gamma$) process via $\pi^0$ decay occurring within advection-dominated accretion flows (ADAFs). This scenario requires a hard proton spectrum with a spectral index of $p \sim 1.6-1.7$ and a cutoff energy ranging from 30 to 90 TeV, as well as a relatively large ADAF radius. Such hard proton spectra suggest that the dominant acceleration mechanisms are likely magnetic reconnection and/or stochastic acceleration processes within ADAFs. Additionally, the emission from the cascaded electrons results in a bump in the keV--MeV band; however, it is overwhelmed by the jet emission. Although the hadronuclear ($pp$) process cannot be entirely ruled out, it would necessitate an even harder proton spectrum and a higher cutoff energy compared to the $p\gamma$ process, making it a less favorable explanation for the observed TeV excess.</description>
