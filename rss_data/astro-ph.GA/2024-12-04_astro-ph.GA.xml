      <title>A sensitivity analysis of the modeling of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon emission in galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have conducted a sensitivity analysis on the mid-infrared spectral decomposition of galaxies and the modeling of the PAH emission spectrum with the NASA Ames PAH Infrared Spectroscopic Database (PAHdb) to assess the variance on the average galaxy PAH population properties under a grid of different modeling parameters. We find that the SL and SL+LL Spitzer-IRS decomposition with PAHFIT provides consistent modeling and recovery of the 5-15 $\mu$m PAH emission spectrum. For PAHdb modeling, application of a redshift to the calculated spectra to account for anharmonic effects introduces a $15\%$-$20\%$ variance on the derived parameters, while its absence improves the fits by $\sim13\%$. The 4.00-$\alpha$ release of PAHdb achieves the complete modeling of the 6-15 $\mu$m PAH spectrum, including the full 6.2 $\mu$m band, improving the average fitting uncertainty by a factor of 2. The optimal PAHdb modeling configuration requires selection of pure PAHs without applying a redshift to the bands. Although quantitatively the PAHdb-derived parameters change under different modeling configurations or database versions, their variation follows a linear scaling, with previously reported trends remaining qualitatively valid. PAHdb modeling of JWST observations, and JWST observations smoothed and resampled to the Spitzer-IRS resolution and dispersion have consistent PAHdb derived parameters. Decomposition with different codes, such as PAHFIT and CAFE, produce PAH emission spectra with noticeable variation in the 11-15~$\mu$m region, driving a $\sim7\%$ difference in the neutral PAH fraction under PAHdb modeling. A new library of galaxy PAH emission templates is delivered to be utilized in galaxy SED modeling.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Photometric Selection of `Little Red Dots' in MIRI Fields: An IR-Bright LRD at $z=3.1386$ with Warm Dust Emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: JWST has revealed a population of compact `Little Red Dots' (LRDs) at $z\gtrsim4$, with red rest-frame optical and blue UV colors. These objects are likely compact dusty starbursts or heavily reddened AGNs, playing a pivotal role in early black hole growth, dust production, and stellar assembly. We introduce a new photometric selection to identify LRDs over a broad range in redshifts and rest-frame UV-to-NIR colors enabling a more complete census of the population. This method identifies 248 LRDs with F444W$&lt;27$ mag over 263 arcmin$^2$ in the JADES, PRIMER-COSMOS, and UDS fields with MIRI coverage, increasing the number density by $\times$1.7 compared to previous samples, suggesting that previous census were underestimated. Most LRDs are detected in MIRI/F770W but only 7% (17) are detected in F1800W. We use MIRI-based rest-frame [1$-$3 $\mu$m] colors to trace dust emission. F1800W-detected LRDs have a median [1$-$3 $\mu$m]$=1.5$ mag, with a broad scatter indicative of diverse dust emission properties. About 20% exhibit [1$-$3 $\mu$m]$&lt;1$ mag colors consistent with negligible dust emission, but the majority show significant dust emission at 3 $\mu$m (f$^{\rm dust}_{3\mu m}\lesssim0.8$) from the galaxy ISM or a hot-dust-deficient AGN torus. A correlation between bluer UV-to-NIR colors and stronger IR emission suggests that the bluest LRDs may resemble unobscured QSOs. We report a LRD at $z_{\rm spec}=3.1386$, detected in MIRI, Spitzer/MIPS, and Herschel/PACS. Its IR SED rises steeply at $\lambda_{\rm rest}&gt;6~\mu$m and peaks near $\sim40~\mu$m, providing the first direct evidence of warm dust emission (T$=50-100$ K) in a LRD.</description>

      <title>The multiple classes of ultra-diffuse galaxies: Can we tell them apart?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study compiles stellar populations and internal properties of ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs) to highlight correlations with their local environment, globular cluster (GC) richness, and star formation histories. Complementing our sample of 88 UDGs, we include 36 low-surface brightness dwarf galaxies with UDG-like properties, referred to as NUDGes (nearly-UDGs). All galaxies were studied using the same spectral energy distribution fitting methodology to explore what sets UDGs apart from other galaxies. We show that NUDGes are similar to UDGs in all properties except for being, by definition, smaller and having higher surface brightness. We find that UDGs and NUDGes show similar behaviours in their GC populations, with the most metal-poor galaxies hosting consistently more GCs on average. This suggests that GC content may provide an effective way to distinguish extreme galaxies within the low surface brightness regime alongside traditional parameters like size and surface brightness. We confirm previous results using clustering algorithms that UDGs split into two main classes, which might be associated with the formation pathways of a puffy dwarf and a failed galaxy. The clustering applied to the UDGs+NUDGes dataset yields an equivalent result. The difference in mass contained in the GC system suggests that galaxies in different environments have not simply evolved from one another but may have formed through distinct processes.</description>

      <title>Signatures of Rapidly Rotating Stars with Chemically Homogeneous Evolution in the First Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has revealed an unexpectedly high abundance of UV luminous galaxies at redshifts $z\gtrsim 10$, challenging `standard' galaxy formation models. This study investigates the role of rapidly rotating (massive) stars undergoing chemically homogeneous evolution (CHE) in reconciling this potential tension. These stars are more compact, hotter, and exhibit enhanced UV emission. We find that the rest-frame UV luminosity of star-forming galaxies can be significantly enhanced by a factor of $\sim 3-6$ when CHE stars above a minimum initial mass of $m_{\star,\min}^{\rm CHE}\sim 2-10\ \rm M_\odot$ account for more than half of the total stellar mass following a Salpeter initial mass function. As a result, the UV luminosity functions observed at $z\sim 12-16$ can be reproduced with less extreme values of star formation efficiency and UV luminosity stochastic variability. Our results highlight the potential of CHE in explaining the UV-bright galaxy populations detected by JWST and call for future work to explore the broader astrophysical implications of CHE and its associated phenomena in the early universe, such as gamma-ray bursts, compact object binaries, and metal enrichment.</description>

      <title>ALMA-IMF XVI: Mass-averaged temperature of cores and protostellar luminosities in the ALMA-IMF protoclusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ALMA-IMF imaged 15 massive protoclusters down to a resolution of of 2 kau scales, identifying about 1000 star-forming cores. The mass and luminosity of these cores, which are fundamental physical characteristics, are difficult to determine, a problem greatly exacerbated at the distances &gt;2 kpc of ALMA-IMF protoclusters. We combined new datasets and radiative transfer modeling to characterize these cores. We estimated their mass-averaged temperature and the masses these estimates imply. For 1/6 of the sample, we measured the bolometric luminosities, implementing deblending corrections when necessary. We used spectral energy distribution (SED) analysis obtained with the PPMAP Bayesian procedure, which aims to preserve the best angular resolution of the input data. We extrapolated the luminosity and dust temperature images provided by PPMAP at 2.5" resolution to estimate those of individual cores, which were identified at higher angular resolution. To do this, we applied approximate radiative transfer relationships between the luminosity of a protostar and the temperature of its surrounding envelope and between the external heating of prestellar cores and their temperatures. For the first time, we provide data-informed estimates of dust temperatures for 883 cores identified with ALMA-IMF: 17-31 K and 28-79 K (5th and 95th percentiles, up to 127 K) for the 617 prestellar and 266 protostellar cores, respectively. We also measured protostellar luminosities spanning 20-80 000 Lsun. For hot cores, we estimated systematically lower temperatures than studies based on complex organic molecules. We established a mass-luminosity evolutionary diagram, for the first time at the core spatial resolution and for a large sample of high-mass protostellar cores. The ALMA-IMF data favor a scenario in which protostars accrete their mass from a larger mass reservoir than their host cores.</description>

      <title>IFUM Integrated Field Spectroscopy of Ten M104 Satellite Galaxy Candidates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the spectroscopic analysis of ten satellite galaxy candidates in the sphere of influence of the Sombrero galaxy (M104, NGC4594), based on data obtained with IFUM (Integral Field Units for Magellan). Based on their newly-observed recessional velocities, we confirm that nine of these candidates are satellite galaxies of M104, with one being a background dwarf galaxy. All ten dwarfs have stellar masses $2\times10^{7}\,M_{\odot}$ to $1\times10^{9}\,M_{\odot}$ and mean weighted metallicities $-1.7&lt;\langle{[\mathrm{M/H}]}\rangle&lt;-0.3$. Although these dwarfs are predominantly old, with stellar populations $\sim5-11\,$Gyr. However, this sample contains a local example of a low-mass "Green Pea" candidate, it exhibits extreme optical emission features and broad emission line features ($\sigma\sim250\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$) reminiscent of high-redshift Ly$\alpha$/LyC photon leaking galaxies. Using the newly-acquired recessional velocities of the nine satellites of M104, we find no evidence of coherent satellite motions unlike other nearby $L_*$ galaxy environments. Given the small sample, this results does not statistically rule out such coherent motions. There remain 60 satellite candidates of M104 for which future spectroscopy can more reliably test for such motion. Using the observed dwarf galaxies as tracers of the gravitational potential of M104, we estimate the dynamical mass of M104, $M_{dyn}=(12.4\pm6.5)\times10^{12}M_{\odot}$, and find that, making a reasonable estimate of M104's gas mass, $&gt;90\%$ of its baryons are missing. These results agree with previous measurements of M104's dynamical mass.</description>

      <title>Tracing magnetic field in super-Alfvenic turbulence with Gradient Technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Super-Alfvenic turbulence is important for many astrophysical objects, particularly galaxy clusters. In this paper, we explore the accuracy of Synchrotron Intensity Gradients (SIGs) and X-ray intensity gradients to map magnetic fields in super-Alfvenic turbulence for a set of astrophysically relevant parameters of turbulent driving. Analyzing our synthetic observations, we report a good accuracy for both techniques. Our results are suggestive that other types of Gradient Technique (GT) can be successfully employed to trace magnetic fields within super-Alfvenic sub-sonic turbulence.</description>

      <title>Reverberation Mapping of Two Variable Active Galactic Nuclei: Probing the Distinct Characteristics of the Inner and Outer Broad-line Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current reverberation mapping (RM) studies primarily focus on single emission lines, particularly the \hb\ line, which may not fully reveal the geometry and kinematic properties of the broad-line region (BLR). To overcome this limitation, we conducted multiline RM observations on two highly variable active galactic nuclei (AGNs), KUG 1141+371 and UGC 3374, using the Lijiang 2.4 m telescope. Our goal was to investigate the detailed structure of different regions within the BLR. We measured the time lags of multiple broad emission lines (\ha, \hb, \hg, \hei, and \heii) and found clear evidence of radial ionization stratification in the BLRs of both AGNs. Velocity-resolved RM analysis revealed distinct geometry and kinematics between the inner and outer regions of the BLRs. Assuming that velocity-resolved lags reflect the kinematics of BLR, our observations indicate that: (1) in KUG 1141+371, the inner BLR exhibits outflow signatures, while the outer region is consistent with virialized motion; (2) in UGC 3374, the inner region displays virial motion, while the outer region shows inflow. Furthermore, we detected ``breathing" behavior in the outer BLR regions of both AGN, while the inner BLR regions show ``anti-breathing", which may be linked to intrinsic BLR properties. We discuss these findings in the context of various BLR formation models, highlighting importance of long-term, multiline RM campaigns in understanding of BLR structure and evolution. Additionally, our results suggest that the observed stratification in BLR geometry and kinematics may contribute to the scatter in black hole mass estimates and the rapid changes in velocity-resolved RM signatures reported in recent studies.</description>

      <title>Alignment Parameters: Quantifying Dense Core Alignment in Star-forming Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent high-resolution observations at millimeter (mm) and sub-mm reveal a diverse spatial distribution for sub-pc scale dense cores within star-forming regions, ranging from clustered to aligned arrangements. To address the increasing volume of observational and simulation data, we introduce "alignment parameters" as a quantitative and reproducible method to automatically assess core alignment. We first demonstrate the effectiveness of these parameters by applying them to artificial test clumps and comparing the results with labels from visual inspection. A threshold value is then proposed to differentiate between "clustered" and "aligned" categories. Subsequently, we apply these parameters to dense cores identified from a sample of ALMA 1.3 mm dust continuum images in high-mass star-forming regions. Analysis exploring correlations between alignment parameters and clump properties rules out the presence of moderate or strong correlation, indicating that clump properties do not appear to strongly influence the outcome of fragmentation. One possible explanation for this is that the fragmentation process is chaotic, meaning that small variations in initial conditions can lead to significant differences in fragmentation outcomes, thus obscuring any direct link between clump properties and core alignment/distribution.</description>

      <title>IllustrisTNG Insights: Factors Affecting the Presence of Bars in Disk Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bars are important in the secular evolution of galaxies. This study is aimed at exploring the reasons why some galaxies have bars at redshift $z=0$ while others do not. We use ellipse fitting to measure the properties and evolution of bars in the IllustrisTNG cosmological simulation. By using the K-S two-sample test and tracing their evolutionary changes, we analyze the parameter differences between barred and unbarred galaxies. The properties of galaxies with short bars are also studied. When tracing all disk galaxies at $z=0$ back to $z=1$, all of them show similar bar features at $z=1$. The fraction of bars increases in barred and short-bar galaxies but decreases in unbarred galaxies during $z=1-0$. In the case of disk galaxies with stellar mass log$(M_*/M_\odot)&gt; 10.8$, nurture (mainly mergers) plays the most important role in suppressing or destroying bars. Bars are more likely to endure in galaxies that experience fewer mergers, which can be quantified by smaller stellar halos and ex-situ mass fractions. Approximately 60\% of the unbarred galaxies in the local Universe once had a bar. In contrast, the lack of responsiveness to bar instabilities (a larger Toomre-Q parameter) due to a less compact nature plays an important role in generating unbarred disk galaxies with stellar mass log$(M_*/M_\odot)&lt;10.8$. Moreover, short bars generally form at a similar time to normal bars, during which they either grow mildly or contract significantly. The fact that IllustrisTNG simulations may produce too many short-bar galaxies indicates that the dynamical properties of the central regions in IllustrisTNG galaxies are less likely to be affected by external factors, such as mergers and gas inflows.</description>

      <title>Wandering and escaping: recoiling massive black holes in cosmological simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: After a merger of two massive black holes (MBHs), the remnant receives a gravitational wave (GW) recoil kick that can have a strong effect on its future evolution. The magnitude of the kick ($v_\mathrm{recoil}$) depends on the mass ratio and the alignment of the spins and orbital angular momenta, therefore on the previous evolution of the MBHs. We investigate the cosmic effect of GW recoil by running for the first time a high-resolution cosmological simulation including GW recoil that depends on the MBH spins (evolved through accretion and mergers), masses and dynamics computed self-consistently. We also run a twin simulation without GW recoil. The simulations are run down to $z=4.4$. We find that GW recoil reduces the growth of merger remnants, and can have a significant effect on the MBH-galaxy correlations and the merger rate. We find large recoil kicks across all galaxy masses in the simulation, up to a few $10^{11}\,\rm M_\odot$. The effect of recoil can be significant even if the MBHs are embedded in a rotationally supported gaseous structure. We investigate the dynamics of recoiling MBHs and find that MBHs remain in the centre of the host galaxy for low $v_\mathrm{recoil}/v_\mathrm{esc}$ and escape rapidly for high $v_\mathrm{recoil}/v_\mathrm{esc}$. Only if $v_\mathrm{recoil}$ is comparable to $v_\mathrm{esc}$ the MBHs escape the central region of the galaxy but might remain as wandering MBHs until the end of the simulation. Recoiling MBHs are a significant fraction of the wandering MBH population. Although the dynamics of recoiling MBHs may be complex, some retain their initial radial orbits but are difficult to discern from other wandering MBHs on radial orbits. Others scatter with the halo substructure or circularise in the asymmetric potential. Our work highlights the importance of including GW recoil in cosmological simulation models.</description>

Abstract: We present a catalogue of photometric redshifts for galaxies from DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys, which includes $\sim0.18$ billion sources covering 14,000 ${\rm deg}^2$. The photometric redshifts, along with their uncertainties, are estimated through galaxy images in three optical bands ($g$, $r$ and $z$) from DESI and two near-infrared bands ($W1$ and $W2$) from WISE using a Bayesian Neural Network (BNN). The training of BNN is performed by above images and their corresponding spectroscopic redshifts given in DESI Early Data Release (EDR). Our results show that categorizing galaxies into individual groups based on their inherent characteristics and estimating their photo-$z$s within their group separately can effectively improve the performance. Specifically, the galaxies are categorized into four distinct groups based on DESI's target selection criteria: Bright Galaxy Sample (BGS), Luminous Red Galaxies (LRG), Emission Line Galaxies (ELG) and a group comprising the remaining sources, referred to as NON. As measured by outliers of $|\Delta z| &gt; 0.15 (1 + z_{\rm true})$, accuracy $\sigma_{\rm NMAD}$ and mean uncertainty $\overline{E}$ for BNN, we achieve low outlier percentage, high accuracy and low uncertainty: 0.14%, 0.018 and 0.0212 for BGS and 0.45%, 0.026 and 0.0293 for LRG respectively, surpassing results without categorization. However, the photo-$z$s for ELG cannot be reliably estimated, showing result of $&gt;15\%$, $\sim0.1$ and $\sim0.1$ irrespective of training strategy. On the other hand, NON sources can reach 1.9%, 0.039 and 0.0445 when a magnitude cut of $z&lt;21.3$ is applied. Our findings demonstrate that estimating photo-$z$s directly from galaxy images is significantly potential, and to achieve high-quality photo-$z$ measurement for ongoing and future large-scale imaging survey, it is sensible to implement categorization of sources based on their characteristics.</description>

      <title>The influence of the bar on the chaotic dynamics of globular clusters in the central region of the Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper is devoted to the analysis of the influence of the galactic bar on the nature of the orbital motion (chaotic or regular) of globular clusters in the central region of the Galaxy with a radius of 3.5 kpc, which are subject to the greatest influence of the bar. The sample includes 45 globular clusters. To form the 6D phase space required for integrating the orbits, the most accurate astrometric data to date from the Gaia satellite (Vasiliev, Baumgardt, 2021) were used, as well as new refined average distances (Baumgardt, Vasiliev, 2021). The orbits of the globular clusters were obtained both in an axisymmetric potential and in a potential including the bar. The following, most realistic, bar parameters were adopted: mass $10^{10} M_\odot$, semi-major axis length 5 kpc, bar axis rotation angle 25$^o$, angular rotation velocity 40 km s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$. The analysis of the chaoticity/regularity of the orbital motion in both potentials was carried out using one of the most effective methods, namely, the frequency method, which consists in calculating the drift of fundamental frequencies. As a result, the influence of the bar on the dynamics of each GC of the sample was assessed. It is established that 8 GCs changed regular dynamics to chaotic under the influence of the bar, and 9 GCs changed chaotic dynamics to regular one.</description>

      <title>Nature versus nurture in galaxy formation: the effect of environment on star formation with causal machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how galaxies form and evolve is at the heart of modern astronomy. With the advent of large-scale surveys and simulations, remarkable progress has been made in the last few decades. Despite this, the physical processes behind the phenomena, and particularly their importance, remain far from known, as correlations have primarily been established rather than the underlying causality. We address this challenge by applying the causal inference framework. Specifically, we tackle the fundamental open question of whether galaxy formation and evolution depends more on nature (i.e., internal processes) or nurture (i.e., external processes), by estimating the causal effect of environment on star-formation rate in the IllustrisTNG simulations. To do so, we develop a comprehensive causal model and employ cutting-edge techniques from epidemiology to overcome the long-standing problem of disentangling nature and nurture. We find that the causal effect is negative and substantial, with environment suppressing the SFR by a maximal factor of $\sim100$. While the overall effect at $z=0$ is negative, in the early universe, environment is discovered to have a positive impact, boosting star formation by a factor of $\sim10$ at $z\sim1$ and by even greater amounts at higher redshifts. Furthermore, we show that: (i) nature also plays an important role, as ignoring it underestimates the causal effect in intermediate-density environments by a factor of $\sim2$, (ii) controlling for the stellar mass at a snapshot in time, as is common in the literature, is not only insufficient to disentangle nature and nurture but actually has an adverse effect, though (iii) stellar mass is an adequate proxy of the effects of nature. Finally, this work may prove a useful blueprint for extracting causal insights in other fields that deal with dynamical systems with closed feedback loops, such as the Earth's climate.</description>

      <title>The ALPINE-ALMA [CII] Survey: Unveiling the baryon evolution in the ISM of $z\sim5$ star-forming galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observations reveal a rapid dust build-up in high-redshift galaxies (z &gt; 4), challenging current models of galaxy formation. While our understanding of dust production and destruction in the interstellar medium (ISM) is advancing, probing baryonic processes in the early Universe remains a complex task. We characterize the evolution of 98 z~5 star-forming galaxies observed as part of the ALPINE survey by constraining the physical processes underpinning the gas and dust production, consumption, and destruction in their ISM. We make use of chemical evolution models to simultaneously reproduce the observed dust and gas content. For each galaxy, we estimate initial gas mass, inflows and outflows, and efficiencies of dust growth and destruction. We test the models with the canonical Chabrier and top-heavy initial mass functions (IMFs), with the latter enabling rapid dust production on shorter timescales. Our models successfully reproduce gas and dust content in older galaxies (&gt; 600 Myr) regardless of the IMF, with Type II SNe as the primary dust source and no dust growth in ISM with moderate inflow of primordial gas. In case of intermediate-age galaxies (300 - 600 Myr), we reproduce the gas and dust content through Type II SNe and dust growth in ISM, though we observe an over-prediction of dust mass in older galaxies, potentially indicating an unaccounted dust destruction mechanism and/or an overestimation of the observed dust masses. The number of young galaxies (&lt; 300 Myr) reproduced, increases for models assuming top-heavy IMF but with maximal prescriptions of dust production. Galactic outflows are necessary to reproduce observed gas and dust masses. The Chabrier IMF models reproduce 65% of galaxies, while top-heavy IMF models improve this to 93%, easing tensions with observations. Upcoming JWST data will refine these models by resolving degeneracies in intrinsic galaxy properties.</description>

      <title>Dust emission from the bulk of galaxies at the Epoch of Reionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: [Abridged] Our view of dust in primordial galaxies is limited towards a few tens of z~7 galaxies, pre-selected from UV-optical observations, and are thus not necessarily representative of the bulk of the sources at these redshifts. In this work, we aim at constraining the dust properties of galaxies at 6&lt;z&lt;12 by making the most of the A3COSMOS database in the JADES/GOODS-South field. We stacked ALMA band 6 and 7 observations of 4464 galaxies covered by the A3COSMOS database and used the measurements as constraints to perform UV-to-FIR SED modelling. We obtain tentative signals for the brightest UV galaxies (MUV&lt;-19mag) as well as for the most massive ones (log Mstar&gt;9) at 6&lt;z&lt;7, and upper limits for fainter (MUV&gt;-19mag), lower mass sources (log Mstar&lt;9), and at higher redshift (z&gt;7). Fitting these 6&lt;z&lt;7 galaxies with ALMA constraints results in lower star formation rates (-0.4dex) and FUV attenuation (-0.5mag) for galaxies with log Mstar&gt;8, compared to the fit without FIR. We extend the LIR vs MUV relation down to MUV=-19mag and show a tentative breakdown of the relation at fainter UV magnitudes. The positions of the JADES z~6.5 sample on the IRX versus beta and IRX versus Mstar diagrams are consistent with those of the ALPINE (z~5.5) and REBELS (z~6.5) samples, suggesting that the dust composition and content of our mass-selected sample are similar to these UV-selected galaxies. Extending our analysis of the infrared properties to z&gt;7 galaxies, we find a non-evolution of beta with redshift in the MUV range probed by our sample (-17.24+/-0.62) and highlight the fact that samples from the literature are not representative of the bulk of galaxy populations at z&gt;6. We confirm a linear relation between AV and 1/sSFR with a flatter slope than previously reported due to the use of ALMA constraints. Our results suggest that rapid and significant dust production has already happened by z~7.</description>

      <title>High-z stellar masses can be recovered robustly with JWST photometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robust inference of galaxy stellar masses from photometry is crucial for constraints on galaxy assembly across cosmic time. Here, we test a commonly-used Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) fitting code, using simulated galaxies from the SPHINX20 cosmological radiation hydrodynamics simulation, with JWST NIRCam photometry forward-modelled with radiative transfer. Fitting the synthetic photometry with various star formation history models, we show that recovered stellar masses are, encouragingly, generally robust to within a factor of ~3 for galaxies in the range M*~10^7-10^9M_sol at z=5-10. These results are in stark contrast to recent work claiming that stellar masses can be underestimated by as much as an order of magnitude in these mass and redshift ranges. However, while &gt;90% of masses are recovered to within 0.5dex, there are notable systematic trends, with stellar masses typically overestimated for low-mass galaxies (M*&lt;~10^8M_sol) and slightly underestimated for high-mass galaxies (M*&gt;~10^9M_sol). We demonstrate that these trends arise due to the SED fitting code poorly modelling the impact of strong emission lines on broadband photometry. These systematic trends, which exist for all star formation history parametrisations tested, have a tilting effect on the inferred stellar mass function, with number densities of massive galaxies underestimated (particularly at the lowest redshifts studied) and number densities of lower-mass galaxies typically overestimated. Overall, this work suggests that we should be optimistic about our ability to infer the masses of high-z galaxies observed with JWST (notwithstanding contamination from AGN) but careful when modelling the impact of strong emission lines on broadband photometry.</description>

      <title>Mon R2: A Hub-Filament System with an Infrared Bubble at the Hub center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A multi-wavelength, multi-scale study of the Mon R2 hub-filament system (HFS) reveals a spiral structure, with the central hub containing more mass than its filaments. ALMA C$^{18}$O(1-0) emission reveals several accreting filaments connected to a molecular ring (size $\sim$0.18 pc $\times$ 0.26 pc). The molecular ring surrounds the infrared (IR) ring (size $\sim$0.12 pc $\times$ 0.16 pc), which is not usually observed. The IR ring encircles IR dark regions and a population of embedded near-IR sources, including the massive stars IRS 1 and IRS 2. ALMA HNC(3-2) line data reveal a mirrored B-shaped feature (extent $\sim$19000 AU $\times$ 39000 AU) toward the eastern part of the molecular ring, suggesting expansion at $\sim$2.25 km s$^{-1}$. Distinct HNC sub-structures in both redshifted and blueshifted velocity components are investigated toward the B-shaped feature. The presence of these braid-like substructures in each velocity component strongly suggests instability in photon-dominated regions. A dusty shell-like feature (extent $\sim$0.04 pc $\times$ 0.07 pc; mass $\sim$7 M$_{\odot}$) hosting IRS 1 is identified in the ALMA 1.14 mm continuum map, centered toward the base of the B-shaped feature. The IR and dense molecular rings are likely shaped by feedback from massive stars, driven by high pressure values between 10$^{-8}$-10$^{-10}$ dynes cm$^{-2}$, observed within a 1 pc range of the B0 ZAMS star powering the ultracompact HII region. Overall, these outcomes support that the Mon R2 HFS transitioned from IR-quiet to IR-bright, driven by the interaction between gas accretion and feedback from massive stars.</description>

      <title>An unbiased statistical study of the metallicity of core-collapse supernovae based on VLT/MUSE integral-field-unit spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metallicity plays a crucial role in the evolution of massive stars and their final core-collapse supernova (CCSN) explosions. Integral-field-unit (IFU) spectroscopy can provide a spatially resolved view of SN host galaxies and serve as a powerful tool to study SN metallicities. Early transient surveys targeted bright galaxies with high star formation and SN rates; as a result, the discovered SNe are significantly biased toward high metallicities. More recently, the untargeted, wide-field transient surveys, such as ASAS-SN and ZTF, have discovered a large number of SNe without such a bias. In this work, we construct a large and unbiased sample of SNe discovered by (quasi-) untargted searches, consisting of 209 SNe of Types II (with unknown subtypes), IIP, IIn, IIb, Ib and Ic at z $\leq$ 0.02 with VLT/MUSE observations. This is currently the largest CCSN sample with IFU observations. With the strong-line method, we reveal the spatially-resolved metallicity maps of the SN host galaxies and acquire accurate metallicity measurements for the SN sites. Our results show that the SN metallicities range from 12 + log(O/H) = 8.1 to 8.7 dex, and the metallicity distributions for different SN types are very close to each other, with mean and median values of 8.4 - 8.5 dex. We carefully analysed the stochastic sampling effect, showing that our large sample size narrows the 1$\sigma$ uncertainty down to only 0.05 dex. The apparent metallicity differences among SN types are all within 3$\sigma$ uncertainties and the metallicity distributions for different SN types are all consistent with being randomly drawn from the same reference distribution. This suggests that metallicity plays a minor role in the origin of different CCSN types and some other metallicity-insensitive processes, such as binary interaction, dominate the distinction of CCSN types.</description>

      <title>In Search of Extraterrestrial Artificial Intelligence through the Dyson Sphere-like structures around the Primordial Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Are we alone? It is a compelling question that human beings have confronted for centuries. The search for extraterrestrial life is a broad range of quests for finding the simple forms of life up to intelligent beings in the Universe. The plausible assumption is that there is a chance that intelligent life will followed by advanced civilization equipped or even dominated by artificial intelligence (AI). In this work, we categorize the advanced civilizations (on an equal footing, an AI-dominated civilization) on the Kardashev scale. We propose a new scale known as space exploration distance to measure civilization advancement. We propose a relation between this length and the Kardashev scale. Then, we suggest the idea that advanced civilizations will use primordial black holes as sources of harvesting energy. We calculate the energy harvested by calculating the space exploration distance. Finally, we propose an observational method to detect the possibility of extraterrestrial AI using Dyson spheres-like structures around primordial black holes in the Milky Way and other galaxies.</description>

      <title>Molecular gas and dust properties in $z&gt;7$ quasar hosts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observational campaigns hunting the elusive reservoirs of cold gas in the host galaxies of quasars at the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) are crucial to study the formation and evolution of the first massive systems at early epochs.
  We present new Northern Extended Millimetre Array (NOEMA) observations tracing CO(6--5), CO(7--6) emission lines, and the underlying continuum in five of the eight quasars at redshift $z&gt;7$ known to date, thus completing the survey of the cold molecular gas reservoir in the host galaxies of the first quasars.
  Combining NOEMA observations with archival Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) data available, we model the far-infrared spectral energy distribution with a modified blackbody to measure dust properties and star formation rates.
  We use CO and [CII] lines to derive molecular gas masses, which we compare with results from semi-analytical models and observations of galaxies at different epochs.
  No statistically significant detection of CO emission lines was reported for the five quasars in this sample, resulting in a relatively low amount of cold molecular gas in the host when compared with galaxies at later epochs.
  Nonetheless, gas-to-dust ratios are consistent with the local value, suggesting that the scaling relation between dust and cold gas holds up to $z&gt;7$.
  Quasars at the EoR show star formation efficiencies which are among the highest observed so far, but comparable with that observed in luminous quasar at Cosmic Noon and that predicted for the brightest ($L_{bol}&gt;3\times10^{46}$ erg s$^{-1}$) quasar objects drawn from the semi-analytical model GAEA.
  Quasar host galaxies at the EoR are undergoing an intense phase of star formation, which suggests a strong coupling between the luminous phase of the quasar and the rapid growth of the host.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Diversity of Faint Satellites in the M81 Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the last decade, we have been able to probe further down the galaxy luminosity function than ever before and expand into the regime of ultra-faint dwarfs (UFDs), which are some of the best probes we have of small-scale cosmology and galaxy formation. Digital sky surveys have enabled the discovery and study of these incredibly low-mass, highly dark-matter dominated systems around the Local Group, but it is critical that we expand the satellite census further out to understand if Milky Way and M31 satellites are representative of dwarf populations in the local Universe. Using data from HST/ACS, we present updated characterization of four satellite systems in the M81 group. These systems - D1005+68, D1006+69, DWJ0954+6821, and D1009+68 - were previously discovered using ground-based Subaru HSC data as overdensities in M81's halo and are now confirmed with HST/ACS by this work. These are all faint (M_V &gt;= -7.9) and consistent with old (~13 Gyr), metal-poor ([M/H] &lt; -1.5) populations. Each system possesses relatively unusual features - including one of the most concentrated satellite galaxies with a Sersic index of n ~ 5, one of the most elliptical galaxies outside the Local Group with an e ~ 0.6, and one of the most compact galaxies for its magnitude. Two of the satellites have very low surface brightness, lower than most known galaxies in this absolute magnitude range. This work previews the scientific promise of the upcoming Rubin Observatory and Roman Telescope for illuminating the diversity of UFDs in the Local Volume and beyond.</description>

      <title>A distance measurement of galaxies from JWST using star formation rate-stellar mass relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use the star formation rate-stellar mass relation ($SFR - {M_ * }$) of galaxies to measure their luminosity distances as well as estimate cosmological parameters. We obtain a sample of 341 high-redshift galaxies at $5 &lt; z &lt; 14$, and 51 others at $1.8 &lt; z &lt; 3.5$ from the JWST observations, which can be used to investigate the correlation between the star formation rate and stellar mass, and determine their cosmological distance. The relation $SFR \propto {\kern 1pt} {({M_ * }/{M_ \odot })^\gamma }$ can be applied to check the nonlinear correlation between the star formation rate and stellar mass ${M_ * }$ of galaxies and give their distance. On the other hand, it also can be used to test if the $SFR - {M_ * }$ relation depends on the absolute UV magnitude ${M_{UV}}$, and the data suggest that the $SFR $ is positively correlated with stellar mass, the $SFR - {M_ * }$ relation of the high-redshift galaxies has an absolute magnitude dependence. Finally, we apply a combination of galaxies and Type Ia supernova (SNIa) Pantheon to test the property of dark energy concerning whether or not its density deviates from the constant, and give the statistical results.</description>

      <title>Performance of Photometric Template Fitting for Ultra-High Redshift Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: JWST has allowed the discovery of a significant population of galaxies at z &gt; 10. Our understanding of the astrophysical properties of these ultra-high redshift galaxies relies on fitting templates, developed using astrophysical models representing our current understanding of high-redshift galaxies. In this work, the highest confidence recent JWST spectroscopic observations are used to evaluate the performance of several high-redshift templates based on two tests: (1) comparing photometric redshifts against spectroscopic redshifts; and (2) comparing the reconstructed spectral energy distributions against observed SEDs. Strict sample selection and error-propagation by bootstrapping is employed to make results robust towards future JWST systematics mitigation. It is shown that some templates perform adequately at high redshift prediction, given a sample selection by observational filters and depth. Other templates work better for SED fitting, but a few objects remain unrepresented in their spectra. We conclude that although templates are usable, models are not yet able to reliably extract astrophysical properties.</description>

      <title>From eccentric binaries to nonstationary gravitational wave backgrounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A large population of binary systems in the Universe emitting gravitational waves (GW) would produce a stochastic noise, known as the gravitational wave background (GWB). The properties of the GWB directly depend on the attributes of its constituents. If the binary systems are in eccentric orbits, it is well established that the GW power they radiate strongly depends on their instantaneous orbital phase. Consequently, their power spectrum varies over time, and the resulting GWB can appear nonstationary. In this work, we estimate the amplitude of time-dependent fluctuations in the GWB power spectrum as a function of the eccentricity of the binaries. Specifically, we focus on the GWB produced by a population of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHB) that should be observable by pulsar timing arrays (PTA). We show that a large population of homogeneously distributed equal SMBHBs produces nonstationary features that are undetectable by current PTA datasets. However, using more realistic and astrophysically motivated populations of SMBHBs, we show that the nonstationarity might become very large and detectable, especially in the case of more massive and eccentric populations. In particular, when one binary is slightly brighter than the GWB, we demonstrate that time fluctuations can become significant. This is also true for individual binary systems with a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) relative to the GWB (SNR $\approx$ 1), which standard data analysis methods would struggle to detect. The detection of nonstationary features in the GWB could indicate the presence of some relatively bright GW sources in eccentric orbits, offering new insights into the origins of the signal.</description>

      <title>Imaging the innermost circumstellar environment of the red supergiant WOH G64 in the Large Magellanic Cloud</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Significant mass loss in the red supergiant (RSG) phase has great influence on the evolution of massive stars and their final fate as supernovae. We present near-infrared interferometric imaging of the circumstellar environment of the dust-enshrouded RSG WOH G64 in the Large Magellanic Cloud. WOH G64 was observed with the GRAVITY instrument at ESO's Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI) at 2.0--2.45 micron. We succeeded in imaging the innermost circumstellar environment of WOH G64 -- the first interferometric imaging of an RSG outside the Milky Way. The reconstructed image reveals elongated compact emission with a semimajor and semiminor axis of ~2 and ~1.5 mas (~13 and 9 stellar radii), respectively. The GRAVITY data show that the stellar flux contribution at 2.2 micron at the time of our observations in 2020 is much lower than predicted by the optically and geometrically thick dust torus model based on the VLTI/MIDI data taken in 2005 and 2007. We found a significant change in the near-infrared spectrum of WOH G64: while the (spectro)photometric data taken at 1--2.5 micron before 2003 show the spectrum of the central RSG with H2O absorption, the spectra and JHK' photometric data taken after 2016 are characterized by a monotonically rising continuum with very weak signatures of H2O. This spectral change likely took place between December 2009 and 2016. On the other hand, the mid-infrared spectrum obtained in 2022 with VLT/VISIR agrees well with the spectra obtained before 2007. The compact emission imaged with GRAVITY and the near-infrared spectral change suggest the formation of hot new dust close to the star, which gives rise to the monotonically rising near-infrared continuum and the high obscuration of the central star. The elongation of the emission may be due to the presence of a bipolar outflow or effects of an unseen companion.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave mergers of accreting binary black holes in AGN discs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Binary black hole (BBH) evolution in the discs of active galactic nuclei (AGN) is a promising channel for gravitational wave (GW)-driven mergers. It is however unclear whether binaries interacting with the surrounding disc undergo orbital contraction or expansion. We develop a simple analytic model of accreting BBHs in AGN discs to follow the orbital evolution from the disc-dominated regime at large separations into the GW-driven regime at small separations (the coupled `disc+GW'-driven evolution). We obtain that accreting binaries expand in thick discs with aspect ratio greater than a critical value ($&gt; h_\mathrm{crit}$); whereas accreting binaries contract and eventually merge in thin discs ($&lt; h_\mathrm{crit}$). Interestingly, accreting BBHs can experience faster mergers compared to non-accreting counterparts, with a non-monotonic dependence on the disc aspect ratio. The orbital contraction is usually coupled with eccentricity growth in the disc-dominated regime, which lead to accelerated inspirals in the GW-driven regime. We quantify the resulting BBH merger timescales in AGN discs ($\tau_\mathrm{merger} \sim 10^5 - 10^7$ yr) and estimate the associated GW merger rates ($\mathcal{R} \sim (0.2 - 5) \, \text{Gpc}^{-3} \text{yr}^{-1}$). Overall, accreting binaries may efficiently contract and merge in thin discs, hence this particular BBH-in-AGN channel may provide a non-negligible contribution to the observed GW merger event rate.</description>

      <title>Smart Kanata: A Framework for Autonomous Decision Making in Rapid Follow-up Observations of Cataclysmic Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Studying the early stages of transient events provides crucial information about the fundamental physical processes in cataclysmic variables (CVs). However, determining an appropriate observation mode immediately after the discovery of a new transient presents challenges due to significant uncertainties regarding its nature. We developed a framework designed for autonomous decision making in prompt follow-up observations of CVs using the Kanata 1.5-m telescope. The system, named Smart Kanata, first estimates the class probabilities of variable star types using a generative model. It then selects the optimal observation mode from three possible options based on the mutual information calculated from the class probabilities. We have operated the system for ~300 days and obtained 21 samples, among which automated observations were successfully performed for a nova and a microlensing event. In the time-series spectra of the nova V4370 Oph, we detected a rapid deepening of the absorption component of the H_alpha line. These initial results demonstrate the capability of Smart Kanata in facilitating rapid observations and improving our understanding of outbursts and eruptions of CVs and other galactic transients.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Methods for Automated Interstellar Object Classification with LSST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Legacy Survey of Space and Time, to be conducted with the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, is poised to revolutionize our understanding of the Solar System by providing an unprecedented wealth of data on various objects, including the elusive interstellar objects (ISOs). Detecting and classifying ISOs is crucial for studying the composition and diversity of materials from other planetary systems. However, the rarity and brief observation windows of ISOs, coupled with the vast quantities of data to be generated by LSST, create significant challenges for their identification and classification. This study aims to address these challenges by exploring the application of machine learning algorithms to the automated classification of ISO tracklets in simulated LSST data. We employed various machine learning algorithms, including random forests (RFs), stochastic gradient descent (SGD), gradient boosting machines (GBMs), and neural networks (NNs), to classify ISO tracklets in simulated LSST data. We demonstrate that GBM and RF algorithms outperform SGD and NN algorithms in accurately distinguishing ISOs from other Solar System objects. RF analysis shows that many derived Digest2 values are more important than direct observables in classifying ISOs from the LSST tracklets. The GBM model achieves the highest precision, recall, and F1 score, with values of 0.9987, 0.9986, and 0.9987, respectively. These findings lay the foundation for the development of an efficient and robust automated system for ISO discovery using LSST data, paving the way for a deeper understanding of the materials and processes that shape planetary systems beyond our own. The integration of our proposed machine learning approach into the LSST data processing pipeline will optimize the survey's potential for identifying these rare and valuable objects, enabling timely follow-up observations and further characterization.</description>

      <title>Measurements and simulations of rate coefficients for the deuterated forms of the H2 + + H2 and H3 + + H2 reactive systems at low temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rate coefficients of various isotopic variations of the H2+ + H2 and H3+ + H2 reactions in the 10-250 K temperature range were measured using a cryogenic 22 pole radio frequency ion trap. The processes involving diatomic ions were found to behave close to the Langevin rate, whereas temperature-dependent rate coefficients were obtained for the four isotopic exchange processes with triatomic ions. Fitting the experimental data using a chemical code allowed us in specific cases to constrain rate coefficients that were not directly measured in the ion trap. The reported rate coefficients suggest a more efficient hydrogenation of deuterated H3+ forms than usually assumed in astrochemical models, which might affect deuteration rates in warmer environments.</description>

      <title>A visibility-based angular bispectrum estimator for radio-interferometric data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Considering radio-interferometric observations, we present a fast and efficient estimator to compute the binned angular bispectrum (ABS) from gridded visibility data. The estimator makes use of Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) techniques to compute the bispectrum covering all possible triangle shapes and sizes. Here, we present the formalism of the estimator and validate it using simulated visibility data for the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) observations at $\nu=154.25$ MHz. We find that our estimator is able to faithfully recover the ABS of the simulated sky signal with $\approx 10-15 \%$ accuracy for a wide variety of triangle shapes and sizes across the range of angular multipoles $46 \le \ell \le 1320$. In future work, we plan to apply this to actual data and also generalize it to estimate the three-dimensional redshifted 21-cm bispectrum.</description>

      <title>Probing jet dynamics and collimation in radio galaxies. Application to NGC 1052</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. Radio galaxies with visible two-sided jet structures, such as NGC 1052, are sources of particular interest to study the collimation and shock structure of active galactic nuclei jets. High-resolution very-long-baseline interferometry observations of such sources can resolve and study the jet collimation profile and probe different physical mechanisms. Aims. In this paper, we study the physics of double-sided radio sources at parsec scales, and in particular investigate whether propagating shocks can give rise to the observed asymmetry between jet and counterjet. Methods. We carry out special relativistic hydrodynamic simulations and perform radiative transfer calculations of an over-pressured perturbed jet. During the radiative transfer calculations we incorporate both thermal and nonthermal emission while taking the finite speed of light into account. To further compare our results to observations, we create more realistic synthetic data including the properties of the observing array as well as the image reconstruction via multifrequency regularized maximum likelihood methods. We finally introduce a semi-automatized method for tracking jet components and extracting jet kinematics. Results. We show that propagating shocks in an inherently symmetric double-sided jet can lead to partially asymmetric jet collimation profiles due to time delay effects and relativistic beaming. These asymmetries may appear on specific epochs, with one jet evolving near conically and the other one parabolically (width profile evolving with a slope of 1 and 0.5, respectively). However, these spurious asymmetries are not significant when observing the source evolve for an extended amount of time. Conclusions. Purely observational effects are not enough to explain a persisting asymmetry in the jet collimation profile of double-sided jet sources and hint at evidence for asymmetrically launched jets.</description>

      <title>Temporal-spatial distribution of YSOs nearby Taurus region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Taurus region is one of the most extensively studied star-forming regions. Surveys indicate that the young stars in this region are comprised of Young Stellar Objects (YSOs) that cluster in groups associated with the molecular cloud (Grouped Young Stellar Objects, GYSOs), and some older ones that are sparsely distributed throughout the region (Distributed Young Stellar Objects, DYSOs). To bridge the age gap between the GYSOs ($\le$5 Myr) and the DYSOs (10-20 Myr), we conducted a survey to search for new YSOs in this direction. Based on infrared color excesses and Li I absorption lines, we identified 145 new YSOs. Combining these with the previously identified GYSOs and DYSOs, we constructed a sample of 519 YSOs that encompasses the entire region. Subsequently, we calculated the ages of the sample based on their proximity to the local bubble. The age versus Distance to the Local Bubble ($D_{\rm LB}$) relationship for the DYSOs shows a clear trend: the farther they are from the Local Bubble, the younger they are, which is consistent with the supernovae-driven formation scenario of the Local Bubble. The GYSOs also exhibit a mild age versus $D_{\rm LB}$ trend. However, they are significantly younger and are mostly confined to distances of 120 to 220 pc. Considering their distribution in the age versus $D_{\rm LB}$ space is well separated from the older DYSOs, they may also be products of the Local Bubble but formed in more recent and localized events.</description>

Abstract: Triple star systems are critical for understanding stellar dynamics and compact objects in astrophysics, yet confirmed hierarchical triples identified via spectroscopy remain limited. In this study, we identified 23 triple systems by cross-matching the Gaia DR3 non-single star catalog with LAMOST DR10 spectroscopic data; 18 of them are new discoveries. For two well-observed triples, we performed radial velocity curve fitting and light curve analysis to determine their orbital parameters, with inner and outer periods of 1.26 days and 656 days for one triple, and 3.42 days and 422 days for the other. We compared the results with other studies. We also analyzed the radial velocities (RVs) of these 23 triples, revealing a range of $V$ from approximately 40~km~s$^{-1}$ to 210~km~s$^{-1}$. Due to spectral resolution and detection limitations, velocity differences below 45~km~s$^{-1}$ in binaries and below 90~km~s$^{-1}$ in the inner binaries of triple systems are challenging to detect. Consequently, our detection range for inner orbital periods is restricted to 0.2--20 days, with the highest efficiency for periods under 10 days. These findings underscore the advantage of spectroscopic observations for identifying triple systems with short inner orbital periods.</description>

      <title>Devouring The Centaurus A Satellites: Modeling Dwarf Galaxies with Galacticus</title>

Abstract: For the first time, systematic studies of dwarf galaxies are being conducted throughout the Local Volume, including the dwarf satellites of the nearby giant elliptical galaxy Centaurus A (NGC 5128). Given Centaurus As mass (roughly ten times larger than that of the Milky Way), AGN activity, and recent major mergers, investigating the dwarf galaxies of Centaurus A and their star formation physics is imperative. However, simulating the faintest dwarfs around a galaxy of Centaurus As mass with sufficient resolution in a hydrodynamic simulation is computationally expensive and currently infeasible. In this study, we seek to reproduce the properties of Centaurus A dwarfs using the semi-analytic model Galacticus to model dwarfs within a 700 kpc region around Centaurus A, corresponding approximately to its splashback radius. We investigate the effects of host halo mass and environment and predict observable properties of Centaurus A dwarfs using astrophysical prescriptions and parameters previously tuned to match properties of the Milky Way's satellite galaxies. This approach allows us to approximately replicate cumulative luminosity functions, and luminosity metallicity and luminosity half-light-radii relations observed in the Centaurus A satellites. We provide predictions for the velocity dispersions, and star formation histories of Centaurus A dwarfs. The agreement between our predicted star formation histories for Centaurus A dwarfs and those of the Milky Way dwarfs implies the presence of universal processes governing star formation in the dwarf galaxies. Overall, our findings shed light on the star formation physics of dwarf galaxies in the Centaurus A system, revealing insights into their properties and dependence on the host environment.</description>

      <title>The magnetic field of the Radcliffe Wave: starlight polarization at nearest approach to the Sun</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03765v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the geometry of the magnetic field towards the Radcliffe Wave, a coherent 3-kpc-long part of the nearby Local Arm recently discovered via three-dimensional dust mapping. We use archival stellar polarization in the optical and new measurements in the near-infrared to trace the magnetic field as projected on the plane of the sky. Our new observations cover the portion of the structure that is closest to the Sun, between Galactic longitudes of 122$^\circ$ and 188$^\circ$. The polarization angles of stars immediately background to the Radcliffe Wave appear to be aligned with the structure as projected on the plane of the sky. The observed magnetic field configuration is inclined with respect to the Galactic disk at an angle of 18$^\circ$. This departure from a geometry parallel to the plane of the Galaxy is contrary to previous constraints from more distant stars and polarized dust emission. We confirm that the polarization angle of stars at larger distances shows a mean orientation parallel to the Galactic disk. We discuss implications of the observed morphology of the magnetic field for models of the large-scale Galactic magnetic field, as well as formation scenarios for the Radcliffe Wave itself.</description>

      <title>Polarization of active galactic nuclei with significant VLBI-Gaia displacements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12226v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Numerous studies have reported significant displacements in the coordinates of active galactic nuclei between measurements using radio interferometry techniques and those obtained by the Gaia space observatory. There is a consensus that these discrepancies do indeed manifest astrometrically resolved sub-components of AGN rather than random measurement noise. Among other evidence, it has been reported that AGN with VLBI-to-Gaia displacements (VGD) pointing downstream their parsec-scale radio jets exhibit higher optical polarization compared to sources with the opposite VGD orientation. We aim to verify this previously reported connection between optical polarization and VGD-jet angle using a larger dataset of polarimetric measurements and updated Gaia DR3 positions. We also seek additional evidence supporting the disc-jet dichotomy as an explanation of such a connection by using mm-wave polarization and multi-band optical polarization measurements. We performed optical polarimetric observations of 152 AGN using three telescopes. We cross-match public astrometric data from VLBI and Gaia experiments, obtain corresponding positional displacements, and join this catalog with the polarimetric and jet directions data. AGN with downstream VGD are confirmed to have significantly higher optical fractional polarization than the upstream sample. At the same time, the mm-wavelength polarization of the two samples demonstrates very similar distributions. Our results support the hypothesis that the VLBI-to-Gaia displacements pointing down the radio jet are likely caused by a component in the jet emitting highly polarized synchrotron radiation and dominating in the overall optical emission. The upstream-oriented VGD are likely to be produced by the low-polarized emission of the central engine sub-components dominating in the optical.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19665v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The opening of the gravitational wave window has significantly enhanced our capacity to explore the universe's most extreme and dynamic sector. In the mHz frequency range, a diverse range of compact objects, from the most massive black holes at the farthest reaches of the Universe to the lightest white dwarfs in our cosmic backyard, generate a complex and dynamic symphony of gravitational wave signals. Once recorded by gravitational wave detectors, these unique fingerprints have the potential to decipher the birth and growth of cosmic structures over a wide range of scales, from stellar binaries and stellar clusters to galaxies and large-scale structures. The TianQin space-borne gravitational wave mission is scheduled for launch in the 2030s, with an operational lifespan of five years. It will facilitate pivotal insights into the history of our universe. This document presents a concise overview of the detectable sources of TianQin, outlining their characteristics, the challenges they present, and the expected impact of the TianQin observatory on our understanding of them.</description>

      <title>An Investigation Into The Selection and Colors of Little Red Dots and Active Galactic Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00100v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, a large number of compact sources at $z &gt; 4$ with blue UV slopes and extremely red rest-frame optical slopes have been found in James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) extragalactic surveys. As a subsample of these sources, commonly called ``little red dots'' (LRDs), have been spectroscopically observed to host a broad-line active galactic nucleus (AGN), they have been the focus of multiple recent studies in an attempt to understand the origin of their UV and optical emission. Here, we assemble a sample of 123 LRDs from the literature along with spectroscopic and photometric JWST-identified samples of AGNs to compare their colors and spectral slopes. We find that while obscured AGNs at $z &lt; 6$ have highly dissimilar colors to LRDs, unobscured AGNs at $z &lt; 6$ span a wide range of colors, with only a subsample showing colors similar to LRDs. At $z &gt; 6$, the majority of the unobscured AGNs that have been found in these samples are LRDs, but this may be related to the fact that these sources are at large bolometric luminosities. Because LRDs occupy a unique position in galaxy color space, they are more straightforward to target, and the large number of broad-line AGNs that do not have LRD colors and slopes are therefore underrepresented in many spectroscopic surveys because they are more difficult to pre-select. Current LRD selection techniques return a large and disparate population, including many sources having $2-5\mu$m colors impacted by emission line flux boosting in individual filters.</description>

      <title>A new approach to constraining properties of AGN host galaxies by combining image and SED decomposition: testing upon the MBH-M* relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05857v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The outshining light from active galactic nuclei (AGNs) poses significant challenges in studying the properties of AGN host galaxies. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach which combines image decomposition and spectral energy distribution (SED) decomposition to constrain properties of AGN host galaxies. Image decomposition allows us to disentangle optical flux into AGN and stellar components, thereby providing additional constraints on the SED models to derive more refined stellar mass. To test the viability of this approach, we obtained a sample of 24 X-ray selected type-I AGNs with redshifts ranging from 0.73 to 2.47. We estimated the stellar masses for our sample and found that our results are generally consistent with earlier estimates based on different methods. Through examining the posterior distribution of stellar masses, we find that our method could derive better constrained results compared to previous SED decomposition methods. With the derived stellar masses, we further studied the MBH-M* relation of our sample, finding a higher intrinsic scatter in the correlation for our entire sample compared to the local quiescent correlation, which could be caused by a few black hole monsters in our sample. We propose that based on our method, future works could extend to larger samples of high-redshift AGN host galaxies, thereby enhancing our understanding of their properties.</description>

      <title>Partial suppression of chaos in relativistic 3-body problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15410v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent numerical results seem to suggest that in certain regimes of typical particle velocities the gravitational $N-$body problem (for $3\leq N\lesssim 10^3$) is intrinsically less chaotic when the post-Newtonian (PN) force terms are included, with respect to its classical counterpart that exhibits a slightly larger maximal Lyapunov exponent $\Lambda_{\rm max}$. In this work we explore the dynamics of wildly chaotic, regular and nearly regular configurations of the 3-body problem with and without the PN corrective terms aiming at shedding some light on the behaviour of the Lyapunov spectra under the effect of said corrections. Because the interaction of the tangent-space dynamics in gravitating systems, needed to evaluate the Lyapunov exponents, becomes rapidly computationally heavy due to the complexity of the higher order force derivatives involving multiple powers of $v/c$, we introduce a technique to compute a proxy of the Lyapunov spectrum based on the time-dependent diagonalization of the inertia tensor of a cluster of trajectories in phase-space. We find that, for a broad range of orbital configurations, the relativistic 3-body problem has a smaller $\Lambda_{\rm max}$ than its classical counterpart starting with the exact same initial condition. However, the rest of the Lyapunov spectrum can be either lower or larger in the classical case, suggesting that the relativistic precession effectively reduces chaos only along one (or few) directions in phase-space. As a general trend, the dynamical entropy of the relativistic simulations as function of the rescaled speed of light always has a regime in which falls below the classical value.} We observe that, the sole analysis of $\Lambda_{\rm max}$ could induce possibly misleading conclusions on the chaoticity of systems with small (and possibly large $N$.</description>

      <title>Evolution of the UV slope of galaxies at cosmic morning (z &gt; 4): the properties of extremely blue galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01623v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an analysis of the UV continuum slope, beta, using a sample of 733 galaxies selected from a mixture of JWST ERS/GTO/GO observational programs and with z &gt; 4. We consider spectroscopic data obtained with the low resolution PRISM/CLEAR NIRSpec configuration. Studying the correlation of beta with M_UV we find a decreasing trend of beta = (-0.056 +- 0.017) M_UV - (3.01 +- 0.34), consistent with brighter galaxies having redder beta as found in previous works. However, analysing the trend in separate redshift bins, we find that at high redshift the relation becomes much flatter, consistent with a flat slope. Furthermore, we find that beta decreases with redshift with an evolution as beta = (-0.075 +- 0.010) z - (1.496 +- 0.056), consistent with most previous results that show a steepening of the spectra going at higher z. We then select a sample of galaxies with extremely blue slopes (beta &lt; -2.6): such slopes are steeper than what is predicted by stellar evolution models, even for dust free, young, metal poor populations, when the contribution of nebular emission is included. We select 51 extremely blue galaxies (XBGs) and we investigate the possible physical origin of their steep slopes, comparing them to a sub-sample of redder galaxies (matched in redshift and M_UV). We find that XBGs have younger stellar populations, stronger ionization fields, lower dust attenuation, and lower but not pristine metallicity (~ 10% solar) compared to red galaxies. However, these properties alone cannot explain the extreme beta values. By using indirect inference of Lyman continuum escape, using the most recent models, we estimate escape fractions f_esc &gt; 10% in at least 25% of XBGs, while all the red sources have smaller f_esc. A reduced nebular continuum contribution as due to either a high escape fraction or to a bursty star-formation history is likely the origin of the extremely blue slopes.</description>

      <title>High-resolution imaging of the evolving bipolar outflows in symbiotic novae: The case of the RSOphiuchi 2021 nova outburst</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05794v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recurrent and symbiotic nova RS Ophiuchi (RSOph) underwent a new outburst phase during August 2021, about 15 years after the last event that occurred in 2006. This outburst represents the first nova event ever detected at very high energies (VHE, E&gt;100\,GeV), and a whole set of coordinated multiwavelength observations were triggered by this event. The main goals of this work are to characterize the evolving morphology of the expanding bipolar ejecta with high accuracy and to determine the physical conditions of the surrounding medium in which they propagate. By means of high-resolution very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) radio observations, we monitored RSOph with the European VLBI Network (EVN) and e-MERLIN at 1.6 and 5\,GHz during multiple epochs from 14 to 65 days after the explosion. We reveal an evolving source structure consisting of a central and compact core and two elongated bipolar outflows expanding on opposite sides of the core in the east-west direction. The ejecta angular separation with time is consistent with a linear expansion with an average projected speed of $\sim7000$ km s$^{-1}$. We find clear evidence of a radial dependence of the density along the density enhancement on the orbital plane (DEOP), going from 1$\times$10$^7$ ~cm$^{-3}$ close to the central binary to 9$\times$10$^5$~cm$^{-3}$ at $\sim400$~AU. Thanks to the accurate source astrometric position provided by \textit{Gaia} DR3, in this work we draw a detailed scenario of the geometry and physics of the RSOph evolving source structure after the most recent nova event. We conclude that most of the mass lost by the red giant companion goes into the DEOP, for which we estimate a total mass of $6.4 \times 10^{-6} ~~\mathrm{M_\odot}$, and into the circumstellar region, while only a small fraction (about one-tenth) is accreted by the white dwarf.</description>
