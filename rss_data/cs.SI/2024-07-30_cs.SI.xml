      <title>Non-Bayesian Social Learning with Multiview Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Bayesian social learning enables multiple agents to conduct networked signal and information processing through observing environmental signals and information aggregating. Traditional non-Bayesian social learning models only consider single signals, limiting their applications in scenarios where multiple viewpoints of information are available. In this work, we exploit, in the information aggregation step, the independently learned results from observations taken from multiple viewpoints and propose a novel non-Bayesian social learning model for scenarios with multiview observations. We prove the convergence of the model under traditional assumptions and provide convergence conditions for the algorithm in the presence of misleading signals. Through theoretical analyses and numerical experiments, we validate the strong reliability and robustness of the proposed algorithm, showcasing its potential for real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Modeling the amplification of epidemic spread by misinformed populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11351v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding how misinformation affects the spread of disease is crucial for public health, especially given recent research indicating that misinformation can increase vaccine hesitancy and discourage vaccine uptake. However, it is difficult to investigate the interaction between misinformation and epidemic outcomes due to the dearth of data-informed holistic epidemic models. Here, we employ an epidemic model that incorporates a large, mobility-informed physical contact network as well as the distribution of misinformed individuals across counties derived from social media data. The model allows us to simulate and estimate various scenarios to understand the impact of misinformation on epidemic spreading. Using this model, we present a worst-case scenario in which a heavily misinformed population would result in an additional 14% of the U.S. population becoming infected over the course of the COVID-19 epidemic, compared to a best-case scenario.</description>

      <title>Reverse Influential Community Search Over Social Networks (Technical Report)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01510v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As an important fundamental task of numerous real-world applications such as social network analysis and online advertising/marketing, several prior works studied influential community search, which retrieves a community with high structural cohesiveness and maximum influences on other users in social networks. However, previous works usually considered the influences of the community on arbitrary users in social networks, rather than specific groups (e.g., customer groups, or senior communities). Inspired by this, we propose a novel Top-M Reverse Influential Community Search (TopM-RICS) problem, which obtains a seed community with the maximum influence on a user-specified target community, satisfying both structural and keyword constraints. To efficiently tackle the TopM-RICS problem, we design effective pruning strategies to filter out false alarms of candidate seed communities, and propose an effective index mechanism to facilitate the community retrieval. We also formulate and tackle a TopM-RICS variant, named Top-M Relaxed Reverse Influential Community Search} (TopM-R2ICS), which returns top-M subgraphs with relaxed structural constraints and having the maximum influence on a user-specified target community. Comprehensive experiments have been conducted to verify the efficiency and effectiveness of our TopM-RICS and TopM-R2ICS approaches on both real-world and synthetic social networks under various parameter settings.</description>

      <title>Shortest-path percolation on random networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06753v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a bond-percolation model intended to describe the consumption, and eventual exhaustion, of resources in transport networks. Edges forming minimum-length paths connecting demanded origin-destination nodes are removed if below a certain budget. As pairs of nodes are demanded and edges are removed, the macroscopic connected component of the graph disappears, i.e., the graph undergoes a percolation transition. Here, we study such a shortest-path-percolation transition in homogeneous random graphs where pairs of demanded origin-destination nodes are randomly generated, and fully characterize it by means of finite-size scaling analysis. If budget is finite, the transition is identical to the one of ordinary percolation, where a single giant cluster shrinks as edges are removed from the graph; for infinite budget, the transition becomes more abrupt than the one of ordinary percolation, being characterized by the sudden fragmentation of the giant connected component into a multitude of clusters of similar size.</description>
