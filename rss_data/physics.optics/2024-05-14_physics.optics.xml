      <title>Quantised helicity in optical media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical helicity quantifies the handedness of light, and plays a central role in the description of interactions between light and chiral matter. In free space, it is related to the duality symmetry of the electromagnetic field, a continuous symmetry encapsulating the invariance of Maxwell's equations under the interchange of electric and magnetic fields. However, in materials the situation is not so straightforward, as the free space transformation must be extended to encompass mixing of both the $\mathbf{E}$/$\mathbf{H}$ and $\mathbf{D}$/$\mathbf{B}$ field pairs. The simultaneous direct interchange of $\mathbf{E}$/$\mathbf{H}$ and of $\mathbf{D}$/$\mathbf{B}$ is incompatible with the presence of linear constitutive relations. In this work, we extend the duality transform in a way that resolves this incompatibility, and use this to define the optical helicity in a general medium, which may be dispersive, lossy, chiral or nonreciprocal. We find that the helicity density must contain an explicit contribution associated with the polarisation and magnetisation of the matter, and we show that the form of this matter contribution is independent of the details of the medium. We also show that the in-medium helicity can be naturally expressed in terms of the elementary quantised excitations of the system.</description>

      <title>Analytical analysis of the decrease in the focal intensity of a femtosecond laser pulse caused by an imperfect surface of compressor diffraction gratings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An analytical expression for the focal intensity of a laser pulse was obtained for an asymmetric out-of-plane compressor with gratings of arbitrary surface shape. The focal intensity is most strongly affected by the linear angular chirp caused by the spatial shift of different frequencies on the second and third gratings. The chirp can be eliminated by simply rotating the fourth grating by an optimal angle, which significantly reduces the requirements for the grating quality. It is shown that the decrease in the focal intensity depends on the product of grating surface rms and pulse spectrum bandwidth. With low-quality gratings, spectrum narrowing would not reduce focal intensity; contrariwise, it may even slightly increase it.</description>

      <title>Hermite-Laguerre-Gaussian Vector Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vector modes are well-defined field distributions with spatially varying polarisation states, rendering them irreducible to the product of a single spatial mode and a single polarisation state. Traditionally, the spatial degree of freedom of vector modes is constructed using two orthogonal modes from the same family. In this letter, we introduce a novel class of vector modes whose spatial degree of freedom is encoded by combining modes from both the Hermite- and Laguerre-Gaussian families. This particular superposition is not arbitrary, and we provide a detailed explanation of the methodology employed to achieve it. Notably, this new class of vector modes, which we term Hybrid Hermite-Laguerre-Gaussian (HHLG) vector modes, gives rise to subsets of modes exhibiting polarisation dependence on propagation due to the difference in mode orders between the constituent Hermite- and Laguerre-Gaussian modes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of vector modes composed of two scalar modes originating from different families. We anticipate diverse applications for HHLG vector modes in fields such as free-space communications, information encryption, optical metrology, and beyond.</description>

      <title>Terahertz Bandstop Filter Using Varying Radii Split-Ring Resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter we report a proof-of-concept terahertz band-stop filter constructed from split-ring resonators that has a center frequency of 1.06 THz and a -3 dB bandwidth of 0.36 THz. The design consists of nine split ring resonators of varying radii (3 x 13 um, 3 x 14 um, 3 x 15 um) that are placed between the conductors of a coplanar stripline transmission line. The response of the filter is measured using a modified terahertz time-domain spectrometer and we find reasonable agreement between simulation and experiment. This work demonstrates the viability of using varying-radii split-ring resonators as discrete sub-wavelength filter elements for terahertz systems.</description>

      <title>Optical Imaging of Flavor Order in Flat Band Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin and valley flavor polarization plays a central role in the many-body physics of flat band graphene, with fermi surface reconstructions often accompanied by quantized anomalous Hall and superconducting state observed in a variety of experimental systems. Here we describe an optical technique that sensitively and selectively detects flavor textures via the exciton response of a proximal transition metal dichalcogenide layer. Through a systematic study of rhombohedral and rotationally faulted graphene bilayers and trilayers, we show that when the semiconducting dichalcogenide is in direct contact with the graphene, the exciton response is most sensitive to the large momentum rearrangement of the Fermi surface, providing information that is distinct from and complementary to electrical compressibility measurements. The wide-field imaging capability of optical probes allows us to obtain spatial maps of flavor orders with high throughput, and with broad temperature and device compatibility. Our work paves the way for optical probing and imaging of flavor orders in flat band graphene systems.</description>

      <title>Towards a fiber-optic temporally multiplexed single photon source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the feasibility of implementing a photon source with sub-Poissonian emission statistics through temporal multiplexing of a continuous wave heralded photon source in the optical communications wavelength range. We use the time arrival information of a heralding photon to actively modify the delay of the heralded photon in an all-fiber assembly, in order to synchronize the output with with respect to an external clock. Within this synchronized operating regime we show that the addition of a single temporal correcting stage can improve the figure of merit for single photon emission of a heralded photon source. We obtain a brightness improvement factor of approximately 1.8 and an enhancement of the signal-to-noise ratio, quantified by the coincidence-to-accidental counts ratio. These results, clear the way for integrated optics non-classical photon sources in the optical communication band.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable generation of spatial entanglement in nonlinear waveguide arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Harnessing high-dimensional entangled states of light presents a frontier for advancing quantum information technologies, from fundamental tests of quantum mechanics to enhanced computation and communication protocols. In this context, the spatial degree of freedom stands out as particularly suited for on-chip integration. But while traditional demonstrations produce and manipulate path-entangled states sequentially with discrete optical elements, continuously-coupled nonlinear waveguide systems offer a promising alternative where photons can be generated and interfere along the entire propagation length, unveiling novel capabilities within a reduced footprint. Here we exploit this concept to implement a compact and reconfigurable source of spatially entangled photon pairs based on parametric down-conversion in AlGaAs nonlinear waveguides arrays. We use a double-pump configuration to engineer the output quantum state and implement various types of spatial correlations, exploiting a quantum interference effect between the biphoton state generated in each pumped waveguide. This demonstration, at room temperature and telecom wavelength, illustrates the potential of continuously-coupled systems as a promising alternative to discrete multi-component quantum circuits for leveraging the high-dimensional spatial degree of freedom of photons.</description>
