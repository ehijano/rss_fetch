      <title>Fermi-Dirac Wigner function for massive spin-1/2 particles in local equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recently proposed Boltzmann local equilibrium Wigner function for massive spin-1/2 particles is generalized to the case of Fermi-Dirac statistics. The resulting formula ensures the correct normalization of the mean polarization vector and reproduces the generalized thermodynamic relations with spin that were obtained in earlier studies. Moreover, we show that the macroscopic currents constructed from the Fermi-Dirac Wigner function can be obtained as derivatives of a suitably defined generating function with respect to the Lagrange multipliers (temperature, hydrodynamic flow, and chemical potentials). The identified generating function also indicates that the underlying framework can be classified as a divergence-type theory.</description>

      <title>Quantum Frustration as a Protection Mechanism in Non-Topological Majorana Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I analyze the decoherence of a $\pi$-junction qubit encoded by two co-located Majorana modes. Although not topologically protected, the qubit leverages distinct spatial profiles to couple to two independent environmental baths, realizing the phenomenon of quantum frustration.This mechanism is tested against the threat of quasiparticle poisoning (QP). I show that frustration is effective against Ohmic noise ($s=1$) and has some protection for $0.76&lt;s&lt;1$ sub-Ohmic noise. However, the experimentally prevalent $1/f$ noise ($s\to0$) falls deep within the model's localized phase, where frustration is insufficient. This causes Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking and catastrophic decoherence. The qubit's viability depends on what is the effective environment that these local Majorana wave functions experience.</description>

      <title>Cooling the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model using thermofield double states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze a simple and efficient experimental protocol to cool the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model to low temperatures. The protocol utilizes local couplings between two copies of an SYK model to create a gapped adiabatic path, between a high temperature product state and a low temperature thermofield double state. By smoothly varying the coupling strength between these two limits, one efficiently cools the SYK model. We support these predictions-and demonstrate fast cooling to the low-temperature gravitational regime-via exact numerical solutions to the large-N equations of motion that govern the ground state and dynamical properties of the coupled system. Finally, we present a theoretical framework based upon eigenstate thermalization that provides a microscopic explanation for the efficacy of the cooling protocol; intriguingly, this suggests that the protocol may be applicable for cooling strongly-interacting quantum Hamiltonians more broadly.</description>

      <title>Temporal quantum interference in many-body programmable atom arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum superposition famously manifests as spatial interference, epitomized by the double-slit experiment. Its less explored temporal analogue, St\"{u}ckelberg interference, arises in driven systems where phases accumulated along distinct time-domain pathways recombine. Extending this phenomenon to large interacting systems introduces a new complexity as delicate phase relationships are disrupted by many-body interactions. Here we experimentally achieve controllable vacuum-state freezing in programmable Rydberg arrays of up to 100 atoms through many-body St\"{u}ckelberg interference, with visibility exceeding $70\%$ and excitation suppression to $1\%$ despite periodic driving that would typically induce heating. Comparing single and dual-frequency protocols across multiple geometries, we show that simultaneous modulation of detuning and Rabi frequency dramatically enhances interference-driven freezing. Finite-range interaction tails play a decisive role, producing interference patterns which constrained $PXP$ models cannot capture. Our results establish temporal interference as a scalable microscopic mechanism for Floquet control, enabling predictive many-body state engineering in large-scale platforms.</description>

      <title>A measurement-driven quantum algorithm for SAT: Performance guarantees via spectral gaps and measurement parallelization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT) is of central importance in both theory and practice. Yet, most provable guarantees for quantum algorithms rely exclusively on Grover-type methods that cap the possible advantage at only quadratic speed-ups, making the search for approaches that surpass this quadratic barrier a key challenge. In this light, this work presents a rigorous worst-case runtime analysis of a recently introduced measurement-driven quantum SAT solver. Importantly, this quantum algorithm does not exclusively rely on Grover-type methods and shows promising numerical performance. Our analysis establishes that the algorithm's runtime depends on an exponential trade-off between two key properties: the spectral gap of the associated Hamiltonian and the success probability of the driving measurements. We show that this trade-off can be systematically controlled by a tunable rotation angle. Beyond establishing a worst-case runtime expression, this work contributes significant algorithmic improvements. First, we develop a new readout routine that efficiently finds a solution even for instances with multiple satisfying assignments. Second, a measurement parallelization scheme, based on perfect hash families, is introduced. Third, we establish an amplitude-amplified version of the measurement-driven algorithm. Finally, we demonstrate the practical utility of our framework: By suitably scheduling the algorithm's parameters, we show that its runtime collapses from exponential to polynomial on a special class of SAT instances, consistent with their known classical tractability. A problem we leave open is to establish a non-trivial lower bound on the spectral gap as a function of the rotation angle. Resolving this directly translates into an improved worst-case runtime, potentially realizing a super-quadratic quantum advantage.</description>

      <title>Non-abelian Geometric Quantum Energy Pump</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a non-abelian geometric quantum energy pump realized by a transitionless geometric quantum drive--a time-dependent Hamiltonian supplemented by a counterdiabatic term generated by a prescribed trajectory on a smooth control manifold--that coherently transports states within a degenerate subspace. When the coordinates of the trajectory are independently addressable by external drives, the net energy transferred between drives is set by the non-abelian Berry-curvature tensor. The trajectory-averaged pumping power is separately controlled by the initial state and by the Hamiltonian topology through the Euler class. We outline an implementation with artificial atoms, which are realizable on various platforms including trapped atoms/ions, superconducting circuits, and semiconductor quantum dots. The resulting energy pump can serve as a quantum transducer or charger, and as a metrological tool for measuring phase coherences in quantum states.</description>

      <title>Optimal Interpolation of Entanglement Purification Protocols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bipartite entanglement purification is the conversion of copies of weakly entangled pairs shared between two separated parties into a smaller number of strongly entangled shared pairs using only local operations and classical communication. Choosing between different entanglement purification protocols generally involves weighing up a trade-off between the ratio of strongly entangled pairs produced to weakly entangled pairs consumed, which we call the rate of the protocol, and the degree of the entanglement of the strongly entangled pairs, typically measured by the fidelity of those pairs to maximally entangled states. By randomly choosing a protocol according to a probability distribution over a list of protocols for each pair we want to produce, we can achieve rates and fidelities not achieved by any of the original protocols. Here, we show how to choose this distribution to maximise the rate at which we produce qubit pairs with a given fidelity to a Bell state or, equivalently, to maximise the fidelity to a Bell state of the qubit pairs produced at a given rate. We investigate both the asymptotic case, where the number of initial pairs goes to infinity, and the finite-size regime, where protocols are restricted to a finite number of weakly entangled pairs.</description>

      <title>Cyclic Hypergraph Product Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hypergraph product (HGP) codes are one of the most popular family of quantum low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. Circuit-level simulations show that they can achieve the same logical error rate as surface codes with a reduced qubit overhead. They have been extensively optimized by importing classical techniques such as the progressive edge growth, or through random search, simulated annealing or reinforcement learning techniques. In this work, instead of machine learning (ML) algorithms that improve the code performance through local transformations, we impose additional global symmetries, that are hard to discover through ML, and we perform an exhaustive search. Precisely, we focus on the hypergraph product of two cyclic codes, which we call CxC codes and we study C2 codes which are the product a cyclic code with itself and CxR codes which are the product of a cyclic codes with a repetition code. We discover C2 codes and CxR codes that significantly outperform previously optimized HGP codes, achieving better parameters and a logical error rate per logical qubit that is up to three orders of magnitude better. Moreover, some C2 codes achieve simultaneously a lower logical error rate and a smaller qubit overhead than state-of-the-art LDPC codes such as the bivariate bicycle codes, at the price of a larger block length. Finally, leveraging the cyclic symmetry imposed on the codes, we design an efficient planar layout for the QCCD architecture, allowing for a trapped ion implementation of the syndrome extraction circuit in constant depth.</description>

      <title>Trotterized Variational Quantum Control for Spin-Chain State Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a hybrid variational framework for quantum optimal control aimed at high-fidelity state transfer in spin chains. The system dynamics are discretized and compiled into a parameterized circuit, where deterministic two-qubit blocks implement the drift interactions, while trainable on-site RZ rotations encode the control inputs. We study two parameterizations: a compact global scheme with a small number of shared parameters per slice, and a local scheme with site-wise angles. Using a Sequential Least Squares Quadratic Programming (SLSQP) optimization to minimize infidelity, simulations on XXZ spin chains show that both parameterizations can achieve near-unit fidelities in the noiseless regime. Under depolarizing noise, the global scheme provides improved robustness for comparable circuit depth and iteration budgets. The results make explicit an expressivity-stability trade-off and suggest a scalable route to Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) compatible control synthesis.</description>

      <title>Two-Mode Janus States: non-Gaussian generalizations of thermofield double</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the Two-Mode Janus State (TMJS), a non-Gaussian quantum state defined as a coherent superposition of two distinct Two-Mode Squeezed States (TMSS). This construction serves as a direct, non-Gaussian generalization of the canonical thermofield double (TFD) state, which is itself a single, Gaussian TMSS. We develop a complete analytical framework for the TMJS's arbitrary $k$-th order photon statistics, identifying a new family of "squeezing polynomials" that govern all diagonal and off-diagonal moments. Our central result is that the state's non-Gaussianity is dynamically steerable via an external "Janus phase." This phase acts as a switch, allowing the higher-order coherences ($g^{(k)}$) to be tuned from perfectly thermal (matching the TFD marginal) to deeply sub-Poissonian, a regime marked by strong Wigner negativity. We further establish a physical realization for the TMJS, proposing its generation via coherently superposed Dynamical Casimir Effect (DCE) trajectories, distinguishing it from the static, observer-dependent Unruh effect. The TMJS provides a versatile, interference-enhanced platform for engineering Unruh-DeWitt detector responses and probing non-Gaussian physics in relativistic settings.</description>

      <title>Liquid metal printing for superconducting circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting circuits are a promising platform for implementing fault-tolerant quantum computers, quantum limited amplifiers, ultra-low power superconducting electronics, and sensors with ultimate sensitivity. Typically, circuit fabrication is realized by standard nanolithography, generally associated with a high level of control over defects and contaminants. Additive approaches have not been used so far since they are expected to be inferior in terms of superconducting properties or quantum coherence. This work shows that liquid-metal based micro-pipette printing is suited for fabricating superconducting lumped-element resonators with high internal quality factors. The applicability of our technique for low-loss superconducting device fabrication and the possibility to locally add metal structures, without affecting any preexisting circuit elements, is a further advantage. Our results open up new avenues in the hardware implementation of scaled-up superconducting quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Constrained Shadow Tomography for Molecular Simulation on Quantum Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum state tomography is a fundamental task in quantum information science, enabling detailed characterization of correlations, entanglement, and electronic structure in quantum systems. However, its exponential measurement and computational demands limit scalability, motivating efficient alternatives such as classical shadows, which enable accurate prediction of many observables from randomized measurements. In this work, we introduce a bi-objective semidefinite programming approach for constrained shadow tomography, designed to reconstruct the two-particle reduced density matrix (2-RDM) from noisy or incomplete shadow data. By integrating $N$-representability constraints and nuclear-norm regularization into the optimization, the method builds an $N$-representable 2-RDM that balances fidelity to the shadow measurements with energy minimization. This unified framework mitigates noise and sampling errors while enforcing physical consistency in the reconstructed states. Numerical and hardware results demonstrate that the approach significantly improves accuracy, noise resilience, and scalability, providing a robust foundation for physically consistent fermionic state reconstruction in realistic quantum simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.09758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that in quantum many-body systems, local arrows of time can differ from the global time $t$ induced by Hamiltonian evolution. That is, within a quantum many-body system, the flow of time can be relative to each observer or by proxy each local subsystem. We provide a definition of local arrows of time in quantum many-body systems, and explain their relation to spacetime quantum entropies. Then we give a variety of numerical and analytical examples which explore different ways in which local arrows of time can manifest in quantum many-body dynamics, including exotic arrows of time arising from quantum thermalization and quantum error correction.</description>

      <title>On the Classical Shadow Nonparametric Bootstrap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical shadows are an efficient method for constructing an approximate classical description of a quantum state using very few measurements. In the paper we propose to enhance classical shadow methods using bootstrap resampling methods. We apply nonparametric bootstrapping to assess the variability and accuracy of estimators by repeatedly sampling with replacement from the observed data, i.e.\ in our case the classical shadow measurements. We show that the bootstrap distributions are very different from the Gaussian approximations. Likewise, the theoretical error bounds are not tight compared to the bootstrap percentiles. Finally, we suggest using resampling tools to make risk assessments.</description>

      <title>Uncovering and Circumventing Noise in Quantum Algorithms via Metastability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The presence of noise is the primary challenge in realizing fault-tolerant quantum computers. In this work, we introduce and experimentally validate a novel strategy to circumvent noise by exploiting the phenomenon of metastability, where a dynamical system exhibits long-lived intermediate states. We demonstrate that if quantum hardware noise exhibits metastability, both digital and analog algorithms can be designed in a noise-aware fashion to achieve intrinsic resilience. We develop a general theoretical framework and introduce an efficiently computable noise resilience metric that avoids the need for full classical simulation of the quantum algorithm. We illustrate the use of our framework with applications to variational quantum algorithms and analog adiabatic state preparation. Crucially, we provide experimental evidence supporting the presence of metastable noise in gate-model quantum processors as well as quantum annealing devices. Thus, we establish that the intrinsic nature of noise in near-term quantum hardware can be leveraged to inform practical implementation strategies, enabling the preparation of final noisy states that more closely approximate the ideal ones.</description>

Abstract: Nash equilibria are crucial for understanding game behavior and systems in economics, physics, biology, and computer science. A significant application arises from the connection between Nash equilibria and optimization problems . However, finding Nash equilibria is challenging due to its NP-Hard complexity, specifically within the PPAD class. By exploiting the correspondence between Maximum Independent Sets (MIS) and Nash equilibria on unit-disk graphs, we map these problems onto the ground state configurations of Rydberg atom arrays. Simulations show the effectiveness of this quantum method, highlighting its potential for solving complex problems in game theory.</description>

      <title>Discrete Time Crystals in Noninteracting Dissipative Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many-body quantum systems, under suitable conditions, exhibit time-translation symmetry breaking and settle in a discrete time crystalline (DTC) phase -- an out-of-equilibrium quantum phase of matter. The defining feature of DTC is a robust subharmonic response. However, the DTC phase is fragile in the presence of environmental dissipation. Here, we propose and exemplify a DTC phase in a noninteracting system that owes its stability to environmental dissipation. The lifetime of this DTC is independent of initial conditions and the size of the system, though it depends on the frequency of the external driver. We experimentally demonstrate this realization of DTC using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Quantum Period-Finding using One-Qubit Reduced Density Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum period-finding (QPF) algorithm can compute the period of a function exponentially faster than the best-known classical algorithm. In standard QPF, the output state has a primary contribution from $r$ high-probability bit strings, where $r$ is the period. Measurement of this state, combined with continued fraction analysis, reveals the unknown period. Here, we explore a different approach to QPF, where the period is obtained from single-qubit quantities $-$ specifically, the set of one-qubit reduced density matrices (1-RDMs) $-$ rather than the output bit strings of the entire quantum circuit. Using state-vector simulations, we compute the 1-RDMs of the QPF circuit for a generic periodic function. Analysis of these 1-RDMs as a function of period reveals distinctive patterns, which allows us to obtain the unknown period from the 1-RDMs using a numerical root-finding approach. Our results show that the 1-RDMs $-$ a set of $O(n)$ one-qubit marginals $-$ contain enough information to reconstruct the period, which is typically obtained by sampling the space of $O(2^n)$ bit strings. Conceptually, this can be viewed as a "compression" of the information in the QPF algorithm, which enables period-finding from $n$ one-qubit marginals. Our results motivate the development of approximate simulations of reduced density matrices to design novel period-finding algorithms.</description>

      <title>Provably Efficient Quantum Algorithms for Solving Nonlinear Differential Equations Using Multiple Bosonic Modes Coupled with Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computers have long been expected to efficiently solve complex classical differential equations. Most digital, fault-tolerant approaches use Carleman linearization to map nonlinear systems to linear ones and then apply quantum linear-system solvers. However, provable speedups typically require digital truncation and full fault tolerance, rendering such linearization approaches challenging to implement on current hardware. Here we present an analog, continuous-variable algorithm based on coupled bosonic modes with qubit-based adaptive measurements that avoids Hilbert-space digitization. This method encodes classical fields as coherent states and, via Kraus-channel composition derived from the Koopman-von Neumann (KvN) formalism, maps nonlinear evolution to linear dynamics. Unlike many analog schemes, the algorithm is provably efficient: advancing a first-order, $L$-grid point, $d$-dimensional, order-$K$ spatial-derivative, degree-$r$ polynomial-nonlinearity, strongly dissipative partial differential equations (PDEs) for $T$ time steps costs $\mathcal{O}\left(T(\log L + d r \log K)\right)$. The capability of the scheme is demonstrated by using it to simulate the one-dimensional Burgers' equation and two-dimensional Fisher-KPP equation. The resilience of the method to photon loss is shown under strong-dissipation conditions and an analytic counterterm is derived that systematically cancels the dominant, experimentally calibrated noise. This work establishes a continuous-variable framework for simulating nonlinear systems and identifies a viable pathway toward practical quantum speedup on near-term analog hardware.</description>

      <title>Reusability Report: Optimizing T-count in General Quantum Circuits with AlphaTensor-Quantum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing has the potential to solve problems that are intractable for classical computers, with possible applications in areas such as drug discovery and high-energy physics. However, the practical implementation of quantum computation is hindered by the complexity of executing quantum circuits on hardware. In particular, minimizing the number of T-gates is crucial for implementing efficient quantum algorithms. AlphaTensor-Quantum is a reinforcement learning-based method designed to optimize the T-count of quantum circuits by formulating the problem as a tensor decomposition task. While it has demonstrated superior performance over existing methods on benchmark quantum arithmetic circuits, its applicability has so far been restricted to specific circuit families, requiring separate, time-intensive training for each new application. This report reproduces some of the key results of the original work and extends AlphaTensor-Quantum's capabilities to simplify random quantum circuits with varying qubit counts, eliminating the need for retraining on new circuits. Our experiments show that a general agent trained on 5- to 8-qubit circuits achieves greater T-count reduction than previous methods for a large fraction of quantum circuits. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a general agent trained on circuits with varying qubit numbers outperforms agents trained on fixed qubit numbers, highlighting the method's generalizability and its potential for broader quantum circuit optimization tasks.</description>

      <title>Improved coherence time of a non-Hermitian qubit in a $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing's potential for exponential speedup is fundamentally limited by decoherence, a phenomenon arising from environmental interactions. Non-Hermitian quantum mechanics, particularly $PT$-symmetric systems, offers a novel framework for extending coherence times. This study examines a qubit's coherence under non-Hermitian $PT$-symmetric dynamics, highlighting significantly enhanced coherence times compared to Hermitian setups. The effect is especially pronounced when both the system and environment exhibit $PT$-symmetry. Interestingly, greater environmental non-Hermiticity correlates with extended coherence, contrary to traditional expectations. These findings point to promising strategies for managing decoherence, which could significantly advance approaches to quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Enantiodetection in a cavity QED setup with finite chiral molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate enantiodetection for both a single cyclic three-level chiral molecule and finite ensembles of such molecules by monitoring the steady-state intracavity photon number in a cavity-QED platform. Our scheme exploits the intrinsic global $\pi$-phase difference between opposite enantiomers to engineer destructive and/or constructive interference pathways, enabling a direct readout of enantiomeric excess with an error below $5\%$. To capture mesoscopic many-molecule effects beyond mean field while avoiding brute-force master-equation simulations, we employ a generalized discrete truncated Wigner approximation, which is well suited for systems with many yet finite molecules. These results pave the way for implementing enantiodetection in realistic quantum-optical settings.</description>

      <title>First and second quantized digital quantum simulations of bosonic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compare the basic resource requirements for first and second quantized bosonic mappings in a system consisting of $N$ particles in $M$ modes. In addition to the standard binary first quantized mapping, we investigate the unary first quantized mapping, which we show to be the most gate-efficient mapping for bosons in the general case, although less qubit-efficient than binary mappings. Our comparison focuses on the $k$-body reduced density matrix ($k$-RDM) as well as two standard bosonic Hamiltonians. The first quantized mappings use less resources for off-diagonal terms of the $k$-RDM by a factor of $ \sim N^k$, compared to the second quantized mappings. The number of gates for the first quantized binary mapping increases faster with $M$ compared to the other mappings. Nevertheless, a detailed numeric analysis reveals that the binary first quantized mapping still requires fewer gates than the binary and unary second quantized ones for realistic combinations of $N$ and $M$, while requiring exponentially fewer qubits than the unary mappings. Additionally, the number of CNOT and $R_z(\phi)$ gates necessary to express the exponential of the Hamiltonian in the binary first quantized mapping is comparable to the (overall most efficient) unary first quantized one when $M = 2^n$ for both the Bose-Hubbard model and the harmonic trap with short-range interactions. This suggests that this mapping can be both qubit- and gate-efficient for practical problems.</description>

      <title>General quantum backflow in realistic wave packets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum backflow is a counterintuitive phenomenon in which the probability density of a quantum particle propagates opposite to its momentum. Experimental observation of backflow has remained elusive due to two main challenges: (i) the effect is intrinsically small, with less than 4% of the probability able to flow backward, and (ii) it requires wave packets with a well-defined momentum direction, which are difficult both to prepare and to verify under realistic, noisy conditions. Here, we overcome these challenges by introducing a general formulation of quantum backflow applicable to arbitrary momentum distributions. The framework recovers the standard backflow limit for unidirectional states and identifies general backflow as probability flow exceeding that predicted by the particle's momentum distribution alone. We show that this excess can reach nearly 13%, surpassing the standard backflow bound by more than a factor of three. Furthermore, we extend the framework to the closely related phenomenon of quantum reentry, provide explicit examples of quantum states exhibiting large general backflow and reentry, and discuss the foundational implications of these nonclassical effects. Our results open a pathway toward the experimental observation of quantum backflow in realistic settings.</description>

      <title>Addressable fault-tolerant universal quantum gate operations for high-rate lift-connected surface codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum low-density parity check (qLDPC) codes are among the leading candidates to realize error-corrected quantum memories with low qubit overhead. Potentially high encoding rates and large distance relative to their block size make them appealing for practical suppression of noise in near-term quantum computers. In addition to increased qubit-connectivity requirements compared to more conventional topological quantum error correcting codes, qLDPC codes remain notoriously hard to compute with. In this work, we introduce a construction to implement all Clifford quantum gate operations on the recently introduced lift-connected surface (LCS) codes (Old et al. 2024). These codes can be implemented in a 3D-local architecture and achieve asymptotic scaling $[[n, \mathcal{O}(n^{1/3}), \mathcal{O}(n^{1/3})]]$. In particular, LCS codes realize favorable instances with small numbers of qubits: For the $[[15,3,3]]$ LCS code, we provide deterministic fault-tolerant (FT) circuits of the logical gate set $\{\overline{H}_i, \overline{H}_i, \overline{C_i X_j}\}_{i,j \in (0,1,2)}$ based on flag qubits. By adding a procedure for FT magic state preparation, we show quantitatively how to realize an FT universal gate set in $d=3$ LCS codes. Numerical simulations indicate that our gate constructions can attain pseudothresholds in the range $p_{\mathrm{th}} \approx 4.8\cdot 10^{-3}-1.2\cdot 10^{-2}$ for circuit-level noise. The schemes use a moderate number of qubits and are therefore feasible for near-term experiments, facilitating progress for fault-tolerant error corrected logic in high-rate qLPDC codes.</description>

      <title>Proof-of-principle demonstration of a Polarization-Circulation Speed Meter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first experimental implementation of a polarization-circulation speed meter. In our experiment, the interferometer was reduced to a single-cavity configuration with all mirrors fixed. A green-locking scheme was employed to stabilize the polarization circulation cavity, and a lock-acquisition procedure was demonstrated to realize speed-meter operation. The system was characterized by measuring the transfer function from a pseudo-displacement signal to the photodetector output, confirming that the device measures the speed of mirror motion. These results support the feasibility of polarization-circulation speed meters and suggest that the control scheme could be extended to more complex configurations, such as Michelson interferometers and suspended-mirror systems.</description>

      <title>Tunable single-photon frequency converter in a waveguide with a giant V-type atom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the single-photon scattering in a one-dimensional (1D) waveguide coupled to one transition of a $V$-type giant atom (GA), whose other transition is coherently driven by an classical field. The inelastic scattering of single photons by the GA realizes the single-photon frequency conversion. By applying the Lippmann-Schwinger equation, the scattering coefficients for single photons incident from different directions are obtained, which present different scattering spectra in the Markovian and the non-Markovian regimes. The conversion contrast characterizing the nonreciprocity is also analyzed in both regimes. It is found that the probability of the frequency up- or down-conversion vanishes as long as the emission from either transition pathways for single photons is suppressed, but it is enhanced and even reach unity by introducing the nonreciprocity. It is the quantum self-interference induced by the scale of this two-legged GA and the phase difference between the GA-waveguide couplings that tune the probability of the frequency up- or down-conversion.</description>

      <title>Ancilla-Free Fast-Forwarding Lindbladian Simulation Algorithms by Hamiltonian Twirling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulation of open quantum systems is an area of active research in quantum algorithms. In this work, we revisit the connection between Markovian open-system dynamics and averages of Hamiltonian real-time evolutions, which we refer to as Hamiltonian twirling channels. Focusing on the class of Lindbladians with a single Hermitian jump operator $H$ recently studied in Shang et al. (arXiv:2510.06759), we show that the time-$t$ evolution map can be expressed exactly a Gaussian twirl over the unitary orbit ${\{\mathrm{e}^{-\mathrm{i} Hs}\}}_{s\in\mathbb{R}}$. This structural insight allows us to design a fast-forwarding algorithm for Lindbladian simulation that achieves diamond-norm error $\varepsilon$ with time complexity $O\big(\sqrt{t\log(1/\varepsilon)}\big)$ -- matching the performance of Shang et al. while requiring no auxiliary registers or controlled operations. The resulting ancilla-free and control-free algorithm is therefore more amenable to near-term experimental implementation. By purifying the Gaussian twirl procedure and performing a conjugate measurement, we derive a continuous-variable quantum phase estimation algorithm. In addition, by applying the L\'evy-Khintchine representation theorem, we clarify when and how a dissipative dynamics can be realized using Hamiltonian twirling channels. Guided by the general theory, we explore Hamiltonian twirling with compound Poisson distributions and their potential algorithmic implications.</description>

      <title>Photon transport and blockade based on non-Markovian interactions between a microring resonator and waveguide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate photon transport and blockade based on the architecture where a waveguide is coupled to a microring resonator at two distinct points. This two-point coupling configuration between the waveguide and resonator gives rise to non-Markovian dynamics, which is induced by the photon transmission delay in the waveguide between the two coupled points. On one hand, by designing the non-Markovian coupling parameters between the waveguide and resonator, single or two-photon transport and the resulting photon blockade effect can be manipulated according to the output photonic states at the end of waveguide. This non-Markovian process can be evaluated by scattering matrices and second order correlation functions related to the distance between two coupled points. On the other hand, when classical driving fields are applied upon the resonator with interactions between its clockwise and counterclockwise modes, the blockade effect of the output field can be determined by the intracavtiy eigenstates. Then the correlations of the output field as well as the intracavity states can be modulated by the non-Markovian coupling between the microring resonator and waveguide.</description>

      <title>Quantum Simulation of Non-unitary Dynamics via Contour-based Matrix Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce contour-based matrix decomposition (CBMD), a framework for scalable simulation of non-unitary dynamics. Unlike existing methods that follow the ``integrate-then-discretize" paradigm and rely heavily on numerical quadrature, CBMD generalizes Cauchy's residue theorem to matrix-valued functions and directly decomposes a non-Hermitian function into a linear combination of Hermitian ones, which can be implemented efficiently using techniques such as quantum singular value transformation (QSVT). For non-Hermitian dynamics, CBMD achieves optimal query complexity. With an additional eigenvalue-shifting technique, the improved complexity depends on the spectral range of the system instead of its spectral norm. For more general dynamics that can be approximated by non-Hermitian polynomials, where algorithms like QSVT face significant difficulties, CBMD remains applicable and avoids the assumptions of diagonalizability as well as the dependence on condition numbers that limit other approaches.</description>

      <title>Generalized coherent states with shifted (displaced) arguments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the paper we developed a procedure for constructing generalized coherent states with shifted argument, as a result of the action of the generalized displacement operator. This was based on the action of a pair of nonlinear ladder operators, which generate nonlinear coherent states. To examine the properties of coherent states with shifted argument, the rules of the normal operator ordering technique (DOOT) were used. The results obtained were verified for a series of particular cases, obtaining expressions consistent with those in the literature. The expressions obtained will be, among others, useful in quantum optics, e.g. for calculating the Wigner operator in the representation of coherent states.</description>

      <title>Optomechanical Cooling without Residual Heating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resolved-sideband cooling is a standard technique in cavity optomechanics enabling quantum control of mechanical motion, but its performance is ultimately limited by quantum backaction heating. This fundamental effect imposes a limit on the minimum achievable mechanical phonon number, establishing a finite-temperature floor regardless of the applied cooling strength. We generalize the semi-classical model for optomechanical cooling to describe universal cavity Hamiltonians incorporating both passive and active nonlinearities. As a concrete demonstration, we analyze the simplest circuit optomechanical system that implements a nonlinear drive via a Josephson junction. Our analysis reveals that this active nonlinear drive can eliminate the residual heating backaction, thereby comparing favorably with alternative optomechanical cooling schemes based on passive nonlinearities arXiv:2202.13228. By successfully overcoming the finite-temperature floor that limits conventional schemes, our method paves the way for unprecedented quantum control over mechanical systems and establishes the experimental viability of zero-heating optomechanical cooling.</description>

      <title>Assessing Finite Scalability in Early Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computing for Homogeneous Catalysts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As quantum hardware advances toward fault-tolerant operation, an intermediate stage known as early fault-tolerant quantum computing (EFTQC) is emerging, where partial error correction enables meaningful computation. In this regime, the ability of quantum processors to scale in size and depth has become a crucial factor shaping their achievable performance. This study investigates how finite scalability influences resource requirements for simulating open-shell catalytic systems using Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE). The analysis compares hardware archetypes distinguished by fidelity or operation speed under two representative scalability models. Finite scalability increases qubit and runtime demands yet leaves overall scaling behavior intact, with high-fidelity architectures requiring lower minimum scalability to solve equally sized problems. These effects are largely independent of the chosen scalability model. Extending this framework, we examine runtime competitiveness across hardware and code configurations, incorporating surface-code and quantum Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC)-based fault tolerance under finite scalability. The results identify operating regimes where high-fidelity architectures remain competitive despite slower gate speeds and show that LDPC codes further expand this regime by reducing space-time overhead. Together, these findings highlight the central role of scalability in quantifying performance and guiding the design of next-generation quantum hardware. Continued progress in scalable architectures will be essential for extending quantum computing to increasingly complex scientific and industrial applications.</description>

      <title>Hardware-Efficient Bosonic Module for Entangling Superconducting Quantum Processors via Optical Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scaling superconducting quantum processors beyond single dilution refrigerators requires efficient optical interconnects, yet integrating microwave-to-optical (M2O) transducers poses challenges due to frequency mismatches and qubit decoherence. We propose a modular architecture using SNAIL-based parametric coupling to interface Brillouin M2O transducers with long-lived 3D cavities, while maintaining plug-and-play compatibility. Through numerical simulations incorporating realistic noises, including laser heating, propagation losses, and detection inefficiency, we demonstrate raw entangled bit fidelities of F~0.8 at kHz-level rates over 30 km using the Duan-Lukin-Cirac-Zoller (DLCZ) protocol. Implementing asymmetric entanglement pumping tailored to amplitude damping errors, we achieve purified fidelities F~0.94 at 0.2 kHz rates. Our cavity-based approach outperforms transmon schemes, providing a practical pathway for distributed superconducting quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Phase Transition in Chaotic non-Hermitian Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have studied entanglement phase transition in a class of chaotic non-Hermitian spin chain in which its spin-spin coupling term commutes with the non-Hermitian term. Two models are investigated: transverse field Ising model with a complex longitudinal field and non-Hermitian XX model with a transverse field. Through calculating their complex spectra, we find these models are subject to a gapless-gapped phase transition with dissipation rate if the transverse field is larger than a model-dependent value. Interestingly, the variation of the complex gap with the dissipation rate is not monotonous, instead it manifest oscillations before entering the gapped phase. By simulating their non-unitary evolution, we show that the entanglement entropy of the steady state would transition from a volume-law to an area-law scaling with the increase of the dissipation rate. Meanwhile, some unexpected results about the entanglement entropy appear in the volume-law phase. These unusual features of the complex gap and the steady-state entanglement can be attributed to level crossings between the maximal imagine level and other levels. Our work reveals a novel entanglement transition in chaotic non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <title>From Local Nonclassicality to Entanglement: A Convexity Law for Single-Excitation Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a simple dynamical law for excitation-preserving interactions: the {sum of local Wigner negativities} is upper-bounded by a fixed budget set by the initially excited state. For the single-excitation sector of the XY model (and its beam-splitter analogue), this convexity bound equals the negativity of the seed state and is saturated only when the excitation is fully localized. At intermediate times the sum lies strictly below the bound due to phase-space overlap in local mixtures, quantitatively accounting for entanglement growth as a redistribution of a finite, budgeted resource into shared correlations. We establish the result analytically for two bodies and corroborate it numerically in engineered state-transfer chains, where it reveals a coherence-enabled dark transport: the resource becomes locally invisible while being stored in multi-body coherences. The predicted trajectory of the summed local negativity provides a practical hardware metric: deviations from the ideal, budgeted curve diagnose decoherence and control error.</description>

      <title>Shortcuts to adiabaticity for coherent atom transport in an adjustable family of two-dimensional optical lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the compelling need for coherent atom transport in a variety of emerging quantum technologies, we investigate such transport on the example of an adjustable family of two-dimensional optical lattices [L. Tarruell {\em et al.}, Nature (London) 483, 302 (2012)] that includes square, triangular, honeycomb, dimerized, and checkerboard lattices as its special cases; dynamical optical lattices of this type have already been utilized for the demonstration of topological pumping and the realiza- tion of two-qubit quantum gates with neutral atoms. At the outset, we propose the appropriate arrangements of acousto-optic modulators that give rise to a frequency imbalance between coun- terpropagating laser beams, thus leading to the dynamical-lattice effect in an arbitrary direction in the lattice plane. We subsequently obtain the dynamical-lattice trajectories that enable atom transport using shortcuts to adiabaticity (STA) in the form of inverse engineering based on a dy- namical invariant of Lewis-Riesenfeld type. We then quantify the resulting atom dynamics using the transport fidelity computed from the numerical solutions of the relevant time-dependent Schroedinger equation. We do so for various choices of the system parameters and transport directions, finding favorable results for the achievable transport times and robustness of the resulting transport to various experimental imperfections.</description>

      <title>Quantum Design Automation: Foundations, Challenges, and the Road Ahead</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.10479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing is transitioning from laboratory research to industrial deployment, yet significant challenges persist: system scalability and performance, fabrication yields, and the advancement of algorithms and applications. We emphasize that in building quantum computers -- spanning quantum chips, system integration, instruction sets, algorithms, and middleware such as quantum error correction schemes -- design is everywhere. In this paper, we advocate for a holistic design perspective in quantum computing, a perspective we argue is pivotal to unlocking innovative co-design opportunities and addressing the aforementioned key challenges. To equip readers with sufficient background for exploring co-optimization opportunities, we detail how interconnected computational methods and tools collaborate to enable end-to-end quantum computer design. This coverage encompasses critical stages -- such as chip layout design automation, high-fidelity system-level simulation, Hamiltonian derivation for quantum system modeling, control pulse simulation, decoherence analysis, and physical verification and testing -- followed by quantum instruction set design. We then proceed to quantum system and software development, including quantum circuit synthesis, quantum error correction and fault tolerance, and logic verification and testing. Through these discussions, we illustrate with concrete examples -- including co-optimizing quantum instruction sets with algorithmic considerations, customizing error correction circuits to hardware-specific constraints, and streamlining quantum chip design through tailored code design, among others. We hope that the detailed end-to-end design workflow as well as these examples will foster dialogue between the hardware and software communities, ultimately facilitating the translation of meaningful research findings into future quantum hardware implementations.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Structure of Nonlocal Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlocal interactions are known to generate volume-law entanglement entropy. However, their deeper impact on the fine structure of quantum correlations remains a key open question. In this work, we explore a bosonic nonlocal field theory, examining correlation measures beyond entanglement entropy, namely, mutual information and tripartite information. Using numerical lattice simulations, we show that the nonlocality scale, \(A\), not only determines the onset of volume-law behavior but also leads to striking features: notably, extremely long-range mutual information and an unusual monogamy structure. In this regime, increasing the separation between large regions can paradoxically enhance their multipartite entanglement. Through holographic duality, we verify that the Ryu-Takayanagi formula correctly captures the volume-law scaling of entropy. Yet, a significant tension emerges: while the field theory reveals rich spatial correlations, the holographic model predicts a complete suppression of both mutual and tripartite information in the volume-law phase. This non-monogamous behavior in the holographic description stands in sharp contrast to the monogamous and highly structured entanglement observed in the field theory. Our results demonstrate that nonlocality gives rise to quantum states of such complexity that conventional geometric models of spacetime fall short. This points to the need for a new framework that goes beyond geometry to fully capture the nature of these correlations.</description>

      <title>Frequency Spectra of Isolated Laser Pulse Envelopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper will deal with isolated laser pulses, those which last for a finite time interval and whose envelope function is strictly zero outside of this interval. We numerically calculate the Fourier transform of this function and study its asymptotic behavior at high frequencies. This work is motivated by recent results on the probability distributions of quadratic operators in second quantized systems. An example is the density of a material which is subject to zero point fluctuations in the phonon vacuum state. These distributions can decrease very slowly, leading to a relatively high probability for large fluctuations. If the operator is measured by a laser pulse, the rate of decrease of the distribution mirrors the rate of decrease of the pulse envelope Fourier transform. We describe a model for the creation of isolated pulses in which this Fourier transform falls as an exponential of a fractional power of frequency and find examples where this fraction is in the range 0.1 to 0.2. The probability distribution for large fluctuation has the same functional form and implies a significant probability for fluctuations very large compared to the variance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.10550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study scattering of particles which obey an $SU(N)$ global symmetry through the lens of quantum computation and quantum algorithms. We show that for scattering between particles which transform in the fundamental or anti-fundamental representations, i.e. qudits, all 2-2 scattering amplitudes can be constructed from only three quantum gates. Further, for any $N$, all 2-2 scattering channels are shown to emerge from the span of a $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ algebra, suggesting that scattering in this context is fundamentally governed by the action of ``bit flips'' on the internal quantum numbers. We frame these findings in terms of quantum algorithms constructed from Linear Combinations of Unitaries and block encoding.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.10556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum fluctuation plays a key role in the parametric down-conversion in the Langevin regime. In this paper, we report the experimental realization of optical parametric down-conversion in the Langevin regime on a chip. By precisely controlling the loss inherently tied to fluctuation, we observe the asymmetric Hong-Ou-Mandel dip - a hallmark of quantum fluctuation in the fluctuation-driven PDC, and the fluctuation-induced compression of single photons by nearly one order of magnitude. These findings pave the way for the manipulation of quantum fluctuation, quantum states, and system-reservoir interaction.</description>

      <title>Finite-size quantum key distribution rates from R\'enyi entropies using conic optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.10584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finite-size general security proofs for quantum key distribution based on R\'enyi entropies have recently been introduced. These approaches are more flexible and provide tighter bounds on the secret key rate than traditional formulations based on the von Neumann entropy. However, deploying them requires minimizing the conditional R\'enyi entropy, a difficult optimization problem that has hitherto been tackled using ad-hoc techniques based on the Frank-Wolfe algorithm, which are unstable and can only handle particular cases. In this work, we introduce a method based on non-symmetric conic optimization for solving this problem. Our technique is fast, reliable, and completely general. We illustrate its performance on several protocols, whose results represent an improvement over the state of the art.</description>

      <title>Information phases of partial projected ensembles generated from random quantum states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The projected ensemble -- an ensemble of pure states on a subsystem conditioned on projective measurement outcomes on its complement -- provides a finer probe of ergodicity and information structure than the reduced density matrix of the subsystem in bipartite quantum states. This framework can be generalised to partial projected ensembles in tripartite settings, where outcomes from part of the measured subsystem are discarded, leading to ensembles of mixed states. We show that information measures defined for such ensembles, in particular the Holevo information, yield a more detailed characterisation of how quantum information is distributed between subsystems compared to conventional entanglement measures. Using exact analytical results supported by numerical results, we uncover a qualitative change in the scaling of the Holevo information with system size in partial projected ensembles generated by Haar-random states, as the relative sizes of the subsystem are varied. In one phase, the Holevo information decays exponentially with system size, while in the other it grows linearly, thereby defining distinct information phases separated by sharp transitions signalled by non-analyticities in the Holevo information. The exponentially decaying phase rigorously establishes the existence of a measurement-invisible quantum-correlated phase -- a manifestation of many-body information scrambling with no bipartite analogue. Finally, we contrast this information-phase diagram with the entanglement-phase structure of tripartite Haar-random states obtained from logarithmic negativity, and show that the Holevo information reveals additional fine structure beyond conventional entanglement measures.</description>

Abstract: The development of quantum computation has resulted in many quantum algorithms for a wide array of tasks. Recently, there is a growing interest in using quantum computing techniques to estimate or compute quantum information-theoretic quantities such as Renyi entropy, Von Neumann entropy, matrix means, etc. Motivated by these results, we present quantum algorithms for computing the maximal quantum $f$-divergences and the operator-theoretic matrix Kubo--Ando means. Both of them involve Renyi entropies, matrix means as special cases, thus implying the universality of our framework.</description>

Abstract: The speed of a fault-tolerant quantum computer is dictated by the reaction time of its classical electronics, that is, the total time required by decoders and controllers to determine the outcome of a logical measurement and execute subsequent conditional logical operations. Despite its importance, the reaction time and its impact on the design of the logical microarchitecture of a quantum computer are not well understood. In this work, we build, for a surface code based architecture, a model for the reaction time in which the decoder latency is based on parallel space- and time-window decoding methods, and communication latencies are drawn from our envisioned quantum execution environment comprising a high-speed network of quantum processing units, controllers, decoders, and high-performance computing nodes. We use this model to estimate the increase in the logical error rate of magic state injections as a function of the reaction time. Next, we show how the logical microarchitecture can be optimized with respect to the reaction time, and then present detailed full-system quantum and classical resource estimates for executing utility-scale quantum circuits based on realistic hardware noise parameters and state-of-the-art decoding times. For circuits with $10^{6}$--$10^{11}$ $T$ gates involving 200--2000 logical qubits, under a $\Lambda=9.3$ hardware model representative of a realistic target for superconducting quantum processors operating at a 2.86 MHz stabilization frequency, we show that even decoding at a sub-microsecond per stabilization round speed introduces substantial resource overheads: approximately 100k--250k additional physical qubits for correction qubit storage in the magic state factory; 300k--1.75M extra physical qubits in the core processor due to the code distance increase of $d$ to $d+4$ for extra memory protection; and a longer runtime by roughly a factor of 100.</description>

      <title>Emergent spin order and steady-state superradiance in one-dimensional baths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spontaneous collective decay in driven atomic ensembles can generate coherence far from equilibrium, as illustrated by superradiant lasers where decay into a single-mode cavity synchronizes atomic phases into a macroscopic dipole and yields superradiant emission of light with an ultranarrow spectrum. Whether similar ordering persists in multimode reservoirs with propagation and competing collective decay channels remains an open question. We address this problem by analyzing atoms coupled to one-dimensional electromagnetic baths through two models. The first is a ring cavity supporting two bright collective decay channels, and the second is a bidirectional waveguide where, in addition to competition between channels, propagation induces coherent dipole-dipole interactions. For suitable incoherent pumping strengths, the dynamics enters a synchronization window in which collective decay overcomes disordering processes, leading to spontaneous steady-state phase ordering and superradiant emission. We extract the thresholds marking the onset of synchronization and show that the maximum intensity scales quadratically in both models. The resulting order is not described by a single macroscopic dipole: in the ring cavity spontaneous chirality emerges at the level of individual trajectories, while the waveguide develops a local chirality with different orders dominating opposite ends of the atomic array. The analysis of the emitted light spectrum reveals a linewidth that seems to narrow with increased system size in the ring cavity, while narrowing in the waveguide remains inconclusive within accessible numerics. These results clarify how competition and propagation shape emergent order in one-dimensional reservoirs and identify regimes where steady-state superradiance may arise beyond the Dicke limit.</description>

      <title>A Remarkable Application of Zassenhaus Formula to Strongly Correlated Electron Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24364v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the Zassenhaus decomposition for the exponential of the sum of two non-commuting operators, simplifies drastically when these operators satisfy a simple condition, called the no-mixed adjoint property. An important application to a Unitary Coupled Cluster method for strongly correlated electron systems is presented. This ansatz requires no Trotterization and is exact on a quantum computer with a finite number of Givens gate equals to the number of free parameters. The formulas obtained in this work also shed light on why and when optimization after Trotterization gives exact solutions in disentangled forms of unitary coupled cluster.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a framework and explicit construction for the regularized measurement of a large class of spacetime-localized observables in bosonic quantum field theory. The measurements fully satisfy relativistic causality and causal transparency, i.e., avoid unphysical superluminal signaling. We show explicitly how the measurement of time-extended observables back-reacts on itself and induces correlations between other measurements in its causal future. Our framework is fully compositional in spacetime and extends previous results on the measurement of instantaneous observables.</description>

      <title>Resolving the phase of a Dirac topological state via interferometric photoemission</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.09560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The electronic wavefunction is at the heart of physical phenomena, defining the frontiers of quantum materials research. While the amplitude of the electron wavefunction in crystals can be measured with state-of-the-art probes in unprecedented resolution, its phase has remained largely inaccessible, obscuring rich electronic information. Here we develop a quantum-path electron interferometer based on time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, that enables the reconstruction of the phase of electronic states in quantum materials - with energy and momentum resolution. We demonstrate the scheme by resolving the phase along the Dirac electronic band of a prototypical topological insulator and observe a resonance-associated phase jump as well as a momentum and phase synchronized inversion revealing the helicity of the Dirac cone. We show the interferometer can be optically controlled by the polarization of the absorbed light, allowing a differential measurement of the phase - a crucial component for extracting phase information from an interferogram. This photo-electron-interferometer is a purely experimental scheme and does not rely on any specific theoretical model. It can be extended to a variety of materials, opening up the phase dimension in quantum materials research.</description>

      <title>Mutual information as a measure of renormalizability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.09625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Renormalization is an essential technique in field-theoretic descriptions of natural phenomena, where the absence of a UV-complete description yields an abundance of divergent quantities. While the renormalization prescription has been thoroughly refined for equilibrium systems, consistently extending it to out-of-equilibrium systems is an active area of research. In this paper, we identify a mutual information-based measure of renormalizability that applies to quantum field theories both in and out of equilibrium. Specifically, we use mutual information to characterize correlations between infinitesimal shells in momentum space and show that the logarithmic derivative of mutual information with mode separation, at large mode separation, is a measure of renormalizability. We first consider Minkowski spacetime, where we introduce dynamics by performing an interaction quench, initializing the field in the free theory vacuum and then turning on the interaction. We show that the late-time mutual information relaxes to that for the interacting vacuum and the logarithmic derivative at large mode separation is negative for super-renormalizable theories, zero for renormalizable (marginal) theories, and positive for non-renormalizable theories. We then consider a conformally-coupled scalar field on the Poincar\'{e} patch of de Sitter spacetime, initializing the field in the Bunch-Davies vacuum in the asymptotic past. For different self-interactions and at any finite time, we find that the resulting mutual information has the same qualitative behavior as a function of mode separation, demonstrating that it can be used as a reliable indicator of renormalizability.</description>

      <title>Superdiffusive transport protected by topology and symmetry in all dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.09629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superdiffusion is an anomalous transport behavior. Recently, a new mechanism, termed the ``nodal mechanism," has been proposed to induce superdiffusion in quantum models. However, existing realizations of the nodal mechanism have so far been proposed on fine-tuned, artificial Hamiltonians, posing a significant challenge for experimental observation. In this work, we propose a broad class of models for generating superdiffusion potentially realizable in condensed matter systems across different spatial dimensions. A robust nodal structure emerges from the hybridization between the itinerant electrons and the local impurity orbitals, protected by the intrinsic symmetry and topology of the electronic band. We derive a universal scaling law for the conductance, $G \sim L^{-\gamma}$, revealing how the exponent is dictated by the dimensionality of the nodal structure ($D_{\text{node}}$) and its order $n$, and the dimensionality of the system $(D)$ at high temperatures or that of the Fermi surface ($D^F$) at low temperatures. Through numerical simulations, we validate these scaling relations at zero temperature for various models, including those based on graphene and multi-Weyl semimetals, finding excellent agreement between our theory and the computed exponents. Beyond the scaling of conductance, our framework predicts a suite of experimentally verifiable signatures, notably a new mechanism for linear-in-temperature resistivity ($\rho \sim T$) and a divergent low-frequency optical conductivity ($\sigma(\omega) \sim \omega^{\gamma -1}$), establishing a practical route to discovering and engineering anomalous transport in quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium Probes of Quantum Geometry in Gapless Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Much of our understanding of gapless many-body quantum systems stems from their low-energy descriptions as conformal field theories. This is especially true in 1+1 dimensions, where such theories have an infinite-dimensional parameter space induced by their conformal symmetry. We reveal the associated quantum geometry by considering finite systems driven by time-dependent conformal transformations. For small deformations, perturbation theory predicts absorption rates and linear responses that are intrinsically related to components of the quantum geometric tensor. For arbitrarily large but adiabatic deformations, we show that periodic drives give rise to nontrivial return amplitudes involving the quantum metric, beyond the familiar leading order that only features a Berry phase. Our field-theoretic findings are universal, comprising general relations between measurable quantities and quantum geometry that only depend on the central charge of the conformal symmetry. This is supported by both analytical results for quantum dynamics under certain Floquet drives, and numerical simulations of gapless lattice models.</description>

      <title>Green Function Invariants for Floquet Topological Superconductivity Induced by Proximity Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We bring forward a Green function approach for the prediction of Floquet topological phases in driven superconductor-semiconductor hybrids. Although it is common to treat the superconducting component as a mere Cooper-pair reservoir, it was recently pointed out that such an approximation breaks down in the presence of driving, due to the emergence of level broadening. Here, we go beyond these recent works and prescribe how to construct the Floquet topological invariants for such driven hybrids. Specifically, we propose to first obtain the midgap quasi-energy spectra by including the hermitian part of the semiconductor's self-energy and, subsequently, read out the respective level broadenings by projecting the anti-hermitian part of the self-energy onto the quasi-energy eigenvectors. We exemplify our approach for a Rashba nanowire coupled to a superconductor and a time-dependent Zeeman field. Using our method, we obtain the Floquet band structure, the respective level broadenings, and the topological invariants. Our analysis reinforces the need to properly account for the self-energy, and corroborates that broadening effects can hinder the observation of the Floquet topological phases and especially of those harboring Majorana $\pi$ modes.</description>

Abstract: Spatially resolved local quantum geometric markers play a crucial role in the diagnosis of topological phases without long-range translational symmetry, including amorphous systems. Here, we focus on the nonlocality of such markers. We demonstrate that they behave as correlation functions independently of the material's structure, showing sharp variations in the vicinity of topological transitions and exhibiting a unique pattern in real space for each transition. Notably, we find that, even within the same Altland-Zirnbauer class, distinct topological transitions generate qualitatively different spatial signatures, enabling a refined, class-internal probe of topological stability. As such, nonlocal quantum geometric indicators provide a more efficient and versatile tool to understand and predict the stability of topological phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Geometry Induced Chiral Transport and Entanglement in $AdS_2$ Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the real-time chiral dynamics of Dirac fermions in AdS$_2$ and AdS$_2$ black hole backgrounds. The spacetime curvature generates a spin connection term, acting as an effective magnetic field and a position-dependent chiral chemical potential. This leads to strongly asymmetric wave propagation, confined within an inhomogeneous Lieb-Robinson cone. The front velocities decrease with increasing fermion mass and horizon radius. Entanglement growth occurs inside the causal cone, and saturates through a string-breaking mechanism driven by screening excitations. In dipole-dipole scattering, the central bipartite entropy rises when the inward Lieb-Robinson fronts intersect, forming a bright ridge in the local entanglement profile. Charge and current correlators peak at the front arrival, providing a real-time diagnostic of chiral transport. These results establish a causality-respecting framework, linking curvature and horizons to transport and entanglement in (1+1)-dimensional fermionic matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.09730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a quantum linear response (qLR) approach within an active-space framework for computing indirect nuclear spin-spin coupling constants, a key ingredient in NMR spectra predictions. The method employs the unitary coupled cluster (UCC) ansatz and its orbital-optimized variant (ooUCC), both suitable for quantum computing implementations, to evaluate spin-spin coupling constants via qLR. Test calculations on five small molecules are compared with CASCI, CASSCF, and conventional CCSD results. qLR with UCC/ooUCC yields spin-spin coupling constants comparable to classical methods. We further examine the role of orbital optimization and find that ooUCC markedly affects the computed couplings; orbital-optimized results show better agreement with CCSD. These findings indicate that orbital optimization is important for accurate NMR coupling predictions within quantum-computing-friendly correlated methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.09859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recovering microscopic couplings directly from data provides a route to solving the inverse problem in statistical field theories, one that complements the traditional-often computationally intractable-forward approach of predicting observables from an action or Hamiltonian. Here, we propose an approach for the inverse problem that uniformly accommodates systems with discrete, continuous, and hybrid variables. We demonstrate accurate parameter recovery in several benchmark systems-including Wegner's Ising gauge theory, $\phi^4$ theory, Schwinger and Sine-Gordon models, and mixed spin-gauge systems, and show how iterating the procedure under coarse-graining reconstructs full non-perturbative renormalization-group flows. This gives direct access to phase boundaries, fixed points, and emergent interactions without relying on perturbation theory. We also address a realistic setting where full gauge configurations may be unavailable, and reformulate learning algorithms for multiple field theories so that they are recovered directly using observables such as correlations from scattering data or quantum simulators. We anticipate that our methodology will find widespread use in practical learning of field theories in strongly coupled regimes where analytical tools might fail.</description>

      <title>Quantum Phase Gradient Imaging Using a Nonlocal Metasurface System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum phase imaging enables the analysis of transparent samples with thickness and refractive index variations in scenarios requiring precise measurements under low-light conditions. Recent advances in nonlinear metasurfaces offer compact solutions for quantum light generation and manipulation. Here, we present a compact quantum phase imaging system integrating a lithium niobate (LiNbO3) metasurface for generating spatially entangled photon pairs and a silicon (Si) metasurface for phase gradient extraction. The LiNbO3 metasurface enables efficient spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) with angularly dispersed, tunable emission, while the Si metasurface employs a nearly linear optical transfer function (OTF) to differentiate phase and extract phase gradients via spatial quantum correlations. This dual-metasurface enabled combined ghost imaging and all-optical scanning protocols with quantum light achieves phase gradient reconstruction without mechanical tuning. Experimental results demonstrate the system's ability to resolve phase gradients up to 25 rad/mm with 88% fidelity using a 6x3-pixel proof-of-concept setup. In addition, theoretically, it is confirmed that the resolution of the system is primarily limited by the quality factor of the compact design, leveraging nonlocal resonances and quantum correlations, establishes a new paradigm for portable quantum phase-gradient imaging, with potential applications in sensing, microscopy, and LiDAR. This work highlights the application of metasurface in both generating and detecting quantum states.</description>

      <title>SeQuant Framework for Symbolic and Numerical Tensor Algebra. I. Core Capabilities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.09943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: SeQuant is an open-source library for symbolic algebra of tensors over commutative (scalar) and non-commutative (operator) rings. The key innovation supporting most of its functionality is a graph-theoretic tensor network (TN) canonicalizer that can handle tensor networks with symmetries faster than their standard group-theoretic counterparts. The TN canonicalizer is used for routine simplification of conventional tensor expressions, for optimizing application of Wick's theorem (used to canonicalize products of tensors over operator fields), and for manipulation of the intermediate representation leading to the numerical evaluation. Notable features of SeQuant include support for noncovariant tensor networks (which often arise from tensor decompositions) and for tensors with modes that depend parametrically on indices of other tensor modes (such dependencies between degrees of freedom are naturally viewed as nesting of tensors, "tensors of tensors" arising in block-wise data compressions in data science and modern quantum simulation). SeQuant blurs the line between pure symbolic manipulation/code generation and numerical evaluation by including compiler-like components to optimize and directly interpret tensor expressions using external numerical tensor algebra frameworks. The SeQuant source code is available at https://github.com/ValeevGroup/SeQuant.</description>

      <title>Interaction as Interference: A Quantum-Inspired Aggregation Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical approaches often treat interaction as engineered product terms or as emergent patterns in flexible models, offering little control over how synergy or antagonism arises. We take a quantum-inspired view: following the Born rule (probability as squared amplitude), \emph{coherent} aggregation sums complex amplitudes before squaring, creating an interference cross-term, whereas an \emph{incoherent} proxy sums squared magnitudes and removes it. In a minimal linear-amplitude model, this cross-term equals the standard potential-outcome interaction contrast \(\Delta_{\mathrm{INT}}\) in a \(2\times 2\) factorial design, giving relative phase a direct, mechanism-level control over synergy versus antagonism.
  We instantiate this idea in a lightweight \emph{Interference Kernel Classifier} (IKC) and introduce two diagnostics: \emph{Coherent Gain} (log-likelihood gain of coherent over the incoherent proxy) and \emph{Interference Information} (the induced Kullback-Leibler gap). A controlled phase sweep recovers the identity. On a high-interaction synthetic task (XOR), IKC outperforms strong baselines under paired, budget-matched comparisons; on real tabular data (\emph{Adult} and \emph{Bank Marketing}) it is competitive overall but typically trails the most capacity-rich baseline in paired differences. Holding learned parameters fixed, toggling aggregation from incoherent to coherent consistently improves negative log-likelihood, Brier score, and expected calibration error, with positive Coherent Gain on both datasets.</description>

      <title>Geometric foundations of thermodynamics in the quantum regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present a comprehensive geometrical formulation of quantum thermodynamics based on contact geometry and principal fiber bundles. The quantum thermodynamic state space is modeled as a contact manifold, with equilibrium Gibbs states forming a Legendrian submanifold that encodes the fundamental thermodynamic relations. A principal fiber bundle over the manifold of density operators distinguishes the quantum state structure from thermodynamic labels: its fibers represent non-equilibrium configurations, and their unique intersections with the equilibrium submanifold enforce thermodynamic consistency. Quasistatic processes correspond to minimizing geodesics under the Bures-Wasserstein metric, leading to minimal dissipation, while the divergence of geodesic length toward rank-deficient states geometrically derives the third law. Non-equilibrium extensions, formulated through pseudo-Riemannian metrics and connections on the principal bundle, introduce curvature-induced holonomy that quantifies irreversibility in cyclic processes. In this framework, the thermodynamic laws in the quantum regime emerge naturally as geometric consequences.</description>

      <title>Competing Localizations on Disordered Non-Hermitian Random Graph Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phase transitions in one-dimensional lattice systems are well established and have been extensively studied within both Hermitian and non-Hermitian frameworks. In this work, we extend this understanding to a more general setting by investigating localization and delocalization transitions and the behavior of the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) using a tight binding model on a generalized random graph lattice. Our model incorporates three key parameters, asymmetric hopping $\Delta$, on site disorder $W$, and a random long-range coupling $p$ that render the underlying nature of random graph. By varying $p,$ $\Delta$ and the disorder, we explore the interplay between topology, randomness, and non-Hermiticity in determining localization properties. Our results show the competition between skin effect driven and Anderson driven localizations in the parameter regimes. Despite the presence of large disorder, the skin effect driven localization coexists with Anderson driven localization.</description>

      <title>Improved Offline Reinforcement Learning via Quantum Metric Encoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) with limited samples is common in real-world applications. However, offline RL performance under this constraint is often suboptimal. We consider an alternative approach to dealing with limited samples by introducing the Quantum Metric Encoder (QME). In this methodology, instead of applying the RL framework directly on the original states and rewards, we embed the states into a more compact and meaningful representation, where the structure of the encoding is inspired by quantum circuits. For classical data, QME is a classically simulable, trainable unitary embedding and thus serves as a quantum-inspired module, on a classical device. For quantum data in the form of quantum states, QME can be implemented directly on quantum hardware, allowing for training without measurement or re-encoding.
  We evaluated QME on three datasets, each limited to 100 samples. We use Soft-Actor-Critic (SAC) and Implicit-Q-Learning (IQL), two well-known RL algorithms, to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. From the experimental results, we find that training offline RL agents on QME-embedded states with decoded rewards yields significantly better performance than training on the original states and rewards. On average across the three datasets, for maximum reward performance, we achieve a 116.2% improvement for SAC and 117.6% for IQL.
  We further investigate the $\Delta$-hyperbolicity of our framework, a geometric property of the state space known to be important for the RL training efficacy. The QME-embedded states exhibit low $\Delta$-hyperbolicity, suggesting that the improvement after embedding arises from the modified geometry of the state space induced by QME. Thus, the low $\Delta$-hyperbolicity and the corresponding effectiveness of QME could provide valuable information for developing efficient offline RL methods under limited-sample conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.10189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well known that all physically relevant states of gauge theories lie in the sectors of the Hilbert space which satisfy the Gauss law. On the lattice, the manifeslty gauge invariant subspace is known to be exactly spanned by gauged tensor networks. In this work, we demonstrate that the continuum limit of certain types of gauged tensor networks is well defined and leads to a new class of states that may be helpful for the non-perturbative study of gauge theories directly in the continuum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.10197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-energy particle decays naturally realise informationally weak measurements of quantum spin. Decay kinematics act as continuous pointer variables whose overlapping angular distributions encode partial, non-projective information about the parent spin state. Ensemble averages of these pointers yield weak values, linking collider spin-density reconstruction to Aharonov-Vaidman measurement theory. This framework unifies spin tomography, entangled-decay correlations, and spin-correlation algorithms, showing that relativistic decays realise informationally weak measurements of spin and suggesting new ways to probe coherence and interference in high-energy processes.</description>

      <title>Direct Raman observation of the quantum metric in a quantum magnet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.10246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum geometric tensor (QGT) unifies the Berry curvature (its imaginary part) and the quantum metric (its real part), yet Raman studies of chiral phonons have so far accessed only the former. We perform circularly polarized Raman spectroscopy on the quantum magnet K2Co(SeO3)2, where the field-odd chiral splitting and the field-even center-frequency shift collapse onto a single curve across temperature and magnetic field, revealing a common microscopic origin for both observables. Since the chiral splitting reflects the Berry curvature, the concomitant even component, arising from the same microscopic origin, captures the field-induced change of the quantum metric, corresponding to the diagonal Born-Oppenheimer correction. Across two resolvable Eg modes, the unified data are well captured by a simple empirical quadratic relation. These results establish Raman spectroscopy as a direct probe of the quantum metric and an operational decomposition of quantum geometry within a single measurement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.10274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Harnessing a beam of slow free electrons in artificial photonic structures offers a powerful, tunable platform for generating nonclassical light without the need for heavy physical equipment. Here we present a theory of nonclassical lasing, demonstrating how incoherent electrons in photonic crystal cavities can coherently emit photons through collective dynamics. When photon emission rate exceeds cavity losses, nonclassical lasing with sub-Poissonian photon statistics emerges, driven by multi-photon Rabi oscillations. At specific coupling strengths, quantum state trapping effect emerges, producing high-fidelity Fock states at room temperature (e.g. nearly 90%-fidelity of four photon Fock state). Notably, the frequency of the emitted photons can be readily tuned via the velocity of the injected electrons to match cavity modes. This approach supports photonic integration and offers a scalable, energy-efficient platform for room-temperature quantum light sources and advanced studies in quantum electrodynamics.</description>

Abstract: The measurements of Hanle and polarization recovery effects for localized charge carriers are the basic tools for determining parameters of the spin dynamics, such as strength of the hyperfine interaction, for example, in quantum dots. We describe the dependence of the spin polarization of localized electrons on transverse and longitudinal magnetic fields taking into account the interplay between electron hopping and measurement back action. We show that these two have a qualitatively similar effect in the Faraday geometry, but compete in the Voigt geometry. This allows one to describe a broad range of the experimental results and study the fundamental effects of quantum measurements.</description>

Abstract: We combine numerical and experimental approaches to study how impurities affect the maximum superflow in an annular Bose-Einstein condensate. By tuning the impurity density, we achieve precise control over the stability of persistent currents which increases with the impurity number. In the unstable regime, the complex vortex motion within the impurity landscape, characterized by pinning and unpinning events, governs the timescale of the current decay and its final value. Our work establishes atomic superfluids as a pristine platform for exploring universal mechanisms of superflow stabilization and decay, paving the way for atomtronic quantum technologies.</description>

We find that there is little significant difference between untreated SiO$_2$ samples and those that have been etched with hydrogen fluoride or Transene AlPad Etch 639. SiN and AlN samples performed significantly better than all SiO$_2$ samples giving a 45% increase in surface flashover voltage at a distance of 5 $\mu$m with the difference increasing with electrode spacing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.10559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the interplay between crossing symmetry and entanglement in $2 \to 2$ scattering within local quantum field theories that possess an $SU(N)$ global symmetry. In particular, we recast scattering amplitudes of fixed helicity as quantum operations on the Hilbert space of internal quantum numbers, where the external states play the role of qudits. The entire space of $SU(N)$-invariant scattering operators between qudits is spanned by a minimal set of three quantum gates. Recoupling relations among quantum gates are shown to follow directly from the crossing properties of the underlying amplitudes and reveal that entanglement generated from separable states in one channel is necessarily intertwined with another. Consequently, we argue any interacting quantum field theory that realizes an $SU(N)$ global symmetry must generate entanglement in at least one scattering channel.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.10642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum theory of geometrically frustrated systems is usually approached as a gauge theory where the local conservation law becomes the Gauss law. Here we show that it can do something fundamentally different: enforce a global conserved quantity via a non-perturbative tiling invariant, rigorously linking microscopic geometry to a new macroscopically phase-coherent state. In a frustrated bosonic model on the honeycomb lattice in the cluster-charging regime at fractional filling, this mechanism protects a conserved global quantum number, the sublattice polarization $\tilde{N} = N_A - N_B$. Quantum fluctuation drives the spontaneous symmetry breaking of this global U(1) symmetry to result in a supernematic (SN) phase -- an incompressible yet phase-coherent quantum state that breaks rotational symmetry without forming a superfluid or realizing topological order. This establishes a route to a novel quantum many-body state driven by combinatorial constraints.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.10646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In addition to topological lattice defects such as dislocations and disclinations, crystals are also accompanied by unavoidable ordinary defects, devoid of any non-trivial geometry or topology, among which vacancies, Schottky defects, substitutions, interstitials, and Frenkel pairs are the most common. In this work, we demonstrate that these ubiquitous ordinary lattice defects, though topologically trivial, can nonetheless serve as universal probes of the non-trivial topology of electronic Bloch bands, and any change in the local topological environment in an otherwise normal insulator in terms of mid-gap bound states in their vicinity. We theoretically establish these generic findings by implementing a minimal model Hamiltonian describing time-reversal symmetry breaking topological and normal insulators on a square lattice, fostering such point defects. The defect-bound mid-gap modes are also shown to be robust against weak point-like charge impurities. Furthermore, we showcase experimental observation of such bound states by embedding ordinary crystal defects in two-dimensional acoustic Chern lattices, where precision-controlled hopping amplitudes are implemented via active meta-atoms and Green's-function-based spectroscopy is used to reconstruct spectra and eigenstates. Our combined theory-experiment study establishes ordinary lattice defects as probes of topology that should be germane in crystals of any symmetry and dimension, raising the possibility of arresting localized Majorana modes near such defects in the bulk of topological superconductors and to emulate ordinary-defect-engineered topological devices.</description>

Graph minor embedding, which maps a problem to the hardware graph of quantum annealers, affects sampling all states. In this study, we demonstrate the influence of graph minor embedding on fair sampling of degenerate ground states. For two embedded models that introduce auxiliary variables, numerical simulations of Schr\"odinger evolution revealed that fairness varies significantly depending on the embedding, and the chain strength is related to ground-state fairness. Using perturbation theory, we found that chain strength determines the energy landscape around ground states, with flatter landscapes having higher probabilities of being obtained.</description>

      <title>Topologically driven no-superposing theorem with a tight error bound</title>

Abstract: To better understand quantum computation we can search for its limits or no-gos, especially if analogous limits do not appear in classical computation. Classical computation easily implements and extensively employs the addition of two bit strings, so here we study 'quantum addition': the superposition of two quantum states. We prove the impossibility of superposing two unknown states, no matter how many samples of each state are available. The proof uses topology; a quantum algorithm of any sample complexity corresponds to a continuous function, but the function required by the superposition task cannot be continuous by topological arguments. Our result for the first time quantifies the approximation error and the sample complexity $N$ of the superposition task, and it is tight. We present a trivial algorithm with a large approximation error and $N=1$, and the matching impossibility of any smaller approximation error for any $N$. Consequently, our results limit state tomography as a useful subroutine for the superposition. State tomography is useful only in a model that tolerates randomness in the superposed state. The optimal protocol in this random model remains open.</description>

Abstract: We present a protocol to create entangled coherent states by engineering cross-Kerr interactions between bosonic systems endowed with (externally driven) internal spin-like degrees of freedom. With slight modifications, the protocol is also able to produce N00N states through nonlinear beam splitter interactions. Each bosonic system interacts locally with its spin and by suitably tuning the model parameters, various classes of effective bosonic interaction Hamiltonians, mediated by the coupled spins, can be engineered. Our approach is benchmarked by numerical simulations aimed at studying the entanglement within a bosonic register and comparing it with the expected one resulting from the target Hamiltonians.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07306v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Distributing entanglement over long distances remains a challenge due to its fragility when exposed to environmental effects. In this work, we compare various entanglement distribution protocols in a realistic noisy fiber network. We focus specifically on two schemes that only require the sending of a non-entangled carrier photon to remote nodes of the network. These protocols rely on optical CNOT gates and we vary the probability with which they can be successfully performed. Encoding our entangled states in photon polarization, we analyse the effect of depolarizing noise on the photonic states as the carrier passes through the fibers. Building a robust model of photon loss and calculating the distillable entanglement of the noisy states, we find the entanglement distribution rate. We discover that methods involving a separable carrier can reach a higher rate than the standard entanglement distribution protocol, provided that the success probability of the optical CNOT gates is sufficiently high.</description>

      <title>Fault-tolerant and secure long-distance quantum communication via uncorrectable-error-injection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14710v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum networks aim to facilitate the fault-tolerant and secure transmission of quantum states across distant devices. The widely adopted quantum teleportation scheme requires multiple rounds of entanglement swapping and purification, leading to significant resource overhead and operational complexity. In this study, we propose a novel fault-tolerant and secure quantum communication scheme based on uncorrectable error injection. Our method exploits a quantum state encoding scheme based on quantum error correction codes, which strategically introduces uncorrectable errors to enhance security. It eliminates the need for entanglement distribution while reducing resource requirements. The injected errors protect against eavesdropping by preventing unauthorized parties from retrieving meaningful information. Security analysis shows that as the data length and encoded message size increase, information leakage becomes negligible relative to the size of the total message. Comparative performance analysis with existing approaches indicates that our method reduces transmission overhead while maintaining comparable fidelity in low-error regimes. These findings suggest that the proposed method offers a scalable and practical alternative for secure long-distance quantum communication, distributed quantum computing, and future quantum internet applications.</description>

      <title>Bargmann-invariant framework for local unitary equivalence and entanglement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17237v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Research on quantum states often focuses on the correlation between nonlocal effects and local unitary invariants, among which local unitary equivalence plays a significant role in quantum state classification and resource theories. This paper focuses on the local unitary equivalence of multipartite quantum states in quantum information theory, aiming to determine a complete set of invariants that identify their local unitary orbits; these invariants are crucial for deriving polynomial invariants and describing the physical properties preserved under local unitary transformations.The study deeply explores the characterization of local unitary equivalence and the method of detecting entanglement using local unitary Bargmann invariants. Taking two-qubit systems as an example, it verifies the measurability of invariants that determine equivalence and establishes a connection between Makhlin fundamental invariants (a complete set of 18 local unitary invariants for two-qubit states) and local unitary Bargmann invariants. These Bargmann invariants, related to the traces of products of density operators and marginal states, can be measured through cycle tests (an extended form of SWAP tests).</description>

      <title>Relativistic model of spontaneous wave-function localization induced by nonHermitian colored noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07050v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a quantum field theory based on random nonHermitian actions, which upon quantization lead to stochastic nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger dynamics for the state vector. In this framework, Lorentz and spacetime translation symmetries are preserved only in a statistical sense: the probability distribution of the action remains invariant under these transformations. As a result, the theory describes ensembles of quantum-state trajectories whose probability distributions remain invariant under changes of reference frame. As a concrete example, we augment the Dirac action with a purely imaginary term coupling the fermion density operator to a universal colored noise. This noise is constructed by solving the d'Alembert equation with white noise as its source, using a generalized stochastic calculus in 1+3 dimensions. We demonstrate that the colored noise drives stochastic localization of wave packets and derive the localization length analytically. Remarkably, the localization length decreases as the size of the observable universe increases. Our model thus provides a potential framework for relativistic spontaneous wave-function collapse. While establishing consistency with Born's law remains an open challenge, the present work constitutes a step toward embedding collapse models into a Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18025v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum computing with superconducting circuits relies on high-fidelity driven nonlinear processes. An ideal quantum nonlinearity would selectively activate desired coherent processes at high strength, without activating parasitic mixing products or introducing additional decoherence. The wide bandwidth of the Josephson nonlinearity makes this difficult, with undesired drive-induced transitions and decoherence limiting qubit readout, gates, couplers, and amplifiers. Significant strides have been recently made into building better `quantum mixers', with promise being shown by Kerr-free three-wave mixers that suppress driven frequency shifts, and balanced quantum mixers that explicitly forbid a significant fraction of parasitic processes. We propose a novel mixer that combines both these strengths, with engineered selection rules that make it essentially linear (not just Kerr-free) when idle, and activate clean parametric processes even when driven at high strength. Further, its ideal Hamiltonian is simple to analyze analytically, and we show that this ideal behavior is first-order insensitive to dominant experimental imperfections. We expect this mixer to allow significant advances in high-Q control, readout, and amplification.</description>

      <title>Strong Local Passivity in Unconventional Scenarios: A New Protocol for Amplified Quantum Energy Teleportation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05288v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum energy teleportation (QET) has been proposed to overcome the restrictions of strong local passivity (SLP) and to facilitate energy transfer in quantum systems. Traditionally, QET has only been considered under strict constraints, including the requirements that the initial state be the ground state of an interacting Hamiltonian, that Alice's measurement commute with the interaction terms, and that entanglement be present. These constraints have significantly limited the broader applicability of QET protocols. In this work, we demonstrate that SLP can arise beyond these conventional constraints, establishing the necessity of QET in a wider range of scenarios for local energy extraction. This leads to a more flexible and generalized framework for QET. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of a ``local effective Hamiltonian,'' which eliminates the need for optimization techniques in determining Bob's optimal energy extraction in QET protocols. As an additional advantage, the amount of energy that can be extracted using our new protocol is amplified to be 7.2 times higher than that of the original protocol. These advancements enhance our understanding of QET and extend its broader applications to quantum technologies. To support our findings, we implement the protocol on quantum hardware, confirming its theoretical validity and experimental feasibility.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05249v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Collective coherent (CC) errors are inevitable, as every physical qubit undergoes free evolution under its kinetic Hamiltonian. These errors can be more damaging than stochastic Pauli errors because they affect all qubits coherently, resulting in high-weight errors that standard quantum error-correcting (QEC) codes struggle to correct. In quantum memories and communication systems, especially when storage durations are long, CC errors often dominate over stochastic noise. Trapped-ion platforms, for example, exhibit strong CC errors with minimal stochastic Pauli components. In this work, we address the regime where immunity to CC errors, high code rate (due to limited qubit availability), and moderate distance (sufficient for correcting low-weight errors) are all essential. We construct a family of constant-excitation (CE) stabilizer codes with parameters $[[2^{r+1}, 2^r - (r+1), 3]]$. The smallest instance, the $[[8,1,3]]$ code, improves the code rate and error threshold of the best previously known CE code by factors of approximately two and four, respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08449v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a computational method to automatically design the n-qubit realisations of quantum algorithms. Our approach leverages a domain-specific language (DSL) that enables the construction of quantum circuits via modular building blocks, making it well-suited for evolutionary search. In this DSL quantum circuits are abstracted beyond the usual gate-sequence description and scale automatically to any problem size. This enables us to learn the algorithm structure rather than a specific unitary implementation. We demonstrate our method by automatically designing three known quantum algorithms-the Quantum Fourier Transform, the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm, and Grover's search. Remarkably, we were able to learn the general implementation of each algorithm by considering examples of circuits containing at most 5-qubits. Our method proves robust, as it maintains performance across increasingly large search spaces. Convergence to the relevant algorithm is achieved with high probability and with moderate computational resources.</description>

Abstract: In the ever-evolving landscape of quantum cryptography, Device-independent Quantum Key Distribution (DI-QKD) stands out for its unique approach to ensuring security based not on the trustworthiness of the devices but on nonlocal correlations. Beginning with a contextual understanding of modern cryptographic security and the limitations of standard quantum key distribution methods, this review explores the pivotal role of nonclassicality and the challenges posed by various experimental loopholes for DI-QKD. Various protocols, security against individual, collective and coherent attacks, and the concept of self-testing are also examined, as well as the entropy accumulation theorem, and additional mathematical methods in formulating advanced security proofs. In addition, the burgeoning field of semi-device-independent models (measurement DI--QKD, Receiver DI--QKD, and One--sided DI--QKD) is also analyzed. The practical aspects are discussed through a detailed overview of experimental progress and the open challenges toward the commercial deployment in the future of secure communications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09985v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Determining the peak photon emission time and rate for an ensemble of $N$ quantum systems undergoing collective superradiant decay typically requires tracking the time evolution of the density operator. Generally, the dimension of the density operator grows exponentially ($\sim \! 2^N$) with the number of emitters, in the absence of any symmetries such as in Dicke superradiance with full or partial permutational symmetry. We present a detailed study of the superradiant peak emission rate and time for initially fully excited quantum emitter ensembles, for one-, two- and three-dimensional arrays in free-space and emitter chains coupled to waveguide reservoirs. For few emitters ($N\lesssim 14$) we utilize the full quantum master equation, and for mesoscopic emitter numbers ($N\lesssim 400$) we use a second- and third-order cumulant expansion of the operator averages to track the time evolution of the system.</description>

      <title>Macroscopicity and observational deficit in states, operations, and correlations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12738v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To understand the emergence of macroscopic irreversibility from microscopic reversible dynamics, the idea of coarse-graining plays a fundamental role. In this work, we develop a unified inferential framework for macroscopic states, that is, coarse descriptions of microscopic quantum systems that can be inferred from macroscopic measurements. Building on quantum statistical sufficiency and Bayesian retrodiction, we characterize macroscopic states through equivalent abstract (algebraic) and explicit (constructive) formulations. Central to our approach is the notion of observational deficit, which quantifies the degree of irretrodictability of a state relative to a prior and a measurement. This leads to a general definition of macroscopic entropy as an inferentially grounded measure of asymmetry under Bayesian inversion. We formalize this structure in terms of inferential reference frames, defined by the pair consisting of a prior and a measurement, which encapsulate the observer's informational perspective. We then formulate a resource theory of microscopicity, treating macroscopic states as free states and introducing a hierarchy of macroscopicity-non-generating operations. This theory unifies and extends existing resource theories of coherence, athermality, and asymmetry. Finally, we apply the framework to study quantum correlations under observational constraints, introducing the notion of observational discord and deriving necessary and sufficient conditions for their vanishing in terms of information recoverability. This work is dedicated to Professor Ryszard Horodecki on the occasion of his 80th birthday, in deep admiration and gratitude for his pioneering contributions to quantum information theory.</description>

      <title>Bounds in Sequential Unambiguous Discrimination of Multiple Pure Quantum States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21704</link>

Abstract: Sequential methods for quantum hypothesis testing offer significant advantages over fixed-length approaches, which rely on a predefined number of state copies. Despite their potential, these methods remain underexplored for unambiguous discrimination. In this work, we derive performance bounds for such methods when applied to the discrimination of a set of pure states. The performance is evaluated based on the expected number of copies required. We establish a lower bound applicable to any sequential method and an upper bound on the optimal sequential method. The upper bound is derived using a novel and simple non-adaptive method. Importantly, the gap between these bounds is minimal, scaling logarithmically with the number of distinct states.</description>

      <title>Quantitative calibration of a TWPA applied to an optomechanical platform</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05837v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the last decade, the microwave quantum electronics toolbox has been enriched with quantum-limited detection devices such as Traveling Wave Parametric Amplifiers (TWPAs). The extreme sensitivity they provide is not only mandatory for some physics applications within quantum information processing, but is also the key element that will determine the detection limit of quantum sensing setups. In the framework of microwave optomechanical systems, an unprecedented range of small motions and forces is accessible, for which a specific quantitative calibration becomes necessary. We report on near quantum-limited measurements performed with an aluminum drumhead mechanical device within the temperature range 4 mK - 400 mK. The whole setup is carefully calibrated, especially taking into account the power-dependence of microwave absorption in the superconducting optomechanical cavity. This effect is commonly attributed to Two-Level-Systems (TLSs) present in the metal oxide. We demonstrate that a similar feature exists in the TWPA, and can be phenomenologically fit with adapted expressions. If not taken into account, the error on the signal strength can be as large as a factor of about 2, which is unacceptable for quantitative experiments. The power and temperature dependence is studied over the full parameter range, leading to an absolute definition of phonon population (i.e. Brownian motion amplitude), with an uncertainty +- 20 % limited by sources of noise internal to the optomechanical element.</description>

      <title>Scalable Quantum State Preparation via Large-Language-Model-Driven Discovery</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06347v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficient quantum state preparation remains a central challenge in first-principles quantum simulations of dynamics in quantum field theories, where the Hilbert space is intrinsically infinite-dimensional. Here, we introduce a large language model (LLM)-assisted framework for quantum-circuit design that systematically scales state-preparation circuits to large lattice volumes. Applied to a 1+1d XY spin chain, the LLM autonomously discovers a compact 4-parameter circuit that captures boundary-induced symmetry breaking with sub-percent energy deviation, enabling successful validation on the \texttt{Zuchongzhi} quantum processor. Guided by this insight, we extend the framework to 2+1d quantum field theories, where scalable variational ans\"atze have remained elusive. For a scalar field theory, the search yields a symmetry-preserving, 3-parameter shallow-depth ansatz whose optimized parameters converge to size-independent constants for lattices $n \ge 4$, providing, to our knowledge, the first scalable ansatz for this class of 2+1d models. Our results establish a practical route toward AI-assisted, human-guided discovery in quantum simulation.</description>

      <title>Thermalization in open many-body systems and KMS detailed balance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20064v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Starting from a microscopic description of weak system-bath interactions, we derive from first principles a quantum master equation that does not rely on the well-known rotating wave approximation. This includes generic many-body systems, with Hamiltonians with vanishingly small energy spacings that forbid that approximation. The equation satisfies a general form of detailed balance, called KMS, which ensures exact convergence to the many-body Gibbs state. Unlike the more common notion of GNS detailed balance, this notion is compatible with the absence of the rotating wave approximation. We show that the resulting Lindbladian dynamics not only reproduces the thermal equilibrium point up to a small renormalization of the system Hamiltonian, but it also approximates the true system evolution with an error that grows at most linearly in time, giving an exponential improvement upon previous estimates. This master equation has quasi-local jump operators, can be efficiently simulated on a quantum computer, and reduces to the usual Davies dynamics in the limit of a coarse-graining time much larger than the inverse of the smallest frequency difference. With it, we provide a rigorous model of many-body thermalization relevant to both open quantum systems and quantum algorithms.</description>

      <title>Detector noise in continuous-variable quantum key distribution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20441v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In continuous-variable (CV) QKD with optical coherent detection, the widely adopted \textit{trusted detector noise} model improves both the secret key rate and the transmission distance. This model assumes that detector noise is inherently random and inaccessible to an adversary. While substantial research has focused on shielding the detector, it is far more difficult to justify the adversary's ignorance of the detector noise. In this paper, we introduce a \textit{calibrated detector noise} model for CV-QKD, which relies solely on the isolation of the detector from the adversary's intervention. Specifically, our model applies even when detector noise is predictable to the adversary. We analyze the electrical noise of a commercial balanced photoreceiver and perform numerical simulations to compare different noise models. Our results show that when the detector noise variance is an order of magnitude below the vacuum noise, the proposed model achieves a secret key rate comparable to that of the trusted detector noise model, while eliminating the questionable assumption of ``truly random'' detector noise.</description>

      <title>Tunable Hybrid-Mode Coupler Enabling Strong Interactions between Transmons at Centimeter-Scale Distance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14128v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The transmon, a fabrication-friendly superconducting qubit, remains a leading candidate for scalable quantum computing. Recent advances in tunable couplers have accelerated progress toward high-performance quantum processors. However, extending coherent interactions beyond millimeter scales to enhance quantum connectivity presents a critical challenge. Here, we introduce a hybrid-mode coupler exploiting resonator-transmon hybridization to simultaneously engineer the two lowest-frequency mode, enabling high-contrast coupling between centimeter-scale transmons. For a 1-cm coupler, our framework predicts flux-tunable $XX$ and $ZZ$ coupling strengths reaching 23 MHz and 100 MHz, with modulation contrasts exceeding $10^2$ and $10^4$, respectively, demonstrating quantitative agreement with an effective two-channel model. This work provides an efficient pathway to mitigate the inherent connectivity constraints imposed by short-range interactions, enabling transmon-based architectures compatible with hardware-efficient quantum tasks.</description>

      <title>Clifford augmented density matrix renormalization group for \textit{ab initio} quantum chemistry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16026v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recently proposed Clifford augmented density matrix renormalization group (CA-DMRG) method seamlessly integrates Clifford circuits with matrix product states, and takes advantage of the expression power from both. CA-DMRG has been shown to be able to achieve higher accuracy than standard DMRG on commonly used lattice models, with only moderate computational overhead compared to the latter. In this work, we propose an efficient scheme in CA-DMRG to deal with \textit{ab initio} quantum chemistry Hamiltonians, and apply it to study several molecular systems. Our numerical results show that CA-DMRG can reach higher accuracy than DMRG using the same bond dimension, pointing out a promising route to push the boundary of solving \textit{ab initio} quantum chemistry with strong static correlations.</description>

      <title>Pulsed laser attack at 1061 nm potentially compromises quantum key distribution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19091v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum key distribution systems offer cryptographic security, provided that all their components are thoroughly characterised. However, certain components might be vulnerable to a laser-damage attack, particularly when attacked at previously untested laser parameters. Here, we show that exposing 1550-nm fiber-optic isolators to 1061-nm sub-nanosecond pulsed illumination with 1.16 W average power permanently degrades their isolation at 1550 nm, while their forward transparency is less affected. One experimental sample was exposed to 17-mW average power picosecond attacking pulses that temporarily reduced its isolation below the specified guaranteed minimum value. This indicates a potential security threat in these attacking laser regimes that need to be addressed by improving security analysis for various light-injection attacks.</description>

      <title>Efficient Berry Phase Calculation via Adaptive Variational Quantum Computing Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19150v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an adaptive variational quantum algorithm to estimate the Berry phase accumulated by a nondegenerate ground state under cyclic, adiabatic evolution of a time-dependent Hamiltonian. Our method leverages cyclic adiabatic evolution of the Hamiltonian and employs adaptive variational quantum algorithms for state preparation and evolution, optimizing circuit efficiency while maintaining high accuracy. We benchmark our approach on dimerized Fermi-Hubbard chains with four sites, demonstrating precise Berry phase simulations in both noninteracting and interacting regimes. Our results show that circuit depths reach up to 106 layers for noninteracting systems and increase to 279 layers for interacting systems due to added complexity. Additionally, we demonstrate the robustness of our scheme across a wide range of parameters governing adiabatic evolution and variational algorithm. These findings highlight the potential of adaptive variational quantum algorithms for advancing quantum simulations of topological materials and computing geometric phases in strongly correlated systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21363v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a theoretical framework for a quantized memristive Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neuron, uniting principles from neuromorphic engineering and open quantum systems. Starting from a classical memristive LIF circuit, we apply canonical quantization techniques to derive a quantum model grounded in circuit quantum electrodynamics. Numerical simulations demonstrate key dynamical features of the quantized memristor and LIF neuron in the weak-coupling and adiabatic regime, including memory effects and spiking behavior. Applications of this model to a sound localization benchmark show that it outperforms a phenomenological quantum LIF model as well as a classical LIF. This work establishes a foundational model for quantum neuromorphic computing, offering a pathway towards biologically inspired quantum spiking neural networks and new paradigms in quantum machine learning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02369v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While the exact separability probability of 8/33 for two-qubit states under the Hilbert-Schmidt measure has been reported by Huong and Khoi [\href{https://doi.org/10.1088/1751-8121/ad8493}{J.Phys.A:Math.Theor.{\bf57}, 445304(2024)}], detailed derivations remain inaccessible for general audiences. This paper provides a comprehensive, self-contained derivation of this result, elucidating the underlying geometric and probabilistic structures. We achieve this by developing a framework centered on the computation of Hilbert-Schmidt volumes for key components: the quantum state space, relevant flag manifolds, and regular (co)adjoint orbits. Crucially, we establish and leverage the connection between these Hilbert-Schmidt volumes and the symplectic volumes of the corresponding regular co-adjoint orbits, formalized through the Duistermaat-Heckman measure. By meticulously synthesizing these volume computations -- specifically, the ratios defining the relevant probability measures -- we reconstruct and rigorously verify the 8/33 separability probability. Our approach offers a transparent pathway to this fundamental constant, detailing the interplay between symplectic geometry, representation theory, and quantum probability.</description>

      <title>Surrogate Quantum Circuit Design for the Lattice Boltzmann Collision Operator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12256v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study introduces a framework for learning a low-depth surrogate quantum circuit (SQC) that approximates the nonlinear, dissipative, and hence non-unitary Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK) collision operator in the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) for the D2Q9 lattice. By appropriately selecting the quantum state encoding, circuit architecture, and measurement protocol, non-unitary dynamics emerge naturally within the physical population space. This approach removes the need for probabilistic algorithms relying on any ancilla qubits and post-selection to reproduce dissipation, or for multiple state copies to capture nonlinearity. The SQC is designed to preserve key physical properties of the BGK operator, including mass conservation, scale equivariance, and D8 equivariance, while momentum conservation is encouraged through penalization in the training loss. When compiled to the IBM Heron quantum processor's native gate set, assuming all-to-all qubit connectivity, the circuit requires only 724 native gates and operates locally on the velocity register, making it independent of the lattice size. The learned SQC is validated on two benchmark cases, the Taylor-Green vortex decay and the lid-driven cavity, showing accurate reproduction of vortex decay and flow recirculation. While integration of the SQC into a quantum LBM framework presently requires measurement and re-initialization at each timestep, the necessary steps towards a measurement-free formulation are outlined.</description>

      <title>Resources for bosonic metrology: quantum-enhanced precision from a superselection rule perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13245v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bosonic systems, particularly in quantum optics and atomic physics, are leading platforms for achieving quantum enhanced precision in parameter estimation. By exploiting properties such as mode and particle entanglement, it is possible to attain precisions that surpass the shot noise limit with respect to key resources like probe number or energy. Yet the mechanisms by which these bosonic resources enable quantum enhancement remain unclear. Consequently, the design of optimal probes and evolutions often relies on case by case analyses, where continuous and discrete variable regimes are treated separately and their connection is still unclear. We develop a comprehensive framework for quantum metrology that unifies all known precision enhancement mechanisms based on bosonic systems. Our approach employs a superselection rule compliant representation of the electromagnetic field that explicitly includes the phase reference, thereby enforcing total particle number conservation and bridging the discrete and continuous limits of quantum optics and symmetric massive systems. Within this unified formalism, of which established results emerge as special cases, we identify the distinct roles of mode and particle entanglement for quantum enhanced precision. The framework further provides general measurement optimization strategies for arbitrary multimode entangled probe states and naturally incorporates noise and non-unitary dynamics, ensuring applicability to realistic experimental conditions.</description>

Abstract: We present a theoretical study of synchronization between two strongly driven magnon modes indirectly coupled via a single-mode microwave cavity. Each magnon mode, hosted in separate Yttrium Iron Garnet spheres, interacts coherently with the cavity field, leading to cavity-mediated nonlinear coupling. We show, by using input-output formalism, that both classical and quantum synchronization emerge for appropriate choices of coupling, detuning, and driving. We find that thermal noise reduces quantum synchronization, highlighting the importance of low-temperature conditions. This study provides useful insights into tunable magnonic interactions in cavity systems, with possible applications in quantum information processing and hybrid quantum technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23650v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The existence of electromagnetic radiation - radio-waves, microwaves, light, x-rays and so on - is one of the most important physical phenomena, and our ability to manipulate them is one of the most significant technological achievement of humankind. Underlying this ability is our understanding of how radiation is produced: whenever an electric charge is accelerated, it radiates. Or, at least, this is how it has been hitherto universally thought. Here we prove that quantum mechanically electric charges can be accelerated without radiating. The physical setup leading to this behavior is relatively simple (once one knows what to do) but its reasons are deep: it relies on the fact that quantum mechanically particles can be accelerated even when no forces act on them, via the Aharonov-Bohm effect. As we argue, the effect presented here is just them tip of an iceberg - it implies the need to reconsider the basic understanding of radiation. Finally, it seems clear that the effect goes far beyond electromagnetism and applies to any kind of radiation.</description>

Abstract: Non-Gaussian states are essential for achieving a quantum advantage in continuous-variable (CV) information processing. Among these, coherent superpositions of squeezed states are a foundational resource. While exact higher-order statistics are available in the undisplaced case, a complete and analytically tractable treatment with a common displacement has been missing. We introduce and solve the displaced Janus state-a coherent superposition of two squeezed coherent states that share the same displacement-and develop an analytical framework, based on a family of Generalized Squeezing Polynomials, that yields closed-form expressions for arbitrary-order factorial moments and coherence functions \(g^{(k)}(0)\), the full Wigner function, and the quantum Fisher information. The analysis shows how interference at a fixed mean, driven by a mismatch of the component covariances rather than by mean separation, can be precisely engineered to transform the extreme photon bunching of the constituents into strong sub-Poissonian and even perfect multiphoton suppression. We further provide a rigorous quantum Fisher information analysis, proving that parameters encoded by linear generators (for example, the number operator) are bounded by the standard quantum limit, whereas parameters encoded by quadratic generators (for example, squeezing transformations) achieve Heisenberg-limited scaling. Together, these results furnish a complete analytical toolkit for a versatile class of non-Gaussian states, establishing the displaced Janus state as a key primitive for hybrid quantum protocols, quantum metrology, and fault-tolerant continuous-variable computation.</description>

      <title>SimQFL: A Quantum Federated Learning Simulator with Real-Time Visualization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12477v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum federated learning (QFL) is an emerging field that has the potential to revolutionize computation by taking advantage of quantum physics concepts in a distributed machine learning (ML) environment. However, the majority of available quantum simulators are primarily built for general quantum circuit simulation and do not include integrated support for machine learning tasks such as training, evaluation, and iterative optimization. Furthermore, designing and assessing quantum learning algorithms is still a difficult and resource-intensive task. Real-time updates are essential for observing model convergence, debugging quantum circuits, and making conscious choices during training with the use of limited resources. Furthermore, most current simulators fail to support the integration of user-specific data for training purposes, undermining the main purpose of using a simulator. In this study, we introduce SimQFL, a customized simulator that simplifies and accelerates QFL experiments in quantum network applications. SimQFL supports real-time, epoch-wise output development and visualization, allowing researchers to monitor the process of learning across each training round. Furthermore, SimQFL offers an intuitive and visually appealing interface that facilitates ease of use and seamless execution. Users can customize key variables such as the number of epochs, learning rates, number of clients, and quantum hyperparameters such as qubits and quantum layers, making the simulator suitable for various QFL applications. The system gives immediate feedback following each epoch by showing intermediate outcomes and dynamically illustrating learning curves. SimQFL is a practical and interactive platform enabling academics and developers to prototype, analyze, and tune quantum neural networks with greater transparency and control in distributed quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Bistability of optical properties of cesium vapor due to collective interaction of alignment and orientation under strong spin exchange conditions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.10119v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hydrogen-like alkali atoms with a single valence electron are the most common objects in quantum optics and, at the same time, serve as essential tools of the field. Under conditions of optical pumping, strong spin-exchange and ultra-weak magnetic field (spin-exchange relaxation free mode, SERF), ensembles of such atoms in the gas phase can demonstrate not only the absence of spin-exchange relaxation, but also nonlinear collective effects. We present experimental evidence that the alignment, i.e. the quadrupole momentum, can not only be preserved under SERF conditions, but also coexist and interact with the orientation, i.e. the dipole momentum. We also show that this interaction leads to bistability: a small change in conditions can cause the medium to transition to a different steady state, an effect characterized by hysteresis. The combination of properties of this effect opens up a wide range of applications as optical keys or memory elements with a storage time of hundreds of seconds in tasks of quantum information and cryptography.</description>

      <title>What can we do in a symmetry-constrained perspective? The importance of the total charge's status in quantum reference frame frameworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13607v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of quantum reference frames has received renewed interest over the last years, leading to the parallel development of non-equivalent frameworks by different communities. We clarify the differences between these frameworks. At the mathematical level, they mainly differ in the kind of symmetry (either weak or strong) employed to constrain the system. We show that this mathematical difference corresponds to a fundamental physical question: whether the global charge associated to the symmetry group is accessible to symmetry-constrained observers. In this context, we formulate a definition of a perspective in terms of operational capacities, or lack thereof. Turning to consequences of adopting either approach, we discuss how adopting the weak approach induces an ambiguity in the momenta included in each perspective and bars from defining reversible QRF transformations. We then review and analyze the existing arguments motivating each approach, and show how they bear upon the problem of charge accessibility. Finally, we introduce a simple operational scenario in which upholding two reasonable physical postulates leads to the conclusion that internal observers could measure the global charge by 1/ performing a relativized interference measurement and 2/ classically communicating.</description>

      <title>Entanglement in the energy-constrained prepare-and-measure scenario: applications to randomness certification and channel discrimination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27559v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum information tasks are often analyzed under varying trust assumptions about the devices involved. The semi-device-independent (SDI) framework offers a balance between needed assumptions and experimental feasibility. In this work, we study the energy-constrained SDI scenario, where the only assumption in a prepare-and-measure setup is an upper bound on the energy of the prepared quantum states. In contrast to previous studies that restricted the preparation and measurement devices to be classically correlated, we show that allowing entanglement strictly enlarges the set of achievable correlations. We identify two operational consequences of this result. The first concerns randomness certification, where we show that allowing the adversary to employ entangled strategies may significantly reduce the amount of certifiable randomness. This includes situations where the amount of randomness drops to zero in the presence of entanglement, while it remains positive when entanglement is excluded. Second, for the task of distinguishing an arbitrary quantum channel from the identity, we show that the known dimension-independent bound on the advantage conferred by entanglement is violated under an energy constraint.</description>

      <title>Spatial Incompatibility Witnesses for Quantum Temporal Correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01179v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a witness-based framework for certifying quantum temporal correlations via the pseudo-density matrix (PDM) formalism, which is a spatiotemporal generalization of the density matrix. We define spatial incompatibility (SI) as the minimum distance between a PDM and valid density matrices. For trace-norm distance, we show that this reduces to the PDM's negativity, enabling the construction of experimentally accessible SI witnesses. We derive a tight bound on SI for quantum channels and analyze the respective roles of state and channel coherence in witnessing SI. Our approach, unlike the LG framework, exploits measurements that generate coherence through state disturbance. We further show that channels satisfying the LG inequality for incoherent states can still exhibit detectable SI, demonstrating that measurement disturbance enhances the certification of temporal correlations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01467v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study quantum differential privacy (QDP) by defining a notion of the order of informativeness between two pairs of quantum states. In particular, we show that if the hypothesis testing divergence of the one pair dominates over that of the other pair, then this dominance holds for every $f$-divergence. This approach completely characterizes $(\varepsilon,\delta)$-QDP mechanisms by identifying the most informative $(\varepsilon,\delta)$-DP quantum state pairs. We apply this to analyze the stability of quantum differentially private learning algorithms, generalizing classical results to the case $\delta&gt;0$. Additionally, we study precise limits for privatized hypothesis testing and privatized quantum parameter estimation, including tight upper-bounds on the quantum Fisher information under QDP. Finally, we establish near-optimal contraction bounds for differentially private quantum channels with respect to the hockey-stick divergence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.05827v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ability to preserve multipartite entanglement in noisy environments is central to advancing quantum information processing. In this work, we develop a semiclassical theoretical model of three entangled qubits exposed to local Markov noise environments with tunable statistical correlations between noise sources. We show that such correlations can significantly influence the dynamics of multipartite entanglement, in some cases slowing its decay and, under ideal conditions, even enabling full preservation. Using tripartite negativity as an entanglement measure, we derive analytical results for the GHZ and W states, demonstrating their contrasting responses to correlated and anticorrelated noise. Our analysis identifies regimes in which multipartite entanglement can be sustained despite environmental interactions, offering new insight into how noise correlations may serve as a resource for protecting quantum coherence in multi-qubit systems.</description>

Abstract: This perspective outlines promising pathways and critical obstacles on the road to developing useful quantum computing applications, drawing on insights from the Google Quantum AI team. We propose a five-stage framework for this process, spanning from theoretical explorations of quantum advantage to the practicalities of compilation and resource estimation. For each stage, we discuss key trends, milestones, and inherent scientific and sociological impediments. We argue that two central stages -- identifying concrete problem instances expected to exhibit quantum advantage, and connecting such problems to real-world use cases -- represent essential and currently under-resourced challenges. Throughout, we touch upon related topics, including the promise of generative artificial intelligence for aspects of this research, criteria for compelling demonstrations of quantum advantage, and the future of compilation as we enter the era of early fault-tolerant quantum computing.</description>

Abstract: Binary Reed-Muller (RM) codes are defined via evaluations of Boolean-valued functions on $\mathbb{Z}_2^m$. We introduce a class of binary linear codes that generalizes the RM family by replacing the domain $\mathbb{Z}_2^m$ with an arbitrary finite Coxeter group. Like RM codes, this class is closed under duality, forms a nested code sequence, satisfies a multiplication property, and has asymptotic rate determined by a Gaussian distribution. Coxeter codes also give rise to a family of quantum codes for which transversal diagonal $Z$ rotations can perform non-trivial logic.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18396v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study many-body quantum geometric effects in time-dependent system with emergent quantum integrable field theory instantaneously. We establish a theorem stating that the Berry connection matrix thus all associated geometric quantities of the system can be precisely characterized by excitations up to two particles from the initial quantum integrable system. To illustrate the many-body geometric influence, we analyze an Ising chain subjected to both a small longitudinal field and a slowly rotating transverse field, whose low-energy physics in the scaling limit is instantaneously governed by the quantum $E_8$ integrable field theory. Focusing on the quantum geometric potential (QGP), we show the QGP continuously suppresses the instantaneous energy gaps with decreasing longitudinal field, thereby enhancing many-body Landau-Zener tunneling as evidenced by the Loschmidt echo and its associated spectral entropy. The critical threshold for the longitudinal field strength is determined,where the spectral entropy linearly increases with system size and exhibits hyperscaling behavior when approaching to the threshold. As the longitudinal field passes the threshold and decreases toward zero, the QGP continuously leads to vanishing instantaneous energy gaps involving more low-energy excitations, resulting in increasing spectral entropy indicative of many-body Landau-Zener tunneling. Our results unveil telltale quantum geometric signatures in time-dependent many-body systems, elucidating the intricate interplay between quantum geometry and dynamics.</description>

Abstract: SNSPDs are indispensable for applications ranging from quantum information processing to deep-space optical communications, owing to their high detection efficiency, low dark counts, and excellent timing resolution. However, further improving the intrinsic detection efficiency (IDE) remains crucial for optimizing SNSPD performance. Ion irradiation has recently emerged as a powerful post-fabrication method to enhance SNSPD characteristics. Here, we studied the effects of He-ion irradiation on the thermal properties of NbN SNSPDs. We systematically examine the evolution of thermal boundary conductance as a function of ion fluence (0-1.1E17 ions/cm2), observing a 57% decrease from 127 to 54 W/m^2K^4 with increasing fluence, followed by saturation at approximately 9E16 ions/cm2. At this fluence, the minimum hotspot relaxation time measurements indicate a 41% increase, rising from 17 to 24 ps,while the electron-phonon interaction time decreases, with the magnitude of change depending on temperature and sample batch.TEM reveals defect formation at the NbN/SiO2 interface (6-8 nm) and He-bubble formation within the SiO2 layer (30-260 nm), contributing to the extended thermal relaxation time. These irradiation-induced modifications play a key role in enhancing the IDE of the treated devices. We further demonstrate a post-irradiation SNSPD showing a saturated IDE plateau at 2000 nm from 2.7 K to 28 mK, enabled by thermal modifications and a weakly wavelength-dependent avalanche-assisted mechanism. Our findings highlight ion irradiation as a valuable tool for thermal tailoring in SNSPDs and advance the understanding of detection physics and defect engineering in superconducting optoelectronics.</description>

      <title>How gravitational waves change photon orbital angular momentum quantum states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16452v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the evolution of vortex light in the presence of gravitational waves (GWs) and demonstrate that the quantized orbital angular momentum (OAM) states can make transitions to other states due to the GWs. The interaction is calculated based on the framework of the wave propagation in linearized gravity theory and canonical quantization of the light field in curved spacetime. It is found that when a photon possessing OAM of $l$ interacts with GWs, the OAM modes of $l\pm1$ and $l\pm2$ may be excited with probabilities of $P_{l\pm1}\sim 10^{-17}$ and $P_{l\pm2}\sim 10^{-20}$, respectively. Higher probabilities of the transitions can be achieved when the photon radial wave vector or the propagation distance is increased, or when the photons encounter GWs with stronger amplitudes or smaller frequencies. Thus, a new GW detection technique is proposed, which may exhibit good performance in a wide range of GW frequencies. Furthermore, the detector is insensitive to seismic noise and is more advantageous for determining the distance of the source compared to current interferometer detectors.</description>

Abstract: Chirality describes the asymmetry between an object and its mirror image and manifests itself in diverse functionalities across all scales of matter - from molecules and aggregates to thin films and bulk chiral materials. A particularly intriguing example is chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS), where chiral structures orient electron spins enantio-sensitively. Despite extensive research, the fundamental origin of spin-chirality coupling, the unexpectedly large magnitude of the CISS effect, and the possible role of electromagnetic fields in it remain unclear. Here, we address these issues by examining the simplest scenario: spin-resolved photoionization of randomly oriented chiral molecules. We uncover a universal mechanism of spin-selective chiral photodynamics, arising solely from electric-dipole interactions and previously unrecognized. This mechanism embodies a chiral molecular compass - a photoinduced magnetization vector that orients the photoelectron spin. It arises in photoexcited chiral molecules even under isotropic illumination, operates even in isotropic chiral media, and enables a phenomenon central to CISS: locking of the photoelectron spin orientation to molecular geometry. It shows that chiral molecules can sustain time-odd correlations whereas achiral molecules cannot. Our findings have broad implications, from unambiguously identifying the origin of CISS effect in photoionization to harvesting correlations underlying this effect in other forms of CISS in various chiral materials.</description>

Abstract: Value decomposition has long been a fundamental technique in multi-agent dynamic programming and reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, the value function of a global state $(s_1,s_2,\ldots,s_N)$ is often approximated as the sum of local functions: $V(s_1,s_2,\ldots,s_N)\approx\sum_{i=1}^N V_i(s_i)$. This approach traces back to the index policy in restless multi-armed bandit problems and has found various applications in modern RL systems. However, the theoretical justification for why this decomposition works so effectively remains underexplored.
  In this paper, we uncover the underlying mathematical structure that enables value decomposition. We demonstrate that a multi-agent Markov decision process (MDP) permits value decomposition if and only if its transition matrix is not "entangled" -- a concept analogous to quantum entanglement in quantum physics. Drawing inspiration from how physicists measure quantum entanglement, we introduce how to measure the "Markov entanglement" for multi-agent MDPs and show that this measure can be used to bound the decomposition error in general multi-agent MDPs.
  Using the concept of Markov entanglement, we proved that a widely-used class of index policies is weakly entangled and enjoys a sublinear $\mathcal O(\sqrt{N})$ scale of decomposition error for $N$-agent systems. Finally, we show how Markov entanglement can be efficiently estimated in practice, providing practitioners with an empirical proxy for the quality of value decomposition.</description>

      <title>On the fate of spacetime singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12314v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I investigate spacetime singularities from the point of view of the wavefunction of the universe. In order to extend the classical notion of geodesic incompleteness one has to include the proper time of an observer as a degree of freedom in the Wheeler DeWitt equation. This leads to a Schr\"odinger equation along the observer worldline. Near the singularity, as in the classical BLK treatment, I ignore spatial gradients and effectively describe the spacetime around the worldline in the mini-superspace approximation. Then the problem proves identical to a spherically symmetric scattering of a quantum particle off a central potential and singularity avoidance is tantamount to unitary evolution for this system. Standard types of matter (dust, radiation) correspond to regular potentials and thus lead to a bounce. The most singular component, spatial anisotropy, is associated to a conserved charge and yields a negative inverse-square potential -- like standard angular momentum, but with opposite sign. This potential is critical, in that the unitarity of the evolution depends on the actual numerical factor in front of it, i.e., on the anisotropy charge.</description>

      <title>Temperature and conditions for thermalization after canonical quenches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12696v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider quenches of a quantum system that is prepared in a canonical equilibrium state of one Hamiltonian and then evolves unitarily in time under a different Hamiltonian. Technically, our main result is a systematic expansion of the pre- and post-quench canonical ensembles in the quench strength. We first demonstrate how this can be used to predict the system's temperature after the quench from equilibrium properties at the pre-quench temperature. For a thermalizing post-quench system, it furthermore allows us to calculate equilibrium observable expectation values. Finally, in the presence of additional conserved quantities besides the Hamiltonian, we obtain a hierarchy of necessary conditions for thermalization towards the (post-quench) canonical ensemble. At first order, these thermalization conditions have a nice geometric interpretation in operator space with the canonical covariance as a semi-inner product: The quench operator (difference between post- and pre-quench Hamiltonians) and the conserved quantity must be orthogonal in the orthogonal complement of the post-quench Hamiltonian. We illustrate the results numerically for a variety of setups involving integrable and nonintegrable models.</description>

      <title>Hybrid light-matter boundaries of graphene in a chiral cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13373v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in chiral cavities that can couple coherently to two-dimensional materials have opened a powerful route to reshape electronic topology without an external drive. Here we establish the bulk-boundary correspondence for graphene embedded in a circularly polarized cavity. By combining exact diagonalization (ED) of zigzag ribbons, a semi-analytic T-matrix for half-infinite lattices, and analytical insights from a Dirac-Jaynes-Cummings model, we show that (i) every light-matter interaction-induced gap hosts pairs of unidirectional light-matter edge currents depending on the Chern number of the band while some of them are even bright; (ii) these chiral states persist throughout the entire photon ladder; and (iii) their dispersion, localization length and photon distribution exhibit a universal scaling controlled by the light-matter interaction. Time-evolution simulations further demonstrate that a dark electronic edge excitation can be converted into a bright and unidirectionally propagating current that remains coherent over long time scales. Our results predict an experimental signature of the hybrid band topology and a blueprint for tunable chiral channels in next generation quantum optical solid-state devices.</description>

      <title>Tensor gravity gradiometry with a single-axis atom gradiometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22350v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a method for using a single-axis atom interferometric gravity gradiometer to measure off-diagonal elements of the gravity gradient tensor. By tilting the gradiometer, the measured gradient becomes a linear combination of different components of the gravity gradient tensor, and through multiple measurements at different tilts the separate tensor components can be inferred. We present a theoretical and numerical investigation of this technique, both for terrestrial surveys where the tilt is statically set by the user and for surveys where a strapdown sensor is dynamically tilted by the motion of the platform. We show that the gradiometer's sensitivity to the vertical gravity gradient is only slightly reduced by this method while allowing for more gradiometer information to be obtained. Major sources of error and loss of sensitivity on dynamic platforms are shown to be mitigated using an optical-gimbal technique employing commercially-available fibre-optic gyroscopes and tip-tilt mirrors.</description>

      <title>From Heisenberg and Schr\"odinger to the P vs. NP Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07502v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This essay offers an epistemological reinterpretation of the foundational divide between matrix mechanics and wave mechanics. Though formally equivalent, the two theories embody distinct modes of knowing: procedural construction and recognitional verification. These epistemic architectures anticipate, in philosophical form, the logical asymmetry expressed by the P versus NP problem in computational complexity. Here, the contrast between efficient generation and efficient recognition is treated not as a mathematical taxonomy but as a framework for understanding how knowledge is produced and validated across physics, computation, and cognition. The essay reconstructs the mathematical history of quantum mechanics through the original derivations of Werner Heisenberg, Max Born, Pascual Jordan, Paul Dirac, Erwin Schr\"odinger, Paul Ehrenfest, and Wolfgang Pauli, culminating in John von Neumann's unification of both approaches within the formalism of Hilbert space. By juxtaposing Heisenberg's algorithmic formalism with Schr\"odinger's representational one, it argues that their divergence reveals a structural feature of scientific reasoning itself-the enduring tension between what can be procedurally constructed and what can only be recognized.</description>
