      <title>Persistent breather and dynamical symmetry in a unitary Fermi gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: SO(2,1) dynamical symmetry makes a remarkable prediction that the breathing oscillation of a scale invariant quantum gas in an isotropic harmonic trap is isentropic and can persist indefinitely. In 2D, this symmetry is broken due to quantum anomaly in the strongly interacting range, and consequently the lifetime of the breathing mode becomes finite. The persistent breather in a strongly interacting system has so far not been realized. Here we experimentally achieve the long-lived breathing mode in a 3D unitary Fermi gas, which is protected by the SO(2,1) symmetry. The nearly perfect SO(2,1) symmetry is realized by loading the ultracold Fermi gas in an isotropic trap and tuning the interatomic interaction to resonance. The breathing mode oscillates at twice the trapping frequency even for large excitation amplitudes. The ratio of damping rate to oscillation frequency is as small as 0.002, providing an interacting persistent breather. The oscillation frequency and damping rate keep nearly constant for different atomic densities and temperatures, demonstrating the robustness of the SO(2,1) symmetry in 3D. The factors that lead to the residual damping have also been clarified. This work opens the way to study many-body non-equilibrium dynamics related to the dynamical symmetry.</description>

      <title>Atoms in Dense Plasmas: Models, Applications, and Current Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modeling plasmas in terms of atoms or ions is theoretically appealing for several reasons. When it is relevant, the notion of atom or ion in a plasma provides us with an interpretation scheme of the plasma's microscopic structure. From the standpoint of quantitative estimation of plasma properties, atomic models of plasma allow extending many theoretical tools of atomic physics to plasmas. This notably includes the statistical approaches to the detailed accounting for excited states, or the collisional-radiative modeling of non-equilibrium plasmas, which is based on the notion of atomic processes.
  This habilitation thesis is mostly focused on the studies to which the author has contributed in the field of atomic modeling of dense, non-ideal plasmas. The studies to which the author contributed in the field of collisional-radiative modeling of non-LTE plasmas are also addressed, and the prospect of bridging with dense-plasma models is sketched.</description>

      <title>Frequency redistribution and step-size distribution of light scattered by atomic vapor: applications to L\'evy flight random walk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The propagation of light that undergoes multiple-scattering by resonant atomic vapor can be described as a L\'evy flight. L\'evy flight is a random walk with heavy tailed step-size (r) distribution, decaying asymptotically as $P(r)\sim r^{-1-\alpha}$, with $\alpha&lt;2$. The large steps, typical of L\'evy flights, have its origins in frequency redistribution of the light scattered by the vapor. We calculate the frequency redistribution function and the step-size distribution for light diffusion in atomic vapor. From the step-size distribution we extract a L\'evy parameter $\alpha$ that depends on the step's size. We investigate how the frequency redistribution function and step-size distribution are influenced by the finite size of the vapor and the many-level structure typical for alkali vapors. Finite size of the vapor introduces cutoff on the light scattered spectrum and thus in the size of steps. Multi-level structure introduces oscillations in $P(r)$ slope. Both effects might have an impact on measurables related to the L\'evy flight random walk.</description>

      <title>Generation of vortex electrons by atomic photoionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15030v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the process of orbital angular momentum (OAM) transfer from a twisted light beam to an electron in atomic ionization within the first Born approximation. The characteristics of the ejected electron are studied regardless of the detection scheme. We find that the outgoing electron possesses a definite projection of OAM when a single atom is located on the propagation axis of the photon, whereas the size of the electron wave packet is determined solely by the energy of the photon rather than by its transverse coherence length. Shifting the position of the atom yields a finite dispersion of the electron OAM. We also study a more experimentally feasible scenario - a localized finite-sized atomic target - and develop representative approaches to describing coherent and incoherent regimes of photoionization.</description>

      <title>Cooling of gold cluster anions, Au$_N^-$, $N=2-13,15$, in a cryogenic ion-beam storage ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09758v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have measured the spontaneous and photo-induced decays of anionic gold clusters, Au$_N^-$, with sizes ranging from $N = 2$ to 13, and 15. After production in a sputter ion source, the size-selected clusters were stored in the cryogenic electrostatic ion-beam storage ring DESIREE and their neutralization decays were measured for storage times between 0.1 and 100 s. The dimer was observed to decay by electron emission in parallel to neutral atom emission at long times, analogously to the behavior of copper and silver dimers, implying a breakdown of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. Radiative cooling is observed for all cluster sizes except for the dimer. The decay rates of clusters $N=3,6,8-13,15$ show only a single radiative cooling time. For $N=6-13$ the cooling times have a strong odd-even oscillation with an amplitude that decrease with cluster size, and with the even $N$ having the fast cooling. We compare our results with previous measurements of radiative cooling rates of the corresponding cationic gold clusters, Au$_N^+$, which also show an odd-even effect with a similar oscillation amplitude but at orders of magnitude shorter time scales, and out of phase with the anions.</description>

      <title>Interplay between external driving, dissipation and collective effects in the Markovian and non-Markovian regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03297v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the combined influence of external driving and dissipation is crucial for studying nonequilibrium quantum phenomena and advancing technological applications. The present study addresses this issue by investigating open-system behavior in driven optical systems coupled to a bosonic field. Starting from an exact non-Markovian master equation for linear systems, we extend the analysis to an ensemble of quantum emitters and validate the proposed solution. The analytical results unveil a range of intriguing phenomena, including pronounced non-Markovian corrections to the coherent driving and a collective cross-driving effect. These effects are experimentally accessible in platforms such as cavity QED, photonic crystals, and state-dependent optical lattices. In the Markovian limit, comparisons with exact solutions reveal short-time non-Markovian effects that endure well beyond the environmental correlation decay time, alongside memory effects triggered by short laser pulses. These findings offer valuable insights into the dynamics of driven open systems, laying the groundwork for precise quantum state control.</description>
