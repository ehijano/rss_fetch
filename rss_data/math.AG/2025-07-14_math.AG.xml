      <title>Degree-one foliations on complete intersections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that, under mild restrictions, the space of codimension-one foliations of degree one on a smooth projective complete intersection has two irreducible components of logarithmic type. We also prove that the same conclusion holds for any smooth hypersurface of dimension at least three that is not a quadric threefold. The proof of these results follows essentially from a more general structure theorem for foliations on manifolds covered by lines.</description>

      <title>Counting sums of two powers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize two well-known enumerative facts. The first, due to Clebsch, says that a general binary sextic form is expressible as the sum of a cube and a square in 40 different ways. The second, due to Zariski and later Vakil, states that a general pencil of binary 12-ics contains exactly 3762 cubes plus squares, ignoring scaling.</description>

      <title>A prismatic-etale comparison theorem in the semistable case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $K|\mathbb{Q}_p$ be a complete discrete valuation field with perfect residue field, $O_K$ be its ring of integers. Consider a semistable $p$-adic formal scheme $X$ over $\mathrm{Spf}(O_K)$ with smooth generic fiber $X_{\eta}$. Du--Liu--Moon--Shimizu showed recently that the category of analytic prismatic $F$-crystals on the absolute log prismatic site of $X$ is equivalent to the category of semistable \'etale $\mathbb{Z}_p$-local systems on the adic generic fiber $X_{\eta}$. In this article, we prove a comparison between the Breuil--Kisin cohomology of an analytic log prismatic $F$-crystal on $X$ and the \'etale cohomology of its corresponding \'etale $\mathbb{Z}_p$-local system. This generalizes Guo--Reneicke's prismatic--\'etale comparison for crystalline $\mathbb{Z}_p$-local systems to the semi-stable case</description>

      <title>The Miyaoka-Yau inequality for singular varieties with big canonical or anticanonical divisors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the Miyaoka-Yau inequality for $n$-dimensional projective klt varieties with big canonical divisor $K_X$: \[ (2(n+1)\widehat{c}_2(X) - n \widehat{c}_1(X)^2) \cdot \langle c_1(K_X)^{n-2} \rangle \ge 0. \] We also prove the Miyaoka-Yau inequality for K-semistable projective klt varieties with big anticanonical divisor $-K_X$. As part of our approach, we define the non-pluripolar product $\langle \alpha_1 \cdots \alpha_p \rangle$ on singular varieties, and establish the Bogomolov-Gieseker type inequality for $\langle \alpha^{n-1} \rangle$-semistable Higgs sheaves with respect to a big class $\alpha$. In addition, we investigate second Chern class inequalities in the cases where $K_X$ or $-K_X$ is nef.</description>

      <title>Categorical K\"unneth formulas for analytic stacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In arXiv:0805.0157v5, the authors define a class of derived stacks, called "perfect stacks" and show that for this class the categories of quasi-coherent sheaves satisfy a categorical K\"unneth formula. Motivated to extend their results to the theory of analytic stacks as developed by Clausen-Scholze, we investigate categorical K\"unneth formulas for general $6$-functor formalisms. As applications we show a general Tannakian reconstruction result for analytic stacks and, following recent work of Ansch\"utz, Le Bras and Mann arXiv:2412.20968v1, show a $p$-adic version of Drinfeld's lemma for certain stacks that appear conjecturally in a categorical $p$-adic Langlands program.</description>

      <title>Some applications of the Nygaard filtration and quasisyntomic descent in positive characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article gives an expository account of quasisyntomic descent and the Nygaard filtration in positive characteristic, complemented by several new applications to $p$-adic cohomology theories. The guiding result is a new approach to Illusie's comparison between fppf cohomology with $\mathbb{Z}_p(1)$ coefficients and the slope $1$ part of crystalline cohomology. We follow work of Bhatt-Lurie, but give a more elementary presentation which does not rely on the formalism of $\infty$-categories. We then revisit Ogus' comparison theorem between infinitesimal cohomology and \'etale cohomology, and give new proofs of several results on fppf cohomology that were previously obtained with the de Rham-Witt complex. We also determine the action of multiplication-by-$n$ on the fppf cohomology of an abelian variety, answering a question of A. Skorobogatov to the author. This is an expanded version of the author's master thesis.</description>

Abstract: We prove a root stack valuative criterion for good moduli space maps and for gerbes for reductive groups under some mild assumptions on the residue characteristic. We give several applications to parahoric extension for torsors, rational points on stacks, gerbes and homogeneous spaces, and the geometry of fibrations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We fit the Brauer group of a $\mu_r$-gerbe over a (possibly arbitrarily singular) stacky curve into an exact sequence and give characterizations for when it is short exact and a condition for when it splits. We also give a precise formula for the Brauer group of a $\mu_r$-gerbe in the case that the base curve is smooth. We end by showing that $\operatorname{Br}=\operatorname{Br'}=\operatorname{H}^2$ for separated tame one-dimensional algebraic stacks of finite type over a field.</description>

      <title>Supersymmetric Topological Sigma Models and Doubling Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Witten's topological B-model on a Calabi-Yau background is known to reproduce, in the open string sector, the derived category of coherent sheaves. When the target space is a complex torus, the topological model enjoys a non-geometric symmetry known as T-duality, which relates the theories on the torus and dual torus backgrounds. By considering the "double field theory" of Hull and Reid-Edwards on the product of a torus and its dual, T-duality occurs as a geometric symmetry of the target space.
  Building on the methods of Y. Qin, we propose a method of analyzing the topological B-model on a torus in the doubled geometry framework which naturally incorporates certain rank-one D-branes, providing a different perspective on the derived category of the torus. In certain cases, the intersection theory of these lifted branes correctly computes the BRST cohomology of the B-model, and hence the derived Hom-spaces of the corresponding line bundles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In analogy to flexible bipyramids, also known as Bricard octahedra, we study flexible couplings of two Bennett mechanisms. The resulting flexible bi-Bennett structures can be used as building blocks of flexible tubes with quadrilateral cross-section that possess skew faces. We present three 4-dimensional families of flexible arranged Bennett tubes and discuss some of their properties as well as their relation to flexible bipyramids and biprisms, respectively.</description>

Abstract: We develop a reduction theory for the representation of $\mathrm{SL}_n$ on pairs of symmetric $n\times n$ matrices. We apply this theory to the pencils of quadrics arising from divisors on hyperelliptic curves. We use these results to show that, in a density $1$ family, an odd degree point $P$ of degree at most $2g-1$ on the hyperelliptic curve $z^2 = f_0x^{2g+2} + f_1 x^{2g+1} y + \cdots + f_{2g+2}y^{2g+2}$ cannot have small Weil height.</description>

Abstract: We study the moduli space of constant scalar curvature K\"ahler surfaces around the toric ones. To this aim, we introduce the class of foldable surfaces : smooth toric surfaces whose lattice automorphism group contain a non trivial cyclic subgroup. We classify such surfaces and show that they all admit a constant scalar curvature K\"ahler metric (cscK metric). We then study the moduli space of polarised cscK surfaces around a point given by a foldable surface, and show that it is locally modeled on a finite quotient of a toric affine variety with terminal singularities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19054v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is a significant step forward in understanding dependency equilibria within the framework of real algebraic geometry encompassing both pure and mixed equilibria. In alignment with Spohn's original definition of dependency equilibria, we propose two alternative definitions, allowing for an algebro-geometric comprehensive study of all dependency equilibria. We give a sufficient condition for the existence of a pure dependency equilibrium and show that every Nash equilibrium lies on the Spohn variety, the algebraic model for dependency equilibria. For generic games, the set of real points of the Spohn variety is Zariski dense. Furthermore, every Nash equilibrium in this case is a dependency equilibrium. Finally, we present a detailed analysis of the geometric structure of dependency equilibria for $(2\times2)$-games</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14612v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate Spohn curves, the algebro-geometric models of totally mixed dependency equilibria for $2 \times 2$ normal-form games. These curves arise as the intersection of two quadrics in $\mathbb{P}^3$ and are generically elliptic curves. We examine the reduction of Spohn curves to plane curves, providing a full classification of conditions under which they are reducible. Notably, we prove that the real points are dense on the Spohn curve in all cases, which is relevant for applications. These computations are further supported by Macaulay2 and stored in Mathrepo. We review methods to compute the $j$-invariants of elliptic curves arising as the intersection of quadrics in $\mathbb P^3$ which we apply to the case of Spohn curves aimed at game theorists. We propose a definition of equivalence of generic $2\times 2$ games based on the $j$-invariant of the Spohn curve.</description>

      <title>Higher Koszul duality and $n$-affineness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16935v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study $\mathbb{E}_n$-Koszul duality for pairs of algebras of the form $\mathrm{C}_{\bullet}(\Omega^{n}_*X;\Bbbk) \leftrightarrow \mathrm{C}^{\bullet}(X;\Bbbk)$, and the closely related question of $n$-affineness for Betti stacks. It was expected, but not known, that $\mathbb{E}_n$-Koszul duality should induce a kind of Morita equivalence between categories of iterated modules. We establish this rigorously by proving that the $(\infty,n)$-category of iterated modules over $\mathrm{C}_{\bullet}(\Omega_*^{n+1}X;\Bbbk)$ is equivalent to the $(\infty,n)$-category of quasi-coherent sheaves of $(\infty,n-1)$-categories on $\mathrm{cSpec}(\mathrm{C}^{\bullet}(X;\Bbbk))$, where $\mathrm{cSpec}(\mathrm{C}^{\bullet}(X;\Bbbk))$ is the cospectrum of $\mathrm{C}^{\bullet}(X;\Bbbk)$. By the monodromy equivalence, these categories are also equivalent to the category of higher local systems on $X$, $n\mathbf{LocSysCat}^{n-1}(X;\Bbbk)$. Our result is new already in the classical case $n=1$, although it can be seen to recover well known formulations of $\mathbb{E}_1$-Koszul duality as a Morita equivalence of module categories (up to appropriate completions of the $t$-structures). We also investigate (higher) affineness properties of Betti stacks. We give a complete characterization of $n$-affine Betti stacks, in terms of the $0$-affineness of their iterated loop space. As a consequence, we prove that $n$-truncated Betti stacks are $n$-affine; and that $\pi_{n+1}(X)$ is an obstruction to $n$-affineness.</description>

      <title>Wahl singularities in degenerations of del Pezzo surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19929v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For any fixed $1 \leq \ell \leq 9$, we characterize all Wahl singularities that appear in degenerations of del Pezzo surfaces of degree $\ell$. This extends the work of Manetti and Hacking-Prokhorov in degree $9$, where Wahl singularities are classified using the Markov equation. To achieve this, we introduce del Pezzo Wahl chains with markings. They define marked del Pezzo surfaces $W_{*m}$ that govern all such degenerations. We also prove that every marked del Pezzo surface degenerates into a canonically defined toric del Pezzo surface with only T-singularities. In addition, we establish a one-to-one correspondence between the $W_{*m}$ surfaces and certain fake weighted projective planes. As applications, we show that every Wahl singularity occurs for del Pezzo surfaces of degree $\leq 4$, but that there are infinitely many Wahl singularities that do not arise for degrees $\geq 5$. We also use Hacking's exceptional collections to provide geometric proofs of recent results by Polishchuk and Rains on exceptional vector bundles on del Pezzo surfaces.</description>

      <title>Analytic K-semistability and local wall-crossing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.08383v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a small polarised deformation of a constant scalar curvature K\"ahler manifold, under some cohomological vanishing conditions, we prove that K-polystability along nearby polarisations implies the existence of a constant scalar curvature K\"ahler metric. In this setting, we reduce K-polystability to the computation of the classical Futaki invariant on the cscK degeneration. Our result holds on specific families and provides local wall-crossing phenomena for the moduli of cscK manifolds when the polarisation varies.</description>

      <title>Tropical combinatorics of max-linear Bayesian networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10394v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A polytrope is a tropical polyhedron that is also classically convex. We study the tropical combinatorial types of polytropes associated to weighted directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). This family of polytropes arises in algebraic statistics when describing the model class of max-linear Bayesian networks. We show how the edge weights of a network directly relate to the facet structure of the corresponding polytrope. We also give a classification of polytropes from weighted DAGs at different levels of equivalence. These results give insight on the statistical problem of identifiability for a max-linear Bayesian network.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of the Efficiency and Comparison of Different Numerical Differentiation Methods on Three Case Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10285v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Without question regarding its pivotal significance, the computation of function derivatives carries substantial weight within a multitude of engineering and applied mathematical fields. These encompass optimization, the development of nonlinear control systems, and the assessment of noisy time signals, among others. In this study, we have chosen three illustrative cases: the logistic model for population dynamics, temperature variation within buildings, and the determination of market equilibrium prices. The primary objective is to assess the effectiveness of various numerical differentiation techniques and conduct a comparative analysis of the outcomes for each of these case studies. To achieve this objective, we employed three distinct numerical differentiation techniques: The Forward, Backward, and Centered FiniteDifference methods, each executed in two different levels of precision, totaling six variations. Our findings clearly indicate that, for the initial case study, the methods characterized by lower computational costs (specifically, the Forward and Backward Finite-Difference methods) yield superior outcomes. In contrast, for the second case study, the Centered Finite-Difference method delivers better results. In the case of the third case study, our results reveal that none of the methods produce estimations that meet acceptable standards. It is noteworthy that the empirical equations for each case study have been validated against previous literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21764v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: If X is a groupoid equipped with an action of a 2-group G then one has a 2-groupoid X/G. We describe the fibers of the functor from X/G to the 1-groupoid $\pi_0(X)/\pi_0(G)$. We also give an explicit model for X/G in a certain situation.</description>
