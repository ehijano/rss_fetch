      <title>Maximum entropy models of neuronal populations at and off criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Empirical evidence of scaling behaviors in neuronal avalanches suggests that neuronal populations in the brain operate near criticality. Departure from scaling in neuronal avalanches has been used as a measure of distance to criticality and linked to brain disorders. A distinct line of evidence for brain criticality has come from thermodynamic signatures in maximum entropy (ME) models. Both of these approaches have been widely applied to the analysis of neuronal data. However, the relationship between deviations from avalanche criticality and thermodynamics of ME models of neuronal populations remains poorly understood. To address this question, we study spontaneous activity of organotypic rat cortex slice cultures in physiological and drug-induced hypo- or hyper-excitable conditions, which are classified as critical, subcritical and supercritical based on avalanche dynamics. We find that ME models inferred from critical cultures show signatures of criticality in thermodynamic quantities, e.g. specific heat. However, such signatures are also present, and equally strong, in models inferred from supercritical cultures -- despite their altered dynamics and poor functional performance. On the contrary, ME models inferred from subcritical cultures do not show thermodynamic hints of criticality. Importantly, we confirm these results using an interpretable neural network model that can be tuned to and away from avalanche criticality. Our findings indicate that maximum entropy models correctly distinguish subcritical from critical/supercritical systems. However, they may not be able to discriminate between avalanche criticality and supercriticality, although they may still capture a number of important features from neuronal data.</description>

      <title>Teaching signal synchronization in deep neural networks with prospective neurons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Working memory requires the brain to maintain information from the recent past to guide ongoing behavior. Neurons can contribute to this capacity by slowly integrating their inputs over time, creating persistent activity that outlasts the original stimulus. However, when these slowly integrating neurons are organized hierarchically, they introduce cumulative delays that create a fundamental challenge for learning: teaching signals that indicate whether behavior was correct or incorrect arrive out-of-sync with the neural activity they are meant to instruct. Here, we demonstrate that neurons enhanced with an adaptive current can compensate for these delays by responding to external stimuli prospectively -- effectively predicting future inputs to synchronize with them. First, we show that such prospective neurons enable teaching signal synchronization across a range of learning algorithms that propagate error signals through hierarchical networks. Second, we demonstrate that this successfully guides learning in slowly integrating neurons, enabling the formation and retrieval of memories over extended timescales. We support our findings with a mathematical analysis of the prospective coding mechanism and learning experiments on motor control tasks. Together, our results reveal how neural adaptation could solve a critical timing problem and enable efficient learning in dynamic environments.</description>

      <title>Detection of spiking motifs of arbitrary length in neural activity using bounded synaptic delays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of spiking neural networks, temporal coding of signals is increasingly preferred over the rate coding hypothesis due to its advantages in processing speed and energy efficiency. In temporal coding, synaptic delays are crucial for processing signals with precise spike timings, known as spiking motifs. Synaptic delays are however bounded in the brain and can thus be shorter than the duration of a motif. This prevents the use of motif recognition methods that consist of setting heterogeneous delays to synchronize the input spikes on a single output neuron acting as a coincidence detector. To address this issue, we developed a method to detect motifs of arbitrary length using a sequence of output neurons connected to input neurons by bounded synaptic delays. Each output neuron is associated with a sub-motif of bounded duration. A motif is recognized if all sub-motifs are sequentially detected by the output neurons. We simulated this network using leaky integrate-and-fire neurons and tested it on the Spiking Heidelberg Digits (SHD) database, that is, on audio data converted to spikes via a cochlear model, as well as on random simultaneous motifs. The results demonstrate that the network can effectively recognize motifs of arbitrary length extracted from the SHD database. Our method features a correct detection rate of about 60% in presence of ten simultaneous motifs from the SHD dataset and up to 80% for five motifs, showing the robustness of the network to noise. Results on random overlapping patterns show that the recognition of a single motif overlapping with other motifs is most effective for a large number of input neurons and sparser motifs. Our method provides a foundation for more general models for the storage and retrieval of neural information of arbitrary temporal lengths.</description>

      <title>Modulating the tennis racket grip during motor imagery influences serve accuracy and performance: A pilot study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is now ample evidence that Motor Imagery (MI) contributes to improve motor performance. Previous studies provided evidence that its effectiveness remains dependent upon specific guidelines and recommendations. The body posture, as well as the context in which MI is performed, are notably critical and should be carefully considered. The present study in young tennis players (n=18) was designed to compare the effectiveness of performing MI of the serve while adopting a loose grip (congruent MI) or holding tightly and squeezing hard the racket (incongruent MI). Data revealed that both MI conditions contributed to enhance the number of successful serves (p&lt;0.001) and the technical quality of the serve (p&lt;0.001). Interestingly, comparing mean serve accuracy scores showed that performance gains were significantly higher in the loose MI group than in the tight MI group (p&lt;0.02). These findings confirm the critical importance of the congruence between the content of the mental representation and the features of the corresponding actual movement. Overall, the present study further highlights the effectiveness of the loose grip while mentally rehearsing the serve, and might thus contribute to update and adjust specific MI guidelines and recommendations.</description>

      <title>Does the Muller-Lyer illusion induced by a goalkeeper configuration influence soccer penalty kicks?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In soccer penalty kicks, goalkeepers that orient their arms upward compared to downward can be misperceived as being taller - effectively recreating the Muller-Lyer illusion. The present study elaborates on previous research surrounding a potential illusion-induced bias in penalty kicks. Participants were exposed to goalkeeper configurations within a virtual goal including arms-parallel, arms-down, arms-out and arms-up. They separately judged the perceived size of the goalkeeper, and executed penalty kicks. The perceived size was near fully consistent with the intended illusion. Meanwhile, the penalty kicks indicated wider a horizontal position following arms-out, and lower vertical position following arms-up. Likewise, there was no relation between the biases expressed in perception and action. While goalkeepers can elicit a perceptual illusion, this does not extend to influencing the penalty kick itself. Instead, other contextual cues appeared more relevant including the proximity between the goalkeeper and goalposts, and with it, the available space in the goal.</description>

      <title>Why Consciousness Should Explain Physical Phenomena: Toward a Testable Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04047v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The reductionist approach commonly employed in scientific methods presupposes that both macro and micro phenomena can be explained by micro-level laws alone. This assumption implies intra-level causal closure, rendering all macro phenomena epiphenomenal. However, the integrative nature of consciousness suggests that it is a macro phenomenon. To ensure scientific testability and reject epiphenomenalism, the reductionist assumption of intra-level causal closure must be rejected. This implies that even neural-level behavior cannot be explained by observable neural-level laws alone. Therefore, a new methodology is necessary to acknowledge the causal efficacy of macro-level phenomena. We model the brain as operating under dual laws at different levels. This model includes hypothetical macro-level psychological laws that are not determined solely by micro-level neural laws, as well as the causal effects from macro to micro levels. In this study, we propose a constructive approach that explains both mental and physical phenomena through the interaction between these two sets of laws.</description>

      <title>A region-specific brain dysfunction underlies cognitive impairment in long COVID brain fog</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14188v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Long COVID "brain fog" is a common and debilitating subjective syndrome often associated with persistent cognitive impairment after COVID-19 infection. Here we identify a specific regional brain dysfunction that mediates this cognitive impairment and provide evidence that targeted neuromodulation improves this deficit. In 120 patients with long COVID brain fog, we found an aberrant perceptual processing pattern. Patients with more severe brain fog committed significantly more false alarms (impulsive responses to non-signals) despite preserved overall accuracy. Both high-density (128-channel) EEG and structural MRI analyses provided converging evidence of a right inferior insula deficit, characterized by a blunted neural monitoring signal and cortical atrophy. We confirmed this deficit in a separate 796-participant UK Biobank longitudinal COVID re-imaging cohort, where COVID-19 survivors also showed selective impairment on a perceptual processing task and corresponding longitudinal atrophy of the right inferior insula compared with healthy controls. Finally, in a proof-of-principle randomized, sham-controlled trial (n = 40), a non-invasive, excitatory theta-burst ultrasound stimulation protocol targeting the right inferior insula rescued the perceptual deficit by reducing false alarms. These findings provide evidence of a causal role for right inferior insula dysfunction in long COVID-related perceptual impairment and show that modulation of this region can rescue the deficit, establishing it as a novel therapeutic target for long COVID cognitive impairment.</description>
