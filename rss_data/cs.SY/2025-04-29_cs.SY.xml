      <title>A Hybrid Framework for Efficient Koopman Operator Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Koopman analysis of a general dynamics system provides a linear Koopman operator and an embedded eigenfunction space, enabling the application of standard techniques from linear analysis. However, in practice, deriving exact operators and mappings for the observable space is intractable, and deriving an approximation or expressive subset of these functions is challenging. Programmatic methods often rely on system-specific parameters and may scale poorly in both time and space, while learning-based approaches depend heavily on difficult-to-know hyperparameters, such as the dimension of the observable space. To address the limitations of both methods, we propose a hybrid framework that uses semidefinite programming to find a representation of the linear operator, then learns an approximate mapping into and out of the space that the operator propagates. This approach enables efficient learning of the operator and explicit mappings while reducing the need for specifying the unknown structure ahead of time.</description>

      <title>A Unified Alternating Optimization Framework for Joint Sensor and Actuator Configuration in LQG Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper fills a gap in the literature by considering a joint sensor and actuator configuration problem under the linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) performance without assuming a predefined set of candidate components. Different from the existing research, which primarily focuses on selecting or placing sensors and actuators from a fixed group, we consider a more flexible formulation where these components must be designed from scratch, subject to general-form configuration costs and constraints. To address this challenge, we first analytically characterize the gradients of the LQG performance with respect to the sensor and actuator matrices using algebraic Riccati equations. Subsequently, we derive first-order optimality conditions based on the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) analysis and develop a unified alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)-based alternating optimization framework to address the general-form sensor and actuator configuration problem. Furthermore, we investigate three representative scenarios: sparsity promoting configuration, low-rank promoting configuration, and structure-constrained configuration. For each scenario, we provide in-depth analysis and develop tailored computational schemes. The proposed framework ensures numerical efficiency and adaptability to various design constraints and configuration costs, making it well-suited for integration into numerical solvers.</description>

      <title>Nonconvex Linear System Identification with Minimal State Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-order linear System IDentification (SysID) addresses the challenge of estimating the parameters of a linear dynamical system from finite samples of observations and control inputs with minimal state representation. Traditional approaches often utilize Hankel-rank minimization, which relies on convex relaxations that can require numerous, costly singular value decompositions (SVDs) to optimize. In this work, we propose two nonconvex reformulations to tackle low-order SysID (i) Burer-Monterio (BM) factorization of the Hankel matrix for efficient nuclear norm minimization, and (ii) optimizing directly over system parameters for real, diagonalizable systems with an atomic norm style decomposition. These reformulations circumvent the need for repeated heavy SVD computations, significantly improving computational efficiency. Moreover, we prove that optimizing directly over the system parameters yields lower statistical error rates, and lower sample complexities that do not scale linearly with trajectory length like in Hankel-nuclear norm minimization. Additionally, while our proposed formulations are nonconvex, we provide theoretical guarantees of achieving global optimality in polynomial time. Finally, we demonstrate algorithms that solve these nonconvex programs and validate our theoretical claims on synthetic data.</description>

      <title>Fairness-aware Dynamic Hosting Capacity and the Impacts of Strategic Solar PV Curtailment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rapid deployment of distributed energy resources (DERs), such as solar photovoltaics (PV), poses a risk to the distribution grid under high penetration. Therefore, studying hosting capacity (HC) limits considering grid physics and demand variability is crucial. This paper introduces an improved framework for determining the HC of radial distribution networks by enhancing an existing convex inner approximation (CIA) approach. The proposed method achieves a more accurate and larger inner approximation, resulting in better HC limits. We also consider time-varying demand and the design of objective functions to ensure equitable access to grid resources. A case study with solar PV integration is conducted using a modified IEEE-37 radial network to examine the impact of increased PV capacity, demonstrating that with no more than 5% annual solar PV energy curtailed, it is possible to increase solar PV hosting capacity by at least 50% with no negative grid impacts and a net positive economic impact when accounted for the cost of carbon. Results show that fair allocation methods can lead to higher net profits and reduced PV curtailment and CO2.</description>

      <title>State Reconstruction Under Malicious Sensor Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers the state reconstruction problem for discrete-time cyber-physical systems when some of the sensors can be arbitrarily corrupted by malicious attacks where the attacked sensors belong to an unknown set. We first prove that the state is $s$-error correctable if the system under consideration is $s$-sparse observable where $s$ denotes the maximum number of attacked sensors. Then, two state reconstruction methods are presented where the first method is based on searching elements with the same value in a set and the second method is developed in terms of searching element satisfying a given condition. In addition, after establishing and analyzing the conditions that the proposed state reconstruction methods are not effective, we address that it is very hard to prevent the state reconstruction when either state reconstruction method proposed in this paper is used. The correctness and effectiveness of the proposed methods are examined via an example of four-dimensional dynamic systems and a real-world example of three-inertia systems.</description>

      <title>Federated Learning-based Semantic Segmentation for Lane and Object Detection in Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) require precise lane and object detection to ensure safe navigation. However, centralized deep learning (DL) approaches for semantic segmentation raise privacy and scalability challenges, particularly when handling sensitive data. This research presents a new federated learning (FL) framework that integrates secure deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Differential Privacy (DP) to address these issues. The core contribution of this work involves: (1) developing a new hybrid UNet-ResNet34 architecture for centralized semantic segmentation to achieve high accuracy and tackle privacy concerns due to centralized training, and (2) implementing the privacy-preserving FL model, distributed across AVs to enhance performance through secure CNNs and DP mechanisms. In the proposed FL framework, the methodology distinguishes itself from the existing approach through the following: (a) ensuring data decentralization through FL to uphold user privacy by eliminating the need for centralized data aggregation, (b) integrating DP mechanisms to secure sensitive model updates against potential adversarial inference attacks, and (c) evaluating the frameworks performance and generalizability using RGB and semantic segmentation datasets derived from the CARLA simulator. Experimental results show significant improvements in accuracy, from 81.5% to 88.7% for the RGB dataset and from 79.3% to 86.9% for the SEG dataset over 20 to 70 Communication Rounds (CRs). Global loss was reduced by over 60%, and minor accuracy trade-offs from DP were observed. This study contributes by offering a scalable, privacy-preserving FL framework tailored for AVs, optimizing communication efficiency while balancing performance and data security.</description>

      <title>A Quadratic Programming Approach to Flight Envelope Protection Using Control Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensuring the safe operation of aerospace systems within their prescribed flight envelope is a fundamental requirement for modern flight control systems. Flight envelope protection prevents violations of aerodynamic, structural, and performance constraints, mitigating risks such as stall, excessive loads, and loss of control. Conventional FEP approaches, such as reference clipping via saturation functions and model-based command filtering, impose constraints at the reference input level but often fail to account for closed-loop system dynamics, potentially leading to constraint violations during transients. This paper introduces a new approach to the flight envelope protection problem by employing a quadratic programming-based safety filter using control barrier functions to dynamically enforce flight envelope constraints while preserving control performance. Unlike traditional reference filtering methods, the control barrier function-based safety filter actively ensures strict forward invariance of the safe flight envelope set, integrating seamlessly with existing control architectures. The proposed framework is implemented in a nonlinear missile flight control system and evaluated in a simulated environment. The results demonstrate its ability to prevent constraint violations while minimizing conservatism, offering a robust alternative to existing flight envelope protection methodologies.</description>

      <title>Trajectory Planning with Model Predictive Control for Obstacle Avoidance Considering Prediction Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel trajectory planner for autonomous robots, specifically designed to enhance navigation by incorporating dynamic obstacle avoidance within the Robot Operating System 2 (ROS2) and Navigation 2 (Nav2) framework. The proposed method utilizes Model Predictive Control (MPC) with a focus on handling the uncertainties associated with the movement prediction of dynamic obstacles. Unlike existing Nav2 trajectory planners which primarily deal with static obstacles or react to the current position of dynamic obstacles, this planner predicts future obstacle positions using a stochastic Vector Auto-Regressive Model (VAR). The obstacles' future positions are represented by probability distributions, and collision avoidance is achieved through constraints based on the Mahalanobis distance, ensuring the robot avoids regions where obstacles are likely to be. This approach considers the robot's kinodynamic constraints, enabling it to track a reference path while adapting to real-time changes in the environment. The paper details the implementation, including obstacle prediction, tracking, and the construction of feasible sets for MPC. Simulation results in a Gazebo environment demonstrate the effectiveness of this method in scenarios where robots must navigate around each other, showing improved collision avoidance capabilities.</description>

      <title>Negative Imaginary Neural ODEs: Learning to Control Mechanical Systems with Stability Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a neural control method to provide guaranteed stabilization for mechanical systems using a novel negative imaginary neural ordinary differential equation (NINODE) controller. Specifically, we employ neural networks with desired properties as state-space function matrices within a Hamiltonian framework to ensure the system possesses the NI property. This NINODE system can serve as a controller that asymptotically stabilizes an NI plant under certain conditions. For mechanical plants with colocated force actuators and position sensors, we demonstrate that all the conditions required for stability can be translated into regularity constraints on the neural networks used in the controller. We illustrate the utility, effectiveness, and stability guarantees of the NINODE controller through an example involving a nonlinear mass-spring system.</description>

      <title>Discrete-time Two-Layered Forgetting RLS Identification under Finite Excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, adaptive identification methods that can achieve the true value convergence of parameters without requiring persistent excitation (PE) have been widely studied, and concurrent learning has been intensively studied. However, the parameter convergence rate is limited for the gradient-based method owing to small parameter update gain, and even the introduction of forgetting factors does not work sufficiently. To address this problem, this study proposes a novel discrete-time recursive least squares method under finite excitation (FE) conditions using two forgetting factors (inner and outer) and an augmented regressor matrix comprising a sum of regressor vectors. The proposed method ensures the PE condition of the augmented regressor matrix under FE conditions of the regressor vector and allows the properly design of the forgetting factor without estimator windup and/or destabilization of the system. Numerical simulations demonstrate its effectiveness by comparing it with several conventional methods.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) verification system for intelligent, camera-based in-body medical devices. A case study of a Video Capsule Endoscopy (VCE) prototype is used to illustrate the system's functionality. The field-programmable gate array (FPGA)-based approach simulates the capsule's traversal through the strointestinal (GI) tract by injecting on-demand pre-recorded images from VCE studies. It is demonstrated that the HIL configuration is capable of meeting the real-time requirements of the prototypes and automatically identifying errors. The integration of machine learning (ML) hardware accelerators within medical devices can be facilitated by utilising this configuration, as it enables the verification of its functionality prior to the initiation of clinical testing.</description>

      <title>Event-triggered Robust Model Predictive Control under Hard Computation Resource Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model predictive control (MPC) is capable of controlling nonlinear systems with guaranteed constraint satisfaction and stability. However, MPC requires solving optimization problems online periodically, which often exceeds the local system's computational capabilities. A potential solution is to leverage external processing, such as a central industrial server. Yet, this central computer typically serves multiple systems simultaneously, leading to significant hardware demands due to the need to solve numerous optimization problems concurrently. In this work, we tackle this challenge by developing an event-triggered model predictive control (ET-MPC) that provably stabilizes multiple nonlinear systems under disturbances while solving only optimization problems for a fixed-size subset at any given time. Unlike existing ET-MPC methods, which primarily reduce average computational load yet still require hardware capable of handling all systems simultaneously, our approach reduces the worst-case computational load. This significantly lowers central server hardware requirements by diminishing peak computational demands. We achieve our improvements by leveraging recent advancements in distributed event-triggered linear control and integrating them with a robust MPC that employs constraint tightening.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Sensor Fault Diagnosis with Proven Guarantees using Incrementally Stable Recurrent Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robust Recurrent Neural Networks (R-RENs) are a class of neural networks that have built-in system-theoretic robustness and incremental stability properties. In this manuscript, we leverage these properties to construct a data-driven Fault Detection and Isolation (FDI) method for sensor faults with proven performance guarantees. The underlying idea behind the scheme is to construct a bank of multiple R-RENs (acting as fault isolation filters), each with different levels of sensitivity (increased or decreased) to faults at different sensors. That is, each R-REN is designed to be specifically sensitive to faults occurring in a particular sensor and robust against faults in all the others. The latter is guaranteed using the built-in incremental stability properties of R-RENs. The proposed method is unsupervised (as it does not require labeled data from faulty sensors) and data-driven (because it exploits available fault-free input-output system trajectories and does not rely on dynamic models of the system under study). Numerical simulations on a roll-plane model of a vehicle demonstrate the effectiveness and practical applicability of the proposed methodology.</description>

      <title>Model-based controller assisted domain randomization in deep reinforcement learning: application to nonlinear powertrain control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex mechanical systems such as vehicle powertrains are inherently subject to multiple nonlinearities and uncertainties arising from parametric variations. Modeling and calibration errors are therefore unavoidable, making the transfer of control systems from simulation to real-world systems a critical challenge. Traditional robust controls have limitations in handling certain types of nonlinearities and uncertainties, requiring a more practical approach capable of comprehensively compensating for these various constraints. This study proposes a new robust control approach using the framework of deep reinforcement learning (DRL). The key strategy lies in the synergy among domain randomization-based DRL, long short-term memory (LSTM)-based actor and critic networks, and model-based control (MBC). The problem setup is modeled via the latent Markov decision process (LMDP), a set of vanilla MDPs, for a controlled system subject to uncertainties and nonlinearities. In LMDP, the dynamics of an environment simulator is randomized during training to improve the robustness of the control system to real testing environments. The randomization increases training difficulties as well as conservativeness of the resultant control system; therefore, progress is assisted by concurrent use of a model-based controller based on a nominal system model. Compared to traditional DRL-based controls, the proposed controller design is smarter in that we can achieve a high level of generalization ability with a more compact neural network architecture and a smaller amount of training data. The proposed approach is verified via practical application to active damping for a complex powertrain system with nonlinearities and parametric variations. Comparative tests demonstrate the high robustness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Spectral Analysis of Approximated Capacity Fade Curvature for Lithium-Ion Batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The techno-economic benefits of incorporating battery degradation into advanced control strategies necessitate the development of degradation diagnosis as an advanced function in battery management systems (BMSs). To address this, a curvature-based knee identification method was proposed in our previous work [1]. Here, we further validate its effectiveness on a new battery aging dataset under a realistic driving profile and conduct spectral analysis of the approximated capacity fade curvature. The curvature-based method shows consistent knee identification performance on this dataset and the approximated curvature is found to correlate with underlying degradation modes and a shift of electrode material phase transition points. The method uses capacity data as the only input, which is easy to acquire in the lab and it is applicable in battery energy storage systems for grid applications.</description>

      <title>Logic-based Resilience Computation of Power Systems Against Frequency Requirements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Incorporating renewable energy sources into modern power grids has significantly decreased system inertia, which has raised concerns about power system vulnerability to disturbances and frequency instability. The conventional methods for evaluating transient stability by bounding frequency deviations are often conservative and may not accurately reflect real-world conditions and operational constraints. To address this, we propose a framework for assessing the resilience of power systems against disturbances while adhering to realistic operational frequency constraints. Our approach leverages the Lure system representation of power system dynamics and Signal Temporal Logic (STL) to capture the essential frequency response requirements set by grid operators. This enables us to translate frequency constraints into formal robustness semantics. We then formulate an optimization problem to identify the maximum disturbance that the system can withstand without violating these constraints. The resulting optimization is translated into a scenario optimization while addressing the uncertainty in the obtained solution. The proposed methodology has been simulated on the Single Machine Infinite Bus case study and 9-Bus IEEE benchmark system, demonstrating its effectiveness in assessing resilience across various operating conditions and delivering promising results.</description>

      <title>Digital Twin-based Out-of-Distribution Detection in Autonomous Vessels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An autonomous vessel (AV) is a complex cyber-physical system (CPS) with software enabling many key functionalities, e.g., navigation software enables an AV to autonomously or semi-autonomously follow a path to its destination. Digital twins of such AVs enable advanced functionalities such as running what-if scenarios, performing predictive maintenance, and enabling fault diagnosis. Due to technological improvements, real-time analyses using continuous data from vessels' real-time operations have become increasingly possible. However, the literature has little explored developing advanced analyses in real-time data in AVs with digital twins built with machine learning techniques. To this end, we present a novel digital twin-based approach (ODDIT) to detect future out-of-distribution (OOD) states of an AV before reaching them, enabling proactive intervention. Such states may indicate anomalies requiring attention (e.g., manual correction by the ship master) and assist testers in scenario-centered testing. The digital twin consists of two machine-learning models predicting future vessel states and whether the predicted state will be OOD. We evaluated ODDIT with five vessels across waypoint and zigzag maneuvering under simulated conditions, including sensor and actuator noise and environmental disturbances i.e., ocean current. ODDIT achieved high accuracy in detecting OOD states, with AUROC and TNR@TPR95 scores reaching 99\% across multiple vessels.</description>

      <title>Clustering-based Recurrent Neural Network Controller synthesis under Signal Temporal Logic Specifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous robotic systems require advanced control frameworks to achieve complex temporal objectives that extend beyond conventional stability and trajectory tracking. Signal Temporal Logic (STL) provides a formal framework for specifying such objectives, with robustness metrics widely employed for control synthesis. Existing optimization-based approaches using neural network (NN)-based controllers often rely on a single NN for both learning and control. However, variations in initial states and obstacle configurations can lead to discontinuous changes in the optimization solution, thereby degrading generalization and control performance. To address this issue, this study proposes a method to enhance recurrent neural network (RNN)-based control by clustering solution trajectories that satisfy STL specifications under diverse initial conditions. The proposed approach utilizes trajectory similarity metrics to generate clustering labels, which are subsequently used to train a classification network. This network assigns new initial states and obstacle configurations to the appropriate cluster, enabling the selection of a specialized controller. By explicitly accounting for variations in solution trajectories, the proposed method improves both estimation accuracy and control performance. Numerical experiments on a dynamic vehicle path planning problem demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.</description>

      <title>Capturing Aerodynamic Characteristics of ATTAS Aircraft with Evolving Intelligent System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate modeling of aerodynamic coefficients is crucial for understanding and optimizing the performance of modern aircraft systems. This paper presents the novel deployment of an Evolving Type-2 Quantum Fuzzy Neural Network (eT2QFNN) for modeling the aerodynamic coefficients of the ATTAS aircraft to express the aerodynamic characteristics. eT2QFNN can represent the nonlinear aircraft model by creating multiple linear submodels with its rule-based structure through an incremental learning strategy rather than a traditional batch learning approach. Moreover, it enhances robustness to uncertainties and data noise through its quantum membership functions, as well as its automatic rule-learning and parameter-tuning capabilities. During the estimation of the aerodynamic coefficients via the flight data of the ATTAS, two different studies are conducted in the training phase: one with a large amount of data and the other with a limited amount of data. The results show that the modeling performance of the eT2QFNN is superior in comparison to baseline counterparts. Furthermore, eT2QFNN estimated the aerodynamic model with fewer rules compared to Type-1 fuzzy counterparts. In addition, by applying the Delta method to the proposed approach, the stability and control derivatives of the aircraft are analyzed. The results prove the superiority of the proposed eT2QFNN in representing aerodynamic coefficients.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Stabilization of Unknown Linear-Threshold Network Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the data-driven control of unknown linear-threshold network dynamics to stabilize the state to a reference value. We consider two types of controllers: (i) a state feedback controller with feed-forward reference input and (ii) an augmented feedback controller with error integration. The first controller features a simpler structure and is easier to design, while the second offers improved performance in the presence of system parameter changes and disturbances. Our design strategy employs state-input datasets to construct data-based representations of the closed-loop dynamics. Since these representations involve linear threshold functions, we rewrite them as switched linear systems, and formulate the design problem as that of finding a common controller for all the resulting modes. This gives rise to a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) whose solutions corresponds to the controller gain matrices. We analyze the computational complexity of solving the LMIs and propose a simplified, sufficient set of conditions that scales linearly with the system state. Simulations on two case studies involving regulation of firing rate dynamics in rodent brains and of arousal level dynamics in humans demonstrate the effectiveness of the controller designs.</description>

      <title>Intelligent Spectrum Sharing in Integrated TN-NTNs: A Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrating non-terrestrial networks (NTNs) with terrestrial networks (TNs) is key to enhancing coverage, capacity, and reliability in future wireless communications. However, the multi-tier, heterogeneous architecture of these integrated TN-NTNs introduces complex challenges in spectrum sharing and interference management. Conventional optimization approaches struggle to handle the high-dimensional decision space and dynamic nature of these networks. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical deep reinforcement learning (HDRL) framework to address these challenges and enable intelligent spectrum sharing. The proposed framework leverages the inherent hierarchy of the network, with separate policies for each tier, to learn and optimize spectrum allocation decisions at different timescales and levels of abstraction. By decomposing the complex spectrum sharing problem into manageable sub-tasks and allowing for efficient coordination among the tiers, the HDRL approach offers a scalable and adaptive solution for spectrum management in future TN-NTNs. Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed framework compared to traditional approaches, highlighting its potential to enhance spectral efficiency and network capacity in dynamic, multi-tier environments.</description>

      <title>Low-Bit Integerization of Vision Transformers using Operand Reodering for Efficient Hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pre-trained vision transformers have achieved remarkable performance across various visual tasks but suffer from expensive computational and memory costs. While model quantization reduces memory usage by lowering precision, these models still incur significant computational overhead due to the dequantization before matrix operations. In this work, we analyze the computation graph and propose an integerization process based on operation reordering. Specifically, the process delays dequantization until after matrix operations. This enables integerized matrix multiplication and linear module by directly processing the quantized input. To validate our approach, we synthesize the self-attention module of ViT on a systolic array-based hardware. Experimental results show that our low-bit inference reduces per-PE power consumption for linear layer and matrix multiplication, bridging the gap between quantized models and efficient inference.</description>

      <title>Foundations of Safe Online Reinforcement Learning in the Linear Quadratic Regulator: $\sqrt{T}$-Regret</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how to efficiently learn while adhering to safety constraints is essential for using online reinforcement learning in practical applications. However, proving rigorous regret bounds for safety-constrained reinforcement learning is difficult due to the complex interaction between safety, exploration, and exploitation. In this work, we seek to establish foundations for safety-constrained reinforcement learning by studying the canonical problem of controlling a one-dimensional linear dynamical system with unknown dynamics. We study the safety-constrained version of this problem, where the state must with high probability stay within a safe region, and we provide the first safe algorithm that achieves regret of $\tilde{O}_T(\sqrt{T})$. Furthermore, the regret is with respect to the baseline of truncated linear controllers, a natural baseline of non-linear controllers that are well-suited for safety-constrained linear systems. In addition to introducing this new baseline, we also prove several desirable continuity properties of the optimal controller in this baseline. In showing our main result, we prove that whenever the constraints impact the optimal controller, the non-linearity of our controller class leads to a faster rate of learning than in the unconstrained setting.</description>

      <title>Learning-Based Modeling of Soft Actuators Using Euler Spiral-Inspired Curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Soft robots, distinguished by their inherent compliance and continuum structures, present unique modeling challenges, especially when subjected to significant external loads such as gravity and payloads. In this study, we introduce an innovative data-driven modeling framework leveraging an Euler spiral-inspired shape representations to accurately describe the complex shapes of soft continuum actuators. Based on this representation, we develop neural network-based forward and inverse models to effectively capture the nonlinear behavior of a fiber-reinforced pneumatic bending actuator. Our forward model accurately predicts the actuator's deformation given inputs of pressure and payload, while the inverse model reliably estimates payloads from observed actuator shapes and known pressure inputs. Comprehensive experimental validation demonstrates the effectiveness and accuracy of our proposed approach. Notably, the augmented Euler spiral-based forward model achieves low average positional prediction errors of 3.38%, 2.19%, and 1.93% of the actuator length at the one-third, two-thirds, and tip positions, respectively. Furthermore, the inverse model demonstrates precision of estimating payloads with an average error as low as 0.72% across the tested range. These results underscore the potential of our method to significantly enhance the accuracy and predictive capabilities of modeling frameworks for soft robotic systems.</description>

      <title>Certifiably-Correct Mapping for Safe Navigation Despite Odometry Drift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate perception, state estimation and mapping are essential for safe robotic navigation as planners and controllers rely on these components for safety-critical decisions. However, existing mapping approaches often assume perfect pose estimates, an unrealistic assumption that can lead to incorrect obstacle maps and therefore collisions. This paper introduces a framework for certifiably-correct mapping that ensures that the obstacle map correctly classifies obstacle-free regions despite the odometry drift in vision-based localization systems (VIO}/SLAM). By deflating the safe region based on the incremental odometry error at each timestep, we ensure that the map remains accurate and reliable locally around the robot, even as the overall odometry error with respect to the inertial frame grows unbounded.
  Our contributions include two approaches to modify popular obstacle mapping paradigms, (I) Safe Flight Corridors, and (II) Signed Distance Fields. We formally prove the correctness of both methods, and describe how they integrate with existing planning and control modules. Simulations using the Replica dataset highlight the efficacy of our methods compared to state-of-the-art techniques. Real-world experiments with a robotic rover show that, while baseline methods result in collisions with previously mapped obstacles, the proposed framework enables the rover to safely stop before potential collisions.</description>

      <title>Diffeomorphic Obstacle Avoidance for Contractive Dynamical Systems via Implicit Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensuring safety and robustness of robot skills is becoming crucial as robots are required to perform increasingly complex and dynamic tasks. The former is essential when performing tasks in cluttered environments, while the latter is relevant to overcome unseen task situations. This paper addresses the challenge of ensuring both safety and robustness in dynamic robot skills learned from demonstrations. Specifically, we build on neural contractive dynamical systems to provide robust extrapolation of the learned skills, while designing a full-body obstacle avoidance strategy that preserves contraction stability via diffeomorphic transforms. This is particularly crucial in complex environments where implicit scene representations, such as Signed Distance Fields (SDFs), are necessary. To this end, our framework called Signed Distance Field Diffeomorphic Transform, leverages SDFs and flow-based diffeomorphisms to achieve contraction-preserving obstacle avoidance. We thoroughly evaluate our framework on synthetic datasets and several real-world robotic tasks in a kitchen environment. Our results show that our approach locally adapts the learned contractive vector field while staying close to the learned dynamics and without introducing highly-curved motion paths, thus outperforming several state-of-the-art methods.</description>

Abstract: Underwater gliders offer effective means in oceanic surveys with a major task in reconstructing the three-dimensional hydrographic field of a mesoscale eddy. This paper considers three key issues in the hydrographic reconstruction of mesoscale eddies with the sampled data from the underwater gliders. It first proposes using the Thin Plate Spline (TPS) as the interpolation method for the reconstruction with a blocking scheme to speed up the computation. It then formulates a procedure for selecting glider path design that minimizes the reconstruction errors among a set of pathway formations. Finally we provide a glider path control procedure to guide the glider to follow to designed pathways as much as possible in the presence of ocean current. A set of optimization algorithms are experimented and several with robust glider control performance on a simulated eddy are identified.</description>

      <title>Asynchronous Push-sum Dual Gradient Algorithm in Distributed Model Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the distributed model predictive control (DMPC) problem for distributed discrete-time linear systems with both local and global constraints over directed communication networks. We establish an optimization problem to formulate the DMPC policy, including the design of terminal ingredients. To cope with the global constraint, we transform the primal optimization problem into its dual problem. Then, we propose a novel asynchronous push-sum dual gradient (APDG) algorithm with an adaptive step-size scheme to solve this dual problem in a fully asynchronous distributed manner. The proposed algorithm does not require synchronous waiting and any form of coordination, which greatly improves solving efficiency. We theoretically prove that the APDG algorithm converges at an R-linear rate as long as the step-size does not exceed the designed upper bound. Furthermore, we develop a distributed termination criterion to terminate the APDG algorithm when its output solution satisfies the specified suboptimality and the global constraint, thereby avoiding an infinite number of iterations. The recursive feasibility and the stability of the closed-loop system are also established. Finally, a numerical example clarifies and validates theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>A Kinematic and Kinetic Dataset of Lower Limb Joints During Obstacle Crossing in Healthy Adults</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Crossing obstacles is a critical component of daily walking, especially for individuals with lower limb amputations, where the challenge and fall risk are heightened. While previous studies have examined obstacle crossing, they lack a systematic analysis of kinematic and kinetic changes in lower limb joints across the entire gait cycle when crossing obstacles of varying heights. This study develops a dataset of healthy individuals crossing obstacles and systematically analyzes the kinematics and kinetics of lower limb joints at different obstacle heights. Ten healthy adults participated in the experiment, crossing obstacles of varying heights (7.5 cm, 15 cm, 22.5 cm, and 30 cm), with biomechanical data including joint angles and torques of the hip, knee, and ankle recorded. As obstacle height increased, the proportion of the swing phase in the gait cycle significantly increased; the hip joint angle increased by approximately 1.5 times, and the knee joint angle increased by about 1.0 times. Both joints also exhibited significant increases in torque. In contrast, minimal changes were observed at the ankle joint, with torque remaining stable. Additionally, noticeable differences in the kinematics and kinetics between the dominant and non-dominant foot were observed, highlighting functional asymmetry. The dominant foot exhibited greater joint angles in the hip and knee joints, and less variation in the ankle joint compared to the non-dominant foot, demonstrating more coordinated movement. This detailed analysis of gait adjustments during obstacle crossing provides valuable insights into biomechanical changes in lower limb joints.</description>

      <title>Robust Nash equilibrium seeking based on semi-Markov switching topologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates a distributed robust Nash Equilibrium (NE) seeking problem in fluctuating environments. Specifically, the players, subject to the second-order dynamics, are considered to be influenced by external disturbances and uncertain dynamics while communicating via semi-Markov switching topologies. In such constantly changing network circumstances, the existence of disturbances and uncertain dynamics may directly affect the performance of most existing NE seeking algorithms. Moreover, the semi-Markov switching topologies may cause communication uncertainty, which are considered in NE seeking for the first time. To accommodate the above concerns, the following targets require to be reached simultaneously: (1) Disturbances and uncertain dynamics rejection in finite time; (2) Distributed estimation on unknown information required for players' cost functions; (3) A reasonable estimation consensus protocol under semi-Markov switching; (4) NE seeking for the second-order players. By combining supertwisting-based Integral Sliding-Mode Control (ISMC) with average consensus tracking, a novel robust NE seeking algorithm is constructed, incorporating an effective leader-follower consensus protocol. Furthermore, to lessen dispensable information transmission, a sampled-data-based event-triggered mechanism is introduced. Incorporating the advantages of both semi-Markov switching and event-triggered mechanism, another NE seeking algorithm is proposed. Through designing an appropriate Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, it is shown that the leader-follower consensus can be achieved in the mean-square sense under event-triggered mechanism. Finally, a connectivity control game is formulated to illustrate the validity of the designed algorithms.</description>

      <title>Robotic Trail Maker Platform for Rehabilitation in Neurological Conditions: Clinical Use Cases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Patients with neurological conditions require rehabilitation to restore their motor, visual, and cognitive abilities. To meet the shortage of therapists and reduce their workload, a robotic rehabilitation platform involving the clinical trail making test is proposed. Therapists can create custom trails for each patient and the patient can trace the trails using a robotic device. The platform can track the performance of the patient and use these data to provide dynamic assistance through the robot to the patient interface. Therefore, the proposed platform not only functions as an evaluation platform, but also trains the patient in recovery. The developed platform has been validated at a rehabilitation center, with therapists and patients operating the device. It was found that patients performed poorly while using the platform compared to healthy subjects and that the assistance provided also improved performance amongst patients. Statistical analysis demonstrated that the speed of the patients was significantly enhanced with the robotic assistance. Further, neural networks are trained to classify between patients and healthy subjects and to forecast their movements using the data collected.</description>

      <title>Efficient COLREGs-Compliant Collision Avoidance using Turning Circle-based Control Barrier Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a computationally efficient collision avoidance algorithm using turning circle-based control barrier functions (CBFs) that comply with international regulations for preventing collisions at sea (COLREGs). Conventional CBFs often lack explicit consideration of turning capabilities and avoidance direction, which are key elements in developing a COLREGs-compliant collision avoidance algorithm. To overcome these limitations, we introduce two CBFs derived from left and right turning circles. These functions establish safety conditions based on the proximity between the traffic ships and the centers of the turning circles, effectively determining both avoidance directions and turning capabilities. The proposed method formulates a quadratic programming problem with the CBFs as constraints, ensuring safe navigation without relying on computationally intensive trajectory optimization. This approach significantly reduces computational effort while maintaining performance comparable to model predictive control-based methods. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in enabling COLREGs-compliant, safe navigation, demonstrating its potential for reliable and efficient operation in complex maritime environments.</description>

      <title>Unscented Particle Filter for Visual-inertial Navigation using IMU and Landmark Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a geometric Quaternion-based Unscented Particle Filter for Visual-Inertial Navigation (QUPF-VIN) specifically designed for a vehicle operating with six degrees of freedom (6 DoF). The proposed QUPF-VIN technique is quaternion-based capturing the inherently nonlinear nature of true navigation kinematics. The filter fuses data from a low-cost inertial measurement unit (IMU) and landmark observations obtained via a vision sensor. The QUPF-VIN is implemented in discrete form to ensure seamless integration with onboard inertial sensing systems. Designed for robustness in GPS-denied environments, the proposed method has been validated through experiments with real-world dataset involving an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) equipped with a 6-axis IMU and a stereo camera, operating with 6 DoF. The numerical results demonstrate that the QUPF-VIN provides superior tracking accuracy compared to ground truth data. Additionally, a comparative analysis with a standard Kalman filter-based navigation technique further highlights the enhanced performance of the QUPF-VIN.</description>

      <title>Synthesis of Discrete-time Control Barrier Functions for Polynomial Systems Based on Sum-of-Squares Programming</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19330v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discrete-time Control Barrier Functions (DTCBFs) are commonly utilized in the literature as a powerful tool for synthesizing control policies that guarantee safety of discrete-time dynamical systems. However, the systematic synthesis of DTCBFs in a computationally efficient way is at present an important open problem. This article first proposes a novel alternating-descent approach based on Sum-of-Squares programming to synthesize quadratic DTCBFs and corresponding polynomial control policies for discrete-time control-affine polynomial systems with input constraints and semi-algebraic safe sets. Subsequently, two distinct approaches are introduced to extend the proposed method to the synthesis of higher-degree polynomial DTCBFs. To demonstrate its efficacy, we apply the proposed method to numerical case studies.</description>

      <title>$O(1/k)$ Finite-Time Bound for Non-Linear Two-Time-Scale Stochastic Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-time-scale stochastic approximation is an algorithm with coupled iterations which has found broad applications in reinforcement learning, optimization and game control. While several prior works have obtained a mean square error bound of $O(1/k)$ for linear two-time-scale iterations, the best known bound in the non-linear contractive setting has been $O(1/k^{2/3})$. In this work, we obtain an improved bound of $O(1/k)$ for non-linear two-time-scale stochastic approximation. Our result applies to algorithms such as gradient descent-ascent and two-time-scale Lagrangian optimization. The key step in our analysis involves rewriting the original iteration in terms of an averaged noise sequence which decays sufficiently fast. Additionally, we use an induction-based approach to show that the iterates are bounded in expectation.</description>

      <title>HyperController: A Hyperparameter Controller for Fast and Stable Training of Reinforcement Learning Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Hyperparameter Controller (HyperController), a computationally efficient algorithm for hyperparameter optimization during training of reinforcement learning neural networks. HyperController optimizes hyperparameters quickly while also maintaining improvement of the reinforcement learning neural network, resulting in faster training and deployment. It achieves this by modeling the hyperparameter optimization problem as an unknown Linear Gaussian Dynamical System, which is a system with a state that linearly changes. It then learns an efficient representation of the hyperparameter objective function using the Kalman filter, which is the optimal one-step predictor for a Linear Gaussian Dynamical System. To demonstrate the performance of HyperController, it is applied as a hyperparameter optimizer during training of reinforcement learning neural networks on a variety of OpenAI Gymnasium environments. In four out of the five Gymnasium environments, HyperController achieves highest median reward during evaluation compared to other algorithms. The results exhibit the potential of HyperController for efficient and stable training of reinforcement learning neural networks.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, a constrained parameter update law is derived in the context of adaptive control. The parameter update law is based on constrained optimization technique where a Lagrangian is formulated to incorporate the constraints on the parameters using inverse Barrier function. The constrained parameter update law is used to develop a adaptive tracking controller and the overall stability of the adaptive controller along with the constrained parameter update law is shown using Lyapunov analysis and development in stability of constrained primal-dual dynamics. The performance of the constrained parameter update law is tested in simulation for keeping the parameters within constraints and convergence to true parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper extends sliding-mode control theory to nonlinear systems evolving on smooth manifolds. Building on differential geometric methods, we reformulate Filippov's notion of solutions, characterize well-defined vector fields on quotient spaces, and provide a consistent geometric definition of higher-order sliding modes. We generalize the regular form to non-Euclidean settings and design explicit first- and second-order sliding-mode controllers that respect the manifold structure. Particular attention is given to the role of topological obstructions, which are illustrated through examples on the cylinder, M\"obius bundle, and 2-sphere. Our results highlight how geometric and topological properties fundamentally influence sliding dynamics and suggest new directions for robust control in nonlinear spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a nonlinear control affine system controlled by inputs generated by a quadratic program (QP) induced by a control barrier functions (CBF). Specifically, we slightly modify the condition satisfied by CBFs and study how the modification can positively impact the closed loop behavior of the system. We show that, QP-based controllers designed using the modified CBF condition preserves the desired properties of QP-based controllers using standard CBF conditions. Furthermore, using the generalized S-procedure for polynomial functions, we formulate the design of the modified CBFs as a Sum-Of-Squares (SOS) program, which can be solved efficiently. Via a numerical example, the proposed CBF design is shown to have superior performance over the standard CBF widely used in existing literature.</description>

      <title>Automated Generation of Precedence Graphs in Digital Value Chains for Automotive Production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study examines the digital value chain in automotive manufacturing, focusing on the identification, software flashing, customization, and commissioning of electronic control units in vehicle networks. A novel precedence graph design is proposed to optimize this process chain using an automated scheduling algorithm that employs mixed integer linear programming techniques. The results show significant improvements in key metrics. The algorithm reduces the number of production stations equipped with expensive hardware and software to execute digital value chain processes, while increasing capacity utilization through efficient scheduling and reduced idle time. Task parallelization is optimized, resulting in streamlined workflows and increased throughput. Compared to the traditional method, the automated approach has reduced preparation time by 50% and reduced scheduling activities, as it now takes two minutes to create the precedence graph. The flexibility of the algorithm's constraints allows for vehicle-specific configurations while maintaining high responsiveness, eliminating backup stations and facilitating the integration of new topologies. Automated scheduling significantly outperforms manual methods in efficiency, functionality, and adaptability.</description>

      <title>Feelbert: A Feedback Linearization-based Embedded Real-Time Quadrupedal Locomotion Framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19965v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quadruped robots have become quite popular for their ability to adapt their locomotion to generic uneven terrains. For this reason, over time, several frameworks for quadrupedal locomotion have been proposed, but with little attention to ensuring a predictable timing behavior of the controller.
  To address this issue, this work presents Feelbert, a modular control framework for quadrupedal locomotion suitable for execution on an embedded system under hard real-time execution constraints. It leverages the feedback linearization control technique to obtain a closed-form control law for the body, valid for all configurations of the robot. The control law was derived after defining an appropriate rigid body model that uses the accelerations of the feet as control variables, instead of the estimated contact forces. This work also provides a novel algorithm to compute footholds and gait temporal parameters using the concept of imaginary wheels, and a heuristic algorithm to select the best gait schedule for the current velocity commands.
  The proposed framework is developed entirely in C++, with no dependencies on third-party libraries and no dynamic memory allocation, to ensure predictability and real-time performance. Its implementation allows Feelbert to be both compiled and executed on an embedded system for critical applications, as well as integrated into larger systems such as Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2). For this reason, Feelbert has been tested in both scenarios, demonstrating satisfactory results both in terms of reference tracking and temporal predictability, whether integrated into ROS 2 or compiled as a standalone application on a Raspberry Pi 5.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.01808v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Incompatibility between patient and donor is a major barrier in kidney transplantation (KT). The increasing shortage of kidney donors has driven the development of desensitization techniques to overcome this immunological challenge. Compared with compatible KT, patients undergoing incompatible KTs are more likely to experience rejection, infection, malignancy, and graft loss. We study the optimal acceptance of possibly incompatible kidneys for individual end-stage kidney disease patients. To capture the effect of incompatibility, we propose a Markov Decision Process (MDP) model that explicitly includes compatibility as a state variable. The resulting higher-dimensional model makes it more challenging to analyze, but under suitable conditions, we derive structural properties including control limit-type optimal policies that are easy to compute and implement. Numerical examples illustrate the behavior of the optimal policy under different mismatch levels and highlight the importance of explicitly incorporating the incompatibility level into the acceptance decision when desensitization therapy is an option.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01804v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the problem of controlling the density of a large ensemble of follower agents by acting on a group of leader agents that interact with them. Using coupled partial integro-differential equations to describe leader and follower density dynamics, we establish feasibility conditions and develop two control architectures ensuring global stability. The first employs feed-forward control on the followers' and a feedback on the leaders' density. The second implements a dual feedback loop through a reference-governor that adapts the leaders' density based on both populations' measurements. Our methods, initially developed in a one-dimensional setting, are extended to multi-dimensional cases, and validated through numerical simulations for representative control applications, both for groups of infinite and finite size.</description>

Abstract: Efficiently estimating system dynamics from data is essential for minimizing data collection costs and improving model performance. This work addresses the challenge of designing future control inputs to maximize information gain, thereby improving the efficiency of the system identification process. We propose an approach that integrates informative input design into the Dynamic Mode Decomposition with control (DMDc) framework, which is well-suited for high-dimensional systems. By formulating an approximate convex optimization problem that minimizes the trace of the estimation error covariance matrix, we are able to efficiently reduce uncertainty in the model parameters while respecting constraints on the system states and control inputs. This method outperforms traditional techniques like Pseudo-Random Binary Sequences (PRBS) and orthogonal multisines, which do not adapt to the current system model and often gather redundant information. We validate our approach using aircraft and fluid dynamics simulations to demonstrate the practical applicability and effectiveness of our method. Our results show that strategically planning control inputs based on the current model enhances the accuracy of system identification while requiring less data. Furthermore, we provide our implementation and simulation interfaces as an open-source software package, facilitating further research development and use by industry practitioners.</description>

      <title>Temporal Logic Control for Nonlinear Stochastic Systems Under Unknown Disturbances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11343v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel framework to synthesize robust strategies for discrete-time nonlinear systems with random disturbances that are unknown, against temporal logic specifications. The proposed framework is data-driven and abstraction-based: leveraging observations of the system, our approach learns a high-confidence abstraction of the system in the form of an uncertain Markov decision process (UMDP). The uncertainty in the resulting UMDP is used to formally account for both the error in abstracting the system and for the uncertainty coming from the data. Critically, we show that for any given state-action pair in the resulting UMDP, the uncertainty in the transition probabilities can be represented as a convex polytope obtained by a two-layer state discretization and concentration inequalities. This allows us to obtain tighter uncertainty estimates compared to existing approaches, and guarantees efficiency, as we tailor a synthesis algorithm exploiting the structure of this UMDP. We empirically validate our approach on several case studies, showing substantially improved performance compared to the state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty-Aware Digital Twins: Robust Model Predictive Control using Time-Series Deep Quantile Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10337v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Digital Twins, virtual replicas of physical systems that enable real-time monitoring, model updates, predictions, and decision-making, present novel avenues for proactive control strategies for autonomous systems. However, achieving real-time decision-making in Digital Twins considering uncertainty necessitates an efficient uncertainty quantification (UQ) approach and optimization driven by accurate predictions of system behaviors, which remains a challenge for learning-based methods. This paper presents a simultaneous multi-step robust model predictive control (MPC) framework that incorporates real-time decision-making with uncertainty awareness for Digital Twin systems. Leveraging a multistep ahead predictor named Time-Series Dense Encoder (TiDE) as the surrogate model, this framework differs from conventional MPC models that provide only one-step ahead predictions. In contrast, TiDE can predict future states within the prediction horizon in a one-shot, significantly accelerating MPC. Furthermore, quantile regression is employed with the training of TiDE to perform flexible while computationally efficient UQ on data uncertainty. Consequently, with the deep learning quantiles, the robust MPC problem is formulated into a deterministic optimization problem and provides a safety buffer that accommodates disturbances to enhance constraint satisfaction rate. As a result, the proposed method outperforms existing robust MPC methods by providing less-conservative UQ and has demonstrated efficacy in an engineering case study involving Directed Energy Deposition (DED) additive manufacturing. This proactive while uncertainty-aware control capability positions the proposed method as a potent tool for future Digital Twin applications and real-time process control in engineering systems.</description>

      <title>Sampled-Data Control using Hermite-Obreschkoff Methods with an IDA-PBC Example</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11495v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The motivation for this paper is the implementation of nonlinear state feedback control, designed based on the continuous-time plant model, in a sampled control loop under relatively slow sampling. In previous work we have shown that using one-step predictions of the target dynamics with higher order integration schemes, together with possibly higher order input shaping, is a simple and effective way to increase the feasible sampling times until performance degradation and instability occur. In this contribution we present a unifying derivation for arbitrary orders of the previously used Lobatto IIIA collocation and Hermite interpolation schemes through the Hermite-Obreschkoff formula. We derive, moreover, an IDA-PBC controller for a magnetic levitation system, which requires a non-constant target interconnection matrix, and show experimental results.</description>

      <title>Compression and Distillation of Data Quadruplets in Non-intrusive Reduced-order Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16683v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a quadrature-free, data-driven approach to balanced truncation for both continuous-time and discrete-time systems. The method non-intrusively constructs reduced-order models using available transfer function samples from the right half of the $s$-plane. It is highlighted that the proposed data-driven balanced truncation and existing quadrature-based balanced truncation algorithms share a common feature: both compress their respective data quadruplets to derive reduced-order models. Additionally, it is demonstrated that by using different compression strategies, these quadruplets can be utilized to develop three data-driven formulations of the IRKA for both continuous-time and discrete-time systems. These formulations non-intrusively generate reduced models using transfer function samples from the $j\omega$-axis or the right half of the $s$-plane, or impulse response samples. Notably, these IRKA formulations eliminate the necessity of computing new transfer function samples as IRKA iteratively updates the interpolation points. The efficacy of the proposed algorithms is validated through numerical examples, which show that the proposed data-driven approaches perform comparably to their intrusive counterparts.</description>

      <title>Inversion-free feed-forward and feedback control of MSM based actuator with large non-smooth input hysteresis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18444v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dynamic systems with a large and non-smooth hysteresis in the feedforward channel challenge the design of feedback control since the instantaneous input gain is varying during the operation, in the worst case between zero and infinity. Magnetic shape memory (MSM) actuators with multi-stable transitions represent such untypical system plant with only the output displacement being measured. This paper provides a case study of designing the feedforward and feedback control system for an MSM-based actuator setup with a fairly high level of the output sensing noise. First, the recently introduced inversion-free feedforward hysteresis compensator is adapted for the Krasnoselskii-Pokrovskii operator model. Then, a robust feedback proportional-integral (PI) loop shaping is performed, while taking into account the lagging behavior of the low-pass filtering and system uncertainties. Experimental results show that the parallel action of feedforward and feedback parts improves the overall performance of position control.</description>

      <title>Learning from Disengagements: An Analysis of Safety Driver Interventions during Remote Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00246v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates disengagements of Remote Driving Systems (RDS) based on interventions by an in-vehicle Safety Drivers (SD) in real-world Operational Design Domains (ODD) with a focus on Remote Driver (RD) performance during their driving training. Based on an analysis of over 14,000 km on remote driving data, the relationship between the driving experience of 25 RD and the frequency of disengagements is systematically investigated. The results show that the number of SD interventions decreases significantly within the first 400 km of driving experience, which illustrates a clear learning curve of the RD. In addition, the most common causes for 183 disengagements analyzed are identified and categorized, whereby four main scenarios for SD interventions were identified and illustrated. The results emphasize the need for experience-based and targeted training programs aimed at developing basic driving skills early on, thereby increasing the safety, controllability and efficiency of RDS, especially in complex urban environment ODDs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11125v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a method for representing the closed-loop dynamics of piecewise affine (PWA) systems with bounded additive disturbances and neural network-based controllers as mixed-integer (MI) linear constraints. We show that such representations enable the computation of robustly positively invariant (RPI) sets for the specified system class by solving MI linear programs. These RPI sets can subsequently be used to certify stability and constraint satisfaction. Furthermore, the approach allows to handle non-linear systems based on suitable PWA approximations and corresponding error bounds, which can be interpreted as the bounded disturbances from above.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Trust and Resilience in Distributed Consensus for Cyberphysical Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2103.05464v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work considers the problem of resilient consensus where stochastic values of trust between agents are available. Specifically, we derive a unified mathematical framework to characterize convergence, deviation of the consensus from the true consensus value, and expected convergence rate, when there exists additional information of trust between agents. We show that under certain conditions on the stochastic trust values and consensus protocol: 1) almost sure convergence to a common limit value is possible even when malicious agents constitute more than half of the network connectivity, 2) the deviation of the converged limit, from the case where there is no attack, i.e., the true consensus value, can be bounded with probability that approaches 1 exponentially, and 3) correct classification of malicious and legitimate agents can be attained in finite time almost surely. Further, the expected convergence rate decays exponentially as a function of the quality of the trust observations between agents.</description>

Abstract: The work studies the problem of decentralized constrained POMDPs in a team-setting where multiple nonstrategic agents have asymmetric information. Using an extension of Sion's Minimax theorem for functions with positive infinity and results on weak-convergence of measures, strong duality is established for the setting of infinite-horizon expected total discounted costs when the observations lie in a countable space, the actions are chosen from a finite space, the constraint costs are bounded, and the objective cost is bounded from below.</description>

      <title>Think Deep and Fast: Learning Neural Nonlinear Opinion Dynamics from Inverse Dynamic Games for Split-Second Interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09810v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-cooperative interactions commonly occur in multi-agent scenarios such as car racing, where an ego vehicle can choose to overtake the rival, or stay behind it until a safe overtaking "corridor" opens. While an expert human can do well at making such time-sensitive decisions, autonomous agents are incapable of rapidly reasoning about complex, potentially conflicting options, leading to suboptimal behaviors such as deadlocks. Recently, the nonlinear opinion dynamics (NOD) model has proven to exhibit fast opinion formation and avoidance of decision deadlocks. However, NOD modeling parameters are oftentimes assumed fixed, limiting their applicability in complex and dynamic environments. It remains an open challenge to determine such parameters automatically and adaptively, accounting for the ever-changing environment. In this work, we propose for the first time a learning-based and game-theoretic approach to synthesize a Neural NOD model from expert demonstrations, given as a dataset containing (possibly incomplete) state and action trajectories of interacting agents. We demonstrate Neural NOD's ability to make fast and deadlock-free decisions in a simulated autonomous racing example. We find that Neural NOD consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art data-driven inverse game baseline in terms of safety and overtaking performance.</description>

      <title>A Novel Massive Random Access in Cell-Free Massive MIMO Systems for High-Speed Mobility with OTFS Modulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01111v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the research of next-generation wireless communication technologies, orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation is emerging as a promising technique for high-speed mobile environments due to its superior efficiency and robustness in doubly selective channels. Additionally, the cell-free architecture, which eliminates the issues associated with cell boundaries, offers broader coverage for radio access networks. By combining cell-free network architecture with OTFS modulation, the system may meet the demands of massive random access required by machine-type communication devices in high-speed scenarios. This paper explores a massive random access scheme based on OTFS modulation within a cell-free architecture. A transceiver model for uplink OTFS signals involving multiple access points (APs) is developed, where channel estimation with fractional channel parameters is approximated as a block sparse matrix recovery problem. Building on existing superimposed and embedded preamble schemes, a hybrid preamble scheme is proposed. This scheme leverages superimposed and embedded preambles to respectively achieve rough and accurate active user equipment (UEs) detection (AUD), as well as precise channel estimation, under the condition of supporting a large number of access UEs. Moreover, this study introduces a generalized approximate message passing and pattern coupling sparse Bayesian learning with Laplacian prior (GAMP-PCSBL-La) algorithm, which effectively captures block sparse features after discrete cosine transform (DCT), delivering precise estimation results with reduced computational complexity. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme is effective and provides superior performance compared to other existing schemes.</description>

Abstract: While robust optimal control theory provides a rigorous framework to compute robot control policies that are provably safe, it struggles to scale to high-dimensional problems, leading to increased use of deep learning for tractable synthesis of robot safety. Unfortunately, existing neural safety synthesis methods often lack convergence guarantees and solution interpretability. In this paper, we present Minimax Actors Guided by Implicit Critic Stackelberg (MAGICS), a novel adversarial reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm that guarantees local convergence to a minimax equilibrium solution. We then build on this approach to provide local convergence guarantees for a general deep RL-based robot safety synthesis algorithm. Through both simulation studies on OpenAI Gym environments and hardware experiments with a 36-dimensional quadruped robot, we show that MAGICS can yield robust control policies outperforming the state-of-the-art neural safety synthesis methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02033v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As the dimension of a system increases, traditional methods for control and differential games rapidly become intractable, making the design of safe autonomous agents challenging in complex or team settings. Deep-learning approaches avoid discretization and yield numerous successes in robotics and autonomy, but at a higher dimensional limit, accuracy falls as sampling becomes less efficient. We propose using rapidly generated linear solutions to the partial differential equation (PDE) arising in the problem to accelerate and improve learned value functions for guidance in high-dimensional, nonlinear problems. We define two programs that combine supervision of the linear solution with a standard PDE loss. We demonstrate that these programs offer improvements in speed and accuracy in both a 50-D differential game problem and a 10-D quadrotor control problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06662v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper considers the discrete-time, stochastic LQR problem with $p$ steps of disturbance preview information where $p$ is finite. We first derive the solution for this problem on a finite horizon with linear, time-varying dynamics and time-varying costs. Next, we derive the solution on the infinite horizon with linear, time-invariant dynamics and time-invariant costs. Our proofs rely on the well-known principle of optimality. We provide an independent proof for the principle of optimality that relies only on nested information structure. Finally, we show that the finite preview controller converges to the optimal noncausal controller as the preview horizon $p$ tends to infinity. We also provide a simple example to illustrate both the finite and infinite horizon results.</description>

      <title>Neuro-LIFT: A Neuromorphic, LLM-based Interactive Framework for Autonomous Drone FlighT at the Edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19259v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The integration of human-intuitive interactions into autonomous systems has been limited. Traditional Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems struggle with context and intent understanding, severely restricting human-robot interaction. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed this dynamic, allowing for intuitive and high-level communication through speech and text, and bridging the gap between human commands and robotic actions. Additionally, autonomous navigation has emerged as a central focus in robotics research, with artificial intelligence (AI) increasingly being leveraged to enhance these systems. However, existing AI-based navigation algorithms face significant challenges in latency-critical tasks where rapid decision-making is critical. Traditional frame-based vision systems, while effective for high-level decision-making, suffer from high energy consumption and latency, limiting their applicability in real-time scenarios. Neuromorphic vision systems, combining event-based cameras and spiking neural networks (SNNs), offer a promising alternative by enabling energy-efficient, low-latency navigation. Despite their potential, real-world implementations of these systems, particularly on physical platforms such as drones, remain scarce. In this work, we present Neuro-LIFT, a real-time neuromorphic navigation framework implemented on a Parrot Bebop2 quadrotor. Leveraging an LLM for natural language processing, Neuro-LIFT translates human speech into high-level planning commands which are then autonomously executed using event-based neuromorphic vision and physics-driven planning. Our framework demonstrates its capabilities in navigating in a dynamic environment, avoiding obstacles, and adapting to human instructions in real-time.</description>

      <title>ASAP: Aligning Simulation and Real-World Physics for Learning Agile Humanoid Whole-Body Skills</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01143v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Humanoid robots hold the potential for unparalleled versatility in performing human-like, whole-body skills. However, achieving agile and coordinated whole-body motions remains a significant challenge due to the dynamics mismatch between simulation and the real world. Existing approaches, such as system identification (SysID) and domain randomization (DR) methods, often rely on labor-intensive parameter tuning or result in overly conservative policies that sacrifice agility. In this paper, we present ASAP (Aligning Simulation and Real-World Physics), a two-stage framework designed to tackle the dynamics mismatch and enable agile humanoid whole-body skills. In the first stage, we pre-train motion tracking policies in simulation using retargeted human motion data. In the second stage, we deploy the policies in the real world and collect real-world data to train a delta (residual) action model that compensates for the dynamics mismatch. Then, ASAP fine-tunes pre-trained policies with the delta action model integrated into the simulator to align effectively with real-world dynamics. We evaluate ASAP across three transfer scenarios: IsaacGym to IsaacSim, IsaacGym to Genesis, and IsaacGym to the real-world Unitree G1 humanoid robot. Our approach significantly improves agility and whole-body coordination across various dynamic motions, reducing tracking error compared to SysID, DR, and delta dynamics learning baselines. ASAP enables highly agile motions that were previously difficult to achieve, demonstrating the potential of delta action learning in bridging simulation and real-world dynamics. These results suggest a promising sim-to-real direction for developing more expressive and agile humanoids.</description>

      <title>Gait-Net-augmented Implicit Kino-dynamic MPC for Dynamic Variable-frequency Humanoid Locomotion over Discrete Terrains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02934v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reduced-order-based optimal control techniques for humanoid locomotion struggle to adapt step duration and placement simultaneously in dynamic walking gaits due to their reliance on fixed-time discretization, which limits responsiveness to various disturbances and results in suboptimal performance in challenging conditions. In this work, we propose a Gait-Net-augmented implicit kino-dynamic model-predictive control (MPC) to simultaneously optimize step location, step duration, and contact forces for natural variable-frequency locomotion. The proposed method incorporates a Gait-Net-augmented Sequential Convex MPC algorithm to solve multi-linearly constrained variables by iterative quadratic programs. At its core, a lightweight Gait-frequency Network (Gait-Net) determines the preferred step duration in terms of variable MPC sampling times, simplifying step duration optimization to the parameter level. Additionally, it enhances and updates the spatial reference trajectory within each sequential iteration by incorporating local solutions, allowing the projection of kinematic constraints to the design of reference trajectories. We validate the proposed algorithm in high-fidelity simulations and on small-size humanoid hardware, demonstrating its capability for variable-frequency and 3-D discrete terrain locomotion with only a one-step preview of terrain data.</description>

      <title>Flat-Top Beamforming with Efficient Array-Fed RIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08490v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Flat-top beam designs are essential for uniform power distribution over a wide angular sector for applications such as 5G/6G networks, beaconing, satellite communications, radar systems, etc. Low sidelobe levels with steep transitions allow negligible cross sector illumination. Active array designs requiring amplitude taper suffer from poor power amplifier utilization. Phase only designs, e.g., Zadoff-Chu or generalized step chirp polyphase sequence methods, often require large active antenna arrays which in turns increases the hardware complexity and reduces the energy efficiency. In our recently proposed novel array-fed reflective intelligent surface (RIS) architecture, the small ($2 \times 2$) active array has uniform (principal eigenmode) amplitude weighting. We now present a pragmatic flat-top pattern design method for practical array (RIS) sizes, which outperforms current state-of-the-art in terms of design superiority, energy efficiency, and deployment feasibility. This novel design holds promise for advancing sustainable wireless technologies in next-generation communication systems, including applications such as beaconing, broadcast signaling, and hierarchical beamforming, while mitigating the environmental impact of high-energy antenna arrays.</description>

      <title>DDAT: Diffusion Policies Enforcing Dynamically Admissible Robot Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15043v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models excel at creating images and videos thanks to their multimodal generative capabilities. These same capabilities have made diffusion models increasingly popular in robotics research, where they are used for generating robot motion. However, the stochastic nature of diffusion models is fundamentally at odds with the precise dynamical equations describing the feasible motion of robots. Hence, generating dynamically admissible robot trajectories is a challenge for diffusion models. To alleviate this issue, we introduce DDAT: Diffusion policies for Dynamically Admissible Trajectories to generate provably admissible trajectories of black-box robotic systems using diffusion models. A sequence of states is a dynamically admissible trajectory if each state of the sequence belongs to the reachable set of its predecessor by the robot's equations of motion. To generate such trajectories, our diffusion policies project their predictions onto a dynamically admissible manifold during both training and inference to align the objective of the denoiser neural network with the dynamical admissibility constraint. The auto-regressive nature of these projections along with the black-box nature of robot dynamics render these projections immensely challenging. We thus enforce admissibility by iteratively sampling a polytopic under-approximation of the reachable set of a state onto which we project its predicted successor, before iterating this process with the projected successor. By producing accurate trajectories, this projection eliminates the need for diffusion models to continually replan, enabling one-shot long-horizon trajectory planning. We demonstrate that our framework generates higher quality dynamically admissible robot trajectories through extensive simulations on a quadcopter and various MuJoCo environments, along with real-world experiments on a Unitree GO1 and GO2.</description>

      <title>Distributed and Localized Covariance Control of Coupled Systems: A System Level Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02094v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work is concerned with the finite-horizon optimal covariance steering of networked systems governed by discrete-time stochastic linear dynamics. In contrast with existing work that has only considered systems with dynamically decoupled agents, we consider a dynamically coupled system composed of interconnected subsystems subject to local communication constraints. In particular, we propose a distributed algorithm to compute the localized optimal feedback control policy for each individual subsystem, which depends only on the local state histories of its neighboring subsystems. Utilizing the system-level synthesis (SLS) framework, we first recast the localized covariance steering problem as a convex SLS problem with locality constraints. Subsequently, exploiting its partially separable structure, we decompose the latter problem into smaller subproblems, introducing a transformation to deal with nonseparable instances. Finally, we employ a variation of the consensus alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to distribute computation across subsystems on account of their local information and communication constraints. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm on a power system with 36 interconnected subsystems.</description>

      <title>Fast Online Adaptive Neural MPC via Meta-Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16369v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data-driven model predictive control (MPC) has demonstrated significant potential for improving robot control performance in the presence of model uncertainties. However, existing approaches often require extensive offline data collection and computationally intensive training, limiting their ability to adapt online. To address these challenges, this paper presents a fast online adaptive MPC framework that leverages neural networks integrated with Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML). Our approach focuses on few-shot adaptation of residual dynamics - capturing the discrepancy between nominal and true system behavior - using minimal online data and gradient steps. By embedding these meta-learned residual models into a computationally efficient L4CasADi-based MPC pipeline, the proposed method enables rapid model correction, enhances predictive accuracy, and improves real-time control performance. We validate the framework through simulation studies on a Van der Pol oscillator, a Cart-Pole system, and a 2D quadrotor. Results show significant gains in adaptation speed and prediction accuracy over both nominal MPC and nominal MPC augmented with a freshly initialized neural network, underscoring the effectiveness of our approach for real-time adaptive robot control.</description>
