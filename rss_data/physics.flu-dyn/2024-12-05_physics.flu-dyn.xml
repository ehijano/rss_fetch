      <title>Free-form intelligent hydrodynamic metamaterials enabled by extreme anisotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intelligent metamaterials have attracted widespread research interest due to their self-adaptive capabilities and controllability. They hold great potential for advancing fluid control by providing responsive and flexible solutions. However, current designs of passive hydrodynamic metamaterials are limited by their fixed shapes and specific environments, lacking environmental adaptability. These two constraints hinder the broader application of hydrodynamic metamaterials. In this work, we propose a design for passive intelligent metashells that utilize extremely anisotropic parameters to endow hydrodynamic metamaterials with self-adaptive abilities and free-form shapes. Achieving the required anisotropic parameters is challenging, but we ingeniously accomplished this by creating isobaric conditions through increasing the water height in the shell region. We validated the design through finite-element simulations. This approach overcomes the limitations of existing passive hydrodynamic metamaterials, enhancing their intelligent behavior. Our model improves the flexibility and robustness of hydrodynamic metamaterials in complex and dynamic environments, providing insights for future designs and practical applications</description>

      <title>Characterization of local energy transfer in large-scale intermittent stratified geophysical flows via space filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies based on simulations of the Boussinesq equations indicate that stratified turbulent flows can develop large-scale intermittency in the velocity and temperature fields, as detected in the atmosphere and in the oceans. In particular, emerging powerful vertical drafts were found to generate local turbulence, proving necessary for stratified flows to dissipate the energy as efficiently as homogeneous isotropic turbulent flows. The existence of regions characterized by enhanced turbulence and dissipation, as observed, for instance, in the ocean, requires appropriate tools to assess how energy is transferred across the scales and at the same time locally in the physical space. After refining a classical space-filtering procedure, here we investigate the feedback of extreme vertical velocity drafts on energy transfer and exchanges in subdomains of simulations of stably stratified flows of geophysical interest. Our analysis shows that vertical drafts are indeed able to trigger upscale and downscale energy transfers, strengthening the coupling between kinetic and potential energies at certain scales, depending on the intensity of the local vertical velocity.</description>

      <title>Stagnation points at grain contacts generate an elastic flow instability in 3D porous media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many environmental, energy, and industrial processes involve the flow of polymer solutions in three-dimensional (3D) porous media where fluid is confined to navigate through complex pore space geometries. As polymers are transported through the tortuous pore space, elastic stresses accumulate, leading to the onset of unsteady flow fluctuations above a threshold flow rate. How does pore space geometry influence the development and features of this elastic instability? Here, we address this question by directly imaging polymer solution flow in microfabricated 3D ordered porous media with precisely controlled geometries consisting of simple-cubic (SC) or body-centered cuboid (BC) arrays of spherical grains. In both cases, we find that the flow instability is generated at stagnation points arising at the contacts between grains rather than at the polar upstream/downstream grain surfaces, as is the case for flow around a single grain. The characteristics of the flow instability are strongly dependent on the unit cell geometry: in SC packings, the instability manifests through the formation of time-dependent, fluctuating 3D eddies, whereas in BC packings, it manifests as continual fluctuating 'wobbles' and crossing in the flow pathlines. Despite this difference, we find that characteristics of the transition from steady to unsteady flow with increasing flow rate have commonalities across geometries. Moreover, for both packing geometries, our data indicate that extensional flow-induced polymeric stresses generated by contact-associated stagnation points are the primary contributor to the macroscopic resistance to flow across the entire medium. Altogether, our work highlights the pivotal role of inter-grain contacts -- which are typically idealized as discrete points and therefore overlooked, but are inherent in most natural and engineered media -- in shaping elastic instabilities in porous media.</description>

      <title>Fingering instability in dewetting capillary nanosuspensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the fingering instability that forms when a capillary nanosuspension liquid bridge is stretched. The dewetting process is observed using a transparent lifted Hele-Shaw cell. The liquid bridge is stretched under constant acceleration, and the resulting instability patterns are recorded using two high-speed cameras. Finger-like structures, characteristic of the Saffman-Taylor instability are observed. The total length of the dendrites and the overlapped number of branches are quantified. We reveal the roles of microparticles, nanoparticles, and the secondary liquid during the fingering instability. Addition of microparticles to pure liquid enhanced finger length due to increased particle interactions and nucleation sites for bubbles. Addition of secondary fluid reduces fingering length by forming a strong interparticle network. Incorporation of Nanoparticles induces an early onset of cavitation and enhanced fingering instability. However, nanoparticles make the capillary suspensions' overall micro-structure more homogeneous, reduce the sample variation in fingering patterns, and promote the even distribution of gel on both slides during splitting. These findings highlight the complex interactions governing dewetting in capillary (nano)suspensions. This knowledge has potential applications in microfluidics, 3D printing, and thin-film coatings, where controlling dewetting is crucial.</description>

      <title>A Novel and Simple Invariant-Domain-Preserving Framework for PAMPA Scheme: 1D Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The PAMPA (Point-Average-Moment PolynomiAl-interpreted) method, proposed in [R. Abgrall, Commun. Appl. Math. Comput., 5: 370-402, 2023], combines conservative and non-conservative formulations of hyperbolic conservation laws to evolve cell averages and point values. Solutions to hyperbolic conservation laws typically have an invariant domain, and ensuring numerical solutions stay within this domain is essential yet nontrivial. This paper presents a novel framework for designing efficient Invariant-Domain-Preserving (IDP) PAMPA schemes. We first analyze the IDP property for updated cell averages in the original PAMPA scheme, revealing the role of cell average decomposition and midpoint values in maintaining the invariant domain. This analysis highlights the difficulty of relying on continuous fluxes alone to preserve the invariant domain. Building on these insights, we introduce a simple IDP limiter for cell midpoint values, and propose a provably IDP PAMPA scheme that guarantees the preservation of the invariant domain for updated cell averages without requiring post-processing limiters. This approach contrasts with existing bound-preserving PAMPA schemes, which often require additional convex limiting to blend high-order and low-order solutions. Most notably, inspired by the Softplus and Clipped ReLU functions from machine learning, we propose an automatic IDP reformulation of the governing equations, resulting in an unconditionally limiter-free IDP scheme for evolving point values. We also introduce techniques to suppress spurious oscillations, enabling the scheme to capture strong shocks effectively. Numerical experiments on 1D problems, including the linear convection equation, Burgers equation, the compressible Euler equations, and MHD equations, demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of the proposed IDP PAMPA scheme.</description>

      <title>A resolvent-based perspective on the generation of Mach wave radiation from compressible boundary layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.14223v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We identify forcing mechanisms that separately amplify subsonic and supersonic features obtained from a linearized Navier-Stokes based model for compressible parallel boundary layers. Resolvent analysis is used to analyse the linear model, where the non-linear terms of the linearized equations act as a forcing to the linear terms. Considering subsonic modes, only the solenoidal component of the forcing to the momentum equations amplify these modes. When considering supersonic modes, we find that these are pressure fluctuations that radiate into the freestream. Within the freestream, these modes closely follow the trends of inviscid Mach waves. There are two distinct forcing mechanisms that amplify the supersonic modes: (i) the 'direct route' where the forcing to the continuity and energy equations and the dilatational component of the forcing to the momentum equations directly force the mode and (ii) the 'indirect route' where the solenoidal component of the forcing to the momentum equations force a response in wall-normal velocity, and this wall-normal velocity in-turn forces the supersonic mode. A majority of the supersonic modes considered are dominantly forced by the direct route. However, when considering Mach waves that are, like in direct numerical simulations, forced from the buffer layer of the flow, the indirect route of forcing becomes significant. We find that these observations are also valid for a streamwise developing boundary layer. These results are consistent with, and extend the observations in the literature regarding the solenoidal and dilatational components of velocity in compressible turbulent wall-bounded flows.</description>

      <title>Modal-based generalised quasilinear approximations for turbulent plane Couette flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14585v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study generalised quasilinear (GQL) approximations applied to turbulent plane Couette flow. The GQL framework is explored in conjunction with a Galerkin reduced-order model (ROM) recently developed by Cavalieri &amp; Nogueira (Phys. Rev. Fluids 7, L102601, 2022), which considers controllability modes of the linearised Navier-Stokes system as basis functions, representing coherent structures in the flow. The velocity field is decomposed into two groups: one composed by high-controllability modes and the other by lowcontrollability modes. The former group is solved with the full nonlinear equations, whereas the equations for the latter are linearised.We also consider a new GQL framework wherein the linearised equations for the lowcontrollability modes are driven by nonlinear interactions of modes in the first group, which are characterised by large-scale coherent structures. It is shown that GQL-ROMs successfully recover the statistics of the full model with relatively high controllability thresholds and sparser nonlinear operators. Driven GQL-ROMs were found to converge more rapidly than standard GQL approximations, providing accurate description of the statistics with a larger number of linearised modes. This indicates that the forcing of linearised flow structures by large-scale coherent structures is an important feature of turbulence dynamics that should be considered in GQL models. The results presented here reveal that further model reductions are attainable with GQL-ROMs, which can be valuable to extend these models to larger Reynolds numbers.</description>

      <title>Tones and upstream-travelling waves in ideally-expanded round impinging jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12047v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the generation of tones by ideally-expanded round jets impinging on a flat plate. Data from large-eddy simulations performed for different nozzle-to-plate distances is explored, and we consider closure of the aeroacoustic feedback loop responsible for the tones by guided jet modes. Allowable frequency ranges for resonance, underpinned by the existence of modes with upstream-directed group velocities, are computed using two different models: a cylindrical vortex-sheet model; and a locally-parallel stability model which considers a finite-thickness velocity profile. It is shown that inclusion of a finite-thickness velocity profile consistent with the mean flow in the vicinity of the plate improves the agreement between observed tones and model predictions. The frequency of the largest tones found in the data are found to fall within, or very close to, the frequency limits of the finite-thickness model, correcting discrepancies observed with the vortex-sheet model. The same trend is observed in comparisons with experimental and numerical data gathered from the literature. Pressure eigenfunctions of the stability model are in good agreement with upstream-travelling disturbances educed from the data at the tone frequencies. This provides further evidence for the involvement of guided jet modes in the resonance mechanism.</description>

      <title>Predicting burst events in a forced 2D flow: A wavelet-based analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05263v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Predicting and perhaps mitigating against rare, extreme events in fluid flows is an important challenge. Due to the time-localised nature of these events, Fourier-based methods prove inefficient in capturing them. Instead, this paper uses wavelet-based methods to understand the underlying patterns in a forced flow over a 2-torus which has intermittent high-energy burst events interrupting an ambient low energy 'quiet' flow. Two wavelet-based methods are examined to predict burst events: (1) a wavelet proper orthogonal decomposition (WPOD) based method which uncovers and utilises the key flow patterns seen in the quiet regions and the bursting episodes; and (2) a wavelet resolvent analysis (WRA) based method that relies on the forcing structures which amplify the underlying flow patterns. These methods are compared to a straightforward energy tracking approach which acts as a benchmark. Both the wavelet-based approaches succeed in producing better predictions than a simple energy criterion, i.e. earlier prediction times and/or fewer false positives and the WRA-based technique always performs better than WPOD. However, the improvement of WRA over WPOD is not as substantial as anticipated. We conjecture that this is because the mechanism for the bursts in the flow studied is found to be largely modal, associated with the unstable eigenfunction of the Navier-Stokes operator linearized around the mean flow. The WRA approach should deliver much better improvement over the WPOD approach for generically non-modal bursting mechanisms where there is a lag between the imposed forcing and the final response pattern.</description>

      <title>A Python-based flow solver for numerical simulations using an immersed boundary method on single GPUs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19920v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an efficient implementation for running three-dimensional numerical simulations of fluid-structure interaction problems on single GPUs, based on Nvidia CUDA through Numba and Python. The incompressible flow around moving bodies is solved in this framework through an implementation of the Immersed Boundary Method tailored for the GPU, where different GPU grid architectures are exploited to optimize the overall performance. By targeting a single-GPU, we avoid GPU-CPU and GPU-GPU communication bottlenecks, since all the simulation data is always in the global memory of the GPU. We provide details about the numerical methodology, the implementation of the algorithm in the GPU and the memory management, critical in single-GPU implementations. Additionally, we verify the results comparing with our analogous CPU-based parallel solver and assess satisfactorily the efficiency of the code in terms of the relative computing time of the different operations and the scaling of the CPU code compared to a single GPU case. Overall, our tests show that the single-GPU code is between 34 to 54 times faster than the CPU solver in peak performance (96-128 CPU cores). This speedup mainly comes from the change in the method of solution of the linear systems of equations, while the speedup in sections of the algorithm that are equivalent in the CPU and GPU implementations is more modest (i.e., $\times 1.6-3$ speedup in the computation of the non-linear terms). Finally, we showcase the performance of this new GPU implementation in two applications of interest, one for external flows (i.e., bioinspired aerodynamics) and one for internal flows (i.e., cardiovascular flows), demonstrating the strong scaling of the code in two different GPU cards (hardware).%\red{for both single and double precision.}</description>

      <title>Velocity gradient partitioning in turbulent flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08955v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The velocity gradient tensor can be decomposed into normal straining, pure shearing and rigid rotation tensors, each with distinct symmetry and normality properties. We partition the strength of turbulent velocity gradients based on the relative contributions of these constituents in several canonical flows. These flows include forced isotropic turbulence, turbulent channels and turbulent boundary layers. For forced isotropic turbulence, the partitioning is in excellent agreement with previous results. For wall-bounded turbulence, the partitioning collapses onto the isotropic partitioning far from the wall, where the mean shearing is relatively weak. By contrast, the near-wall partitioning is dominated by shearing. Between these two regimes, the partitioning collapses well at sufficiently high friction Reynolds numbers and its variations in the buffer layer and the log-law region can be reasonably modelled as a function of the mean shearing strength. Altogether, our results highlight the expressivity and broad applicability of the velocity gradient partitioning as advantages for turbulence modelling.</description>

      <title>Effective Block Preconditioners for Fluid Dynamics Coupled to Reduced Models of a Non-Local Nature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13668v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modeling cardiovascular blood flow is central to many applications in biomedical engineering. To accommodate the complexity of the cardiovascular system, in terms of boundary conditions and surrounding vascular tissue, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) often are coupled to reduced circuit and/or solid mechanics models. These allow for realistic simulations of hemodynamics in the heart or the aorta, but come at additional computational cost and complexity. In this contribution, we design a novel block preconditioner for the solution of the stabilized Navier-Stokes equations coupled to reduced-order models of a non-local nature. These models encompass lumped-parameter systems that impose flux-dependent boundary tractions, and Galerkin reduced-order models that can be used to account for outlying mechanical structures. Here we propose a 3x3 preconditioner derived from the block factorization and approximation to the Schur complement(s). The solver performance is demonstrated for a series of examples with increasing complexity, culminating in a reduced FSI simulation in a patient-specific contracting left heart model. For all test cases, we show that our proposed approach is superior to other frequently presented 2x2 schemes that merge stiffness contributions from reduced models into the fluid Jacobian or consolidate some variables for the purpose of efficiency - with an up to six times shorter overall computing time and/or only half as many linear iterations.</description>

      <title>A Geometric Approach to the Navier-Stokes Equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18724v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Introduction: the Navier-Stokes equations are essential in fluid dynamics, describing the motion of fluids like liquids and gases. Solving these equations, especially in complex flows and high-Reynolds-number regimes, is a significant challenge. Numerical simulations provide some insights, but often under restrictive assumptions that limit applicability. Recent geometric and algebraic methods have emerged, focusing on the equations' structure, yet questions about the uniqueness and stability of weak solutions persist. Objective: this paper aims to reformulate the Navier-Stokes equations in covariant form and develop new equations that facilitate the search for potential solutions, emphasizing symmetries. Geometric Approach: a covariant formulation of the Navier-Stokes equations is presented, applying a Fourier transform on a bounded manifold and seeking smoothness and viable solutions through convergence of manifold elements. Transformations: the study examines transformations between manifolds, investigating symmetries and interpretations related to homeomorphisms, isometries, and diffeomorphisms, including inertial frames of reference. Discussion and Conclusions: this study introduces a geometric reformulation of the Navier-Stokes equations, proposing new equations to enhance convergence and smoothness of solutions. It presents a novel class of solutions and transformations, with significant interdisciplinary connections. Further simulations, experimental validation, and ongoing development are essential to broaden the applicability of these equations and their solutions.</description>

Abstract: Simulating complex hydraulic conditions, particularly two-phase flows over spillway chutes, can be achieved with high accuracy using three-dimensional numerical models. This study investigates the potential for vacuum generation and cavitation phenomena on the Aghchai Dam service spillway through numerical simulations conducted in Flow-3D. The analysis focuses on two specific flow rates, 4400 and 1065 cubic meters per second, as determined by experimental data. The Volume of Fluid (VOF) method is employed to accurately calculate the free surface flow. Simulation results at a discharge rate of 4400 cubic meters per second indicate a high likelihood of cavitation at critical locations, including the ogee curve and the angle transition in the chute channel. These areas require specific mitigation measures to prevent cavitation-induced damage. In contrast, at the lower flow rate of 1065 cubic meters per second, the risk of cavitation is minimal due to reduced flow velocity and the absence of flow separation from the bed. The numerical findings align closely with empirical observations, demonstrating the reliability of the simulation approach in predicting cavitation behavior.</description>

      <title>Early-time small-scale structures in hot-exoplanet atmosphere simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00526v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report on the critical influence of small-scale flow structures (e.g., fronts, vortices, and waves) that immediately arise in hot-exoplanet atmosphere simulations initialized with a resting state. A hot, 1:1 spin-orbit synchronized Jupiter is used here as a clear example; but, the phenomenon is generic and important for any type of a hot synchronized planet -- gaseous, oceanic, or telluric. When the early-time structures are not captured in simulations (due to, e.g., poor resolution and/or too much dissipation), the flow behavior is markedly different at later times -- in an observationally significant way; for example, the flow at large-scale is smoother and much less dynamic. This results in the temperature field, and its corresponding thermal flux, to be incorrectly predicted in numerical simulations, even when the quantities are spatially averaged.</description>
