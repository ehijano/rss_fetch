      <title>Countability Properties of Weakly Compact Sets in Asymmetric Locally Convex Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A dual pair formulation for asymmetric locally convex spaces is developed that strictly generalises the ordinary vector space setting. The concept of a polar topology carries over to the asymmetric case and some familiar results are reproduced or generalised such as the bipolar theorem and a Mackey-Arens type theorem. The implications of weak compactness and countability properties are studied and appear intimately connected to separation properties. An asymmetric analogue $C_a(K)$ of the well-known space $C_p(K)$ is introduced and the properties of (relatively) (countably respectively sequentially) compact subspaces are investigated. In particular, it is shown that $C_a([0,1])$ is not angelic. However, for Hausdorff subspaces satisfying a simple closure condition, the different compactness conditions are equivalent and imply the Fr\'echet-Urysohn property. Moreover, an analogue of the Eberlein-\v{S}mulian theorem holds in asymmetrically normed spaces.</description>

      <title>Soft Uniform Spaces and Soft Uniform Continuity: Induced Topologies, Separation, and Compactness-Type Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Soft uniform structures provide a way to speak about uniform closeness in a parameterized setting. Working over a fixed parameter set, we treat entourages as soft relations and introduce a notion of \emph{soft uniformity} whose axioms parallel the classical entourage approach. Every soft uniformity induces a canonical soft topology; moreover, the uniformity is separated exactly when the induced topology is soft $T_1$, and the induced topology is soft regular. We then study soft uniformly continuous mappings and prove a soft Heine--Cantor type theorem: on a soft compact domain, soft continuity already forces soft uniform continuity. Finally, soft total boundedness and soft completeness are formulated via soft Cauchy filters, and we show that soft compactness implies both properties. Examples are included to relate the theory to uniformities generated from classical structures and to highlight the role played by parameters.</description>

      <title>Compactness in Constructive Mathematics via Affine Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study topology, particularly compactness, as an extension of Shulman's work for constructive mathematics via affine logic, while allowing propositional impredicativity. In addition to some basic properties of compactness, we prove the extreme value theorem and the Heine-Borel theorem for "cuts", which are a version of Dedekind cuts in affine logic. Moreover, from the antithesis translation of the Heine-Borel theorem for cuts to intuitionistic logic, we derive the Heine-Borel theorem for one-sided reals intuitionistically, and have verified its proof with the interactive theorem prover. The code is available at https://github.com/hziwara/CutsHeineBorel.</description>

      <title>Joins of closed sublocales are not always a coframe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00987v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a locale $L$, the collection $\mathsf{S}_c(L)$ of joins of closed sublocales forms a frame--somewhat unexpectedly, as it is naturally embedded in the coframe of all sublocales of $L$, where by coframe we mean the order-theoretic dual of a frame. This construction has attracted attention in point-free topology: as a maximal essential extension in the category of frames, for its (non-)functorial properties, its relation to canonical extensions and exact filters of frames, etc.
  A central open question of the theory, posed by Picado, Pultr, and Tozzi in 2019, asked whether $\mathsf{S}_c(L)$ is always a coframe, or whether there exists a locale for which this fails. In this paper, we resolve this question in the negative by constructing a locale $L$ such that $\mathsf{S}_c(L)$ is not a coframe. The main challenge in such questions lies in the difficulty of understanding exact infima in $\mathsf{S}_c(L)$; we circumvent this by analysing a certain separation property satisfied by $\mathsf{S}_c(L)$.</description>

      <title>Circular orders: Topology and continuous actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17314v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the topology of circularly ordered sets. While the algebraic notion is classical, the general topological theory has received comparatively little attention. In this work we provide a self-contained topological exposition and present several new directions and results: Initiate a systematic study of generalized circularly ordered topological spaces and of continuous group actions on them. Provide a convex uniform structure description of circularly ordered compactifications. This yields a topological analysis of Novak's regular completion and its minimal uniformity. Show that this uniform structures approach implies several new results in the theory of proper $G$-compactifications for topological group actions on abstract ordered spaces. Reexamine functions of bounded variation on circularly ordered sets and prove generalizations of Helly's selection theorem (for circular and linear orders). These developments and the systematic analysis of circular order topologies are motivated by recent applications in topological dynamics, particularly in joint works with Eli Glasner, which demonstrate that circularly ordered dynamical systems provide a natural class of tame dynamics.</description>

      <title>Toposes with enough points as categories of \'etale spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09604v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend Makkai duality between coherent toposes and ultracategories to a duality between toposes with enough points and ultraconvergence spaces. Our proof generalizes and simplifies Makkai's original proof. Our main result can also be seen as an extension to ionads of Barr's equivalence between topological spaces and relational modules for the ultrafilter monad. In view of the correspondence between toposes and geometric theories, we obtain a strong conceptual completeness theorem, in the sense of Makkai, for geometric theories with enough Set-models. The same result has recently been obtained independently by Saadia (arXiv:2506.23935) and by Hamad (arXiv:2507.07922). Both of their proofs rely on groupoid representations of toposes, which our proof here does not assume.</description>

      <title>A new characterization of (pre)liminary C*-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20980v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given an arbitrary countable ordinal $\alpha $, we introduce the notion of type $I_{\alpha }$ C*-algebra and $\alpha $-subhomogeneous C*-algebra. When $\alpha =0$, these recover the notions of Fell C*-algebra and of commutative C*-algebra, respectively. When $\alpha =n&lt;\omega $, these recover the notions of type $I_{n}$ C*-algebra and of $n$-subhomogeneous C*-algebra, respectively. We prove that a separable C*-algebra is liminary if and only if it is type $I_{\alpha }$ for some $\alpha &lt;\omega _{1}$, and it is preliminary (i.e., has no infinite-dimensional irreducible representation) if and only if it is $\alpha $-subhomogeneous for some $\alpha &lt;\omega _{1}$. We also prove that for any countable ordinal $\alpha $ there exists a separable C*-algebra that is type $I_{\alpha }$ and not type $I_{\beta }$ for $\beta &lt;\alpha $, and a separable C*-algebra that is $\alpha $-subhomogeneous and not $\beta $-subhomogeneous for any $\beta &lt;\alpha $.</description>
