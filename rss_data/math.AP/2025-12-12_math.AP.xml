      <title>Regularity of the free boundary for the supercooled Stefan problem in arbitrary dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the free boundary in the supercooled Stefan problem, a classical model for the solidification of water below its freezing temperature. In contrast with the melting problem, physical experiments and heuristics indicate that the water--ice interface in the supercooled problem may exhibit fractal freezing sets, infinite-speed propagation of the frozen front, and nucleation (the spontaneous appearance of ice). Despite this, we show that the free boundary has a robust structure.
  We decompose the free boundary into three parts: (1) a regular part that advances with finite speed in time; (2) a singular part consisting of points where the front attains infinite speed or nucleates, but with controlled space-time (i.e., $\leq d-1$ parabolic) dimension; and (3) a jump component, which can have large dimension in a time slice, but which is contained in a space-time smooth graph and occurs only at a zero-dimensional set of times. Examples show that each of these parts can be nonempty.
  Furthermore, we prove that the free boundary is the graph $t=s(x)$ of a continuously differentiable freezing time $s$, and the singular set coincides with the critical set of $s$, proving that singularities in supercooled freezing always occur with infinite speed.
  These results provide the first free boundary regularity theory for the supercooled Stefan problem in arbitrary dimensions.</description>

      <title>The supercooled Stefan problem: fractal freezing and the fine structure of maximal solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the supercooled Stefan problem in arbitrary dimensions. First, we study general solutions and their irregularities, showing generic fractal freezing and nucleation, based on a novel Markovian gluing principle. In contrast, we then establish regularity properties of maximal solutions, which are obtained by maximizing a suitable notion of "average" freezing time. Unexpectedly, we show that maximal solutions have a transition zone that is open modulo a low-dimensional set: this allows us to apply obstacle problem theory for a finer regularity analysis. We further show that maximal solutions are in general non-universal, and we obtain sharp stability results under perturbation of each maximal solution. Lastly, we study maximal solutions in both the radial and the one-dimensional setting. We show that in these cases the maximal solution is universal and minimizes nucleation, in agreement with phenomena observed in the physics literature.</description>

      <title>Parabolic Frequency on Gaussian Spaces and Unique Continuation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish an almost-monotonicity formula for a parabolic frequency on Gaussian spaces for solutions of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck heat equation with lower-order terms: $$\partial_t u = L_\gamma u + b(x,t) \cdot \nabla u + c(x,t)u, $$ where $L_\gamma = \Delta - x \cdot \nabla$ is the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck operator. In contrast to classical results that require $b$ and $c$ to be bounded, we only assume that $b$ is bounded and $c$ satisfies a linear growth condition, while the solution $u$ is allowed to have at most exponential quadratic growth. The key innovation is a weighted $L^2$ framework that uses the backward Mehler kernel as a weight, which naturally encodes the underlying measure and compensates for the unbounded coefficients. From the frequency monotonicity, we derive the strong unique continuation principle. This extends Poon's seminal results and complements recent geometric generalizations by Colding and Minicozzi in the context of Gaussian measure spaces. We further apply our framework to establish unique continuation for equations with potentials exhibiting quadratic growth or certain singularities.</description>

      <title>Topological degree for negative fractional Kazdan--Warner equation on finite graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studies on Kazdan--Warner equations on graphs have grown steadily, yet the fractional case remains insufficiently explored. Using topological degree theory, this work investigates the fractional Kazdan--Warner equation in the negative case on connected finite graphs, focusing on the existence and multiplicity of solutions. This work not only extends the earlier result of S. Liu and Yang (2020) to the fractional setting, but also provides a concise proof for the work of Shan and Y. Liu (2025).</description>

      <title>Vortex atmospheres of traveling vortices: rigorous definition, existence, and topological classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In incompressible and inviscid fluids, the vortex atmosphere refers to the collection of fluid particles outside the support of a traveling vortex that are nevertheless carried along with it. This phenomenon has been recognized since the nineteenth century, e.g., in the classical works of O. Reynolds [Nature, 1876] and O. Lodge [Lond. Edinb. Dubl. Phil. Mag., 1885], yet rigorous mathematical definitions and proofs have remained largely undeveloped, with most subsequent studies relying on thin-core approximations or asymptotic analyses. In this paper, we give a rigorous definition of a vortex atmosphere and establish its existence and uniqueness. We further compare the planar atmosphere surrounding a 2D vortex dipole with the axisymmetric atmosphere surrounding a 3D vortex ring. In particular, we emphasize and prove the topological distinctions observed by W. Hicks [Lond. Edinb. Dubl. Phil. Mag., 1919]: under natural assumptions, every 2D dipole with its atmosphere forms an oval-shaped region, whereas for 3D rings, both spheroidal and toroidal configurations may occur. Our proof is based on showing that each atmosphere can be characterized precisely as a specific superlevel set of its corresponding stream function.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Sphere Concentration at Infinity for NLS with L^2 Constraint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation$$-\Delta u + V(x)\,u = a\,u^p + \mu u \quad \text{in }\mathbb{R}^n,\qquad \int_{\mathbb{R}^n} u^2 = 1,$$modeling attractive Bose--Einstein condensates. For all dimensions $n\ge 2$ and all exponents $p&gt;1$, we prove the existence of normalized solutions whose $L^2$-mass concentrates on spheres with radii diverging to infinity. In particular, the concentration set escapes to infinity rather than remaining on a fixed compact hypersurface, which makes our regime qualitatively different both from classical point-concentration phenomena and from concentrating profiles in unconstrained problems. Our approach combines a tailored finite-dimensional reduction with a blow-up analysis based on Pohozaev identities and, in this way, extends the two-dimensional mass-critical result for $(n,p)=(2,3)$ obtained in Guo--Tian--Zhou (Calc.\ Var.\ Partial Differential Equations, 2022). The proof in that paper relies in an essential way on the two-dimensional structure and does not directly apply in higher dimensions, whereas here we develop a different approximation scheme and functional setting adapted to the high-dimensional sphere-at-infinity concentration regime.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic analysis of fractional Sobolev spaces on thin films in the low-integrability regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the behaviour of fractional Sobolev spaces $H^s(\Omega_\varepsilon)$ with $s\in(0,1/2)$ defined on ``thin films'' $\Omega_\varepsilon=\omega\times (0,\varepsilon)$ in $\mathbb R^d$, and prove that they tend to the space $H^{s+\frac12}(\omega)$ as $\varepsilon\to 0$. This is made precise by using a notion of dimension-reduction convergence, with respect to which suitably scaled Gagliardo seminorms define equicoercive functionals. Asymptotic results are proved for $s\to 0^+$ and $s\to 1/2^-$.</description>

      <title>The $\ell^p$-boundedness of wave operators for the fourth order Schr\"{o}dinger operators on the lattice $\mathbb{Z}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the $\ell^p$ boundedness of wave operators $W_\pm(H,\Delta^2)$ associated with discrete fourth-order Schr\"odinger operators $H = \Delta^2 + V$ on the lattice $\mathbb{Z}$, where $$(\Delta\phi)(n)=\phi(n+1)+\phi(n-1)-2\phi(n),\quad n\in\mathbb{Z},$$ and $V(n)$ is a real-valued potential on $\mathbb{Z}$. Under suitable decay assumptions on $V$ (depending on the types of zero resonance of $H$), we show that the wave operators $W_{\pm}(H, \Delta^2)$ are bounded on $\ell^p(\mathbb{Z})$ for all $1 &lt; p &lt; \infty$: $$ \|W_{\pm}(H, \Delta^2) f\|_{\ell^p(\mathbb{Z})} \lesssim \|f\|_{\ell^p(\mathbb{Z})}. $$ In particular, if both thresholds $0$ and $16$ are regular points of $H$, we prove that $W_{\pm}(H, \Delta^2)$ are neither bounded on the endpoint space $\ell^1(\mathbb{Z})$ nor on $\ell^\infty(\mathbb{Z})$. We remark that the proof of these bounds relies fundamentally on the asymptotic expansions of the resolvent of $H$ near the thresholds $0$ and $16$, and on the theory of {\it discrete singular integrals} on the lattice.
  As applications, we derive the following sharp $\ell^p-\ell^{p'}$ decay estimates for solutions to the discrete beam equation with a parameter $a\in \mathbb{R}$ on the lattice $\mathbb{Z}$: $$ \|{\rm cos}(t\sqrt {H+a^2})P_{ac}(H)\|_{\ell^p\rightarrow\ell^{p'}}+\left\|\frac{{\rm sin}(t\sqrt {H+a^2})}{t\sqrt {H+a^2}}P_{ac}(H)\right\|_{\ell^p\rightarrow\ell^{p'}}\lesssim|t|^{-\frac{1}{3}(\frac{1}{p}-\frac{1}{p'})},\quad t\neq0, $$ where $1&lt;p\le 2$, ${p'}$ is the conjugated index of $p$ and $P_{ac}(H)$ denotes the spectral projection onto the absolutely continuous spectrum space of $H$.</description>

      <title>On the ground state of the nonlinear Schr{\"o}dinger equation: asymptotic behavior at the endpoint powers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the ground states of the nonlinear Schr{\"o}dinger equation, which stand for radially symmetric and exponentially decaying solutions on the full space. We investigate their behaviors at both endpoint powers of the nonlinearity, up to some rescaling to infer non-trivial limits. One case corresponds to the limit towards a Gaussian function called Gausson, which is the ground state of the stationary logarithmic Schr{\"o}dinger equation. The other case, for dimension at least three, corresponds to the limit towards the Aubin-Talenti algebraic soliton. We prove strong convergence with explicit bounds for both cases, and provide detailed asymptotics. These theoretical results are illustrated with numerical approximations.</description>

      <title>$\Phi^4\_2$ theory limit of a many-body bosonic free energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the quantum Gibbs state of an interacting Bose gas on the 2D torus. We set temperature, chemical potential and coupling constant in a regime where classical field theory gives leading order asymptotics. In the same limit, the repulsive interaction potential is set to be short-range: it converges to a Dirac delta function with a rate depending polynomially on the other scaling parameters. We prove that the free-energy of the interacting Bose gas (counted relatively to the non-interacting one) converges to the free energy of the $\Phi^4\_2$ non-linear Schr{\"o}dinger-Gibbs measure, thereby revisiting recent results and streamlining proofs thereof. We combine the variational method of Lewin-Nam-Rougerie to connect, with controled error, the quantum free energy to a classical Hartree-Gibbs one with smeared non-linearity. The convergence of the latter to the $\Phi^4\_2$ free energy then follows from arguments of Fr{\"o}hlich-Knowles-Schlein-Sohinger. This derivation parallels recent results of Nam-Zhu-Zhu.</description>

      <title>Observability inequality for the von Neumann equation in crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a quantitative observability inequality for the von Neumann equation on $\mathbb{R}^d$ in the crystal setting, uniform in small $\hbar$. Following the method of Golse and Paul (2022) proving this result in the non-crystal setting, the method relies on a stability argument between the quantum (von Neumann) and classical (Liouville) dynamics and uses an optimal transport-like pseudo-distance between quantum and classical densities. Our contribution yields in the adaptation of all the required tools to the periodic setting, relying on the Bloch decomposition, notions of periodic Schr\"odinger coherent state, periodic T\"oplitz operator and periodic Husimi densities.</description>

      <title>Finding core subgraphs of directed graphs via discrete Ricci curvature flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ricci curvature and its associated flow offer powerful geometric methods for analyzing complex networks. While existing research heavily focuses on applications for undirected graphs such as community detection and core extraction, there have been relatively less attention on directed graphs.
  In this paper, we introduce a definition of Ricci curvature and an accompanying curvature flow for directed graphs. Crucially, for strongly connected directed graphs, this flow admits a unique global solution. We then apply this flow to detect strongly connected subgraphs from weakly connected directed graphs. (A weakly connected graph is connected overall but not necessarily strongly connected). Unlike prior work requiring graphs to be strongly connected, our method loosens this requirement. We transform a weakly connected graph into a strongly connected one by adding edges with very large artificial weights. This modification does not compromise our core subgraph detection. Due to their extreme weight, these added edges are automatically discarded during the final iteration of the Ricci curvature flow.
  For core evaluation, our approach consistently surpasses traditional methods, achieving better results on at least two out of three key metrics. The implementation code is publicly available at https://github.com/12tangze12/Finding-core-subgraphs-on-directed-graphs.</description>

      <title>Sharp mapping properties of Poisson transforms and the Baum-Connes conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a sharp, quantitative analogue of Helgason's conjecture at the level of distributions: For a semisimple Lie group $G$ of real rank one, Poisson transforms map a Sobolev space on $P\backslash G$ boundedly with closed range to an $L^2$-space on $K\backslash G$. The result is obtained for the Poisson transform studied by Knapp-Wallach under the name Szeg\"o map, and the appropriate Sobolev spaces are defined using van Erp-Yuncken's Heisenberg calculus. The proof generalizes to show that commutators of this Poisson transform with smooth functions on the Furstenberg compactification are compact. This proves the remaining open conjecture in Julg's seminal program to establish the Baum-Connes conjecture for closed subgroups of semisimple Lie groups of real rank one.</description>

      <title>Large deviations for invariant measure of stochastic Allen-Cahn equation with inhomogeneous boundary conditions and multiplicative noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove the validity of a small noise large deviation principle for the family of invariant measures $\{\mu_\epsilon\}_{\epsilon&gt;0} $ associated to the one dimensional stochastic Allen-Cahn equation with inhomogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions, perturbed by unbounded multiplicative noise. The main difficulty is that the system is not strongly dissipative. Using L. Simon's convergence theorem, we show that the dynamics of the noiseless system converge in large time to the minimizer of the Ginzburg-Landau energy functional, which is unique due to the boundary condition. We obtain an estimate of the invariant measure on the bounded set in the Sobolev space $W^{k^\star,p^\star} $, where $k^\star p^\star&gt;1$, and $p^\star$ is large. As a corollary of the main result, we show that $\mu_\epsilon$ concentrates around the unique minimizer with such boundary conditions exponentially fast when $\epsilon$ is sufficiently small.</description>

      <title>Spectral Theory of the Weighted Fourier Transform with respect to a Function in $\mathbb{R}^n$: Uncertainty Principle and Diffusion-Wave Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we generalize the weighted Fourier transform with respect to a function, originally proposed for the one-dimensional case in \cite{Dorrego}, to the $n$-dimensional Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^{n}$. We develop a comprehensive spectral theory on a weighted Hilbert space, establishing the Plancherel identity, the inversion formula, the convolution theorem, and a Heisenberg-type uncertainty principle depending on the geometric deformation. Furthermore, we utilize this framework to rigorously define the weighted fractional Laplacian with respect to a function, denoted by $(-\Delta_{\phi,\omega})^{s}$. Finally, we apply these tools to solve the generalized time-space fractional diffusion-wave equation, demonstrating that the fundamental solution can be expressed in terms of the Fox H-function, intrinsically related to the generalized $\omega$-Mellin transform introduced in \cite{Dorrego}. In this paper, we generalize the weighted Fourier transform with respect to a function, originally proposed for the one-dimensional case, to the n-dimensional Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^n$.

      <title>Sigma-convergence for thin heterogeneous domains and application to the upscaling of Darcy-Lapwood-Brinkmann flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09004</link>

Abstract: The sigma-convergence concept has been up to now used to derive macroscopic models in full space dimensions. In this work, we generalize it to thin heterogeneous domains given rise to phenomena in lower space dimensions. More precisely, we provide a new approach of the sigma-convergence method that is suitable for the study of phenomena occurring in thin heterogeneous media. This is made through a systematic study of the sigma-convergence method for thin heterogeneous domains. Assuming that the thin heterogeneous layer is made of microstructures that are distributed inside in a deterministic way including as special cases the periodic and the almost periodic distributions, we make use of the concept of algebras with mean value to state and prove the main compactness results. As an illustration, we upscale a Darcy-Lapwood-Brinkmann micro-model for thin flow. We prove that, according to the magnitude of the permeability of the porous domain, we obtain as effective models, the Darcy law in lower dimensions. The effective models are derived through the solvability of either the local Stokes-Brinkmann problems or the local Hele-Shaw problems.</description>

      <title>Variational structures for the Fokker--Planck equation with general Dirichlet boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07803v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the convergence of a modified Jordan--Kinderlehrer--Otto scheme to a solution to the Fokker--Planck equation in $\Omega \Subset \mathbb R^d$ with general -- strictly positive and temporally constant -- Dirichlet boundary conditions. We work under mild assumptions on the domain, the drift, and the initial datum.
  In the special case where $\Omega$ is an interval in $\mathbb R^1$, we prove that such a solution is a gradient flow -- curve of maximal slope -- within a suitable space of measures, endowed with a modified Wasserstein distance.
  Our discrete scheme and modified distance draw inspiration from contributions by A. Figalli and N. Gigli [J. Math. Pures Appl. 94, (2010), pp. 107--130], and J. Morales [J. Math. Pures Appl. 112, (2018), pp. 41--88] on an optimal-transport approach to evolution equations with Dirichlet boundary conditions. Similarly to these works, we allow the mass to flow from/to the boundary $\partial \Omega$ throughout the evolution. However, our leading idea is to also keep track of the mass at the boundary by working with measures defined on the whole closure $\overline \Omega$.
  The driving functional is a modification of the classical relative entropy that also makes use of the information at the boundary. As an intermediate result, when $\Omega$ is an interval in $\mathbb R^1$, we find a formula for the descending slope of this geodesically nonconvex functional.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the support of semiclassical measures for higher-dimensional cat maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13449v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum cat maps are toy models in quantum chaos associated to hyperbolic symplectic matrices $A\in \operatorname{Sp}(2n,\mathbb{Z})$. The macroscopic limits of sequences of eigenfunctions of a quantum cat map are characterized by semiclassical measures on the torus $\mathbb{R}^{2n}/\mathbb{Z}^{2n}$. We show that if the characteristic polynomial of every power $A^k$ is irreducible over the rationals, then every semiclassical measure has full support. The proof uses an earlier strategy of Dyatlov-J\'ez\'equel [arXiv:2108.10463] and the higher-dimensional fractal uncertainty principle of Cohen [arXiv:2305.05022]. Our irreducibility condition is generically true, in fact we show that asymptotically for $100\%$ of matrices $A$, the Galois group of the characteristic polynomial of $A$ is $S_2 \wr S_n$.
  When the irreducibility condition does not hold, we show that a semiclassical measure cannot be supported on a finite union of parallel non-coisotropic subtori. On the other hand, we give examples of semiclassical measures supported on the union of two transversal symplectic subtori for $n=2$, inspired by the work of Faure-Nonnenmacher-De Bi\`evre [arXiv:nlin/0207060] in the case $n=1$. This is complementary to the examples by Kelmer [arXiv:math-ph/0510079] of semiclassical measures supported on a single coisotropic subtorus.</description>

Abstract: Assume no-slip boundary conditions for the velocity field and either insulated or Dirichlet boundary conditions for the temperature field in a steady compressible fluid. In the inviscid limit $\v \rightarrow 0$, we develop a mathematical framework for the uniform-in-$\v$ remainder estimate for the linear steady compressible Navier-Stokes-Fourier equations around a Prandtl layer profile with both velocity and thermal layers, which leads to the validity of the Prandtl layer expansion.</description>

      <title>On the sharp quantitative stability of critical points of the Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev inequality in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ with $n\geq3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19248v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Assume $n\geq3$ and $u\in \dot{H}^1(\mathbb{R}^n)$. Recently, Piccione, Yang and Zhao \cite{Piccione-Yang-Zhao} established a nonlocal version of Struwe's decomposition in \cite{Struwe-1984}, i.e., if $\Gamma(u):=\left\|\Delta u+D_{n,\alpha}\int_{\mathbb{R}^{n}}\frac{|u|^{p_{\alpha}}(y) }{|x-y|^{\alpha}}\mathrm{d}y |u|^{p_{\alpha}-2} u\right\|_{\dot{H}^{-1}} \rightarrow 0$ and $u\geq 0$, then $dist(u,\mathcal{T})\to 0$, where $dist(u,\mathcal{T})$ denotes the $\dot{H}^1(\mathbb{R}^n)$-distance of $u$ from the manifold of sums of Talenti bubbles. In this paper, we establish the nonlocal version of the quantitative estimates of Struwe's decomposition in Ciraolo, Figalli and Maggi \cite{CFM} for one bubble and $n\geq3$, Figalli and Glaudo \cite{Figalli-Glaudo2020} for $3\leq n\leq5$ and Deng, Sun and Wei \cite{DSW} for $n\geq6$ and two or more bubbles. We prove that for $n\geq 3$ and $0&lt;\alpha&lt;n$, \[dist (u,\mathcal{T})\leq C\begin{cases} \Gamma(u)\left|\log \Gamma(u)\right|^{\frac{1}{2}}\quad&amp;\text{if } \,\, n\geq 6, \,\, \nu\geq2 \,\, \text{and} \,\, \alpha=\frac{n+2}{2}, \\ \Gamma(u) \quad&amp;\text{for any other cases,}\end{cases}\] where $\nu$ denotes the number of bubbles. Furthermore, we show that this inequality is sharp for $n\geq 6$ and $\alpha=\frac{n+2}{2}$. It should be emphasized that, in our paper, we have developed new techniques to deal with the strong singular case $4&lt;\alpha&lt;n$, which can not be handled by reduction methods in previous works. We believe that our method can also be applied to other problems related to the physically interesting Hartree equation.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study semilinear damped equations $u_{tt}+u_t-\Delta u=|u|^p$ with the initial data in $({\dot{H}^{-\gamma}}\cap H^s)\times({\dot{H}^{-\gamma}}\cap L^2)$. Chen-Reissig (2023) studied the case $0&lt;\gamma&lt;\frac{n}{2}$ and showed that the exponent $p_{\mathrm{crit}}=1+\frac{4}{n+2\gamma}$ of $p$ distinguishes the time global existence and the blow-up of solution. In this paper, we discuss the case $\gamma\ge\frac{n}{2}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22754v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the three-dimensional fluid-structure interaction system modeling a system consisting of a viscous incompressible fluid and an elastic plate forming its moving upper boundary. The fluid is described by the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations with a free upper boundary that evolves according to the motion of the structure, coupled via the velocity- and stress-matching conditions. We show that under a rather general condition on the initial data, there exists a global-in-time weak solution of the system. In particular, there is no contact between the plate and the bottom boundary.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the optimal cost of null controllability for the $n$-dimensional Stokes system when the control acts on $n-1$ scalar components. We establish a novel spectral estimate for low frequencies of the Stokes operator, involving solely $n-1$ components, and use it to show that the cost of controllability with controls having $n-1$ components remains of the same order in time as in the case of controls with $n$ components, namely $O(e^{C/T})$, i.e. the cost of null controllability is not affected by the absence of one component of the control. We also give several applications of our results.</description>

      <title>On Schauder estimates for nonlocal and mixed local-nonlocal viscous Hamilton$\unicode{x2013}$Jacobi equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07999v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove spatial Schauder estimates $\unicode{x2013}$ optimal regularity estimates in H\"older spaces $\unicode{x2013}$ and well-posedness results for mild and classical solutions of viscous Hamilton$\unicode{x2013}$Jacobi equations with subcritical nonlocal and mixed local-nonlocal diffusions in $\mathbb{R}^d$. Our results hold under mild assumptions on the nonlocal/mixed operators and Hamiltonians. The Laplacian, fractional Laplacians, nonsymmetric, spectrally one-sided, and strongly anisotropic integral operators, as well as sums of such operators are covered. We observe an interplay between the regularity of the initial data and the growth of the Hamiltonian in the gradient, and give results for the two canonical cases: (i) Lipschitz initial data and general Hamiltonians that are H\"older in space and merely locally Lipschitz in the gradient, and (ii) H\"older initial data and Hamiltonians that are H\"older in space and locally Lipschitz with power growth in the gradient. We compute explicit blow-up rates for $C^1$ and higher order H\"older norms as $t\to 0$. The results include short and long time existence of mild solutions, optimal regularity in H\"older spaces and corresponding Schauder a priori estimates, and that spatially smooth mild solutions are regular in time and pointwise classical solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00997v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the internal non null-controllability properties of the heat equation on 2-dimensional almost-Riemannian manifolds with an interior singularity, and under the assumption that the closure of the control zone does not contain the whole singularity. We show that if locally, around the singularity, the sub-Riemannian metric can be written in a Grushin form, or equivalently the sub-Laplacian writes as a generalized Grushin operator, then, achieving null-controllability requires at least a minimal amount of time. As locally the manifold looks like a rectangular domain, we consequently focus ourselves on the non null-controllability properties of the generalized Grushin-like heat equation on various Euclidean domains.</description>

      <title>Unraveling Self-Similar Energy Transfer Dynamics: a Case Study for 1D Burgers System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12764v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we consider the problem of constructing initial conditions for a flow model such that the resulting flow evolution leads to a self-similar energy cascade consistent with Kolmogorov's statistical theory of turbulence. As a first step in this direction, we focus on the one-dimensional viscous Burgers equation as a toy model. Its solutions exhibiting self-similar behavior, in a precisely-defined sense, are found by framing this problems in terms of PDE-constrained optimization. The main physical parameters are the time window over which self-similar behavior is sought (equal to approximately one eddy turnover time), viscosity (inversely proportional to the ``Reynolds number") and an integer parameter characterizing the distance in the Fourier space over which self-similar interactions occur. Local solutions to this nonconvex PDE optimization problems are obtained with a state-of-the-art adjoint-based gradient method. Two distinct families of solutions, termed viscous and inertial, are identified and are distinguished primarily by the behavior of enstrophy which, respectively, uniformly decays and grows in the two cases. The physically meaningful and appropriately self-similar inertial solutions are found only when a sufficiently small viscosity is considered. These flows achieve the self-similar behaviour by a uniform steepening of the wave fronts present in the solutions. The results obtained demonstrate that the proposed methodology may be used to search for self-similar behavior in more complex flow models, including shell models, 2D turbulence and, ultimately, 3D turbulence.</description>
