      <title>Search for a new charged particle in the mass range of 2-100 MeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the theory of electroweak interactions, there is no prohibition on the existence of particles with a mass other than that of an electron, muon and tauon. The task is to search for a new particle in the mass range of 2-100 MeV. The search was performed using the photo material of the 2-m propane bubble chamber. The chamber has been exposed in a 10 GeV proton beam at the JINR Synchrophasotron. For its search, ~55 thousand stereo photos have been scanned. The events of the $\gamma$ quantum conversion into a pair of charged particles have been analyzed. 50 anomalous events have been found in which one particle of the pair stops in the volume of the chamber, has an increased track density at the end of the range and, upon identification, detects a mass of ~ 8 MeV. The average value of the mass of the new particle is (8.5 $\pm$ 2.5) MeV</description>

      <title>Interpretable Machine Learning Methods Applied to Jet Background Subtraction in Heavy Ion Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.08275v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Jet measurements in heavy ion collisions can provide constraints on the properties of the quark gluon plasma, but the kinematic reach is limited by a large, fluctuating background. We present a novel application of symbolic regression to extract a functional representation of a deep neural network trained to subtract the background for measurements of jets in relativistic heavy ion collisions. We show that the deep neural network is approximately the same as a method using the particle multiplicity in a jet. This demonstrates that interpretable machine learning methods can provide insight into underlying physical processes.</description>

      <title>Testing effective field theory with the most general neutron decay correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Built on the seminal works by Jackson-Treiman-Wyld and Ebel-Feldman, we derive the most general free neutron differential decay rate where all massive particles (neutron, proton and electron) are polarized. This introduces 33 new correlations in addition to the 18 existing ones, which over-constrain the coupling constants in the low-energy effective field theory of charged weak interactions, and thus provides stringent tests of the validity of the theory framework itself. We classify the correlation coefficients in terms of their Standard Model limit and discrete symmetries, and study their expansion with respect to the new physics coupling strengths, supplemented by the experiment-independent $\mathcal{O}(\alpha)$ virtual electromagnetic radiative corrections.</description>

      <title>Muon Capture on $^{6}$Li, $^{12}$C, and $^{16}$O from $Ab~Initio$ Nuclear Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Muon capture on nuclei is one of the most promising probes of the nuclear electroweak current driving the yet-hypothetical neutrinoless double-beta ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay. Both processes involve vector and axial-vector currents at finite momentum transfer, $q\sim 100$ MeV, as well as the induced pseudoscalar and weak-magnetism currents. Comparing measured muon-capture rates with reliable $ab~initio$ nuclear-theory predictions could help us validate these currents. To this end, we compute partial muon-capture rates for $^{6}$Li, $^{12}$C and $^{16}$O, feeding the ground and excited states in $^{6}$He, $^{12}$B and $^{16}$N, using $ab~initio$ no-core shell model with two- and three-nucleon chiral interactions. We remove the spurious center-of-mass motion by introducing translationally invariant operators and approximate the effect of hadronic two-body currents by Fermi-gas model. We solve the bound-muon wave function from the Dirac wave equations in the Coulomb field created by a finite nucleus. We find that the computed rates to the low-lying states in the final nuclei are in good agreement with the measured counterparts. We highlight sensitivity of some of the transitions to the sub-leading three-nucleon interaction terms. We also compare summed rates to several tens of final states with the measured total capture rates and note that we slightly underestimate the total rate with this simple approach due to limited range of excitation energies.</description>

      <title>Symmetric cumulant $sc_{2,4} \left \{ 4 \right \}$ and asymmetric cumulant $ac_{2} \left \{ 3 \right \}$ from transverse momentum conservation and flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The multi-particle cumulants method can be used to reveal long-range collectivity in small and large colliding systems. The four-particle symmetric cumulant $sc_{2,4} \left \{ 4 \right \}$, three-particle asymmetric cumulant $ac_{2} \left \{ 3 \right \}$, and the normalised cumulants $nsc_{2,4} \left \{ 4 \right \}$ and $nac_{2} \left \{ 3 \right \}$ from the transverse momentum conservation and flow are calculated. The interplay between the two effects is also investigated. Our results are in good agreement with the recent ATLAS measurements of multi-particle azimuthal correlations with the subevent cumulant method, which provides insight into the origin of collective flow in small systems.</description>

      <title>Accessing the speed of sound in relativistic ultracentral nucleus-nucleus collisions using the mean transverse momentum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been argued that the speed of sound of the strong interaction at high temperature can be measured using the variation of the mean transverse momentum with the particle multiplicity in ultracentral heavy-ion collisions. We test this correspondence by running hydrodynamic simulations at zero impact parameter with several equations of state, at several colliding energies from 0.2 TeV to 15 TeV per nucleon pair. The correspondence is found to be precise and robust for a smooth, boost-invariant fluid and an ideal detector. We discuss the differences between this ideal setup and an actual experiment. We conclude that the extraction of the speed of sound from data is reliable, and that the main uncertainty comes from our poor knowledge of the distribution of density fluctuations at the early stages of the collision.</description>

      <title>Gluon Double-Spin Asymmetry in the Longitudinally Polarized $p+p$ Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the first-ever small-$x$ expression for the inclusive gluon production cross section in the central rapidity region of the longitudinally polarized proton-proton collisions. The cross section depends on the polarizations of both protons, therefore comprising the numerator of the longitudinal double-spin asymmetry $A_{LL}$ for the produced gluons. The cross section is calculated in the shock wave formalism and is expressed in terms of the polarized dipole scattering amplitudes on the projectile and target protons. We show that the small-$x$ evolution corrections are included into our cross section expression if one evolves these polarized dipole amplitudes using the double-logarithmic helicity evolution derived in \cite{Kovchegov:2015pbl, Kovchegov:2016zex, Kovchegov:2018znm, Cougoulic:2022gbk}. Our calculation is performed for the gluon sector only, with the quark contribution left for future work. When that work is complete, the resulting formula will be applicable to longitudinally polarized proton-proton and proton-nucleus collisions, as well as to polarized semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering (SIDIS) on a proton or a nucleus. Our results should allow one to extend the small-$x$ helicity phenomenology analysis of \cite{Adamiak:2023yhz} to the jet/hadron production data reported for the longitudinally polarized proton-proton collisions at RHIC and to polarized SIDIS measurements at central rapidities to be performed at the EIC.</description>

      <title>Direct high-precision measurement of the mass difference of $^{77}$As-$^{77}$Se related to neutrino mass determination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15242v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The first direct determination of the ground-state-to-ground-state ${\beta^{-}}$-decay $Q$-value of $^{77}$As to $^{77}$Se was performed by measuring their atomic mass difference utilizing the double Penning trap mass spectrometer, JYFLTRAP. The resulting $Q$-value is 684.463(70) keV, representing a remarkable 24-fold improvement in precision compared to the value reported in the most recent Atomic Mass Evaluation (AME2020). With the significant reduction of the uncertainty of the ground-state-to-ground-state $Q$-value and knowledge of the excitation energies in $^{77}$Se from $\gamma$-ray spectroscopy, the ground-state-to-excited-state $Q$-value of the transition $^{77}$As (3/2$^{-}$, ground state) $\rightarrow$ $^{77}$Se$^{*}$ (5/2$^{+}$, 680.1035(17) keV) was refined to be 4.360(70) keV. We confirm that this potential low $Q$-value ${\beta^{-}}$-decay transition for neutrino mass determination is energetically allowed at a confidence level of about 60$\sigma$. Nuclear shell-model calculations with two well-established effective Hamiltonians were used to estimate the partial half-life for the low $Q$-value transition. The half-life was found to be of the order of 10$^{9}$ years for this first-forbidden non-unique transition, which rules out this candidate a potential source for rare-event experiments searching for the electron antineutrino mass.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic Transition Form Factors of Baryon Resonances</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.13900v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent experimental and theoretical advancements have led to significant progress in our understanding of the electromagnetic structure of nucleons ($N$), nucleon excitations ($N^\ast$), and other baryons. These breakthroughs have been made possible by the capabilities of modern facilities, enabling the induction of photo- and electro-excitation of nucleon resonances. Recent experimental advances have sparked notable developments in theoretical approaches. New theoretical methods have been tested and proven to be robust, marking the beginning of a new era in our understanding on baryons. We present a comprehensive review of progress in experimental data on $\gamma^\ast N \to N^\ast$ reactions. Additionally, we discuss various analyses and theoretical results. Some of these methods have matured in their predictive power, offering new perspectives on exotic hadrons with multiquark components. We place special emphasis on both the low-$Q^2$ and large-$Q^2$ regions to reinforce crucial physical constraints on observables that hold in these limits. Furthermore, we illustrate that the combination of lattice QCD with chiral effective field theory and quark models, respectively, proves beneficial in interpreting data and applying constraints within those different regimes. As a practical contribution and for future reference, we review the formulas for helicity amplitudes, multipole form factors and the relations between these two sets of functions for transitions to resonances with general spin $J \geq \frac{1}{2}$. These formulas are ubiquitous and play a pivotal role in experimental and theoretical studies on baryon structure. Notably, the multipole transition form factors for $J \ge \frac{3}{2}$ resonances serve as valuable tools to test perturbative QCD results in the large-$Q^2$ region, thanks to the correlations between electric and magnetic transition form factors.</description>

      <title>HBT signature for clustered substructures probing primordial inhomogeneity in hot and dense QCD matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.17619v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel approach to probe primordial inhomogeneity in hot and dense matter which could be realized in non-central heavy-ion collisions. Although the Hanbury Brown and Twiss (HBT) interferometry is commonly used to infer the system size, the cluster size should be detected if substructures emerge in space. We demonstrate that a signal peak in the HBT two-particle correlation stands at the relative momentum corresponding to the spatial scale of pseudo one-dimensional modulation. We assess detectability using the data prepared by an event generator (AMPT model) with clustering implemented in the particle distribution.</description>

      <title>Symmetry energy and neutron star properties constrained by chiral effective field theory calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.04063v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the nuclear symmetry energy and neutron star properties using a Bayesian analysis based on constraints from different chiral effective field theory calculations using new energy density functionals that allow for large variations at high densities. Constraints at high densities are included from observations of GW170817 and from NICER. In particular, we show that both NICER analyses lead to very similar posterior results for the symmetry energy and neutron star properties when folded into our equation-of-state framework. Using the posteriors, we provide results for the symmetry energy and the slope parameter, as well as for the proton fraction, the speed of sound, and the central density in neutron stars. Moreover, we explore correlations of neutron star radii with the pressure and the speed of sound in neutron stars. Our 95\% credibility ranges for the symmetry energy $S_v$, the slope parameter $L$, and the radius of a 1.4$\msun$ neutron star, $R_{1.4}$, are $S_v=(30.6\text{--}33.9)$\,MeV, $L=(43.7\text{--}70.0)$\,MeV, and $R_{1.4}=(11.6\text{--}13.2)$\,km. Our analysis for the proton fraction shows that larger and/or heavier neutron stars are more likely to cool rapidly via the direct Urca process. Within our equation-of-state framework a maximum mass of neutron stars $M_{\rm max}&gt;2.1\msun$ indicates that the speed of sound needs to exceed the conformal limit.</description>

      <title>Electric dipole polarizability of low-lying excited states in atomic nuclei</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.10775v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Novel equations for the electric dipole polarizability $\alpha_{_{E1}}$ of low-lying excited states in atomic nuclei -- and the related $(-2)$ moment of the total photo-absorption cross section, $\sigma_{_{-2}}$ -- are inferred in terms of electric dipole and quadrupole matrix elements. These equations are valid for arbitrary angular momenta of the initial/ground and final/excited states and have been exploited in fully converged 1$\hbar\omega$ shell-model calculations of selected {\it p-} and {\it sd-}shell nuclei that consider configuration mixing; advancing previous knowledge from $^{17}$O to $^{36}$Ar, where thousands of electric dipole matrix elements are computed from isovector excitations which include the giant dipole resonance region. Our results are in reasonable agreement with previous shell-model calculations and follow -- except for $^{6,7}$Li and $^{17,18}$O -- Migdal's global trend provided by the combination of the hydrodynamic model and second-order non-degenerate perturbation theory. Discrepancies in $^{6,7}$Li and $^{17}$O arise as a result of the presence of $\alpha$-cluster configurations in odd-mass nuclei, whereas the disagreement in $^{18}$O comes from the mixing of intruder states, which is lacking in the shell-model interactions. More advanced \emph{ab initio} calculations of the dipole polarizability for low-lying excited states covering all the isovector states within the giant dipole resonance region are missing and could be very valuable to benchmark the results presented here and shed further light on how atomic nuclei polarize away from the ground state</description>

      <title>Rapidity scan approach for net-baryon cumulants with a statistical thermal model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.11374v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Utilizing rapidity-dependent measurements to map the QCD phase diagram provides a complementary approach to traditional beam-energy-dependent measurements around midrapidity. The changing nature of thermodynamic properties of QCD matter along the beam axis in heavy-ion collisions at low collision energies both motivates and poses challenges for this method. In this study, we derive the analytical cumulant-generating function for subsystems within distinct rapidity windows, while accounting for global net-baryon charge conservation of the full system. Rapidity-dependent net-baryon cumulants are then calculated for a system exhibiting inhomogeneity along the beam axis, and their sensitivity to finite acceptances through changing rapidity bin widths is explored. We highlight the nontrivial behaviors exhibited by these cumulants, underscoring their importance in establishing a noncritical baseline for interpreting net-proton cumulants in the search for the QCD critical point. Finally, we discuss the implications of the rapidity scan for mapping the QCD phase diagram within the current context.</description>

      <title>Light-by-Light Scattering at Next-to-Leading Order in QCD and QED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16956v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent experimental observation of Light-by-Light (LbL) scattering at the Large Hadron Collider has revived interest in this fundamental process, and especially of the accurate prediction of its cross-section, which we present here for the first time at Next-to-Leading Order (NLO) in both QCD and QED. We compare two radically different computational approaches, both exact in the fermion mass dependence, thus offering a strong cross-check of our results. The first approach is a fully analytic method to calculate compact and well-organized two-loop helicity amplitudes. The second one is entirely numerical and leverages the Local Unitarity construction. Our two calculations agree with each other and conclude that including the exact fermion mass contribution typically increases the size of the NLO corrections. Moreover, we find that the exact result converges slowly to the massless limit of the high-energy regime, thus emphasizing the importance of including the full mass dependence at NLO. We also compare our results with the ATLAS measurement of LbL in ultra-peripheral lead-lead collisions, and find that the inclusion of exact NLO corrections reduces, but does not eliminate, the existing tension with theoretical predictions.</description>
