      <title>Homogeneous Rota--Baxter Operators of Weight~0 on $B(q)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a complete and rigorous classification of homogeneous weight $0$ Rota--Baxter operators on the Block-type Witt algebra $B(q)$, assuming the operator has integral degree $(k,k') \in \mathbb{Z}^2$. A key correction is established in the non+resonant regime $q \ne k'$ with $k \ne 0$: the profile function $g(i) = f(-k,i)$ must satisfy the nonlinear functional equation \[ (i - j)g(i)g(j) = g(i+j+k')\big[(i + k' + q)g(i) - (j + k' + q)g(j)\big], \] which admits only constant, Kronecker-delta, or finite-support solutions. This excludes previously and erroneously claimed families such as non-constant polynomials, exponentials, or nontrivial periodic functions. In contrast, the resonant case $q = k'$ exhibits full flexibility: any profile $g$ is admissible, provided the operator is supported on the single line $m = -k$. The classification is cohomologically exhaustive for generic $q$ (i.e., when $H^1(B(q),B(q)) = 0$), and is applied to derive all homogeneous post-Lie structures and associated Lie algebra deformations.</description>

      <title>Asymmetry in Spectral Graph Theory: Harmonic Analysis on Directed Networks via Biorthogonal Bases (Adjacency-Operator Formulation)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical spectral graph theory and graph signal processing rely on a symmetry principle: undirected graphs induce symmetric (self-adjoint) adjacency/Laplacian operators, yielding orthogonal eigenbases and energy-preserving Fourier expansions. Real-world networks are typically directed and hence asymmetric, producing non-self-adjoint and frequently non-normal operators for which orthogonality fails and spectral coordinates can be ill-conditioned. In this paper we develop an original harmonic-analysis framework for directed networks centered on the \emph{adjacency} operator. We propose a \emph{Biorthogonal Graph Fourier Transform} (BGFT) built from left/right eigenvectors, formulate directed ``frequency'' and filtering in the non-Hermitian setting, and quantify how asymmetry and non-normality affect stability via condition numbers and a departure-from-normality functional. We prove exact synthesis/analysis identities under diagonalizability, establish sampling-and-reconstruction guarantees for BGFT-bandlimited signals, and derive perturbation/stability bounds that explain why naive orthogonal-GFT assumptions break down on non-normal directed graphs. A simulation protocol compares undirected versus directed cycles (asymmetry without non-normality) and a perturbed directed cycle (genuine non-normality), demonstrating that BGFT yields coherent reconstruction and filtering across asymmetric regimes.</description>

      <title>Polynomial Identities and Codimensions of Two- and Three-Dimensional Metabelian Non-Lie Leibniz Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over an arbitrary field, we conduct a comprehensive study of the polynomial identities and codimensions of two- and three-dimensional metabelian non-Lie Leibniz algebras. In addition, we compute the images of multihomogeneous polynomials on two-dimensional Leibniz algebras and, as a consequence, prove that the image of any multilinear polynomial evaluated on such algebras is always a vector space. Our analysis includes the three nontrivial isomorphism classes in dimension two and the ten isomorphism classes in dimension three, all of which are metabelian. In particular, we determine finite bases for their corresponding $T$-ideals and provide explicit bases for the associated relatively free graded algebras.</description>

      <title>A note on complete evolution algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This short note provides positive answers to two conjectures of Camacho, Khudoyberdiyev, and Omirov on the classification of complete evolution algebras. Our approach is based on analysing the solution set of a generic non-linear polynomial system of equations using elementary tools from algebraic geometry. We also obtain new results on subalgebras and idempotents of evolution algebras, and conclude by proposing a conjecture that may characterise solvable evolution algebras.</description>

      <title>A counterexample to DG version of Han's conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2004, Han proposed the following conjecture: let $B$ be a finite-dimensional $k$-algebra. If $\mathrm{HH}_{n}(B)\neq 0$ for only finitely many $n\in \mathbb{Z}$, then $B$ is smooth. This conjecture can be generalized to the DG setting: let $B$ be a finite-dimensional DG $k$-algebra. If $\mathrm{HH}_{n}(B)\neq 0$ for only finitely many $n\in \mathbb{Z}$, then $B$ is smooth. In this note, we show that the DG generalization of Han's conjecture is false.</description>

      <title>Transposed Poisson Structure on the Kantor double of Virasoro-like algebra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.12961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following Kantor's procedure, we construct the Kantor double of Virasoro-like algebra and delve into the study of transposed Poisson structures on this Lie superalgebra. Our findings establish that it lacks non-trivial 1/2 -derivations, and therefore, it does not exhibit a non-trivial transposed Poisson algebra structure.</description>

      <title>The structure of $k$-potents and mixed Jordan-power preservers on matrix algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $M_n(\mathbb{F})$ denote the algebra of $n \times n$ matrices over an algebraically closed field $\mathbb{F}$ of characteristic different from $2$. For $n \ge 2$, we classify all maps $\phi : M_n(\mathbb{F}) \to M_n(\mathbb{F})$ satisfying the mixed Jordan-power identity $$ \phi(A^{k} \circ B) = \phi(A)^{k} \circ \phi(B), \quad \text{for all } A,B \in M_n(\mathbb{F}), $$ where $\circ$ denotes the (normalized) Jordan product $A \circ B := \tfrac{1}{2}(AB + BA)$ and $k \in \mathbb{N}$. We show that every such map is either constant, taking a fixed $(k+1)$-potent value, or there exist an invertible matrix $T \in M_n(\mathbb{F})$, a ring monomorphism $\omega : \mathbb{F} \to \mathbb{F}$, and a $k$-th root of unity $\varepsilon \in \mathbb{F}$ such that $\phi$ takes one of the forms $$ \phi(X) = \varepsilon\, T\, \omega(X)\, T^{-1} \quad \text{ or } \quad \phi(X) = \varepsilon\, T\, \omega(X)^{t}\, T^{-1}, $$ where $\omega(X)$ denotes the matrix obtained by applying $\omega$ entrywise to $X$, and $(\cdot)^{t}$ denotes matrix transposition. In particular, every nonconstant solution is necessarily additive. The classification relies fundamentally on the preservation of $(k+1)$-potents and their intrinsic structural properties.</description>

      <title>Reversible and Reversible-Complement Double Cyclic Codes over F4+vF4 and its Application to DNA Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study the algebraic structure of double cyclic codes of length $(m, n)$ over $\mathbb{F}_4$ and we give a necessary and sufficient condition for a double cyclic code over $\mathbb{F}_4$ to be reversible. Also, we determine the algebraic structure of double cyclic codes of length $(m, n)$ over $\mathbb{F}_4+v\mathbb{F}_4$ with $v^2=v$, satisfying the reverse constraint and the reverse-complement constraint. Then we establish a one-to-one correspondence $\psi$ between the 16 DNA double pairs $S_{D_{16}} $ and the 16 elements of the finite ring $\mathbb{F}_4+v\mathbb{F}_4$. We also discuss the GC-content of DNA double cyclic codes.</description>

      <title>The free $F$-restriction semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a geometric model for the free $X$-generated $F$-restriction semigroup in the extended signature $(\cdot\,, ^+, ^m,\lambda)$, where the unary operation $^m$ maps an element $a$ to the maximum element $a^m$ of its $\sigma$-class, and the constant $\lambda$ is the unique left identity. This model is based on a certain quotient of the Cayley graph expansion of the free monoid $X^*$ with respect to the extended set of generators $X\cup \overline{X^*}$, where the generators from $\overline{X^*}$ are in a bijection with the free monoid $X^*$ and serve to capture the maximum elements of $\sigma$-classes of the quotient. We also provide models for the free $X$-generated strong and perfect $F$-restriction semigroups in the same extended signature. The constructed models enable us to solve the word problems for all the free objects under consideration.</description>

      <title>Harmonic Analysis on Directed Networks: A Biorthogonal Laplacian Framework for Non-Normal Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical spectral graph theory relies on the symmetry of the adjacency and Laplacian operators, which guarantees orthogonal eigenbases and energy-preserving Fourier transforms. However, real-world networks are intrinsically directed and asymmetric, resulting in non-normal operators where standard orthogonality assumptions fail. In this paper, we develop a rigorous harmonic analysis framework for directed graphs centered on the \emph{Combinatorial Directed Laplacian} ($L = D_{out} - A$). We construct a \emph{Biorthogonal Graph Fourier Transform} (BGFT) using dual left and right eigenbases, and introduce a directed variational semi-norm based on the operator norm $\|Lx\|_2$ rather than the quadratic form. We derive exact Parseval-type bounds that quantify the energy distortion induced by the non-normality of the graph, explicitly linking signal reconstruction stability to the condition number of the eigenvector matrix, $\kappa(V)$. Finally, we present experimental validation comparing normal directed cycles against non-normal perturbed topologies, demonstrating that while the BGFT provides exact reconstruction in ideal regimes, the geometric departure from normality acts as the fundamental limit on filter stability in directed networks.</description>

      <title>Moduli stacks of quiver connections and non-Abelian Hodge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In arXiv:2407.11958, a moduli stack parametrizing $I$--indexed diagrams of Higgs bundles over a base stack $X$ was constructed for any finite simplicial set $I$, inspiring speculations about extending the non-Abelian Hodge correspondence to these moduli stacks. In the present work, we formalize the de Rham side of this conjectural extension. We construct moduli stacks parametrizing diagrams of bundles with $\lambda$--connections over a base prestack $X$, where $\lambda$ can be a fixed number or a parameter. Taking $\lambda$ to be $1$ gives a moduli stack parametrizing diagrams of bundles with connection, while taking it to be a parameter gives a version of Simpson's non-Abelian Hodge filtration for digrams of bundles with connection. We show that when $X$ is a smooth and projective scheme over an algebraically closed field $k$ of characteristic $0$, these moduli stacks are algebraic and locally of finite presentation, and have affine diagonal.</description>

      <title>Skew-symmetrizable cluster algebras from surfaces and symmetric quivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study skew-symmetrizable cluster algebras $\mathcal{A}$ associated with unpunctured surfaces $\mathbf{S}$ endowed with an orientation-preserving involution $\sigma$. Cluster variables of $\mathcal{A}$ correspond to $\sigma$-orbits of arcs of $\mathbf{S}$, while clusters are given by admissible $\sigma$-invariant ideal triangulations. We provide a cluster expansion formula for any $\sigma$-orbit $[\gamma]$ in terms of perfect matchings of some labeled modified snake graphs constructed from the arcs of $[\gamma]$. Then, we associate a symmetric finite-dimensional algebra $A$ to any seed of $\mathcal{A}$, such that non-initial cluster variables bijectively correspond to orthogonal indecomposable $A$-modules. Finally, we exhibit a purely representation-theoretic map from the category of orthogonal $A$-modules to $\mathcal{A}$.
  If $\mathbf{S}$ is a regular polygon, we recover the results proved in arXiv:2403.11308, arXiv:2405.14915, and arXiv:2502.06410 for cluster algebras of type B.</description>

      <title>Discrete quantum groups and their duals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discrete quantum groups were introduced as duals of compact quantum groups by Podle\'s and Woronowicz in 1990. Shortly after, they were defined and studied intrinsically by Effros and Ruan, and by this author. In 1998, with the introduction of the multiplier Hopf algebras with integrals (also called algebraic quantum groups), the duality between discrete and compact quantum groups became part of the more general duality in the self-dual category of these algebraic quantum groups. Again a few years later the duality was extended to all locally compact quantum groups.
  In these notes, we give a new and a somewhat updated approach of the theory of discrete quantum groups. In particular, we view them as special cases of algebraic quantum groups. The duality between the compact quantum groups and the discrete quantum groups is seen in this larger context. This has a number of advantages as we will explain.
  On the one hand, we provide quite a bit of information about how all of this fits into the more general theory of algebraic quantum groups and its duality. Occasionally, we even go one step further and look at the most general case of locally compact quantum groups. Also sometimes, we compare with known results in pure Hopf algebra theory. On the other hand however, we have tried to make these notes highly self-contained. The aim of these notes in the first place is not to give new results but rather to review known results in a more modern perspective, taking into account recent developments. We believe this may be helpful for people who want to work with compact and discrete quantum groups now.</description>

      <title>Counting Cholesky factorizations of the zero matrix over $\mathbb{F}_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A square, upper-triangular matrix $U$ is a Cholesky root of a matrix $M$ provided $U^*U=M$, where $\cdot^*$ represents the conjugate transpose when working over the complex field and $U^*=U^T$ over the reals and finite fields. In this paper, we investigate the number of such factorizations over the finite field with two elements, $\mathbb{F}_2$, and prove the equinumerosity, for each fixed rank, of the Cholesky roots of and the upper-triangular square roots of the zero matrix. We then provide asymptotics for this count and finish with a few directions for future inquiry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.12519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the enumerative and asymptotic properties related to Hermitian $\ell$-complementary codes on the unitary space over $\F_{q^2}$. We provide some closed form expressions for the counting formulas of Hermitian $\ell$-complementary codes. There is a similarity in the asymptotic weight distribution between Hermitian self-orthogonal codes and unrestricted codes. Furthermore, we study the asymptotic behavior of Hermitian self-orthogonal codes whose minimum distance is at least $d$. In particular, we conclude that MDS codes within the class of Hermitian self-orthogonal codes are asymptotically dense when the alphabet size approaches to infinity.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study deformations of crossed homomorphisms on Lie groups by means of the cohomology which controls them. Using the Moser type argument, we obtain several rigidity results of crossed homomorphisms on Lie groups. We further investigate the relationship between the cohomology of crossed homomorphisms on Lie groups and that on Lie algebras. Finally, we characterize the rigidity properties of all crossed homomorphisms with respect to the conjugation action on the connected and simply connected two-dimensional Lie group.</description>

      <title>Intervals of torsion pairs and generalized Happel-Reiten-Smal{\o} tilting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{A}$ be an abelian category with a torsion pair $(\mathcal{T},\mathcal{F})$. Happel-Reiten-Smalo tilting provides a method to construct a new abelian category $\mathcal{B}$ with a torsion pair associated to $(\mathcal{T},\mathcal{F})$, which is exactly the heart of a certain $t$-structure on the bounded derived category $D^b(\mathcal{A})$. In this paper, we mainly study generalized HRS tilting. We first show that an interval of torsion pairs in extriangulated categories with negative first extensions is bijectively associated with torsion pairs in the corresponding heart, which yields several new observations in triangulated categories. Then we obtain a generalization of HRS tilting by replacing hearts of $t$-structures with extended hearts. As an application, we show that certain $t$-structures on triangulated subcategories can be extended to $t$-structures on the whole triangulated categories.</description>

      <title>Groupoid Graded Semisimple Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03141v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop the theory of groupoid graded semisimple rings. Our rings are neither unital nor one-sided artinian. Instead, they exhibit a strong version of having local units and being locally artinian, and we call them $\Gamma_0$-artinian. One of our main results is a groupoid graded version of the Wedderburn-Artin Theorem, where we characterize groupoid graded semisimple rings as direct sums of graded simple $\Gamma_0$-artinian rings and we exhibit the structure of this latter class of rings. In this direction, we also prove a groupoid graded version of Jacobson-Chevalley density theorem. We need to define and study properties of groupoid gradings on matrix rings (possibly of infinite size) over groupoid graded rings, and specially over groupoid graded division rings. Because of that, we study groupoid graded division rings and their graded modules. We consider a natural notion of freeness for groupoid graded modules that, when specialized to group graded rings, gives the usual one, and show that for a groupoid graded division ring all graded modules are free (in this sense). Contrary to the group graded case, there are groupoid graded rings for which all graded modules are free according to our definition, but they are not graded division rings. We exhibit an easy example of this kind of rings and characterize such class among groupoid graded semisimple rings. We also relate groupoid graded semisimple rings with the notion of semisimple category defined by B. Mitchell. For that, we show the link between functors from a preadditive category to abelian groups and graded modules over the groupoid graded ring associated to this category, generalizing a result of P. Gabriel. We characterize simple artinian categories and categories for which every functor from them to abelian groups is free in the sense of B. Mitchell.</description>

Abstract: Our paper "Solving Third Order Linear Difference Equations in Terms of Second Order Equations" gave two algorithms for solving difference equations in terms of lower order equations: an algorithm for absolute factorization, and an algorithm for solving third order equations in terms of second order. Here we improve the efficiency for absolute factorization, and extend the other algorithm to order four.</description>

      <title>Graded chain conditions and graded Jacobson radical of groupoid graded modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03667v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we continue to lay the groundwork for the theory of groupoid graded rings and modules. The main topics we address include graded chain conditions, the graded Jacobson radical, and the gr-socle for graded modules. We present several descending (ascending) chain conditions for graded modules and we refer to the most general one as $\Gamma_0$-artinian ($\Gamma_0$-noetherian). We show that $\Gamma_0$-artinian (resp. $\Gamma_0$-noetherian) modules share many properties with artinian (noetherian) modules in the classical theory. However, we present an example of a right $\Gamma_0$-artinian ring that is not right $\Gamma_0$-noetherian. Following the pattern of the classical case, we examine the basic properties of the graded Jacobson radical and the gr-socle for groupoid graded modules. We also establish some fundamental properties of the graded Jacobson radical of groupoid graded rings. Finally, we introduce the notion of gr-semilocal ring, which simultaneously generalizes the concepts of semilocal ring and (small) semilocal category.</description>

      <title>Module structure of Weyl algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19344v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The seminal paper "J.T. Stafford, Module structure of Weyl algebras, J. London Math. Soc. (2) 18 (1978), no. 3, 429--442" was a major step forward in our understanding of Weyl algebras. Beginning with Serre's Theorem on free summands of projective modules and Bass' Stable Range Theorem in commutative algebra, we attempt to trace the origins of this work and explain how it led to Stafford's construction of non-holonomic simple modules over Weyl algebras. We also describe Bernstein-Lunt's geometric construction of infinite families of non-holonomic simple modules. We recall more recent developments related to Weyl algebras, especially that of parametrizing right ideals in the first Weyl algebra and its relation to Calogero-Moser spaces. Finally, we revisit Stafford's results in the context of quantized symplectic singularities, where they lead naturally to open problems on the behaviour of simple modules.</description>

      <title>Structure and Invariants of Weyl-Type Algebras with Hyperbolic Sine Generators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06491v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces and systematically studies a class of Weyl-type algebras enriched with hyperbolic sine and power generators over a field of characteristic zero, defined as $A_{p,t,\cA} = \Weyl{\sinh(\pm x^{p} \sinh(t)),\; \sinh(\cA x),\; x^{\cA}}$ in the associative setting and $\Nass{\sinh(\pm x^{p} \sinh(t)),\; \sinh(\cA x),\; x^{\cA}}$ in a non-associative framework. We establish fundamental structural properties, including the triviality of the center for the non-associative version and the explicit description $Z(A_{p,t,\cA}) = \FF[\sinh(\pm x^{p} \sinh(t))]$ for the associative one, proving that $A_{p,t,\cA}$ is an Azumaya algebra over its center and represents a nontrivial class in the Brauer group $\Br(\FF(y))$. Furthermore, we compute the Gelfand--Kirillov dimension for relevant examples and demonstrate its key properties, such as additivity under tensor products and the growth dichotomy. We completely characterize the automorphism group of $A_{p,t,\cA}$ as a semidirect product of a torus with a discrete group, and provide a sharp isomorphism criterion showing that the parameter $t$ is a complete invariant in the family. The paper concludes with two open problems concerning the GK dimension of non-associative hyperbolic sine algebras and the classification of their deformations, pointing toward future research directions in non-associative growth theory and deformation rigidity.</description>

      <title>Triangular Prism Equations and Categorification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.06522v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the triangular prism equations (TPE) for fusion categories, obtained by evaluating triangular prisms in terms of tetrahedra. Using an oriented graphical calculus, we show that the geometric symmetries of the regular tetrahedron are preserved. In the spherical case, we prove that the TPE are equivalent to the pentagon equations after a suitable change of basis. These equations provide new insight for managing complexity via localization. As a consequence, and using the Fuchs-Runkel-Schweigert theorem on the second Frobenius-Schur indicator, we obtain new categorification criteria. As an application, we solve all remaining open cases to complete the classification of unitary 1-Frobenius simple integral fusion categories up to rank 8 and up to Frobenius-Perron dimension 20000.</description>

      <title>Codes in algebras of direct products of groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09695v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we obtain the Wedderburn-Artin decomposition of a semisimple group algebra associated to a direct product of finite groups. We also provide formulae for the number of all possible group codes, and their dimensions, that can be constructed in a group algebra. As particular cases, we present the complete algebraic description of the group algebra of any direct product of groups whose direct factors are cyclic, dihedral, or generalised quaternion groups.</description>
