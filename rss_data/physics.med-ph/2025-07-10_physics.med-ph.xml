      <title>Magneto-radiative modelling and artificial neural network optimization of biofluid flow in a stenosed arterial domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing complexity of cardiovascular diseases and limitations in traditional healing methods mandate the invention of new drug delivery systems that assure targeted, effective, and regulated treatments, contributing directly to UN SDGs 3 and 9, thereby encouraging the utilization of sustainable medical technologies in healthcare. This study investigates the flow of a Casson-Maxwell nanofluid through a stenosed arterial domain. The quantities, such as skin friction and heat transfer rate, are analysed in detail. The Casson-Maxwell fluid shows a lower velocity profile than the Casson fluids, which indicates the improved residence time for efficient drug delivery. The heat transfer rate shows an increase with higher volume fractions of copper and aluminium oxide nanoparticles and a decrease with higher volume fractions of silver nanoparticles. The skin friction coefficient decreases by 219% with a unit increase in the Maxwell parameter, whereas it increases by 66.1% with a unit rise in the Casson parameter. This work supports SDGs 4 and 17 by fostering interdisciplinary learning and collaboration in fluid dynamics and healthcare innovation. Additionally, the rate of heat flow was forecasted (with an overall R-value of 0.99457) using the Levenberg-Marquardt backpropagation training scheme under the influence of magneto-radiative, linear heat source and Casson-Maxwell parameters along with the tri-metallic nanoparticle volume fractions. It is also observed that the drag coefficient is most sensitive to the changes in the Maxwell parameter.</description>

      <title>A hybrid dosimetry approach for remote audits in Ir-192 HDR interstitial brachytherapy: Development and pilot implementation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: This work presents the development and pilot implementation of a comprehensive remote dosimetry audit for Ir-192 High Dose Rate interstitial brachytherapy, integrating experimental and computational dosimetry procedures into a unified workflow. TG43 and Model Based Dose Calculations Algorithms (MBDCAs) are both considered. Methods: A compact, water-equivalent phantom was designed to hold two catheters, ten Optically Stimulated Luminescent Dosimeters (OSLDs) and two radiochromic films, enabling point and 2D dose measurements. A user-selected treatment plan was created using a clinical Treatment Planning System (TPS), tailored to the optimal dose range of the dosimeters. A computational dosimetry audit test was also performed via Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, enabling independent 3D dose calculations for the same plan and phantom geometry. All dosimetry results were compared to TPS calculations (TG43 and an MBDCA) using the Gamma Index (GI) test, dose difference maps, and dose-volume histogram comparisons, wherever applicable. The protocol was designed to minimize clinical workload. Results: This study was completed within ten days of phantom delivery to the clinic. If necessary, measurements were corrected using appropriate correction factors determined through side studies. GI passing criteria were adapted to the uncertainty of each dosimetry system. Excellent agreement was found between MBDCA and experimental or MC results. Within the volume of interest, TG43 systematically overestimated dose compared to MC (median difference: 2.16%), attributed to missing scatter and phantom material. Conclusion: Despite the labor-intensive workflow, this protocol supports remote Ir-192 audits with acceptable uncertainties. Combining experimental and computational methods enhances the robustness of the audit. This hybrid approach shows clear advantages for rigorous dosimetry auditing programs.</description>

      <title>Robust Containerization of the High Angular Resolution Functional Imaging (HARFI) Pipeline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Historically, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of the brain has focused primarily on gray matter, particularly the cortical gray matter and associated nuclei. However, recent work has demonstrated that functional activity in white matter also plays a meaningful role in both cognition and learning. In previous work, we introduced the High Angular Resolution Functional Imaging (HARFI) pipeline, which demonstrated both local and global patterns of functional correlation in white matter. Notably, HARFI enabled exploration of asymmetric voxel-wise correlation using odd-order spherical harmonics. Although the original implementation of HARFI was released via GitHub, adoption was limited due to the technical complexity of running the source code. In this work, we present a robust and efficient containerized version of the HARFI pipeline, enabling seamless execution across multiple public datasets. Our goal is to facilitate broader and deeper exploration of functional white matter architecture, especially through the lens of high angular resolution functional correlations. The key innovation of this work is the containerized implementation, which we have made available under a permissive open-source license to support reproducible and accessible research practices.</description>

      <title>Integrated Open-Source Framework for Simulation of Transcatheter Pulmonary Valves in Native Right Ventricular Outflow Tracts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06337v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background - Pulmonary insufficiency is a consequence of transannular patch repair in Tetralogy of Fallot (ToF), leading to late morbidity and mortality. Transcatheter native outflow tract pulmonary valve replacement (TPVR) has become common, but assessment of patient candidacy and selection of the optimal device remains challenging. We demonstrate an integrated open-source workflow for simulation of TPVR in image-derived models to inform device selection.
  Methods - Machine learning-based segmentation of CT scans was implemented to define the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT). A custom workflow for device positioning and pre-compression was implemented in SlicerHeart. Resulting geometries were exported to FEBio for simulation. Visualization of results and quantification were performed using custom metrics implemented in SlicerHeart and FEBio.
  Results - RVOT model creation and device placement could be completed in under 1 minute. Virtual device placement using FE simulations visually mimicked actual device placement and allowed quantification of vessel strain, stress, and contact area. Regions of higher strain and stress were observed at the proximal and distal end locations of the TPVs where the devices impinge the RVOT wall. No other consistent trends were observed across simulations. The observed variability in mechanical metrics across RVOTS, stents, and locations in the RVOT highlights that no single device performs optimally in all anatomies, thereby reinforcing the need for simulation-based patient-specific assessment.
  Conclusions - This study demonstrates the feasibility of a novel open-source workflow for the rapid simulation of TPVR which with further refinement may inform assessment of patient candidacy and optimal device selection.</description>

      <title>Circulating tumor cell detection in cancer patients using in-flow deep learning holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are cancer cells found in the bloodstream that serve as biomarkers for early cancer detection, prognostication, and disease monitoring. However, CTC detection remains challenging due to low cell abundance and heterogeneity. Digital holographic microscopy (DHM) offers a promising, label-free method for high-throughput CTC identification by capturing superior morphological information compared to traditional imaging methods, while remaining compatible with in-flow data acquisition. We present a streamlined DHM-based system that integrates microfluidic enrichment with deep learning-driven image analysis, supplemented by immunofluorescent profiling, to improve the sensitivity and specificity of CTC enumeration. Specifically, our platform combines inertial microfluidic preprocessing with dual-modality imaging, integrating holography with fluorescence sensing of up to two markers. A deep learning model, trained on a diverse set of healthy blood samples and cancer cell lines, and executed in real-time, provides a morphological confidence on a cell-by-cell basis that may then be combined with immunofluorescence criteria for enumeration. In a pilot study, we demonstrate significantly higher CTC counts in patients with late-stage prostate cancer (n=13) compared to healthy controls (n=8), with a patient-level false positive rate of 1 cell/mL. Notably, nearly two-thirds of identified CTCs were EpCAM-negative but PSMA positive (a prostate specific epithelial marker), suggesting that traditional use of EpCAM as an epithelial marker for CTCs may lead to false negatives. These findings highlight the potential of DHM for applications including but not limited to screening, diagnostics, and precision oncology.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nanophotonics, an interdisciplinary field merging nanotechnology and photonics, has enabled transformative advancements across diverse sectors including green energy, biomedicine, and optical computing. This review comprehensively examines recent progress in nanophotonic principles and applications, highlighting key innovations in material design, device engineering, and system integration. In renewable energy, nanophotonic allows light-trapping nanostructures and spectral control in perovskite solar cells, concentrating solar power, and thermophotovoltaics. That have significantly enhanced solar conversion efficiencies, approaching theoretical limits. For biosensing, nanophotonic platforms achieve unprecedented sensitivity in detecting biomolecules, pathogens, and pollutants, enabling real-time diagnostics and environmental monitoring. Medical applications leverage tailored light-matter interactions for precision photothermal therapy, image-guided surgery, and early disease detection. Furthermore, nanophotonics underpins next-generation optical neural networks and neuromorphic computing, offering ultra-fast, energy-efficient alternatives to von Neumann architectures. Despite rapid growth, challenges in scalability, fabrication costs, and material stability persist. Future advancements will rely on novel materials, AI-driven design optimization, and multidisciplinary approaches to enable scalable, low-cost deployment. This review summarizes recent progress and highlights future trends, including novel material systems, multidisciplinary approaches, and enhanced computational capabilities, to pave the way for transformative applications in this rapidly evolving field.</description>

      <title>Segmentation Regularized Training for Multi-Domain Deep Learning Registration applied to MR-Guided Prostate Cancer Radiotherapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background: Accurate deformable image registration (DIR) is required for contour propagation and dose accumulation in MR-guided adaptive radiotherapy (MRgART). This study trained and evaluated a deep learning DIR method for domain invariant MR-MR registration. Methods: A progressively refined registration and segmentation (ProRSeg) method was trained with 262 pairs of 3T MR simulation scans from prostate cancer patients using weighted segmentation consistency loss. ProRSeg was tested on same- (58 pairs), cross- (72 1.5T MR Linac pairs), and mixed-domain (42 MRSim-MRL pairs) datasets for contour propagation accuracy of clinical target volume (CTV), bladder, and rectum. Dose accumulation was performed for 42 patients undergoing 5-fraction MRgART. Results: ProRSeg demonstrated generalization for bladder with similar Dice Similarity Coefficients across domains (0.88, 0.87, 0.86). For rectum and CTV, performance was domain-dependent with higher accuracy on cross-domain MRL dataset (DSCs 0.89) versus same-domain data. The model's strong cross-domain performance prompted us to study the feasibility of using it for dose accumulation. Dose accumulation showed 83.3% of patients met CTV coverage (D95 &gt;= 40.0 Gy) and bladder sparing (D50 &lt;= 20.0 Gy) constraints. All patients achieved minimum mean target dose (&gt;40.4 Gy), but only 9.5% remained under upper limit (&lt;42.0 Gy). Conclusions: ProRSeg showed reasonable multi-domain MR-MR registration performance for prostate cancer patients with preliminary feasibility for evaluating treatment compliance to clinical constraints.</description>

      <title>A Digital Twin Framework for Adaptive Treatment Planning in Radiotherapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14701v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The development of a digital twin (DT) framework for fast online adaptive proton therapy planning in prostate stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) with dominant intraprostatic lesion (DIL) boost represents a significant advancement in personalized radiotherapy. This framework integrates deep learning-based multi-atlas deformable image registration, daily patient anatomy updates via cone-beam CT (CBCT), and knowledge-based plan quality evaluation using the ProKnow scoring system to achieve clinical-equivalent plan quality with substantially reduced reoptimization times compared to traditional clinical workflows. Drawing on a database of 43 prior prostate SBRT cases, the DT framework predicts interfractional anatomical variations for new patients and pre-generates multiple probabilistic treatment plans. Upon acquiring daily CBCT, it enables rapid plan reoptimization, achieving an average reoptimization time of 5.5 [2.8, 8.2] minutes, compared to 19.8 [7.9, 31.7] minutes for clinical plans. The DT-based plans yielded a plan quality score of 157.2 [151.6, 162.8], surpassing or matching clinical plans, with superior dose coverage for the DIL (V100: 99.5%) and clinical target volume (CTV V100: 99.8%). Additionally, the framework minimized doses to organs at risk (OARs), achieving bladder V20.8Gy of 11.4 [7.2, 15.6] cc, rectum V23Gy of 0.7 [0.3, 1.1] cc, and urethra D10 of 90.9% [88.6%, 93.2%], aligning with clinical standards. By addressing interfractional variations efficiently, the DT framework enhances treatment precision, reduces OAR toxicity, and supports real-time adaptive radiotherapy. This transformative approach not only streamlines the planning process but also improves clinical outcomes, offering a scalable solution for prostate SBRT with DIL boost and paving the way for broader applications in adaptive proton therapy.</description>
