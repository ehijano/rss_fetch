      <title>Working Paper: Conflicts and the New Scramble for African Resources -- A Shift-Share Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper estimates the causal effect of mineral trade on conflicts in Africa using a Shift-Share IV approach based on an exogenous price-commodity shock. The main result is that an increase in mineral trade significantly increases the number of conflicts while it has no clear effect on fatalities. Exploring heterogeneous effects, I find that a specific group of minerals, oil and fuels, drives the results on the number of conflicts. Moreover, the group of rare minerals such as coltan, precious metals or cobalt has no effect on the number of conflicts but appears to have an important impact on the number of fatalities.</description>

      <title>Solving stochastic climate-economy models: A deep least-squares Monte Carlo approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic versions of recursive integrated climate-economy assessment models are essential for studying and quantifying policy decisions under uncertainty. However, as the number of stochastic shocks increases, solving these models as dynamic programming problems using deterministic grid methods becomes computationally infeasible, and simulation-based methods are needed. The least-squares Monte Carlo (LSMC) method has become popular for solving optimal stochastic control problems in quantitative finance. In this paper, we extend the application of the LSMC method to stochastic climate-economy models. We exemplify this approach using a stochastic version of the DICE model with all five main uncertainties discussed in the literature. To address the complexity and high dimensionality of these models, we incorporate deep neural network approximations in place of standard regression techniques within the LSMC framework. Our results demonstrate that the deep LSMC method can be used to efficiently derive optimal policies for climate-economy models in the presence of uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Games with Planned Actions and Scouting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study games in which every action requires planning and preparation. Moreover, before players act, they can revise their plans based on partially revealing information that they receive on their adversary's preparations. In turn, we examine how players' information over each others' planned actions influences winning odds in matching pennies games, and how it incentivises the use of decoys, deception, and camouflage. Across scenarios, we emphasize that the decomposition of an action into (i) a preparation to act and (ii) the execution of the action, allows to analyze one-shot simultaneous-move games, where players partially observe each others' contemporaneous actions.</description>

      <title>Participatory Mapping of Local Green Hydrogen Cost-Potentials in Sub-Saharan Africa</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Green hydrogen is a promising solution within carbon free energy systems with Sub-Saharan Africa being a possibly well-suited candidate for its production. However, green hydrogen in Sub-Saharan Africa is not yet investigated in detail. This work determines the green hydrogen cost-potential for green hydrogen within this region. Therefore, a potential analysis for PV, wind and hydropower, groundwater analysis, and energy systems optimization are conducted. The results are evaluated under local socio-economic factors. Results show that hydrogen costs start at 1.6 EUR/kg in Mauritania with a total potential of ~259 TWh/a under 2 EUR/kg in 2050. Two third of the regions experience groundwater limitations and need desalination at surplus costs of ~1% of hydrogen costs. Socio-economic analysis show, that green hydrogen deployment can be hindered along the Upper Guinea Coast and the African Great Lakes, driven by limited energy access, low labor costs in West Africa, and high labor potential in other regions.</description>

      <title>Paired Completion: Flexible Quantification of Issue-framing at Scale with LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting and quantifying issue framing in textual discourse - the perspective one takes to a given topic (e.g. climate science vs. denialism, misogyny vs. gender equality) - is highly valuable to a range of end-users from social and political scientists to program evaluators and policy analysts. However, conceptual framing is notoriously challenging for automated natural language processing (NLP) methods since the words and phrases used by either `side' of an issue are often held in common, with only subtle stylistic flourishes separating their use. Here we develop and rigorously evaluate new detection methods for issue framing and narrative analysis within large text datasets. By introducing a novel application of next-token log probabilities derived from generative large language models (LLMs) we show that issue framing can be reliably and efficiently detected in large corpora with only a few examples of either perspective on a given issue, a method we call `paired completion'. Through 192 independent experiments over three novel, synthetic datasets, we evaluate paired completion against prompt-based LLM methods and labelled methods using traditional NLP and recent LLM contextual embeddings. We additionally conduct a cost-based analysis to mark out the feasible set of performant methods at production-level scales, and a model bias analysis. Together, our work demonstrates a feasible path to scalable, accurate and low-bias issue-framing in large corpora.</description>

      <title>Regional and spatial dependence of poverty factors in Thailand, and its use into Bayesian hierarchical regression analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Poverty is a serious issue that harms humanity progression. The simplest solution is to use one-shirt-size policy to alleviate it. Nevertheless, each region has its unique issues, which require a unique solution to solve them. In the aspect of spatial analysis, neighbor regions can provide useful information to analyze issues of a given region. In this work, we proposed inferred boundaries of regions of Thailand that can explain better the poverty dynamics, instead of the usual government administrative regions. The proposed regions maximize a trade-off between poverty-related features and geographical coherence. We use a spatial analysis together with Moran's cluster algorithms and Bayesian hierarchical regression models, with the potential of assist the implementation of the right policy to alleviate the poverty phenomenon. We found that all variables considered show a positive spatial autocorrelation. The results of analysis illustrate that 1) Northern, Northeastern Thailand, and in less extend Northcentral Thailand are the regions that require more attention in the aspect of poverty issues, 2) Northcentral, Northeastern, Northern and Southern Thailand present dramatically low levels of education, income and amount of savings contrasted with large cities such as Bangkok-Pattaya and Central Thailand, and 3) Bangkok-Pattaya is the only region whose average years of education is above 12 years, which corresponds (approx.) with a complete senior high school.</description>

      <title>Multi-level emission impacts of electrification and coal pathways in China's netzero transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04332v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Decarbonizing China's energy system necessitates both greening the power supply and end-use electrification. However, there are concerns that electrification may be premature while coal power dominates. Using a global climate mitigation model, we examine multiple high electrification scenarios with different coal phase-out timelines. On an aggregate level, the pace of Chinese power sector decarbonization is climate significant. A ten-year delay in coal phase-out could alone increase global warming by around 0.011{\deg}C. However, on energy service and sectoral level there is no evidence of large-scale premature electrification even under slower coal phase-out. This challenges the sequential interpretation of the "order of abatement" - electrification can begin only when the power sector is almost decarbonized. As long as power emission intensity reduces to below 150 kgCO2/MWh by 2040, even with the current power supply mix, early scale-up of electrification brings a huge gain in CO2 abatement in the medium- to long-term, equivalent to approximately 0.04{\deg}C avoided warming.</description>

      <title>China's plug-in hybrid electric vehicle transition: an operational carbon perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07308v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Assessing the emissions of plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) operations is crucial for accelerating the carbon-neutral transition in the passenger car sector. This study is the first to adopt a bottom-up model to measure the real-world energy use and carbon dioxide emissions of China's top twenty selling PHEV models across different regions from 2020 to 2022. The results indicate that (1) the actual electricity intensity of the best-selling PHEV models (20.2-38.2 kWh/100 km) was 30-40% higher than the New European Driving Cycle values, and the actual gasoline intensity (4.7-23.5 L/100 km) was 3-6 times greater than the New European Driving Cycle values. (2) The overall energy use of the best-selling models varied among different regions, and the energy use from 2020 to 2022 in Southern China was double that Northern China and the Yangtze River Middle Reach. (3) The top-selling models emitted 4.7 megatons of carbon dioxide nationwide from 2020 to 2022, with 1.9 megatons released by electricity consumption and 2.8 megatons released by gasoline combustion. Furthermore, targeted policy implications for expediting the carbon-neutral transition within the passenger car sector are proposed. In essence, this study explores and compares benchmark data at both the national and regional levels, along with performance metrics associated with PHEV operations. The main objective is to aid nationwide decarbonization efforts, focusing on carbon reduction and promoting the rapid transition of road transportation toward a net-zero carbon future.</description>
