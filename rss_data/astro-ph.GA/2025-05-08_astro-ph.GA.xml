      <title>SAPPHIRES: Extremely Metal-Poor Galaxy Candidates with $12+{\rm log(O/H)}&lt;7.0$ at $z\sim5-7$ from Deep JWST/NIRCam Grism Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Population III stars, the hypothetical first generation metal-free stars, have yet to be discovered. Even after three years of successful JWST operations, studies have shown that most galaxies identified to date at $z &gt; 5$ exhibit a metallicity floor of $Z\gtrsim2\%\,Z_{\odot}$, possibly due to unknown selection biases toward bright galaxies or rapid metal enrichment. To address this question, we search for galaxies with low R3$=$[OIII]$\,\lambda$5008/H$\beta$ ratios as part of the JWST Cycle-3 large treasury program, the Slitless Areal Pure-Parallel HIgh-Redshift Emission Survey (SAPPHIRES). Using deep NIRCam Wide-Field Slitless Spectrscopy (WFSS) data, we report the discovery of seven extremely metal-poor galaxy candidates in the SAPPHIRES Early Data Release field, with estimated $12+{\rm log(O/H)}&lt;7.0$ at $z\sim5-7$, including two sources with $Z&lt;1\%\,Z_{\odot}$, significantly breaking the metallicity floor observed both locally and at high redshift. These candidates appear extremely faint ($\sim28-30\,$ F200W AB mag) and low-mass (${\rm log}(M_{*}/M_{\odot})\sim6.8-7.8$), as expected from the mass-metallicity relation. They also exhibit very blue UV slopes ($-2.6\lesssim\beta\lesssim-2.0$), likely due to low dust content $A_{V}\lesssim0.2\,{\rm mag}$ or young stellar ages $\sim5-20\,{\rm Myr}$. Compared to galaxies at similar redshift, they appear exceptionally bursty in their star formation activity. Our results highlight the power of NIRCam/WFSS in identifying extremely metal-poor galaxies, from just a single pointing, with more data to come in SAPPHIRES. This underscores the potential of pure-parallel programs towards achieving JWST's primary science goal: discovering the first pristine stars and galaxies. Deep JWST/NIRSpec follow-up observations will also be essential to confirm their nature and perform detailed chemical abundance analyses.</description>

      <title>SHELLQs-JWST Unveils the Host Galaxies of Twelve Quasars at $z&gt;6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of JWST has opened new horizons in the study of quasar host galaxies during the reionization epoch ($z &gt; 6$). Building upon our previous initial uncovering of stellar light from two quasar host galaxies at these redshifts, we now report the detection of the stellar light from the full Cycle 1 sample of 12 distant moderate-luminosity quasar ($M_{1450}&gt;-24$ mag) host galaxies at $z&gt;6$ from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP). Using JWST/NIRCam observations at 1.5 and 3.6 $\mu$m combined with 2D image decomposition analysis, we successfully detect the host galaxies in 11 out of 12 targets, underscoring the high detection rates achievable with moderate-luminosity quasars. Based on two-band photometry and SED fitting, we find that our host galaxies are massive with log~M$_*$/M$_{\odot} = 9.5\text{-}11.0$. The effective radii range from 0.6 to 3.2 kpc which is comparable to the sizes of inactive galaxies with similar masses as measured with imaging from COSMOS-Web. Intriguingly, the two quasar hosts with post-starburst features, which reside at the high-mass end of our sample and exhibit relatively compact morphologies, are consistent (at the 1-$\sigma$ level) with quiescent galaxies at $z\sim4\text{-}5$ in terms of their sizes and stellar mass surface densities. These findings support the so-called galaxy compaction scenario already being valid at the reionization epoch ($z&gt;6$), in which gas inflows during starburst phases drive centrally concentrated star formation followed by rapid quenching, bridging the structural transition of massive galaxies from relatively extended star-forming disks to compact quiescent systems.</description>

      <title>Assessing the connection between galactic conformity and assembly-type bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Galaxies in the Universe show a conformity in the fraction of quenched galaxies out to large distances, being quite larger around quenched central galaxies than for star-forming ones. On the other hand, simulations have shown that the clustering of halos and the galaxies within them depends on secondary properties other than halo mass, a phenomenon termed assembly bias. Aims. Our aim is to study whether samples that show galactic conformity also show assembly bias and to see if the amplitude of these two effects is correlated. Methods. We use synthetic galaxies at $z = 0$ from the semi-analytical model SAG run on the MultiDark Planck 2 (MDPL2) cosmological simulation and measure both conformity and galaxy assembly bias for different samples of central galaxies at fixed host halo mass. We focus on central galaxies hosted by low-mass halos of 10$^{11.6}$ $\leq$ $M_{\rm h}$/$h^{-1}$ M$_{\odot}$ $&lt;$ 10$^{11.8}$ because it is a mass range where the assembly bias has been reported to be strong. The samples of central galaxies are separated according to their specific star formation rate and stellar age. Results. We find that the level of conformity shown by our different samples is correlated with the level of assembly bias measured for them. We also find that removing galaxies around massive halos diminishes the conformity signal and lowers the amount of assembly bias. Conclusions. The high correlation in the amplitude of conformity and assembly bias for different samples with and without removing galaxies near massive halos clearly indicates the strong relationship between both phenomena.</description>

      <title>Evidence for universal gas depletion in a sample of 41 luminous Type 1 quasars at z $\sim$ 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present ALMA CO observations of the molecular gas in a sample of 41 luminous unobscured quasars at z $\sim$ 2 from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. 32 targets comprise the main sample observed in CO(3-2) and 9 targets have archival ALMA data of CO(3-2), CO(4-3) and CO(7-6). All quasars have rest-UV to optical spectra tracing ionised gas in the broad line region (e.g. CIV) and the narrow line region (e.g. [OIII]) and they cover the full range of outflow properties in the SDSS quasar population at these redshifts. 15 out of the 32 quasars in the main sample are detected in CO(3-2) and five out of the nine archival quasars are also detected in CO. The median gas mass for all 20 CO detected quasars is 8.0 $\pm$ 1.5 $\times$ 10$^9$ M$_{\odot}$ with a median M$_{dyn}$ of 1.4 $\pm$ 0.9 $\times$ 10$^{11}$ M$_{\odot}$. We find gas fractions in the range 0.02 - 0.32, which are generally lower than both inactive galaxies and obscured quasars at similar redshifts. We suggest an evolutionary trend in gas fractions of quasar host galaxies from obscured and gas rich to unobscured and gas poor. We note a tentative correlation between the gas fractions and the broad-line region properties with quasars showing high CIV blueshifts, indicating stronger broad-line region winds, having higher gas fractions. Six of the quasars corresponding to 15% of the sample also show evidence for at least one companion galaxy detected in CO at the same redshift.</description>

      <title>Many body effects in the line radiative transfer equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The radiative transfer equation for spectral lines from an extended gas is derived from first principles, treating the gas as a system of many atoms/molecules rather than isolated ones. Line broadening effects are assumed to be dominated by particle motions (Doppler effect), but collisional broadening effects are included in the impact approximation. We retrieve the canonical radiative transfer equation under the condition that the optical depth over a coherence length, defined as the transition-levels lifetime times the speed of light, is much lower than unity. For other cases, the line radiative transfer equation contains a correction factor whose magnitude depends exponentially on the coherent optical depth. We compute that many-body effects affect line radiative transfer of strongly emitting and astronomically ubiquitous radio- and submillimter lines, such as the HI 21 cm line, and rotational transitions of the main isotopologue of CO. These results imply that care must be taken when interpreting observations relying on these lines, as many-body effects can significantly alter emergent line profiles and bias inferred physical conditions of the emitting gas.</description>

      <title>Broad line region echo from rapidly accreting intermediate-mass black hole candidate SDSS J144850.08+160803.1. The first probe of intra-night variability and reverberation mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Elusive intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs; $100~M_{\odot} \leq M_{\rm BH}\leq 2\times10^{5}~M_{\odot}$) can act as ``time-squeezing'' machines, enabling studies of AGN geometry through reverberation mapping (RM) on much shorter timescales than their supermassive siblings. Aims. The broad line region (BLR) radius constraints for IMBH candidates with different Eddington ratios probe the unexplored faint end of radius--luminosity ($R-L$) relations and allow us to build a robust $M_{\rm BH}$ estimator. This study aims to (a) confirm a rapidly accreting IMBH candidate; (b) demonstrate the feasibility of the first photometric BLR reverberation mapping (RM) campaign for this class of objects. Methods. The IMBH candidate J1448+16 was identified in the broad H$\alpha$-selected spectroscopic sample from SDSS. We carried out narrow-band H$\alpha$ and broad-band SDSS~g\'~monitoring to check small-scale variability and extract the time lag between the BLR and accretion disk (AD) continuum during 5 months (March--July 2024) using a 60-cm telescope at the Caucasus Mountain Observatory. Results. We confirmed the candidate as an active IMBH using XMM-Newton as a bright X-ray point source with the photon index $\Gamma = 2.32^{+0.15}_{-0.13}$, suggesting the high accretion rate. From a combination of SDSS optical spectra and XMM-Newton observations, we estimate the black hole mass in the range $\sim 0.9-2.4~\times10^{5} M_{\odot}$ and the Eddington rate from $\sim 37-112\%$. We report high-amplitude $\sim 60\%$ intra-night ($\sim 2$~h) H$\alpha$ variability in this highly accreting IMBH. In addition, we extracted a tentative measurement of a BLR RM radius $\sim 1-8~\mathrm{days}$. Conclusions. This work is a proof of concept for further IMBH variability studies and BLR RM campaigns, which will be essential for the calibration of the $R-L$ relation at the faint end.</description>

      <title>The MUSE view of Lyman-$\alpha$ nebulae in High redshift Radio Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results of VLT/MUSE integral field spectroscopic observations of the Ly$\alpha\,$ emission nebulae associated with 11 high redshift ($z \geq 2.9$) radio galaxies (HzRGs) with DEC $&lt;25^{\circ}$. When considering the other nine sources with available archival MUSE data, these observations increase the coverage to half of the currently known HzRGs. For two sources we are unable to confirm the original identification, as no Ly$\alpha\,$ emission was detected. We produce narrow band images centered on the Ly$\alpha\,$ line, extract their nuclear spectra, map their ionized gas kinematics, and derive the Ly$\alpha\,$ surface brightness profiles (SBPs). The SBPs are generally well reproduced by an exponential law with a typical scale length of $\sim 20-30$ ckpc. We measure emission line ratios finding most sources in agreement with an AGN origin for their gas ionization, with a single object hinting at strong star formation. Regarding the connection between the radio and ionized gas emission, we find that while the Ly$\alpha\,$ nebulae are preferentially aligned with the direction of the radio emission, there is no clear correlation in terms of size or gas kinematics, and only a weak trend connecting their radio and Ly$\alpha\,$ luminosities. The alignment is most likely the result of anisotropic nuclear emission rather than of a direct impact of the jets into the ionized gas.</description>

      <title>The Isaac Newton Telescope Monitoring Survey of Local Group Dwarf Galaxies. VII. Long-Period Variable Stars in the Nearest Starburst Dwarf Galaxy, IC 10</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To identify long-period variable (LPV) stars in IC10 - the nearest starburst galaxy of the Local Group (LG) - we conducted an optical monitoring survey using the 2.5-m Isaac Newton Telescope (INT) with the wide-field camera (WFC) in the i-band and V-band from 2015 to 2017. We created a photometric catalog for 53,579 stars within the area of CCD4 of WFC ($\sim$ 0.07 deg$^2$ corresponding to 13.5 kpc$^2$ at the distance of IC10), of which we classified 536 and 380 stars as long-period variable candidates (LPVs), mostly asymptotic giant branch stars (AGBs) and red supergiants (RSGs), within CCD4 and two half-light radii of IC10, respectively. By comparing our output catalog to the catalogs from Pan-STARRS, Spitzer Space Telescope, Hubble Space Telescope (HST), and carbon stars from the Canada-France-Hawai'i Telescope (CFHT) survey, we determined the success of our detection method. We recovered $\sim$ 73% of Spitzer's sources in our catalog and demonstrated that our survey successfully identified 43% of the variable stars found with Spitzer, and also retrieved 40% of the extremely dusty AGB stars among the Spitzer variables. In addition, we successfully identified $\sim$ 70% of HST variables in our catalog. Furthermore, we found all the confirmed LPVs that Gaia DR3 detected in IC10 among our identified LPVs. This paper is the first in a series on IC10, presenting the variable star survey methodology and the photometric catalog, available to the public through the Centre de Donn\'ees Astronomiques de Strasbourg.</description>

      <title>Barycenter kinematics in Local Group analogues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new way to identify systems similar to our Local Group (LG) of galaxies in cosmological simulations. Our method uses as a new constraint the speed and direction of the LG's center of mass, which we can measure accurately from cosmic microwave background data. When we apply these criteria to different cosmological simulations and compare the results with traditional selection methods, we find statistically significant differences. Our approach produces simulated galaxy pairs where the relative M31 velocity is less radial (2 to 10 percent difference over the mean) and more tangential (1 to 4 percent difference over the mean) than in cases that do not take into account the barycenter speed. The radial change pattern appears consistently across all cosmological models we test, showing that matching the observed barycenter velocity has a measurable effect when modeling and interpreting Local Group-like systems.</description>

      <title>Beyond Morphology: Challenges in Decomposing Massive Stellar Halos in Sombrero-like, Halo-Embedded Disk Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sombrero-like galaxies exhibit unique structural properties that challenge traditional photometric decomposition methods. In this study, we investigate their structural differences using both photometric and kinematic approaches to assess the extent to which photometric decomposition may misidentify key components, particularly the stellar halo. We select 270 Sombrero-like galaxies at redshift z=0 from the TNG50 simulation, applying filters to include only those with stellar mass $M_{\ast} &gt; 10^{10}M_{\odot}$ and stellar halo mass fraction $0.3 &lt; f_{\rm halo} &lt; 0.6$. Synthetic images are generated using the GALAXEV population synthesis code, and photometric decomposition is carried out on both face-on and edge-on views using GALFIT. We then compare these results with kinematic decomposition based on the auto-GMM method, focusing on differences in recovered structural parameters such as mass fractions and S'ersic indices.Sombrero-like galaxies typically consist of disks embedded in massive stellar halos and may account for 30-60% of galaxies in TNG50. However, their identification is complicated by structural degeneracies and the presence of disk features (e.g., bars, spirals, star formation) at low or moderate inclinations. In face-on projections, photometric decomposition systematically overestimates disk fractions as stellar halos are almost absent, while edge-on analysis provides only approximate halo fractions. Radial profiles show discrepancies between photometric and kinematic decomposition, particularly in central regions. Additionally, no conclusive link exists between the S'ersic index n and the presence of large stellar halos, challenging the use of n as a merger history proxy. These findings underscore the need for improved decomposition methods to better understand the complex structures of Sombrero-like galaxies.</description>

      <title>The ALMA-ATOMS Survey: Exploring Protostellar Outflows in HC$_3$N</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first systematic study of bipolar outflows using HC$_3$N as a tracer in a sample of 146 massive star-forming regions from ALMA-ATOMS survey. Protostellar outflows arise at the initial stage of star formation as a consequence of active accretion. In general, these outflows play a pivotal role in regulating the star formation processes by injecting energetic material in the parent molecular clouds. In such process, lower velocity components of outflows contain a significant portion of the energy. However, extraction of those component is difficult as the corresponding gas is often mixed with that of the ambient cloud. In our sample, we identified 44 bipolar outflows and one explosive outflow in HC$_3$N (J=11--10). The host clumps of these outflows are found to be at different evolutionary stages, suggesting that outflows in HC$_3$N are detectable in different stages of star formation. Also, the non-correlation of HC$_3$N outflows with clump evolutionary stages suggests that HC$_3$N is an unbiased tracer of outflows. Analyses revealed that HC$_3$N performs slightly better in detecting low-velocity components of outflows than traditionally employed tracers like SiO. The derived outflow parameters (i.e outflow mass, momentum, and energy) show moderate correlations with clump mass and luminosity. Our analysis of outflow opening angles and position-velocity diagrams across the outflow lobes show that, HC$_3$N is not only a good tracer of low-velocity outflows, but can also detect high-velocity collimated outflows. Overall, this study indicates that HC$_3$N can be used as a complementary outflow tracer along with the traditionally known outflow tracers, particularly in the detection of the low-velocity components of outflows.</description>

      <title>MAMMOTH-MOSFIRE: Environmental Effects on Galaxy Interstellar Medium at $z\sim2$</title>

Abstract: The MAMMOTH-MOSFIRE program is a deep Keck MOSFIRE K-band spectroscopic follow-up of emission-line galaxies identified in the MAMMOTH-Grism HST WFC3/G141 slitless spectroscopic survey, targeting the core regions of three most massive galaxy protoclusters at cosmic noon. To introduce this program, we present a comprehensive analysis of the emission-line diagnostics for a unique sample of 43 protocluster member galaxies at $z\sim2$, investigating the impact of the overdense environment on their interstellar medium conditions. We characterize their ionization and excitation state using the $\rm [N\,II]\lambda$6584, $\rm [S\,II]\lambda\lambda$6717,6731, and $\rm [O\,I]\lambda$6300 BPT diagrams, from a full suite of rest-frame optical emission lines jointly covered by Keck MOSFIRE and HST G141 spectroscopy. Our analysis reveals a median electron density of $n_{\rm e}\approx290~{\rm cm}^{-3}$ from $\rm [S\,II]$ doublets, consistent with measurements from field galaxies at similar redshifts. Like their field counterparts at $z\sim2$, protocluster galaxies exhibit a systematic offset in the N2 BPT diagram compared to the local star-forming sequence, but no offset in the S2 BPT diagram. Notably, we find significantly enhanced $\rm [O\,I]/H{\alpha}$ ratios, which can be well explained by photoionization models incorporating both $\rm H\,II$ regions and shock excitation. This work highlights the powerful synergy between high-resolution Keck MOSFIRE K-band spectroscopy and HST G141 slitless spectroscopy, enabling comprehensive coverage of the rest-frame optical spectra of galaxies at $z\sim2$.</description>

      <title>Environment of SDSS quasars at $z=0.4$$-$$1.0$ explored by Subaru HSC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The relationship between quasars and their galaxy environment is important for understanding the evolution of galaxies and supermassive black holes, but it is not fully understood. We perform a wide and deep exploration of the environment of quasars at $0.4 &lt; z &lt; 1.0$ using the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP) survey. We investigate the environment of the 1,912 spectroscopically selected quasars from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), using photometrically selected galaxies from the HSC-SSP data, over an area of 505 deg${^{2}}$. The quasar environment is compared to the environment of matched galaxies with similar stellar mass and redshift. We employ the $k$-nearest neighbor method to define the local galaxy number density for both the quasars and the matched galaxies at a scale of a few hundred kpc. As a result, we find that the number density of galaxies around SDSS quasars is lower than that of the matched galaxies by $\sim$11--$20\%$. We also investigate possible correlations between the local galaxy number densities and the quasar properties such as black hole mass and Eddington ratio. As a result, no correlation is found between the local galaxy number densities and these properties of quasars. These results suggest that the quasar activity is not triggered by the high number density of surrounding galaxies at the scale of a few hundred kpc.</description>

      <title>WALLABY pilot survey: properties of HI-selected dark sources and low surface brightness galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the optical counterparts of the 1829 neutral hydrogen (HI) detections in three pilot fields in the Widefield ASKAP L-band Legacy All-sky Blind surveY (WALLABY) using data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Legacy Imaging Surveys DR10. We find that 17 per cent (315) of the detections are optically low surface brightness galaxies (LSBGs; mean $g$-band surface brightness within 1 $ R_e$ of $&gt; 23$ mag arcsec$^{-2}$) and 3 per cent (55) are optically 'dark'. We find that the gas-rich WALLABY LSBGs have low star formation efficiencies, and have stellar masses spanning five orders of magnitude, which highlights the diversity of properties across our sample. 75 per cent of the LSBGs and all of the dark HI sources had not been catalogued prior to WALLABY. We examine the optically dark sample of the WALLABY pilot survey to verify the fidelity of the catalogue and investigate the implications for the full survey for identifying dark HI sources. We assess the HI detections without optical counterparts and identify 38 which pass further reliability tests. Of these, we find that 13 show signatures of tidal interactions. The remaining 25 detections have no obvious tidal origin, so are candidates for isolated galaxies with high HI masses, but low stellar masses and star-formation rates. Deeper HI and optical follow-up observations are required to verify the true nature of these dark sources.</description>

      <title>Mass Modeling the Andromeda Dwarf Galaxies: Andromeda VI and Andromeda XXIII</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately mapping the mass profiles of low mass dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies allows us to test predictions made by dark matter (DM) models. To date, such analyses have primarily been performed on Milky Way (MW) satellites. Meanwhile, the Andromeda Galaxy (M31) is home to 35 known dwarf galaxies, yet only two have been successfully mass-modeled so far. In order to better understand the nature of dark matter, a more comprehensive study of Local Group dwarfs is necessary. In this study, we have undertaken a dynamical study of two higher-luminosity Andromeda dwarf galaxies: Andromeda VI (And VI) and Andromeda XXIII (And XXIII). We infer an enclosed mass for And VI of M(r &lt; r$_{\rm{h}}$) = (4.9 $\pm$ 1.5) $\times$ 10$^{7}$ M$_{\odot}$, corresponding to a mass-to-light ratio of $[M/L]_{r_{\rm{h}}}$ = (27.1 $\pm$ 8.2) M$_{\odot}$/L$_{\odot}$. We infer an enclosed mass for And XXIII of M(r &lt; r$_{\rm{h}}$) = (3.1 $\pm$ 1.9) $\times$ 10$^{7}$ M$_{\odot}$, corresponding to a mass-to-light ratio of $[M/L]_{\rm{r_{h}}}$ = (90.2 $\pm$ 53.9) M$_{\odot}$/L$_{\odot}$. Using the dynamical Jeans modeling tool, GravSphere, we determine And VI and And XXIII's dark matter density at 150 pc, finding $\rho_{\rm{DM,VI}}$(150 pc) = (1.4 $\pm$ 0.5) $\times$ 10$^{8}$ M$_{\odot}$ kpc$^{-3}$ and $\rho_{\rm{DM,XXIII}}$(150 pc) = 0.5$\substack{+0.4 \\ -0.3} \times$ 10$^{8}$ M$_{\odot}$ kpc$^{-3}$. Our results make And VI the first mass-modeled M31 satellite to fall into the cuspy regime, while And XXIII has a lower density, implying either a more cored central dark matter density, or a lowering of the density through tides. This adds And XXIII to a growing list of M31 dwarfs with a central density lower than most MW dwarfs and lower than expected for isolated dwarfs in the Standard Cosmology. This could be explained by the M31 dwarfs having experienced stronger tides than their Milky Way counterparts.</description>

      <title>A disturbance in the force. How force fluctuations hinder dynamical friction and induce core stalling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamical friction is an important phenomena in stellar dynamics resulting in the slowing down of a test particle upon many two-body scatters with background particles. Chandrasekhar's original formulation, developed for idealized infinite and homogeneous systems, has been found to be sufficiently accurate even in models of finite extent and radially dependent density profiles. However, in some cases $N-$body simulations evidenced a breakdown of Chandrasekhar's formalism. In particular, in the case of cored stellar systems, the analytical predictions underestimate the rate of in-fall of the test particle. Several explanations for such discrepancy have been proposed so far, in spite of this it remains unclear whether the origin is a finite N effect or an effect arising from the resonance of the orbits of the test and field particles, which is independent on $N$, such as dynamical buoyancy. Here we aim at shedding some light on this issue with tailored numerical experiments. We perform ad hoc simulations of a massive tracer initially placed on a low eccentricity orbit in spherical equilibrium models with increasing resolution. We use an $N-$body code where the self-consistent interaction among the background particles can be substituted with the effect of the static smooth potential of the system's continuum limit, so that the higher order contributions to the dynamical friction arising from the formation of a wake can be neglected if needed. We find that, contrary to what reported in the previous literature, a suppression of dynamical friction happens in both cuspy and cored models. When neglecting the interaction among field particles we observe in both cases a clear $N^{-1/2}$ scaling of the radius at which dynamical friction ceases to be effective. This hints towards a granularity-induced origin of the so-called core-stalling of the massive tracer in cored models.</description>

      <title>Cosmic reflections I: the structural diversity of simulated and observed low-mass galaxy analogues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dwarf galaxies serve as powerful laboratories for investigating the underlying physics of galaxy evolution including the impact of baryonic feedback processes and environmental influences. We compare the visual and structural properties of dwarf galaxies in ultra-deep HSC-SSP imaging of the COSMOS field with those measured from realistic HSC-like synthetic observations of dwarfs generated by the Illustris TNG50 and NewHorizon simulations. Using S\'ersic profile fitting and non-parametric morphological metrics (Gini, $M_{20}$, asymmetry, and concentration), we evaluate the diversity of structural properties in observed and simulated galaxies.
  Our analysis shows that NewHorizon and TNG50 galaxies lie at opposite extremes of observed structural trends: NewHorizon produces diffuse, extended galaxies with shallow S\'ersic indices, while TNG50 yields compact, concentrated systems with steep indices. Both simulations reproduce observed structural trends more closely at higher stellar masses ($M_{\star}\sim10^{9.5} {\rm M_{\odot}}$) but fail to capture the full diversity of COSMOS dwarfs at lower masses. Non-parametric metrics further show that NewHorizon galaxies exhibit more uneven, clumpy light distributions while TNG50 galaxies have smoother but excessively concentrated profiles. These structural differences reflect underlying differences in their physical prescriptions and are likely driven by differing approaches to ISM physics, supernova feedback and star formation in addition to differences in numerical resolution.
  Our findings highlight the unique power of low-mass galaxies to constrain differences in simulation physics, especially star formation and feedback. Upcoming surveys from facilities like the Vera C. Rubin Observatory and Euclid will enable more rigorous comparisons with simulations, offering deeper insights into the physical processes shaping galaxy evolution.</description>

      <title>PANCAKE: Python bAsed Numerical Color-magnitude-diagram Analysis pacKagE</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar populations serve as a fossil record of galaxy formation and evolution, providing crucial information about the history of star formation and galaxy evolution. The color-magnitude diagram (CMD) stands out as the most accurate tool currently available for inferring the star formation histories (SFHs) of nearby galaxies with stellar-resolved multiband data. The launch of new space telescopes, including JWST, EUCLID, and the upcoming CSST and Roman, will significantly increase the number of stellar-resolved galaxies over the next decade. A user-friendly and customizable CMD fitting package would be valuable for galaxy evolution studies with these data. We develop an open-source Python-based package named \textsc{pancake}, which is fast and accurate in determining SFHs and stellar population parameters in nearby galaxies. We have validated our method via a series of comprehensive tests. First, \textsc{pancake} performs well on mock data, meanwhile the random and systematic uncertainties are quantified. Second, \textsc{pancake} performs well on observational data containing a star cluster and 38 dwarf galaxies (50 fields). Third, the star formation rate (SFR) from \textsc{pancake} is consistent with the SFR from FUV photometry. To ensure compatibility and accuracy, we have included isochrone libraries generated using PARSEC for most of the optical and near-infrared filters used in space telescopes such as HST, JWST, and the upcoming CSST.</description>

      <title>Scintillometry of Fast Radio Bursts: Resolution effects in two-screen models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) exhibit scintillation and scattering, often attributed to interactions with plasma screens in the Milky Way and the host galaxy. When these two screens appear "point-like" to each other, two scales of scintillation can be observed with sufficient frequency resolution. A screen perceives a second screen as extended or resolved when the angular size of the latter is smaller than the angular resolution of the former. We define the ratio of these two as the Resolution Power (RP). Previous observational studies have argued that, in the resolving regime, scintillations disappear, assuming that a screen resolving another screen is equivalent to a screen resolving an incoherent emission region. In this theoretical and simulation-based study of resolving effects in two-screen scenarios, we argue that resolving quenches only the relatively broad-scale scintillation and that this quenching is a gradual process. We present qualitative and quantitative predictions for dynamic spectra, spectral autocorrelation functions (ACF), and modulation indices in resolved and unresolved regimes of two-screen systems. We show that the spectral ACF of a two-screen system has a product term in addition to the sum of individual screen contributions, causing the total modulation index to rise to \sqrt(3) in the unresolved regime. To aid in discovering resolving systems, we also present observable trends in multi-frequency observations of a screen resolving another screen or incoherent emission. Additionally we introduce a new formula to estimate the distance between the FRB and the screen in its host galaxy. We also show that this formula, like previous ones in the literature, is only applicable to screens that are two-dimensional in the plane of the sky.</description>

      <title>CAPERS-LRD-z9: A Gas Enshrouded Little Red Dot Hosting a Broad-line AGN at z=9.288</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present CAPERS-LRD-z9, a little red dot (LRD) which we confirm to be a $z=9.288$ broad-line AGN (BLAGN). First identified as a high-redshift LRD candidate from PRIMER NIRCam photometry, follow-up NIRSpec/PRISM spectroscopy of CAPERS-LRD-z9 from the CANDELS-Area Prism Epoch of Reionization Survey (CAPERS) has revealed a broad $3500$ km s$^{-1}$ H$\beta$ emission line and narrow [O III]$\lambda\lambda4959,5007$ lines, indicative of a BLAGN. Based on the broad H$\beta$ line, we compute a canonical black-hole mass of $\log(M_{\textrm{BH}}/M_{\odot})=7.58\pm0.15$, although full consideration of systematic uncertainties yields a conservative range of $6.65&lt;\log(M_{\textrm{BH}}/M_{\odot})&lt;8.50$. These observations suggest that either a massive black hole seed, or a lighter stellar remnant seed undergoing periods of super-Eddington accretion, is necessary to grow such a massive black hole in $\lesssim500$ Myr of cosmic time. CAPERS-LRD-z9 exhibits a strong Balmer break, consistent with a central AGN surrounded by dense ($\sim 10^{10}\textrm{ cm}^{-3}$) neutral gas. We model CAPERS-LRD-z9 using CLOUDY to fit the emission red-ward of the Balmer break with a dense gas-enshrouded AGN, and bagpipes to fit the rest-ultraviolet emission as a host-galaxy stellar population. This upper limit on the stellar mass of the host galaxy ($&lt;10^9\,{\rm M_\odot}$) implies that the black-hole to stellar mass ratio may be extremely large, possibly $&gt;5\%$ (although systematic uncertainties on the black-hole mass prevent strong conclusions). However, the shape of the UV continuum differs from typical high-redshift star-forming galaxies, indicating that this UV emission may also be of AGN origin, and hence the true stellar mass of the host may be still lower.</description>

      <title>The eROSITA Final Equatorial Depth Survey (eFEDS): SDSS spectroscopic observations of X-ray sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03872v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present one of the largest uniform optical spectroscopic surveys of X-ray selected sources to date that were observed as a pilot study for the Black Hole Mapper (BHM) survey. The BHM program of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)-V is designed to provide optical spectra for hundreds of thousands of X-ray selected sources from the SRG/eROSITA all-sky survey. This significantly improves our ability to classify and characterise the physical properties of large statistical populations of X-ray emitting objects. Our sample consists of 13079 sources in the eROSITA eFEDS performance verification field, 12011 of which provide reliable redshifts from 0&lt;z&lt;5.8. The vast majority of these objects were detected as point-like sources (X-ray flux limit F(0.5-2 keV)&gt;6.5x10^-15 erg/s/cm^2) and were observed for about 20 years with fibre-fed SDSS spectrographs. After including all available redshift information for the eFEDS sources from the dedicated SDSS-V plate programme and archival data, we visually inspected the SDSS optical spectra to verify the reliability of these redshift measurements and the performance of the SDSS pipeline. The visual inspection allowed us to recover reliable redshifts (for 99% of the spectra with a signal-to-noise ratio of &gt;2) and to assign classes to the sources, and we confirm that the vast majority of our sample consists of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Only ~3% of the eFEDS/SDSS sources are Galactic objects. We also show the diversity of the optical spectra of the X-ray selected AGNs and provide spectral stacks with a high signal-to-noise ratio in various sub-samples with different redshift and optical broad-band colours. Our AGN sample contains optical spectra of (broad-line) quasars, narrow-line galaxies, and optically passive galaxies. It is considerably diverse in its colours and in its levels of nuclear obscuration.</description>

      <title>The Dark Matter Diffused Supernova Neutrino Background</title>

Abstract: We consider neutrinos scattering off Milky Way dark matter and the impact of this scattering on supernovae neutrinos. This can take the form of attenuation on the initial flux of neutrinos and a time-delayed flux of scattered neutrinos. Considering dark matter masses above 100 MeV and past Milky Way supernovae, we find this time-delayed flux is nearly constant in time. We call this flux the Dark Matter Diffused Supernova Neutrino Background (DMDSNB), and use Super-K limits on the Diffuse Supernova Neutrino Background (DSNB) flux to set limits on the dark matter-neutrino scattering cross section. We find $\sigma_{\rm DM-\nu}/m_{\rm DM} \lesssim 2.4 \times 10^{-24} \mathrm{cm^2}$/GeV for $m_{\rm DM} \gtrsim 1$ GeV, which is the strongest bound to date on dark matter-neutrino scatterings at MeV energies, and stronger than bounds set from SN1987A neutrino attenuation by an order of magnitude. We end by discussing how the DMDSNB could be distinguished from the DSNB.</description>

      <title>Probing Abundance Variations among Multiple Stellar Populations in the Metal-Poor Globular Cluster NGC 2298 using Gemini-South/GHOST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04001v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Studying the abundances in metal-poor globular clusters is crucial for understanding the formation of the Galaxy and the nucleosynthesis processes in the early Universe. We observed 13 red giant stars from the metal-poor globular cluster NGC 2298 using the newly commissioned GHOST spectrograph at Gemini South. We derived stellar parameters and abundances for 36 species across 32 elements, including 16 neutron-capture elements. We find that the stars exhibit chemical anomalies among the light elements, allowing us to classify them into first-generation (8 stars) and second-generation (5 stars). We derive a mean cluster metallicity of [Fe/H]=-1.98 +/- 0.10 with no significant variation among cluster members. Most alpha- and Fe-peak elements display low star-to-star abundance dispersion, with notable exceptions for Sc, Ni, and Zn for which the dispersions in Sc vary significantly between stars from different generations to 2\sigma levels. Similarly, among the neutron-capture elements, we observed considerable differences in dispersion for Sr and Eu among the first and second generation stars to 2 sigma levels. We also confirm an intrinsic scatter beyond observational uncertainties for several elements using a maximum likelihood approach among stars from different generations. Additionally, we note an increase in [Sr/Eu] and [Ba/Eu] with [Mg/Fe] in first-generation stars indicating correlations between the productions of light r-process and Mg. We find the universal r-process pattern, but with larger dispersions in the main r-process than the limited-r elements. These differences in abundance dispersion, among first- and second-generation stars in NGC 2298, suggest complex and inhomogeneous early chemical enrichment processes, driven by contributions from multiple nucleosynthetic events, including massive stars and rare r-process events.</description>

      <title>Teleios (G305.4-2.2) -- the mystery of a perfectly shaped new Galactic supernova remnant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the serendipitous radio-continuum discovery of a likely Galactic supernova remnant (SNR) G305.4-2.2. This object displays a remarkable circular symmetry in shape, making it one of the most circular Galactic SNRs known. Nicknamed Teleios due to its symmetry, it was detected in the new Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) Evolutionary Map of the Universe (EMU) radio-continuum images with an angular size of 1320"x1260" and PA = 0 deg. While there is a hint of possible H$\alpha$ and gamma-ray emission, Teleios is exclusively seen at radio-continuum frequencies. Interestingly, Teleios is not only almost perfectly symmetric, but it also has one of the lowest surface brightnesses discovered among Galactic SNRs and a steep spectral index of $\alpha=-0.6\pm 0.3$. Our estimates from HI studies and the Sigma-D relation place Teleios as a type Ia SNR at a distance of either ~2.2 kpc of ~7.7 kpc. This indicates two possible scenarios, either a young (under 1000 yr) or an older SNR (over 10000 yr). With a corresponding diameter of 14/48 pc, our evolutionary studies place Teleios at the either early or late Sedov phase, depending on the distance estimate. However, our modelling also predicts X-ray emission, which we do not see in the present generation of eROSITA images. We also explored a type Iax explosion scenario that points to a much closer distance of &lt;1 kpc and Teleios size of only ~3.3 pc, which would be similar to the only known type Iax remnant SN1181. Unfortunately, all examined scenarios have their challenges, and no definitive supernova (SN) origin type can be established at this stage. Teleios's symmetrical shape suggests expansion into a rarefied and isotropic ambient medium. The low radio surface brightness and the lack of pronounced polarisation can be explained by a high level of ambient rotation measure (RM), with the largest RM being observed at centre.</description>

      <title>Galactic Spacetime Solutions with a Varying Newton's Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We find a new family of galactic metrics corresponding to flat rotation curves at the outer radii. These are vacuum solutions to a gravity theory where the Newton's coupling varies mildly in space. The effective `mass', whose origin is purely geometric, receives a negative non-baryonic contribution. The angle of deflection of a light ray propagating in this geometry is found to be diminished rather than enhanced compared to the Einsteinian bending, the effect being highly suppressed though. Hence, these spacetimes are observationally dintinguishable from other geometric or `dark matter' based alternatives invoked to explain mass discrepancies in galaxies.</description>

      <title>Leptohadronic Multimessenger Modeling of Two High-redshift (z $&gt;$ 1) Neutrino Emission Blazar Candidates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The blazars are one of the leading candidate sources of high-energy neutrinos. Recently, two blazars have been found to be temporally and spatially correlated with some IceCube high-energy neutrino events. The two blazars, GB6 J2113+1121 and NVSS J171822+423948, are Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars (FSRQs) with redshifts greater than unity. In particular, NVSS J171822+423948 has a redshift of 2.7, which provides an important probe for studying the radiation processes of jets from active galactic nuclei in the early universe. To better understand the physical origin of the IceCube neutrinos, we adopt the one-zone leptohadronic model to fit the multimessenger emission of GB6 J2113+1121 and NVSS J171822+423948 during their $\gamma$-ray flaring periods and then calculate the high-energy neutrino detection probability. The chance of detecting a single muon neutrino from these two sources is found to be $\sim 2\%$ and $0.8\%$, respectively. Although such detection rates are not high mainly because of their high redshifts, our investigation strongly suggests that these sources are efficient PeV neutrino emitters. Our results also indicate that electromagnetic cascades produced by hadronic processes contribute significantly to X-ray and $\gamma$-ray emissions. However, high-energy $\gamma$-rays can be severely absorbed by the soft photon field from the broad-line region (BLR), which weakens the correlation between $\gamma$-rays and neutrinos, while suggesting a stronger connection between X-rays and neutrinos. We predict that IceCube will continue to detect neutrinos from FSRQs with redshifts greater than 1 in the future.</description>

      <title>Linear Thermal Instability of a Condensing Gas-Particle Mixture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the stability of a hot saturated gas coexisting with condensed particles in an optically thin medium. Such a situation may obtain downstream of a shock, at condensation fronts, or in vaporizing impacts. We show that the gas-particle mixture is subject to a thermal instability whereby a region of lower temperature and higher condensate density cools faster to condense faster. If the region of runaway condensation has a sound-crossing time shorter than its cooling time, then it accretes more mass, in gas and particles, from its higher pressure surroundings. Numerical integration of the linearized perturbation equations demonstrates that this radiation-condensation instability can create particle clumps and voids out of a secularly cooling gas. Provided radiation can escape to cool particle overdensities, thermal instability can help assemble chondrite parent bodies out of the vaporized debris of asteroid collisions, and form planetesimals generally.</description>

      <title>Challenging the LyC-Ly$\alpha$ relation: strong Ly$\alpha$ emitters without LyC leakage at z $\sim$ 2.3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07618v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The escape fraction of LyC ionizing radiation ($f_{lyc}$) is crucial for understanding reionization, yet difficult to measure at $z \gtrsim 4$. Recently, studies have focused on calibrating indirect indicators of $f_{lyc}$ at $z \sim 0.3$, finding that $Ly\alpha$ is closely linked to it. What is still unclear is whether the LyC $-$ $Ly\alpha$ relation evolves with redshift, and if $Ly\alpha$ is truly applicable as an $f_{lyc}$ indicator during the reionization epoch. In this study, we investigate seven $-21 \lesssim M_{UV} \lesssim-19$ gravitationally lensed galaxies from the BELLS GALLERY Survey at $z\sim2.3$. Our targets have rest-frame $Ly\alpha$ equivalent widths between 40 \r{A} and 200 \r{A} and low dust content ($-2.4 \lesssim \beta \lesssim -2.0$), both indicative of high LyC escape. Surprisingly, direct estimates of $f_{lyc}$ using Hubble Space Telescope imaging with F275W and F225W reveal that our targets are not LyC emitters, with an absolute $f_{lyc} &lt; 13 \%$ (assuming the median IGM transmission). The low $f_{lyc}$, coupled with the high $Ly\alpha$ equivalent width and escape fraction, could potentially be attributed to the redshift evolution of the neutral hydrogen column density and dust content, as well as covering fractions of optically thick gas below 1 in high redshift galaxies. Additionally, our analysis suggests that the emission for each lensed component is uniformly absorbed. Our results challenge the validity of the extrapolation of $z\sim0$ Ly$\alpha$-based LyC indirect estimators into the reionization epoch.</description>

      <title>Are compact groups of galaxies special?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20357v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is often believed that isolated, compact groups of galaxies (CGs) are special systems. But only few studies compared CGs to regular groups. We study the global properties and internal correlations of a volume- and luminosity-complete subsample of 78 groups of four members (CG4s), within the HMCG Hickson-like sample of compact groups. We compare them to those of a similarly built subsample (including the 3-magnitude range of CG4s) of the Lim et al. regular groups. The latter are split into three control samples: one with the four brightest members (Control4Bs), one with the four closest members to the brightest group galaxy (BGG) (Control4Cs), and one with exactly four members (RG4s). The vast majority of CG4s are located within regular groups, and a large preponderance of the BGGs of these CG4s are the same as those of their host groups. CG4s are smaller than the groups of all other samples and more luminous than RG4s, both results as expected from their selection as high surface brightness systems. However, CG4s (especially those split among several regular groups) have similar luminosities as Control4Cs. CG4s also have higher velocity dispersions, probably because of a too permissive redshift accordance criterion. The BGGs of CG4s are not more dominant in luminosity than those of RG4s, but they are significantly more offset relative to the group size, because the Lim groups are built around their BGGs. In summary, compact groups have similar properties to the regular groups of four galaxies and to the cores of regular groups, once selection criteria of CGs are considered. A large fraction of CGs are the cores of regular groups, isolated on the sky by construction, but rarely isolated in real space (from simulations), indicating that they are often plagued by chance alignments of host groups galaxies along the line of sight.</description>

      <title>ASURA-FDPS-ML: Star-by-star Galaxy Simulations Accelerated by Surrogate Modeling for Supernova Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23346v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce new high-resolution galaxy simulations accelerated by a surrogate model that reduces the computation cost by approximately 75 percent. Massive stars with a Zero Age Main Sequence mass of more than about 10 $\mathrm{M_\odot}$ explode as core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe), which play a critical role in galaxy formation. The energy released by CCSNe is essential for regulating star formation and driving feedback processes in the interstellar medium (ISM). However, the short integration timesteps required for SNe feedback have presented significant bottlenecks in astrophysical simulations across various scales. Overcoming this challenge is crucial for enabling star-by-star galaxy simulations, which aim to capture the dynamics of individual stars and the inhomogeneous shell's expansion within the turbulent ISM. To address this, our new framework combines direct numerical simulations and surrogate modeling, including machine learning and Gibbs sampling. The star formation history and the time evolution of outflow rates in the galaxy match those obtained from resolved direct numerical simulations. Our new approach achieves high-resolution fidelity while reducing computational costs, effectively bridging the physical scale gap and enabling multi-scale simulations.</description>

      <title>SIEGE III: The formation of dense stellar clusters in sub-parsec resolution cosmological simulations with individual star feedback</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02502v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Star clusters stand at the crossroads between galaxies and single stars. Resolving the formation of star clusters in cosmological simulations represents an ambitious and challenging goal, since modelling their internal properties requires very high resolution. This paper is the third of a series within the SImulating the Environment where Globular clusters Emerged (SIEGE) project, where we conduct zoom-in cosmological simulations with sub-parsec resolution that include the feedback of individual stars, aimed to model the formation of star clusters in high-redshift proto-galaxies. We investigate the role of three fundamental quantities in shaping the intrinsic properties of star clusters, i. e., i) pre-supernova stellar feedback (continuous or instantaneous ejection of mass and energy through stellar winds); ii) star formation efficiency, defined as the fraction of gas converted into stars per freefall time, for which we test 2 different values (epsi_ff=0.1 and 1), and iii) stellar initial mass function (IMF, standard vs top-heavy). All our simulations are run down to z=10.5, which is sufficient for investigating some structural properties of the emerging clumps and clusters. [Abridged] The prescription for a continuous, low-intensity feedback, along with the adoption of epsi_ff=1, produces star clusters with maximum stellar density values up to 10^4 M_sun pc^(-2), in good agreement with the surface density-size relation observed in local young star clusters (YSCs). Therefore, a realistic stellar wind description and a high star formation effiency are the key ingredients that allow us to achieve realistic star clusters characterised by properties comparable to those of local YSCs. In contrast, the other models produce too diffuse clusters, in particular the one with a top-heavy IMF.</description>

      <title>Towards characterizing dark matter subhalo perturbations in stellar streams with graph neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03522v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The phase space of stellar streams is proposed to detect dark substructure in the Milky Way through the perturbations created by passing subhalos - and thus is a powerful test of the cold dark matter paradigm and its alternatives. Using graph convolutional neural network (GCNN) data compression and simulation-based inference (SBI) on a simulated GD-1-like stream, we improve the constraint on the mass of a [$10^8$, $10^7$, $10^6$] $M_\odot$ perturbing subhalo by factors of [11, 7, 3] with respect to the current state-of-the-art density power spectrum analysis. We find that the GCNN produces posteriors that are more accurate (better calibrated) than the power spectrum. We simulate the positions and velocities of stars in a GD-1-like stream and perturb the stream with subhalos of varying mass and velocity. Leveraging the feature encoding of the GCNN to compress the input phase space data, we then use SBI to estimate the joint posterior of the subhalo mass and velocity. We investigate how our results scale with the size of the GCNN, the coordinate system of the input and the effect of incomplete observations. Our results suggest that a survey with $10 \times$ fewer stars (300 stars) with complete 6-D phase space data performs about as well as a deeper survey (3000 stars) with only 3-D data (photometry, spectroscopy). The stronger constraining power and more accurate posterior estimation motivate further development of GCNNs in combining future photometric, spectroscopic and astrometric stream observations.</description>

      <title>Investigating photometric and spectroscopic variability in the multiply-imaged Little Red Dot A2744-QSO1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07875v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: JWST observations have uncovered a new population of red, compact objects at high redshifts dubbed `Little Red Dots' (LRDs), which typically show broad emission lines and are thought to be dusty Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). Some of their other features, however, challenge the AGN explanation, such as prominent Balmer breaks and extremely faint or even missing metal high-ionization lines, X-ray, or radio emission, including in deep stacks. Time variability is another, robust, test of AGN activity. Here, we exploit the $z=7.045$ multiply-imaged LRD A2744-QSO1, which offers a particularly unique test of variability due to lensing-induced time delays between the three images spanning 22 yr (2.7 yr in the rest-frame), to investigate its photometric and spectroscopic variability. We find the equivalent widths (EWs) of the broad H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ lines, which are independent of magnification and other systematics, to exhibit significant variations, up to $18\pm3$ % for H$\alpha$ and up to $22\pm8$ % in H$\beta$, on a timescale of 875 d (2.4 yr) in the rest-frame. This suggests that A2744-QSO1 is indeed an AGN. We find no significant photometric variability beyond the limiting systematic uncertainties, so it currently cannot be determined whether the EW variations are due to line-flux or continuum variability. These results are consistent with a typical damped random walk (DRW) variability model for an AGN like A2744-QSO1 ($M_{\mathrm{BH}}=4\times10^7 \mathrm{M}_{\odot}$) given the sparse sampling of the light-curve with the available data. Our results therefore support the AGN interpretation of this LRD, and highlight the need for further photometric and spectroscopic monitoring in order to build a detailed and reliable light-curve.</description>

      <title>Dynamical friction for circular orbits in self-interacting ultralight dark matter and Fornax globular clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19219v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of repulsive self-interaction in ultralight dark matter (ULDM) on dynamical friction in circular orbits in ULDM halos and its implications for the Fornax dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxy's globular clusters. Using the Gross-Pitaevskii-Poisson equations, we derive the dynamical friction force considering soliton density profiles for both non-interacting and strongly self-interacting ULDM. Our results show that self-interactions reduce the dynamical friction effect further than both the non-interacting ULDM and standard cold dark matter models. Furthermore, we derive the low Mach number approximation to simplify the analysis in the subsonic motion, where the tangential component of dynamical friction dominates. Applying these findings to the Fornax dSph, we calculate the infall timescales of globular clusters, demonstrating that strong self-interaction can address the timing problem more effectively. We constrain the parameter space for ULDM particle mass and self-coupling constant, which are consistent with other constraints from astronomical and cosmological observations.</description>

      <title>Externally irradiated young stars in NGC 3603. A JWST NIRSpec catalogue of pre-main-sequence stars in a massive star formation region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05650</link>

Abstract: NGC 3603 is the optically brightest massive star forming region (SFR) in the Milky Way, representing a small scale starburst region. Studying young stars in regions like this allows us to assess how star and planet formation proceeds in a dense clustered environment with high levels of UV radiation. JWST provides the sensitivity, unbroken wavelength coverage, and spatial resolution required to study individual pre-main-sequence (PMS) stars in distant massive SFRs in detail for the first time. Using the Micro-Shutter Assembly (MSA) onboard the Near InfraRed Spectrograph (NIRSpec), multi-object spectroscopy was performed, yielding 100 stellar spectra. We fit the PMS spectra to derive their photospheric properties, extinction, and NIR veiling. From this, we determined the masses and ages of our sources by placing them on the Hertzsprung-Russel diagram (HRD). Their accretion rates were determined by converting the luminosity of hydrogen emission lines to an accretion luminosity. We have classified 42 as actively accreting. Our sources span a range of masses from 0.5 to 7 $M_{\odot}$. Twelve of these accreting sources have ages consistent with $\ge$ 10 Myrs, with four having ages of $\ge$ 15 Myrs. Their mass accretion rates span 5 orders of magnitude and are systematically higher for a given stellar age and mass than for a comparative sample taken from low-mass SFRs. We report an environmental relationship between $\dot{M}_{acc}$ and the density of ambient molecular gas as traced by nebular $H_2$ emission.</description>

      <title>Kinematic evidence of magnetospheric accretion for Herbig Ae stars with JWST NIRSpec</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05668v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hydrogen emission lines have been used to estimate the mass accretion rate of pre-main-sequence stars for over $25$ years, although the physical origin of these lines is still unclear. Magnetospheric accretion (MA) and magneto-centrifugal winds are the two most often invoked mechanisms. Using a combination of HST photometry and new JWST NIRSpec spectra in the range $1.66 - 3.2 \; \mu m$, we analysed the emission line spectra of five sources to attempt to reveal the physical origin of their hydrogen emission lines. These sources reside in NGC 3603, a Galactic massive star forming region. We performed fits of the SEDs of the five sources employing a Markov chain Monte Carlo exploration to estimate $T_{eff}$, $R_{*}$, $M_{*}$, and $A(V)$ for each source. We performed a kinematic analysis across three spectral series of hydrogen lines (Paschen, Brackett, and Pfund). We studied the full width at half maximum and optical depth of the lines in order to constrain the emission origin. We calculated the expected velocities from MA as well as gas in Keplerian orbit for our sources. All five sources have SEDs consistent with young intermediate-mass stars. We classified three of these sources as Herbig Ae type stars based on their $T_{eff}$. Hydrogen lines with high upper energy levels $n_{up}$ tend to be significantly broader than lines with a lower $n_{up}$. The optical depth of the emission lines is also highest for the high-velocity component of each line, and it becomes optically thin in the low-velocity component. Emission from magneto-centrifugal winds is not consistent with any of our observations. Two sources are consistent with emission from a Keplerian disc, or MA. The remaining three sources are only consistent with emission from MA. In the future, this approach can be applied to more statistically significant samples of Herbig AeBe spectra, including existing archival observations.</description>
