      <title>The Operator Algebras Mentor Network: Impact of Community-Based Mentoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper aims to determine if membership within the Operator Algebras Mentor Network (OAMN) is beneficial to its members. The OAMN is an international mentoring initiative that offers support in small groups to women and minority genders in the particularly male-dominated field of operator algebras (OA) in mathematics. Expected advantages of membership include raising awareness of the lack of gender diversity in this field, providing advice to mentees by mentors (e.g., pertaining to career or work/life balance), broadening one's network in OA, etc. A questionnaire was sent to OAMN members and a control group of non-members at similar institutions and similar positions to collect their experience with the mentoring initiative and perception of gender dynamics within the OA discipline, together with basic demographics. The initial analysis of the data collected shows that mentoring junior women and other minority genders in the area has a positive effect on mentees' networking ability, self-promotion, and raising awareness of gender issues within OA as a whole.</description>

      <title>Measure equivalence rigidity of the handlebody groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.10064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.10064v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $V$ be a connected $3$-dimensional handlebody of finite genus at least $3$. We prove that the handlebody group $\mathrm{Mod}(V)$ is superrigid for measure equivalence, i.e. every countable group which is measure equivalent to $\mathrm{Mod}(V)$ is in fact virtually isomorphic to $\mathrm{Mod}(V)$. Applications include a rigidity theorem for lattice embeddings of $\mathrm{Mod}(V)$, an orbit equivalence rigidity theorem for free ergodic measure-preserving actions of $\mathrm{Mod}(V)$ on standard probability spaces, and a $W^*$-rigidity theorem among weakly compact group actions.</description>

      <title>Measure equivalence rigidity among the Higman groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.00884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.00884v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that all (generalized) Higman groups on at least $5$ generators are superrigid for measure equivalence. More precisely, let $k\ge 5$, and let $H$ be a group with generators $a_1,\dots,a_k$, and Baumslag-Solitar relations given by $a_ia_{i+1}^{m_i}a_i^{-1}=a_i^{n_i}$, with $i$ varying in $\mathbb{Z}/k\mathbb{Z}$ and nonzero integers $|m_i|\neq |n_i|$ for each $i$. We prove that every countable group which is measure equivalent to $H$, is in fact virtually isomorphic to $H$. A key ingredient in the proof is a general statement providing measured group theoretic invariants for groups acting acylindrically on $\mathrm{CAT}(-1)$ polyhedral complexes with control on vertex and edge stabilizers.
  Among consequences of our work, we obtain rigidity theorems for generalized Higman groups with respect to lattice embeddings and automorphisms of their Cayley graphs. We also derive an orbit equivalence and $W^*$-superrigidity theorem for all free, ergodic, probability measure-preserving actions of generalized Higman groups.</description>
