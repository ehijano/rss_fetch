      <title>Social coordination perpetuates stereotypic expectations and behaviors across generations in deep multi-agent reinforcement learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite often being perceived as morally objectionable, stereotypes are a common feature of social groups, a phenomenon that has often been attributed to biased motivations or limits on the ability to process information. We argue that one reason for this continued prevalence is that pre-existing expectations about how others will behave, in the context of social coordination, can change the behaviors of one's social partners, creating the very stereotype one expected to see, even in the absence of other potential sources of stereotyping. We use a computational model of dynamic social coordination to illustrate how this "feedback loop" can emerge, engendering and entrenching stereotypic behavior, and then show that human behavior on the task generates a comparable feedback loop. Notably, people's choices on the task are not related to social dominance or system justification, suggesting biased motivations are not necessary to maintain these stereotypes.</description>

      <title>Windowed MAPF with Completeness Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional multi-agent path finding (MAPF) methods try to compute entire start-goal paths which are collision free. However, computing an entire path can take too long for MAPF systems where agents need to replan fast. Methods that address this typically employ a "windowed" approach and only try to find collision free paths for a small windowed timestep horizon. This adaptation comes at the cost of incompleteness; all current windowed approaches can become stuck in deadlock or livelock. Our main contribution is to introduce our framework, WinC-MAPF, for Windowed MAPF that enables completeness. Our framework uses heuristic update insights from single-agent real-time heuristic search algorithms as well as agent independence ideas from MAPF algorithms. We also develop Single-Step CBS (SS-CBS), an instantiation of this framework using a novel modification to CBS. We show how SS-CBS, which only plans a single step and updates heuristics, can effectively solve tough scenarios where existing windowed approaches fail.</description>

      <title>Performant, Memory Efficient and Scalable Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the field of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) progresses towards larger and more complex environments, achieving strong performance while maintaining memory efficiency and scalability to many agents becomes increasingly important. Although recent research has led to several advanced algorithms, to date, none fully address all of these key properties simultaneously. In this work, we introduce Sable, a novel and theoretically sound algorithm that adapts the retention mechanism from Retentive Networks to MARL. Sable's retention-based sequence modelling architecture allows for computationally efficient scaling to a large number of agents, as well as maintaining a long temporal context, making it well-suited for large-scale partially observable environments. Through extensive evaluations across six diverse environments, we demonstrate how Sable is able to significantly outperform existing state-of-the-art methods in the majority of tasks (34 out of 45, roughly 75\%). Furthermore, Sable demonstrates stable performance as we scale the number of agents, handling environments with more than a thousand agents while exhibiting a linear increase in memory usage. Finally, we conduct ablation studies to isolate the source of Sable's performance gains and confirm its efficient computational memory usage. Our results highlight Sable's performance and efficiency, positioning it as a leading approach to MARL at scale.</description>

      <title>Finite-time convergence to an $\epsilon$-efficient Nash equilibrium in potential games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15497v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the convergence time of log-linear learning to an $\epsilon$-efficient Nash equilibrium (NE) in potential games. In such games, an efficient NE is defined as the maximizer of the potential function. Previous literature provides asymptotic convergence rates to efficient Nash equilibria, and existing finite-time rates are limited to potential games with further assumptions such as the interchangeability of players. In this paper, we prove the first finite-time convergence to an $\epsilon$-efficient NE in general potential games. Our bounds depend polynomially on $1/\epsilon$, an improvement over previous bounds that are exponential in $1/\epsilon$ and only hold for subclasses of potential games. We then strengthen our convergence result in two directions: first, we show that a variant of log-linear learning that requires a factor $A$ less feedback on the utility per round enjoys a similar convergence time; second, we demonstrate the robustness of our convergence guarantee if log-linear learning is subject to small perturbations such as alterations in the learning rule or noise-corrupted utilities.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Zero-Shot Scalable Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03869v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The emergence of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is significantly transforming various fields like autonomous vehicle networks. However, real-world multi-agent systems typically contain multiple roles, and the scale of these systems dynamically fluctuates. Consequently, in order to achieve zero-shot scalable collaboration, it is essential that strategies for different roles can be updated flexibly according to the scales, which is still a challenge for current MARL frameworks. To address this, we propose a novel MARL framework named Scalable and Heterogeneous Proximal Policy Optimization (SHPPO), integrating heterogeneity into parameter-shared PPO-based MARL networks. We first leverage a latent network to learn strategy patterns for each agent adaptively. Second, we introduce a heterogeneous layer to be inserted into decision-making networks, whose parameters are specifically generated by the learned latent variables. Our approach is scalable as all the parameters are shared except for the heterogeneous layer, and gains both inter-individual and temporal heterogeneity, allowing SHPPO to adapt effectively to varying scales. SHPPO exhibits superior performance in classic MARL environments like Starcraft Multi-Agent Challenge (SMAC) and Google Research Football (GRF), showcasing enhanced zero-shot scalability, and offering insights into the learned latent variables' impact on team performance by visualization.</description>

      <title>Safe Decentralized Multi-Agent Control using Black-Box Predictors, Conformal Decision Policies, and Control Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18862v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the challenge of safe control in decentralized multi-agent robotic settings, where agents use uncertain black-box models to predict other agents' trajectories. We use the recently proposed conformal decision theory to adapt the restrictiveness of control barrier functions-based safety constraints based on observed prediction errors. We use these constraints to synthesize controllers that balance between the objectives of safety and task accomplishment, despite the prediction errors. We provide an upper bound on the average over time of the value of a monotonic function of the difference between the safety constraint based on the predicted trajectories and the constraint based on the ground truth ones. We validate our theory through experimental results showing the performance of our controllers when navigating a robot in the multi-agent scenes in the Stanford Drone Dataset.</description>
