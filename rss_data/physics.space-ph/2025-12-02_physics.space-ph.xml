      <title>A robust empirical relationship between speed and turbulence energy in the near-Earth solar wind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The connection between turbulence and solar-wind acceleration, long known in space physics, is further developed in this Letter by establishing a robust empirical law that relates the bulk-flow speed to the magnetohydrodynamic-scale fluctuation energy in the plasma. The model is based on analysis of twenty-five years of near-Earth observations by NASA's Advanced Composition Explorer. It provides a simple way to estimate turbulence energy from low-resolution speed data -- a practical approach that may be of utility when high-resolution measurements or advanced turbulence models are unavailable. Potential heliospheric applications include space-weather forecasting operations, remote imaging datasets, and energetic-particle transport models that require turbulence amplitudes to specify diffusion parameters.</description>

      <title>The Ginzburg-Landau Model of Magnetospheric Chorus: Instabilities and Mode Condensation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The analogy between free-electron lasers (FELs) - laboratory devices which generate intense coherent light with tunable frequencies - and whistler wave-particle interactions in the magnetosphere has recently been extended to account for waves with spatially dependent amplitudes and a spectrum of frequencies. The whistler was found to be governed by one of the most well-studied nonlinear equations in physics, the Ginzburg-Landau equation (GLE), which can be used to predict the complex nonlinear physics of multi-mode interactions. In this study, we focus on the single-mode solutions of the GLE and investigate their propagation and stability in the context of magnetospheric chorus. As with FELs, there are two types of instabilities, the Benjamin-Feir instability, where all single modes are unstable, and the Eckhaus instability, where there is a band of stable modes, but all modes outside of the band are unstable. Both stability conditions are given by well known inequalities in the GLE literature. For whistler-mode chorus, we analytically reduce the inequalities to simple expressions and show that, to the extent that the GLE represents magnetospheric chorus, it is Benjamin-Feir stable. We also derive the width of the Eckhaus stability band. We find that the predicted bandwidth is consistent with in situ satellite observations and support our analytical calculations with numerical simulations of the GLE. Our simulations demonstrate the robustness of the stable modes, the evolution from unstable modes to stable ones, and the tendency for mode condensation, whereby a noisy spectrum of modes tends to relax to a single stable mode.</description>

      <title>Towards a future space-based, highly scalable AI infrastructure system design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: If AI is a foundational general-purpose technology, we should anticipate that demand for AI compute -- and energy -- will continue to grow. The Sun is by far the largest energy source in our solar system, and thus it warrants consideration how future AI infrastructure could most efficiently tap into that power. This work explores a scalable compute system for machine learning in space, using fleets of satellites equipped with solar arrays, inter-satellite links using free-space optics, and Google tensor processing unit (TPU) accelerator chips. To facilitate high-bandwidth, low-latency inter-satellite communication, the satellites would be flown in close proximity. We illustrate the basic approach to formation flight via a 81-satellite cluster of 1 km radius, and describe an approach for using high-precision ML-based models to control large-scale constellations. Trillium TPUs are radiation tested. They survive a total ionizing dose equivalent to a 5 year mission life without permanent failures, and are characterized for bit-flip errors. Launch costs are a critical part of overall system cost; a learning curve analysis suggests launch to low-Earth orbit (LEO) may reach $\lesssim$\$200/kg by the mid-2030s.</description>

      <title>A high-order weighted positive and flux conservative method for the Vlasov equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a high-order conservative, positivity-preserving, and non-oscillatory scheme for solving the Vlasov equation. The scheme attains formal fifth-order accuracy through a convex combination of positive and non-oscillatory polynomials in substencils. Nonlinear weights for these polynomials are formulated that assign higher priority to substencils with larger L2 norm to enhance resolution while maintaining positivity and non-oscillatory properties. An approximate dispersion relation indicates that the spectral properties of the present scheme outperform those of an underlying fifth-order scheme and even surpass those of a seventh-order scheme in certain wavenumber ranges. We apply this scheme to the one-dimensional Vlasov-Ampere equations and the two-dimensional Vlasov-Maxwell equations, and demonstrate high-resolution simulations with improved conservation of entropy.</description>

      <title>Velocity-space turbulent cascade in the near-Sun solar wind: first insights from the Parker Solar Probe mission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In space plasmas, the rarity of collisions leads to complex structures in the velocity space where a turbulent cascade of the velocity distribution function fluctuations is thought to occur. Previous studies have explored this phenomenon using the Hermite decomposition of the ion velocity distribution function (VDF) in both magnetosheath data and numerical simulations. In this work, we investigate the Hermite spectrum of the ion VDFs measured by Parker Solar Probe in the inner heliosphere. We analyze a superalfv\'enic stream at a radial distances of $R \approx 28 R_{sun}$ and a subalfv\'enic at $R \approx 11 R_{sun}$, the former characterized by a prevalence of VDFs with suprathermal beams (also known as hammerhead). The Hermite analysis is also compared with various proxies of energization and dissipation, in order to establish a connection between turbulent cascades in real space and those in the velocity space. A qualitative agreement between the energization proxies and the Hermite analysis is observed. The results are suggestive of the presence of a dual cascade in real and velocity space.</description>

      <title>Macroscopic Quantum Resonators Path Finder (MAQRO-PF) White Paper</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optically levitated particles are used in a wide range of experiments to explore both fundamental physics and to act as sensors to a variety of external forces. One field of particular interest that these particles can be used to investigate is quantum mechanics. Previous research has yet to set an absolute upper bound on the size of objects that can be prepared in a quantum superposition. Exploring this limit involves allowing ever-larger objects to freely and coherently evolve to assess if their behaviour matches quantum or classical theoretical predictions. However, the long free evolution times required for these behaviours to be visible result in the experiments being gravitationally limited. Space based platforms therefore become the next key step in these investigations. In this white paper, we shall discuss our proposal for an optical levitation experiment in space that will explore the fundamental upper size limits of quantum mechanics. We shall cover the scientific motivation behind these investigations, then summarize the current status of our designs for the satellite. We will then review the aspects of the payload that require further development, then summarize the current estimates of the payload's requirements.</description>
