      <title>GRIMM: Genetic stRatification for Inference in Molecular Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The vast majority of biological sequences encode unknown functions and bear little resemblance to experimentally characterized proteins, limiting both our understanding of biology and our ability to harness functional potential for the bioeconomy. Predicting enzyme function from sequence remains a central challenge in computational biology, complicated by low sequence diversity and imbalanced label support in publicly available datasets. Models trained on these data can overestimate performance and fail to generalize. To address this, we introduce GRIMM (Genetic stRatification for Inference in Molecular Modeling), a benchmark for enzyme function prediction that employs genetic stratification: sequences are clustered by similarity and clusters are assigned exclusively to training, validation, or test sets. This ensures that sequences from the same cluster do not appear in multiple partitions. GRIMM produces multiple test sets: a closed-set test with the same label distribution as training (Test-1) and an open-set test containing novel labels (Test-2), serving as a realistic out-of-distribution proxy for discovering novel enzyme functions. While demonstrated on enzymes, this approach is generalizable to any sequence-based classification task where inputs can be clustered by similarity. By formalizing a splitting strategy often used implicitly, GRIMM provides a unified and reproducible framework for closed- and open-set evaluation. The method is lightweight, requiring only sequence clustering and label annotations, and can be adapted to different similarity thresholds, data scales, and biological tasks. GRIMM enables more realistic evaluation of functional prediction models on both familiar and unseen classes and establishes a benchmark that more faithfully assesses model performance and generalizability.</description>

      <title>Time-Varying Directed Interactions in Functional Brain Networks: Modeling and Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the dynamic nature of brain connectivity is critical for elucidating neural processing, behavior, and brain disorders. Traditional approaches such as sliding-window correlation (SWC) characterize time-varying undirected associations but do not resolve directional interactions, limiting inference about time-resolved information flow in brain networks. We introduce sliding-window prediction correlation (SWpC), which embeds a directional linear time-invariant (LTI) model within each sliding window to estimate time-varying directed functional connectivity (FC). SWpC yields two complementary descriptors of directed interactions: a strength measure (prediction correlation) and a duration measure (window-wise duration of information transfer). Using concurrent local field potential (LFP) and fMRI BOLD recordings from rat somatosensory cortices, we demonstrate stable directionality estimates in both LFP band-limited power and BOLD. Using Human Connectome Project (HCP) motor task fMRI, SWpC detects significant task-evoked changes in directed FC strength and duration and shows higher sensitivity than SWC for identifying task-evoked connectivity differences. Finally, in post-concussion vestibular dysfunction (PCVD), SWpC reveals reproducible vestibular-multisensory brain-state shifts and improves healthy-control vs subacute patient (HC-ST) discrimination using state-derived features. Together, these results show that SWpC provides biologically interpretable, time-resolved directed connectivity patterns across multimodal validation and clinical application settings, supporting both basic and translational neuroscience.</description>

      <title>Optical Inversion and Spectral Unmixing of Spectroscopic Photoacoustic Images with Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate estimation of the relative concentrations of chromophores in a spectroscopic photoacoustic (sPA) image can reveal immense structural, functional, and molecular information about physiological processes. However, due to nonlinearities and ill-posedness inherent to sPA imaging, concentration estimation is intractable. The Spectroscopic Photoacoustic Optical Inversion Autoencoder (SPOI-AE) aims to address the sPA optical inversion and spectral unmixing problems without assuming linearity. Herein, SPOI-AE was trained and tested on \textit{in vivo} mouse lymph node sPA images with unknown ground truth chromophore concentrations. SPOI-AE better reconstructs input sPA pixels than conventional algorithms while providing biologically coherent estimates for optical parameters, chromophore concentrations, and the percent oxygen saturation of tissue. SPOI-AE's unmixing accuracy was validated using a simulated mouse lymph node phantom ground truth.</description>

      <title>Parameter-free representations outperform single-cell foundation models on downstream benchmarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data exhibit strong and reproducible statistical structure. This has motivated the development of large-scale foundation models, such as TranscriptFormer, that use transformer-based architectures to learn a generative model for gene expression by embedding genes into a latent vector space. These embeddings have been used to obtain state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on downstream tasks such as cell-type classification, disease-state prediction, and cross-species learning. Here, we ask whether similar performance can be achieved without utilizing computationally intensive deep learning-based representations. Using simple, interpretable pipelines that rely on careful normalization and linear methods, we obtain SOTA or near SOTA performance across multiple benchmarks commonly used to evaluate single-cell foundation models, including outperforming foundation models on out-of-distribution tasks involving novel cell types and organisms absent from the training data. Our findings highlight the need for rigorous benchmarking and suggest that the biology of cell identity can be captured by simple linear representations of single cell gene expression data.</description>

      <title>Integrating Chain-of-Thought and Retrieval Augmented Generation Enhances Rare Disease Diagnosis from Clinical Notes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12286v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Background: Several studies show that large language models (LLMs) struggle with phenotype-driven gene prioritization for rare diseases. These studies typically use Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) terms to prompt foundation models like GPT and LLaMA to predict candidate genes. However, in real-world settings, foundation models are not optimized for domain-specific tasks like clinical diagnosis, yet inputs are unstructured clinical notes rather than standardized terms. How LLMs can be instructed to predict candidate genes or disease diagnosis from unstructured clinical notes remains a major challenge. Methods: We introduce RAG-driven CoT and CoT-driven RAG, two methods that combine Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to analyze clinical notes. A five-question CoT protocol mimics expert reasoning, while RAG retrieves data from sources like HPO and OMIM (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man). We evaluated these approaches on rare disease datasets, including 5,980 Phenopacket-derived notes, 255 literature-based narratives, and 220 in-house clinical notes from Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia. Results: We found that recent foundations models, including Llama 3.3-70B-Instruct and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B, outperformed earlier versions such as Llama 2 and GPT-3.5. We also showed that RAG-driven CoT and CoT-driven RAG both outperform foundation models in candidate gene prioritization from clinical notes; in particular, both methods with DeepSeek backbone resulted in a top-10 gene accuracy of over 40% on Phenopacket-derived clinical notes. RAG-driven CoT works better for high-quality notes, where early retrieval can anchor the subsequent reasoning steps in domain-specific evidence, while CoT-driven RAG has advantage when processing lengthy and noisy notes.</description>

      <title>Likelihood-free inference of phylogenetic tree posterior distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12976v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Phylogenetic inference, the task of reconstructing how related sequences evolved from common ancestors, is a central objective in evolutionary genomics. The current state-of-the-art methods exploit probabilistic models of sequence evolution along phylogenetic trees, by searching for the tree maximizing the likelihood of observed sequences, or by estimating the posterior of the tree given the sequences in a Bayesian framework. Both approaches typically require to compute likelihoods, which is only feasible under simplifying assumptions such as independence of the evolution at the different positions of the sequence, and even then remains a costly operation. Here we present the first likelihood-free inference method for posterior distributions over phylogenies. It exploits a novel expressive encoding for pairs of sequences, and a parameterized probability distribution factorized over a succession of subtree merges. The resulting network provides well-calibrated estimates of the posterior distribution leading to more accurate tree topologies than existing methods, even under models amenable to likelihood computation. We further show that its edge against likelihood-based methods dramatically increases under models of sequence evolution with intractable likelihoods.</description>

      <title>Out-of-Distribution Detection in Molecular Complexes via Diffusion Models for Irregular Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18454v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Predictive machine learning models generally excel on in-distribution data, but their performance degrades on out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. Reliable deployment therefore requires robust OOD detection, yet this is particularly challenging for irregular 3D graphs that combine continuous geometry with categorical identities and are unordered by construction. Here, we present a probabilistic OOD detection framework for complex 3D graph data built on a diffusion model that learns a density of the training distribution in a fully unsupervised manner. A key ingredient we introduce is a unified continuous diffusion over both 3D coordinates and discrete features: categorical identities are embedded in a continuous space and trained with cross-entropy, while the corresponding diffusion score is obtained analytically via posterior-mean interpolation from predicted class probabilities. This yields a single self-consistent probability-flow ODE (PF-ODE) that produces per-sample log-likelihoods, providing a principled typicality score for distribution shift. We validate the approach on protein-ligand complexes and construct strict OOD datasets by withholding entire protein families from training. PF-ODE likelihoods identify held-out families as OOD and correlate strongly with prediction errors of an independent binding-affinity model (GEMS), enabling a priori reliability estimates on new complexes. Beyond scalar likelihoods, we show that multi-scale PF-ODE trajectory statistics - including path tortuosity, flow stiffness, and vector-field instability - provide complementary OOD information. Modeling the joint distribution of these trajectory features yields a practical, high-sensitivity detector that improves separation over likelihood-only baselines, offering a label-free OOD quantification workflow for geometric deep learning.</description>
