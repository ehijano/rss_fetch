      <title>Empirical investigation of nuclear correlation function distributions in lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-point correlation functions of systems with baryon number $B \in \{1,2,3,4\}$ are investigated using lattice Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). In particular, the empirical distributions of importance-sampling Monte-Carlo samples of these correlation functions are examined as a function of the spacetime separation between the two points and the baryon number. While the exact forms of these distributions are not known for QCD, recent work has determined asymptotic expressions for analogous correlation function distributions in simpler theories such as scalar field theory and the disordered phase of the $O(N)$ model. The theoretical O(N) model distributions are found to provide an accurate description of the empirical QCD distributions at zero momentum over a wide range of temporal separations for each baryon number when assessed with a range of different statistical tests. In particular, the behaviour of the baryon number $B$ QCD correlation function at large temporal separation is well-reproduced by the $O(N \sim 2/B)$ model distribution.</description>

      <title>Studying Effective String Theory using deep generative models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective String Theory (EST) offers a robust non-perturbative framework for describing confinement in Yang-Mills theory by treating the confining flux tube between a static quark-antiquark pair as a thin, vibrating string. While EST calculations are typically carried out using zeta-function regularization, certain problems-such as determining the flux tube width-are too complex to solve analytically. However, recent studies have demonstrated that EST can be explored numerically by employing deep learning techniques based on generative algorithms. In this work, we provide a brief introduction to EST and this novel numerical approach. Finally, we present results for the width of the Nambu-Got\"o EST.</description>

      <title>Bosonization and Kramers-Wannier dualities in general dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well known that the noninteracting Majorana chain is dual to the one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model, either through the Jordan-Wigner transformation or by gauging fermion parity. In this correspondence, the minimal translation of the Majorana chain maps to the celebrated Kramers-Wannier (KW) duality of the spin model, with the critical point mapped to the self-dual point. In this work, we generalize this mapping to two and higher dimensions by constructing a unitary equivalence between the parity-gauged fermionic system and a spin system defined on arbitrary polyhedral decompositions of space. Imposing the flatness condition on the gauge field yields a bosonization duality between the original (ungauged) fermionic system and a gauged spin system obeying a Gauss law. The dependence of the Gauss law in the spin system on the Kasteleyn orientation (and the discrete spin structure) of the fermionic system is made explicit. Applying this bosonization to one or two copies of Majorana fermions on translationally invariant lattices, we derive higher-dimensional analogs of KW (self-)dualities in spin systems arising from fermionic minimal translations. The KW (self-)dualities are non-invertible due to projections onto eigenspaces of higher-form symmetries in the associated symmetry operators. The bosonization framework we present is intuitive, general, and systematic, encompassing other known exact bosonization methods while offering a novel approach to establish new connections between fermionic and spin systems in arbitrary dimensions.</description>

      <title>Lee-Yang-zero ratio method in three-dimensional Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By performing Monte Carlo simulations of the three-dimensional Ising model, we apply the recently proposed Lee-Yang-zero ratio (LYZR) method to determine the location of the critical point in this model. We demonstrate that the LYZR method is as powerful as the conventional Binder-cumulant method in studying the critical point, while the LYZR method has the advantage of suppressing the violation of the finite-size scaling and non-linearity near the critical point. We also achieve a precise determination of the values of the LYZRs at the critical point, which are universal numbers. In addition, we propose an alternative method that uses only a single Lee-Yang zero and show that it is also useful for the search for the critical point.</description>

      <title>Physics of the gluon mass gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has long been known that the gluon propagator in Landau-gauge QCD exhibits a mass gap; and its emergence has been ascribed to the action of the Schwinger mechanism in the gauge sector of QCD. In the present work, we relate this property to the physical mass gap of QCD by considering two observables associated with confinement and chiral symmetry breaking, namely the confinement-deconfinement transition temperature and the pion decay constant, respectively. It turns out that the first observable is linearly proportional to the gluon mass gap, a fact that allows us to assign a direct physical meaning to this scale. Moreover, we identify three distinct momentum regimes in the gluon propagator, ultraviolet, intermediate, and deep infrared, and assess their impact on the aforementioned observables. Both observables are sensitive to the first two regions of momenta, where functional approaches essentially coincide, but are insensitive to the third, deep infrared, regime. The combined information is used for a simple fit for the gluon propagator, all of whose parameters admit a clear physical interpretation. Finally, we discuss how this fit can help us access the intertwined dynamics of confinement and chiral symmetry breaking in QCD-type theories.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic properties of heavy-light mesons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Within the Bethe-Salpeter framework, we present a computation of space-like electromagnetic form factors for pseudoscalar mesons, including light and heavy-light systems. Our approach employs a flavour-dependent variation of the standard Taylor effective charge, which contains key contributions from the quark-gluon vertices. This effective interaction is a common ingredient of all relevant dynamical equations, and accommodates the crucial mass differences between the various quark flavours. Particular attention is paid to the nonperturbative determination of the quark-photon vertex. The computed electromagnetic form factors for the pion and the kaon mesons show excellent agreement with experimental determinations. In addition, the predictions for the charge radii of heavy-light systems are in overall good agreement with lattice QCD.</description>

      <title>Single- and double-heavy Hadronic Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this presentation the notion of hadronic molecules is reviewed and it is argued that some of the enigmatic single and double heavy mesons, namely the lowest lying positive parity open charm states, the $T_{cc}(3875)^+$ and the $\chi_{c1}(3872)$ aka $X(3872)$, that do not fit into the conventional quark--anti-quark scheme in fact qualify as hadronic molecules. For the single heavy states we show that an alternative explanation as diquark--anti-diquark structure is at odds with either phenomenology or lattice data. For the $X(3872)$ we discuss also the claimed isovector partner state, whose properties would provide additional strong support for a molecular structure of the $J^{PC}=1^{++}$ states near the $D\bar D^{*}$ thresholds. Its existence could be confirmed by, e.g., a high statistics measurement of the $J/\psi\pi^+\pi^-$ lineshape from $B^0\to K^0 J/\psi\pi^+\pi^-$.</description>

      <title>Matching Wilson flow time for calculating the topological charge density and the pseudoscalar glueball mass in quenched lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02756v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The matching Wilson flow time for calculating the topological charge density correlator (TCDC) of the gluonic definition by the Wilson flow is analyzed using the matching procedure. The relationship has been established between the matching Wilson flow time for calculating TCDC and the matching Wilson flow time at which the topological charge defined by the gluon fields is closest to an integer. The properties of TCDC defined by the bosonic field are investigated, and the pseudoscalar glueball mass was extracted from the TCDC computed at the matching Wilson flow time. It is further demonstrated that the matching Wilson flow time determined by the matching procedure can be applied to compute the topological susceptibility in the gluonic definition.</description>

      <title>Exact Diagonalization, Matrix Product States and Conformal Perturbation Theory Study of a 3D Ising Fuzzy Sphere Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00842v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Numerical studies of phase transitions in statistical and quantum lattice models provide crucial insights into the corresponding Conformal Field Theories (CFTs). In higher dimensions, comparing finite-volume numerical results to infinite-volume CFT data is facilitated by choosing the sphere $S^{d-1}$ as the spatial manifold. Recently, the fuzzy sphere regulator in Ref. [Zhu et al, Phys. Rev. X 13 021009 (2023)] has enabled such studies with exact rotational invariance, yielding impressive agreement with known 3D Ising CFT predictions, as well as new results. However, systematic improvements and a deeper understanding of finite-size corrections remain essential. In this work, we revisit the fuzzy sphere regulator, focusing on the original Ising model, with two main goals. First, we assess the robustness of this approach using Conformal Perturbation Theory (CPT), to which we provide a detailed guidebook. We demonstrate how CPT provides a unified framework for determining the critical point, the speed of light, and residual deviations from CFT predictions. Applying this framework, we study finite-size corrections and clarify the role of tuning the model in minimizing these effects. Second, we develop a novel method for extracting Operator Product Expansion (OPE) coefficients from fuzzy sphere data. This method leverages the sensitivity of energy levels to detuning from criticality, providing new insights into level mixing and avoided crossings in finite systems. Our work also includes validation of CPT in a 1+1D Ising model away from the integrable limit.</description>
