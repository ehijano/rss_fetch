      <title>How does ClinicalTrials.gov Impact Company Innovation?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pharmaceutical companies may have incentives to exaggerate the therapeutic effects of their developed products during the clinical stage, which endangers the health of patients. To increase transparency in clinical practice, the NIH established ClinicalTrials.gov in 2000, which indicates a significant impact on medicine. However, little evidence shows how ClinicalTrials.gov affects medical enterprises innovation. By identifying the patent application activities through USPTO, Pubmed, and Compustat, we used coherent DID to prove the impact of ClinicalTrials.gov on innovation. We found that the emergence of ClinicalTrials.gov reduced the number of patent applications and led to a shift in RD directions. This effect can also be moderated depending on firm size, probably because small companies are more incentivized to manipulate data. Hence, we suggest agencies could consider wide-ranging influences when formulating open science policies.</description>

      <title>Medical Research as a Productivity Indicator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Across fields, the quantity of research has increased substantially, without an attendant increase in output. We argue that, in medicine, this indicator of declining productivity reflects a compositional shift toward low-capital, low-productivity research. Using a fine-tuned, open-source large language model, we construct a novel census of capital-intensive, high-productivity medical investment -- clinical trials. Since 2010, the annual quantity of clinical trials has been constant. By contrast, the quantity of other forms of clinical research has increased substantially. Within clinical trials, there is substantial heterogeneity in productivity. The distribution of this heterogeneity is stable over time.</description>

      <title>Trade Openness, Tariffs and Economic Growth: An Empirical Study from Countries of G-20</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: International trade has been in the forefront of economic development and growth debates. Trade openness, its definition, scope, and impacts have also been studied numerously. Tariff has been dubbed as negative influencer of economic growth as per conventional wisdom and most empirical studies. This paper empirically examines relationships among trade openness as trade share to GDP, import tariff rate and economic growth. Panel dataset of 11 G-20 member countries were selected for the study. Results found a positively significant correlation between trade openness and economic growth. Tariff has negatively significant correlation with economic growth in lagged model. OLS and panel data fixed-effects regression were employed to carry out the regression analysis. To deal with endogeneity in trade openness variable, a 1-year lag regression technique was conducted. Results are robust and significant. Policy recommendation suggests country specific trade opening and tariff relaxation.</description>

      <title>Large increases in public R&amp;D investment are needed to avoid declines of US agricultural productivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Increasing agricultural productivity is a gradual process with significant time lags between research and development (R&amp;D) investment and the resulting gains. We estimate the response of US agricultural Total Factor Productivity (TFP) to both R&amp;D investment and weather, and quantify the public R&amp;D spending required to offset the emerging impacts of climate change. We find that offsetting the climate-induced productivity slowdown by 2050 alone requires a sustained public R&amp;D spending growth of 5.2-7.8% per year over 2021-2050. This amounts to an additional $208-$434B investment over this period. These are substantial requirements comparable to the public R&amp;D spending growth that followed the two World Wars.</description>

      <title>The Causal Effect of Repealing Certificate-of-Need Laws for Ambulatory Surgical Centers: Does Access to Medical Services Increase?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many states, certificate-of-need (CON) laws prevent ambulatory surgical centers (ASCs) from entering the market or expanding their services. This paper estimates the causal effects of state ASC-CON law repeal on the accessibility of medical services statewide, as well as for rural areas. Our findings show that CON law repeals increase ASCs per capita by 44-47% statewide and 92-112% in rural areas. Repealing ASC-CON laws causes a continuous increase in ASCs per capita, an effect which levels off ten years after repeal. Contrary to the 'cream-skimming' hypothesis, we find no evidence that CON repeal is associated with hospital closures in rural areas. Rather, some regression models show that repeal is associated with fewer medical service reductions.</description>

      <title>Rural Healthcare Access and Supply Constraints: A Causal Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Certificate-of-need (CON) laws require that healthcare providers receive approval from a state board before offering additional services in a given community. Proponents of CON laws claim that these laws are needed to prevent the oversupply of healthcare services in urban areas and to increase access in rural areas, which are predominantly underserved. Yet, the policy could lower rural access if used by incumbents to limit entry from competitors. We explore the repeal of these regulations in five U.S. states to offer the first estimate of the causal effects of CON laws on rural and urban healthcare access. We find that repealing CON laws causes a substantial increase in hospitals in both rural and urban areas. We also find that the repeal leads to fewer beds and smaller hospitals on average, suggesting an increase in entry and competition in both rural and urban areas.</description>

      <title>The allocation of FIFA World Cup slots based on the ranking of confederations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19100v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Qualifications for several world championships in sports are organised such that distinct sets of teams play in their own tournament for a predetermined number of slots. Inspired by a recent work studying the problem with the tools from the literature on fair allocation, this paper provides an alternative approach based on historical matches between these sets of teams. We focus on the FIFA World Cup due to the existence of an official rating system and its recent expansion to 48 teams, as well as to allow for a comparison with the already suggested allocations. Our proposal extends the methodology of the FIFA World Ranking to compare the strengths of five confederations. Various allocations are presented depending on the length of the sample, the set of teams considered, as well as the frequency of rating updates. The results show that more European and South American teams should play in the FIFA World Cup. The ranking of continents by the number of deserved slots is different from the ranking implied by FIFA policy. We recommend allocating at least some slots transparently, based on historical performances, similar to the access list of the UEFA Champions League.</description>

      <title>The Effect of Antitrust Enforcement on Venture Capital Investments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13564v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the effect of antitrust enforcement on venture capital (VC) investments and VC-backed companies. To establish causality, I exploit the DOJ's decision to close several antitrust field offices in 2013, which reduced the antitrust enforcement in areas near the closed offices. I find that the reduction in antitrust enforcement causes a significant decrease in VC investments in startups located in the affected areas. Furthermore, these affected VC-backed startups exhibit a reduced likelihood of successful exits and diminished innovation performance. These negative results are mainly driven by startups in concentrated industries, where incumbents tend to engage in anticompetitive behaviors more frequently. To mitigate the adverse effect, startups should innovate more to differentiate their products. This paper sheds light on the importance of local antitrust enforcement in fostering competition and innovation.</description>
