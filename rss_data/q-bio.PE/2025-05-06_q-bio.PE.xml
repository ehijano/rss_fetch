      <title>A mathematical model of human population reproduction through marriage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a linear one-sex dynamical model of human population reproduction through marriage. In our model, we assume that a woman can repeatedly marry and divorce but only married women produce children. The iterative marriage process is formulated by a three-state compartmental model, which is described by the system of McKendrick equations with the duration-specific birth rate by age at marriage. In order to see the effect of changes in nuptiality on fertility, new formulae for the reproduction indices are given. In particular, the total fertility rate (TFR) is considered as the product of the indices of marriage and marital fertility. Using the vital statistics of Japan, we can show that our model can provide a reasonable estimate of the Japanese TFR, and its possible future scenario.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Diseased-Impacted Prey Populations: Defense and Allee Effect Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study introduces an innovative framework for merging ecological and epidemiological modeling via the formulation of a sophisticated predator-prey model that addresses the intricacies of disease dynamics, the Allee effect, and defensive mechanisms through prey aggregation. Employing rigorous stability and bifurcation analyses, we identify multiple feasible equilibria and establish critical thresholds that influence population survival and extinction. Our mathematical model reveals that the intensity of the Allee effect plays a crucial role in shaping population recovery and disease persistence, offering pivotal insights into finite time extinction mechanisms. We further illustrate, through extensive numerical simulations, that adjusting susceptible prey aggregation strategically can substantially reduce disease transmission, emphasizing the applicability of our findings for practical conservation interventions. The combined modulation of the aggregation constant and Allee effect determined three primary ecological outcomes: stable coexistence, elimination of infected prey, and complete population extinction. Moreover, these results have significant implications for wildlife management and ecosystem resilience, providing a solid theoretical framework for interdisciplinary strategies aimed at protecting endangered species.</description>

      <title>Heterosynaptic Circuits Are Universal Gradient Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a design principle for the learning circuits of the biological brain. The principle states that almost any dendritic weights updated via heterosynaptic plasticity can implement a generalized and efficient class of gradient-based meta-learning. The theory suggests that a broad class of biologically plausible learning algorithms, together with the standard machine learning optimizers, can be grounded in heterosynaptic circuit motifs. This principle suggests that the phenomenology of (anti-) Hebbian (HBP) and heterosynaptic plasticity (HSP) may emerge from the same underlying dynamics, thus providing a unifying explanation. It also suggests an alternative perspective of neuroplasticity, where HSP is promoted to the primary learning and memory mechanism, and HBP is an emergent byproduct. We present simulations that show that (a) HSP can explain the metaplasticity of neurons, (b) HSP can explain the flexibility of the biology circuits, and (c) gradient learning can arise quickly from simple evolutionary dynamics that do not compute any explicit gradient. While our primary focus is on biology, the principle also implies a new approach to designing AI training algorithms and physically learnable AI hardware. Conceptually, our result demonstrates that contrary to the common belief, gradient computation may be extremely easy and common in nature.</description>

      <title>Sunlight-heated refugia protect frogs from chytridiomycosis: a mathematical modelling study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06846v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The fungal disease Chytridiomycosis poses a threat to frog populations worldwide. It has driven over 90 amphibian species to extinction and severely affected hundreds more. Difficulties in disease management have shown a need for novel conservation approaches.
  We present a novel mathematical model for chytridiomycosis transmission in frogs that includes the natural history of infection, to test the hypothesis that sunlight-heated refugia reduce transmission. The model is fit using approximate Bayesian computation to experimental data where a cohort of frogs, a fixed subset of which had cleared a prior infection, were provided access to either sunlight-heated or shaded refugia. Using our model, we can estimate the extent to which prior chytridiomycosis infection protects against subsequent infection, and quantify the effect of sunlight-heating of refugia.
  Results estimate a 40% reduction in chytridiomycosis transmission when frogs have access to sunlight-heated refugia, compared to shaded refugia. This strongly supports the hypothesis that the sunlight-heated refugia reduce disease transmission. Frogs that were infected and recovered were estimated to have a reduction in susceptibility of approximately 97% compared to frogs with no prior infection.
  This research provides quantitative evidence supporting sunlight-heated refugia as an effective disease management tool for chytridiomycosis in frog populations. By estimating both the impact of refugia and the protective effects of prior infection, the model provides an evidence base for implementing sunlight-heated refugia as part of amphibian conservation strategies. This work represents an important first step in using mathematical modelling to inform policy on the design and implementation of habitat-based interventions to support amphibian population recovery and long-term sustainability.</description>
