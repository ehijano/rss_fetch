      <title>Resonances: Universality and Factorization on Higher Sheets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most particles in nature are unstable, manifesting as resonances in scattering processes. Using analyticity and unitarity, we show nonperturbatively that resonances, defined as poles on higher Riemann sheets of scattering amplitudes, share basic properties with stable particles: (i) Universality, that a resonance generically appears in every S-matrix element; and (ii) Factorization, that amplitudes factorize on resonance poles. Our framework applies in any spacetime dimension and across arbitrarily many two-particle cuts, including cases where the kinematic Riemann surface becomes infinitely sheeted. Importantly, we find that resonance data (mass, width, couplings, and sheet index) are fully encoded on the physical sheet, where causality can impose additional constraints. These results are relevant for extending S-matrix bootstrap studies beyond elastic scattering.</description>

      <title>Positivity with Long-Range Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce infrared finite, analytic, crossing symmetric, Regge behaved, and Lorentz invariant amplitudes $\mathcal{M}_{\mathcal {E}}$, labeled by the experimental energy resolution $\mathcal{E}$ for detecting soft photons and gravitons. For $\mathcal{E}$ exponentially smaller than any hard scale, they also satisfy unitarity and their associated cross sections reproduce the inclusive, infrared-finite cross sections of ordinary amplitudes. These properties make $\mathcal{M}_{\mathcal{E}}$ suitable for deriving infrared-safe positivity bounds on effective field theories in the presence of long-range forces even in $D=4$. As an illustration, we present explicit bounds in the low-energy theory of pions coupled to electromagnetism and gravity.</description>

      <title>Symmetries of de Sitter Particles and Amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the symmetry aspects of quantum field theory in global four-dimensional de Sitter spacetime linked to $SO(1,4)$ isometries. For the unitary irreducible representations relevant to elementary particles, we obtain explicit transformation laws for the symmetry generators acting on one-particle states in a basis adapted to the $SU(2) \times SU(2)'$ decomposition of the Hilbert space. Using these results, we derive the corresponding Ward identities and demonstrate how global spacetime symmetries constrain de Sitter scattering amplitudes. We show that the Poincar\'e algebra and flat-space Ward identities are recovered in the large-momentum limit.</description>

      <title>The spectrum of Feynman-integral geometries at two loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a complete classification of the Feynman-integral geometries at two-loop order in four-dimensional Quantum Field Theory with standard quadratic propagators. Concretely, we consider a finite basis of integrals in the 't Hooft--Veltman scheme, i.e. with $D$-dimensional loop momenta and four-dimensional external momenta, which belong to 79 independent topologies, or sectors. Then, we analyze the leading singularities of the integrals in those sectors for generic values of the masses and momenta, using the loop-by-loop Baikov representation. Aside from the Riemann sphere, we find that elliptic curves, hyperelliptic curves of genus 2 and 3 as well as K3 surfaces occur. Moreover, we find for the first time in Feynman integrals a smooth and non-degenerate Del Pezzo surface of degree 2, a particular Fano variety known to be rationalizable, resulting in a curve of geometric genus 3. These geometries determine the space of functions relevant for Quantum Field Theories at two-loop order, including in the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Non-hermitian Density Matrices from Time-like Entanglement and Wormholes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extensively explore the connections between time-like entanglement and non-hermitian density matrices in quantum many-body systems. We classify setups where we encounter non-hermitian density matrices into two types: one is due to causal influences under unitary evolutions, and the other is due to non-unitary evolutions in non-hermitian systems. We provide various examples of these setups including interacting harmonic oscillators, two dimensional conformal field theories and holographic dualities. In them, we compute the time-like entanglement entropy and imagitivity, which measures how much density matrices are non-hermitian. In both two classes, typical holographic examples are given by traversable AdS wormholes. We explain how causal influences in a wormhole dual to a pair of non-hermitian quantum systems is possible even without interactions between them. We argue that to realize a traversable wormhole we need not only ordinary quantum entanglement but also time-like entanglement.</description>

      <title>"Filtering" CFTs at large N: Euclidean Wormholes, Closed Universes, and Black Hole Interiors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite its successes, the large-$N$ holographic dictionary remains incomplete. Key features of gravitational path integrals--most notably Euclidean wormholes and the associated failure of factorization--lack a clear interpretation in the standard large-$N$ framework. A related challenge is the possibility of erratic $N$-dependence in CFT observables, behavior with no evident semiclassical gravitational counterpart.
  We argue that these puzzles point to a missing ingredient in the dictionary: a large-$N$ filter. This filter projects out the erratic $N$-dependence of CFT quantities when mapping them to semiclassical bulk physics, providing an intrinsic boundary definition of gravitational "averages." It also offers a boundary explanation of wormhole contributions and a boundary prediction of their amplitudes, thereby giving a natural resolution of the factorization puzzle. In addition, we derive an infinite tower of inequalities constraining wormhole amplitudes and argue that internal wormholes do not induce random couplings in the low-energy effective theory.
  Beyond resolving factorization, the large-$N$ filter supplies a generalized framework from which richer Lorentzian spacetime structures can emerge, including closed universes and black hole interiors. We argue that, as a consequence of erratic large-$N$ behavior, both closed universes and black hole interiors are quantum volatile, and that an AdS spacetime entangled with a baby universe is likewise quantum volatile. This volatility may allow an observer in AdS to infer the existence of the baby universe, whereas for an infalling observer, the ability to make measurements near a black hole horizon may become fundamentally limited--even if they may not live long enough to notice.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Cohen-Macaulay One-Loop Feynman Integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the generalized hypergeometric systems, in the sense of Gel'fand, Kapranov, and Zelevinsky, associated with one-loop Feynman integrals, and determine when their rank is independent of space-time dimension and propagator powers. This is equivalent to classifying when the associated affine semigroup ring is Cohen-Macaulay. For massive one-loop integrals, we prove necessary and sufficient conditions for Cohen-Macaulayness, generalizing previous results on normality for these rings. We show that for Feynman integrals, the Cohen-Macaulay property is fully determined by an integer linear program built from the Newton polytope of the integrand and find a graphical description of its solutions. Furthermore, we provide a sufficient condition for Cohen-Macaulayness of general one-loop integrals.</description>

      <title>Black Holes and Abelian Instantons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We argue that the electromagnetic $\theta$-term is a physical parameter of the Standard Model coupled to gravity. Specifically, in the context of 4-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell theory we show that there exist Euclidean field configurations that have finite action, are asymptotically flat, and feature non-zero electromagnetic second Chern number. These ``gravitational Abelian instantons" correspond to a dyonic extension of a Euclidean wormhole. We argue that these configurations should be included in the gravitational path integral, and that doing so generates a non-perturbative contribution to the vacuum energy density that is $\theta$-dependent. We provide a Lorentzian interpretation of these instantons as capturing the effect of quantum fluctuations corresponding to pair production and annihilation of charged black holes. When $\theta$ is the expectation value of a dynamical axion field, the instantons presented here generate a potential for the axion, thereby breaking the axion shift symmetry. This provides yet another example of how quantum gravity violates global symmetries through the existence of black holes.</description>

      <title>Quantum Walks and Exact RG in de Sitter Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The local physics of light scalar fields in de Sitter space is well described by classical random walks, as expressed through the framework of Stochastic Inflation. Recent work has clarified how this formalism arises from quantum field theory (QFT) and the renormalization group (RG), allowing for corrections to this formalism to be determined order by order. Yet, this description is incomplete. For example, the quantum dynamics of these fields are expected to become important when determining the tail of the probability distribution for the fluctuations. In this paper, we develop the understanding of fields in de Sitter as a quantum walk in order to bridge the gap between the classical and quantum description. We use the framework of exact RG to calculate the evolution equation for the reduced density matrix of the long wavelength fields. This master equation provides the direct map from light fields to models of quantum walks. We show how to reduce the master equation to Stochastic Inflation, and provide a new understanding of how the higher-order corrections arise. In the process, we demonstrate that divergences and secular growth in de Sitter, for both light and heavy fields, can be absorbed by (dynamical) renormalization.</description>

      <title>The Role of Microstate Degeneracy in Phase Transitions: Gravitational Waves from Bubble Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vacuum bubbles, formed in first order phase transitions, have important implications for cosmology. In particular, they source gravitational waves. Usually, it is assumed that, once bubbles are materialized, their state, further evolution and mergers are well-described classically. This paper will show that this intuition breaks down for bubbles which possess high microstate degeneracy. This is generic when the phase transition breaks spontaneously a symmetry. First, the degeneracy enhances the transition rate. Furthermore, the internal quantum state of the bubbles profoundly affects the classical dynamics of their mergers. A bubble, no matter how macroscopic, is born in a maximally entangled quantum state. This state can be viewed as a symmetric superposition of many different would-be classical bubbles. The inner entanglement is largely maintained up until their mergers. The resulting true quantum dynamics of the merger is macroscopically different from any type of classical mergers. These differences are imprinted as macroscopic features in the resulting classical gravitational waves. In this way, the inner microstate entanglement of merging bubbles provides a qualitatively new source of gravitational waves. This phenomenon is quantified and compared with the swift memory burden effect in black hole mergers.</description>

      <title>Scaling solutions for gauge invariant flow equations in dilaton quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of quantum gravity for models of a scalar singlet coupled to the metric. Such models describe inflation for early cosmology and dynamical dark energy for late cosmology. We work within the ''variable gravity approximation" keeping in the effective action an arbitrary field dependence for terms with up to two derivatives. We focus on the scaling solutions of the gauge invariant functional flow equation which describes the dependence of the effective action on a momentum or length scale. The existence of such solutions is required for the ultraviolet fixed point defining an ultraviolet complete renormalizable quantum field theory for gravity. Our findings strengthen the case for the presence of a ''dilaton quantum gravity fixed point" for which the Planck mass increases proportional to the scalar field for large field values. This fixed point is different from the extended Reuter fixed point with a flat scalar potential and field-independent Planck mass, which is also seen in our setting.</description>

      <title>New analytic solutions of non-SUSY black branes in $10$-D heterotic supergravity and the phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the exploration of the vast string landscape, we provide new analytic solutions of non-SUSY black branes in 10-D heterotic supergravity which exhibit a phase transition. Our black brane solutions carry two kinds of gauge charges but still are exact, which extends the recent developments in classification of heterotic branes. The solutions offer a novel method to embed previously known noncritical 2-D or 3-D solutions to the critical dimensions. Furthermore, by performing a perturbative analysis of the non-Abelian gauge field on this exact background, we analytically find that as the temperature decreases, a spontaneous symmetry breaking occurs, leading to a dynamical instability accompanied by gauge field condensation. This instability embodies a phase transition of black branes in heterotic supergravity, and analytically predicts the existence of unknown black hole solutions to be unveiled. Our results suggest that phase transition phenomena can be used to explore and analyze the phase structure of black hole solutions, for systematically discovering and classifying stringy black holes.</description>

      <title>General Effective Theories of Black Holes in the Large D Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the general form of the effective equations governing black hole dynamics in the limit of a large number of dimensions $D$. These split into a universal \emph{soap-bubble} embedding condition for stationary configurations and a set of nonlinear dynamical evolution equations describing near-horizon fluctuations of $O(1/D)$ amplitude over horizon scales of $O(1/\sqrt{D})$. We obtain these equations in full generality, including arbitrary asymptotic sources in the near-horizon region, and we show that they form a parabolic system with a well-posed initial value problem. To connect the various approaches to large-$D$ black hole dynamics, we also show that both the embedding and dynamical equations can be derived from the covariant membrane formalism. We clarify the intrinsic scope of the large-$D$ approach, emphasizing that it yields a well-posed dynamical evolution only on horizon scales of $O(1/\sqrt{D})$, which is the range where the most relevant horizon dynamics occur. Our results highlight the versatility of these effective theories for studying a wide class of black hole phenomena.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Lockdown: When Decoherence Saves the Universe from Tunneling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how quantum decoherence influences the tunneling dynamics of quantum fields in cosmological spacetimes. Specifically, we study a scalar field in an asymmetric double well potential during inflation, coupled to environmental degrees of freedom provided either by heavy spectator fields or by short-wavelength modes as they cross out the Hubble scale. This setup enables a systematic derivation of both Markovian and non-Markovian master equations, along with their stochastic unravelings, which we solve numerically. We find that, while decoherence is essential for suppressing quantum interference between vacua, its impact on the relative vacuum populations is limited. Fields heavier than the Hubble scale relax adiabatically toward the true vacuum with high probability, while lighter fields exhibit non-adiabatic enhancements of false-vacuum occupation. Once the system has decohered, quantum tunneling between vacua becomes strongly suppressed, effectively locking the system into the stochastically selected local minimum. This ``cosmic lockdown'' mechanism is a manifestation of the quantum Zeno effect: environmental monitoring stabilizes enhanced false-vacuum occupation for light fields by preventing them from tunneling.</description>

      <title>Gravitational charges and radiation in asymptotically locally de Sitter spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive discussion of gravitational charges and radiation in four-dimensional asymptotically locally de Sitter (AldS) spacetimes. Such spacetimes have compact spatial sections and possess spacelike past and future infinities, $\mathscr{I}^\pm$. We show that the variational problem is well-posed if one specifies a conformal class up to three-dimensional diffeomorpshims at $\mathscr{I}^\pm$, provided one adds at $\mathscr{I}^\pm$ suitable local terms. These are analogues of the AdS covariant counterterms of holographic renormalisation. Radiation is possible only when the conformal class at infinity is non-trivial. Bulk diffeomorphisms that asymptote to conformal Killing vectors at $\mathscr{I}^\pm$ lead to gravitational charges that are conserved under radial translations, while transformations that asymptote to a general three-dimensional vector imply that the gravitational charges satisfy flux-balance laws. We also present quantities that are invariant under temporal translations, if gravitational flux is absent, but otherwise satisfy flux-balance laws. We derive these results using first principles application of Noether's method as well as covariant phase space methods. We apply our formalism to several exact solutions, including the Robinson-Trautman-dS class, which we use to demonstrate the existence of conserved charges even in the absence of asymptotic conformal Killing vectors and the existence of monotonic charges, including the Bondi mass.</description>

      <title>Anti-de Sitter flag superspace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work aims to develop a global formulation for ${\cal N}=2$ harmonic/projective anti-de Sitter (AdS) superspace $\text{AdS}^{4|8}\times S^2 \simeq \text{AdS}^{4|8}\times {\mathbb C}P^1$ that allows for a simple action of superconformal (and hence AdS isometry) transformations. First of all, we provide an alternative supertwistor description of the ${\cal N}$-extended AdS superspace in four dimensions, AdS$^{4|4\cal N}$, which corresponds to a realisation of the connected component $\mathsf{OSp}_0({\cal N}|4; {\mathbb R})$ of the AdS isometry supergroup as $\mathsf{SU}(2,2 |{\cal N}) \bigcap \mathsf{OSp} ({\cal N}| 4; {\mathbb C})$. The proposed realisation yields the following properties: (i) AdS$^{4|4\cal N}$ is an open domain of the compactified ${\cal N}$-extended Minkowski superspace, $\overline{\mathbb M}^{4|4\cal N}$; (ii) the infinitesimal ${\cal N}$-extended superconformal transformations naturally act on AdS$^{4|4\cal N}$; and (iii) the isometry transformations of AdS$^{4|4\cal N}$ are described by those superconformal transformations which obey a certain constraint. The obtained results for AdS$^{4|4\cal N}$ are then applied to develop a supertwistor formulation for an AdS flag superspace $ \text{AdS}^{4|8} \times {\mathbb F}_1(2)$ that we identify with the ${\cal N}=2$ harmonic/projective AdS superspace. This construction makes it possible to read off the superconformal and AdS isometry transformations acting on the analytic subspace of the harmonic superspace.</description>

      <title>Holography and the Swampland: Constraints on Quantum Gravity from Holographic Principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Swampland Program aims to delineate the space of consistent low-energy effective field theories (EFTs) that admit a UV completion in quantum gravity from those that do not. In parallel, holography, and particularly the AdS/CFT correspondence, offers a non-perturbative definition of quantum gravity in asymptotically anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetimes. In this paper, we explore the Swampland Conjectures through the lens of holography, focusing on how holographic consistency conditions, such as the convexity of the conformal field theory (CFT) spectrum, the averaged null energy condition (ANEC), and the modular bootstrap, map onto Swampland constraints in the bulk. We argue that the holographic principle provides a geometric realization of Swampland bounds, particularly on scalar field potentials and the absence of long-lived de Sitter vacua. Finally, we discuss how the emergent bulk locality in AdS/CFT provides evidence that the Swampland conjectures may themselves be manifestations of deeper holographic consistency conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we revisit abelian S-duality in the context of higher gauge theory. By using a specific crossed module a set of transformations arise, which are known as the "thin" and "fat" transformations. The "fat" transformations are the ones introduced by hand to construct the S-dual theory. By utilizing crossed modules and higher gauge theory, we arrive at transformations referred to by some as "third-type transformations", giving these transformations a geometric interpretation, as transformations of a local 2-connection in a 2-principal bundle. This approach opens a new perspective to understand S-duality in non-abelian gauge theories through higher gauge theory.</description>

      <title>A Compact Formula for Conserved Three-Point Tensor Structures in 4D CFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a compact analytic formula for a complete basis of conformally invariant tensor structures for three-point functions of conserved operators in arbitrary 4D Lorentz representations. The construction follows directly from a novel constraint equivalent to applying conservation conditions at each point: the leading terms in all OPE limits appear as symmetric traceless tensors. We derive this by lifting to a unified $\mathrm{SU}(m,m|2n)$ analytic superspace framework, where the conservation conditions are automatically solved and then reducing back to 4D CFT. The same method is also used for cases involving one non-conserved operator. This formalism further reveals a map of the counting of CFT tensor structures to that of finite-dimensional $\mathrm{SU}(2n)$ representations, solved by Littlewood-Richardson coefficients. All results can be directly re-interpreted as three-point $\mathcal{N}=2$ and $\mathcal{N}=4$ superconformal tensor structures via the unified analytic superspace.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ultra-relativistic (Carrollian) regime of gravity has recently emerged as a fertile framework for exploring holography, non-Lorentzian symmetries, and geometric limit of General Relativity. In this letter, we establish the presence of a non-vanishing torsion within three-dimensional Carrollian gravity by constructing the Carrollian Mielke-Baekler (C-MB) gravity theory in its Chern-Simons formulation, obtained as the ultra-relativistic limit of the relativistic Mielke-Baekler model. The resulting C-MB theory features non-zero temporal torsion and curvature, together with spatial curvature, providing the most general three-dimensional Carrollian gravity model with these properties. Several known ultra-relativistic gravity theories arise as particular limits of this framework, highlighting its unifying character.</description>

      <title>On in-in correlators for spinning theories and their shadow formulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In-in correlators are the basic observables in cosmology and are traditionally computed using the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism. In this paper we revisit this formalism for photons, gluons, and gravitons coupled to scalars in four dimensional de Sitter space and provide a novel treatment of boundary gauge-fixing of the underlying path integral. We also derive effective actions in Euclidean Anti-de Sitter space whose Feynman rules compute the in-in correlators of these theories in de Sitter space, generalising the shadow formalism recently obtained for scalar theories. We illustrate this formalism in a number of examples at tree-level and 1-loop, demonstrating its relative simplicity compared to other approaches. Moreover, we initiate the study of color/kinematics duality and the double copy for in-in correlators using dressing rules which uplift flat space Feynman diagrams to de Sitter space.</description>

      <title>Cryptographic transformations over polyadic rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article introduces a novel cryptographic paradigm based on nonderived polyadic algebraic structures. Traditional cryptosystems rely on binary operations within groups, rings, or fields, whose well-understood properties can be exploited in cryptanalysis. To overcome these vulnerabilities, we propose a shift to polyadic rings, which generalize classical rings by allowing operations of higher arity: an $m$-ary addition and an $n$-ary multiplication. The foundation of our approach is the construction of polyadic integers -- congruence classes of ordinary integers endowed with such $m$-ary and $n$-ary operations. A key innovation is the parameter-to-arity mapping $\Phi(a,b)=(m,n)$, which links the parameters $(a,b)$ defining a congruence class to the specific arities required for algebraic closure. This mapping is mathematically intricate: it is non-injective, non-surjective, and multivalued. This complex, non-unique relationship forms the core of the proposed cryptosystem's security. We present two concrete encryption procedures that leverage this structure by encoding plaintext within the parameters of polyadic rings and transmitting information via polyadically quantized analog signals. In one method, plaintext is linked to the additive arity $m_{i}$ and secured using the summation of such signals; in the other, it is linked to a ring parameter $a_{i}$ and secured using their multiplication. In both cases, the "quantized" nature of polyadic operations generates systems of equations that are straightforward for a legitimate recipient with the correct key but exceptionally difficult for an attacker without it. The resulting framework promises a substantial increase in cryptographic security. This work establishes the theoretical foundation for this new class of encryption schemes and highlights their potential for constructing robust, next-generation cryptographic protocols.</description>

      <title>Topological and optical signatures of modified black-hole entropies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate how deviations from the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy modify black-hole spacetimes through the recently proposed entropy-geometry correspondence. For four representative modified entropies, namely Barrow, R\'enyi, Kaniadakis, and logarithmic, we derive the corresponding effective metrics and analyze their thermodynamic and topological classification using the off-shell free energy and winding numbers. We show that Barrow and R\'enyi entropies yield a single unstable sector with global charge $W=-1$, while logarithmic and Kaniadakis corrections produce canceling defects with $W=0$, revealing topological structures absent in the Schwarzschild case. Using the modified metrics, we further calculate the photon-sphere radius and shadow size, showing that each modified entropy relation induces characteristic optical shifts. Thus, by comparing with Event Horizon Telescope observations of Sgr A$^\ast$, we extract new bounds on all entropy-deformation parameters. Our results demonstrate that thermodynamic topology, together with photon-sphere phenomenology, offers a viable way to test generalized entropy frameworks and probe departures from the Bekenstein-Hawking area law.</description>

      <title>Quantum simulation using Trotterized disorder Hamiltonians in a single-mode optical cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: All-to-all interacting and disordered many-body systems are notoriously hard to simulate on quantum platforms, as interactions are commonly mediated by auxiliary degrees of freedom that lower the amount of disorder, introducing undesired correlations. In this work, we show how a Trotterization scheme can be effectively utilized to densify the disorder of the model. In particular, we study the statistical properties of the resulting model, as well as Trotterization errors in the simulation that affect the time evolution and dynamical observables. As a concrete example, we propose an implementation via a single-mode cavity QED platform of the complex Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model. We analyze several features of the effective model, such as the distribution of the effective couplings, the number of interacting sites, state preparation, and the behavior of quantum chaos probes. We conclude this work with a detailed investigation of the robustness of our findings against dissipation, both analytically and numerically.</description>

      <title>Transversal Clifford-Hierarchy Gates via Non-Abelian Surface Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a purely 2D transversal realization of phase gates at any level of the Clifford hierarchy, and beyond, using non-Abelian surface codes. Our construction encodes a logical qubit in the quantum double $D(G)$ of a non-Abelian group $G$ on a triangular spatial patch. The logical gate is implemented transversally by stacking on the spatial region a symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phase specified by a group 2-cocycle. The Bravyi--K\"onig theorem limits the unitary gates implementable by constant-depth quantum circuits on Pauli stabilizer codes in $D$ dimensions to the $D$-th level of the Clifford hierarchy. We bypass this, by constructing transversal unitary gates at arbitrary levels of the Clifford hierarchy purely in 2D, without sacrificing locality or fault tolerance, however at the cost of using the quantum double of a non-Abelian group $G$. Specifically, for $G = D_{4N}$, the dihedral group of order $8N$, we realize the phase gate $T^{1/N} = \mathrm{diag}(1, e^{i\pi/(4N)})$ in the logical $\overline{Z}$ basis. For $8N = 2^n$, this gate lies at the $n$-th level of the Clifford hierarchy and, importantly, has a qubit-only realization: we show that it can be constructed in terms of Clifford-hierarchy stabilizers for a code with $n$ physical qubits on each edge of the lattice. We also discuss code-switching to the $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$ and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ toric codes, which can be utilized for the quantum error correction in this setup.</description>

      <title>Universal Statistics of Measurement-Induced Entanglement in Tomonaga-Luttinger liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the statistics of measurement-induced entanglement (MIE) after partial measurement on a class of one-dimensional quantum critical states described by Tomonaga-Luttinger liquids at low energies. Using a replica trick to average over measurement outcomes in the charge basis and tools from conformal field theory (CFT), we derive closed-form expressions for the cumulants of MIE. We show that exact Born-averaging over microscopic measurement outcomes becomes equivalent at low energy to averaging over conformal boundary conditions weighted by their corresponding partition functions. Our results yield distinctive critical behavior across all cumulants in the regime where the unmeasured parts of the system are maximally separated. We also obtain the full distribution of the post-measurement entanglement entropy, finding that it is generically bimodal and exhibits fat-tails. We corroborate our analytical predictions by numerical calculations and find good agreement between them.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper examines frameworks and phenomenology of ultrarelativistic Higgs vacuum bubble collisions in a first-order phase transition associated with the Standard Model Higgs field in the early Universe. Such collisions act as a cosmic scale Higgs collider, providing access to energy scales far beyond any temperature reached in our cosmic history, potentially up to the Planck scale. This provides a unique opportunity to probe new physics that couples to the Higgs at very high scales, while also enabling novel applications for various cosmological phenomena, opening tremendous opportunities for particle physics and cosmology. As examples, we demonstrate the viability of nonthermal production of ultra-heavy Higgs portal dark matter up to $10^{16}$ GeV (with observable indirect and direct detection signals up to $m_\text{DM}=O(10)$ TeV), and leptogenesis from the production of GUT scale right-handed neutrinos.</description>

Abstract: We use total energy-momentum conservation and the Bianchi identity (magnetic-flux conservation) to construct second-order relativistic magnetohydrodynamics in a Zubarev's non-equilibrium statistical operator (NESO) framework. We obtain all dissipative tensors in the medium by focusing on a relativistic magnetized plasma that preserves parity and is symmetric to charge-conjugation. We also provide Kubo formulas for all transport coefficients that arise at second order. Moreover, we extend the NESO formalism to systematically take into account for nonlocal contributions.</description>

      <title>Quantum fields in a cold atomic simulator: relaxation and phase locking in tunnel-coupled 1D bosonic quasi-condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a prime example of simulating interacting relativistic QFT with cold atoms: the realisation of the sine-Gordon model by tunnel-coupled quasi-1D Bose gases. While experiments have shown that it can realise the sine-Gordon model in equilibrium, studies of non-equilibrium dynamics have revealed a phase-locking behaviour that stands in contrast to predictions from sine-Gordon field theory. Here, we examine a one-dimensional field-theoretic model of the system and find that the phase-locking behaviour can be understood in terms of the presence of the longitudinal harmonic trap, and that the additional degrees of freedom known to be present in the experiment do not appear to play a significant role. Therefore, the experimental setup provides a good simulator of the sine-Gordon quantum field theory, even out of equilibrium, if the inhomogeneous background induced by the trap is taken into account. Furthermore, our results support the idea that modifying the longitudinal trap to a box shape should result in agreement with standard sine-Gordon dynamics. The main remaining open issues are to account for 3D corrections and model the effect of the boundaries.</description>

      <title>Graviton Condensate Stars and Its Gravitational Echoes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct the exact stellar configurations that contain an ordinary perfect-fluid matter that interacts minimally with a condensate of gravitons with distinct pressure conditions on the surface. We propose vanishing transverse pressure on the surface for, namely graviton condensate type 1 and vanishing radial pressure on the surface for type 2. The condition for the radial pressure of type 1 requires the existence of a thin shell that will balance the pressure discontinuity while for type 2, the discontinuity on transverse pressure does not require the additional thin shell. It is found that the Buchdahl inequality of the resulting stellar configurations depends on the parameter related to the graviton condensate, such that we can find the ultra-compact regime of the stellar models. Moreover, the echo time and echo frequency within the ultra-compact regime are computed. At the same compactness, it is found that the presence of the graviton condensate will delay the gravitational echoes for type 2 and will expedite the gravitational echoes for type 1 compared to constant density star, $\tau_{echo2}&gt;\tau_{CDS}&gt;\tau_{echo1}$. Furthermore, the gravitational perturbation of a massless scalar wave is also investigated to support these results. These results could open more opportunities for the observational study of graviton in the near future, mostly from the compact astrophysical objects.</description>

      <title>Glueballs Confinement and Cosmological Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a unified framework in which the dynamics of a scalar glueball field, originating from phenomenological nonperturbative QCD confinement, simultaneously governs the deconfinement transition of strongly interacting matter and drives cosmological inflation. Starting from a temperature-dependent effective potential $V_{eff}(\phi, T)$, we show that the glueball mass vanishes at a critical temperature $T_{c\phi}$, signaling a first-order phase transition characterized by supercooling and a transient metastable vacuum. In the high-temperature regime $T &gt; T_{c\phi}$, the deconfined phase naturally produces an exponential expansion of the scale factor, providing the correct conditions for inflation. By computing the slow-roll parameters and the resulting spectral index $n_s$, tensor-to-scalar ratio $r_s$, and running $\alpha_s$, we confront the model with the Planck observations. The predicted values of $n_s$ and $r_s$ fall within the Planck confidence contours for a broad and physically motivated range of the parameter $\gamma$ and for $N \approx 50\text{--}60$ e-folds. A distinctive linear relation, $r_s = 4(1-n_s)-72\gamma$, emerges as a testable signature of the model. Normalization to the observed scalar amplitude further constrains the thermal correction parameter $\sigma^2$ and the coupling $\gamma$, linking cosmological data directly to QCD-scale dynamics. These results demonstrate that a confinement-inspired potential can naturally reproduce the observed inflationary phenomenology and offer a novel bridge between early-universe cosmology and the nonperturbative sector of QCD.</description>

Abstract: We propose a string field Hamiltonian formalism that associates a class of spectral curves and provides their quantization through the Chekhov-Eynard-Orantin topological recursion. As illustrative examples, we present Hamiltonians for the $(2,2m-1)$ minimal discrete and continuum dynamical triangulation (DT) models, the supersymmetric analogue of minimal continuum DT models, the Penner model, and 4D $\mathcal{N}=2$ $SU(2)$ gauge theories in the self-dual $\Omega$-background.</description>

      <title>Chiral gravitational waves from domain walls in Nieh-Yan gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the scattering of gravitational waves by axion domain walls in teleparallel gravity with the Nieh-Yan term. Since a domain wall causes the parity violation, the transmitted gravitational waves also exhibit the parity violation. We calculate the degree of circular polarization of gravitational waves. It turns out that gravitational waves after going through the domain wall could be chiral. Remarkably, the degree of circular polarization does not depend on the tension of the domain wall.</description>

      <title>An integrable hierarchy associated with loop extension of $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-graded $\mathfrak{osp}(1|2)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A hierarchy of $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-graded integrable equations is constructed using the loop extension of the $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-graded Lie superalgebra $\mathfrak{osp}(1|2)$. This hierarchy includes $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-graded extensions of the Liouville, sinh-Gordon, cosh-Gordon, and, in particular, the mKdV equations. The $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-graded KdV equation is also derived from the $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-mKdV equation via the Miura transformation. We present explicit formulas for the conserved charges of the $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-KdV and $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-mKdV equations. A distinctive feature of these $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-graded integrable systems is the existence of conserved charges with nontrivial grading.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum-gravitational effective actions with higher-derivative and non-local operators are expected to regularize the singularities of general relativity. Here we focus on quasi-local Einstein-Weyl gravity and obtain a classification of Frobenius solutions in static spherical symmetry. In contrast to local Einstein-Weyl gravity, and more generally quadratic gravity, we find that the quasi-local theory admits only regular solutions at the radial core. In addition, we find asymptotic $1/r^{6}$-corrections to the Schwarzschild geometry at large radial distances. Other solution classes around generic expansion points describe Schwarzschild-like and other types of horizons, as well as symmetric and non-symmetric wormhole throats.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss recent developments regarding the use of kernels in complex Langevin simulations. In particular, we outline how a kernel can be used to solve the problem of wrong convergence in a simple toy model. Since conventional correctness criteria for complex Langevin results are only necessary but not sufficient, the correct convergence of complex Langevin simulations is not always straightforward to assess. Hence, we furthermore discuss a condition for correctness that we have recently derived, which is both necessary and sufficient. Finally, we outline a machine-learning approach for finding suitable kernels in lattice gauge theories and present preliminary results of its application to the heavy-dense limit of QCD.</description>

Abstract: In this review, we summarize the main ideas of perturbative algebraic quantum field theory, which is a rigorous framework combining some of the Haag-Kastler axioms with perturbative methods involving formal power series. It allows for the construction of interacting QFT models in four spacetime dimensions and works on arbitrary globally hyperbolic manifolds. This approach has also led to the development of a non-perturbative construction of local nets of C*-algebras for interacting theories, which will also be discussed at the end of this review.</description>

      <title>On the Renormalization Group in EFTs: On-Shell Bases, Ambiguities, and Divergences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent results for two-loop renormalization group (RG) functions in effective field theories exhibit unphysical divergences when calculated in an on-shell operator basis. We demonstrate that this can be understood to be a result of omitting non-minimal source terms in the renormalized vacuum functional, which are essential to maintaining renormalizability of and describing the RG flow of Green's functions in an on-shell framework. With the inclusion of the missing source terms, any remaining divergences are ambiguous, generating only unphysical RG flow directed along flavor rotations, and the RG functions are RG-finite. We carefully examine the role of flavor rotations in generating ambiguities in both on- and off-shell RG functions and explore the geometry of a physical coupling space.</description>

      <title>Invisible gravitons and large-scale magnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The large-scale limits on the relic signals of gravitational radiation complement the bounds coming from the interferometric detectors (in the audio band) and from the pulsar timing arrays (in the nHz range). Within this inclusive perspective the spectral energy density of the gravitons is sharply suppressed in the aHz region even though the high frequency signal can be comparatively much larger both in the kHz and GHz domains. For there are no direct tests on the expansion rate prior to the formation of the light nuclei, a modified postinflationary timeline affects the total number of $e$-folds and additionally suppresses the tensor to scalar ratio by making the relic signals effectively invisible in the aHz range. The expansion rate prior to nucleosynthesis is further bounded by the evolution of the hypercharge field and the large-scale magnetism also constrains the decelerated expansion rate. The magnetogenesis requirements are compatible with a potentially detectable spectral energy density of the relic gravitons between the MHz and the THz while the tensor to scalar ratio remains suppressed in the aHz region. A maximum of the spectral energy density of the gravitons in the audio domain leads instead to a larger magnetic field when the scale of the gravitational collapse of the protogalaxy (of the order of the Mpc) gets comparable with the Hubble radius before equality. Along a converse viewpoint the results obtained here imply that a long decelerated stage expanding faster than radiation does not affect the high frequency range but reduces the effective number of $e$-folds by so enhancing the tensor to scalar ratio, possibly beyond its observational limit.</description>

Abstract: A recent study [Annals Phys. 455 (2023) 169394, e-Print: 2204.01901 [gr-qc]] examined the thermodynamic behavior of an axially symmetric black hole within a non-commutative framework that mimics the effect of an angular momentum. However, the analysis presents notable computational inconsistencies. In that analysis, the event horizon was miscalculated, and this error propagated through and compromised all subsequent results. In addition, an incorrect definition of surface gravity was used -- the spherically symmetric case was invoked for an axially symmetric spacetime -- rendering the thermodynamic results invalid. In other words, all the results presented in the paper require a thorough reexamination.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Waves from Confinement in $SU(N)$ Yang-Mills Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a detailed analysis of the gravitational wave spectrum of $SU(N)$ pure Yang-Mills theory. The confinement phase transition is described with an effective Polyakov loop model, using the latest lattice data as an input. In particular, recent lattice studies clarified the large-$N$ scaling of the surface tension, which we incorporate through a modification of the kinetic term. We demonstrate that the thin-wall approximation agrees with the Polyakov loop model at small $N$ while it breaks down at large $N$. Furthermore, we include reliable estimates of the bubble wall velocity using a recently developed framework based on a large enthalpy jump at the phase transition. Altogether, this allows us to derive the gravitational wave signals for all $SU(N)$ confinement phase transitions and clarifies the behaviour at large $N$. The strongest signal arises for $N=20$, but overall the predicted signals remain rather weak. Our work paves the way for future studies of other gauge groups and systems with fermions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive power counting formulas for ribbon graph amplitudes that were recently independently discovered in two contexts, namely as a generalization of the Kontsevich model, and as corresponding to a matrix model approach to the spectral action. The Feynman rules are based on divided difference functions of eigenvalues of an abstract Dirac operator. We obtain formulas for the order of divergence, depending on the spectral dimension $d$, the order of decay of the test function $f$ of the spectral action, and the graph properties. Several consequences are discussed, such as the fact that all graphs with maximal order of divergence (at a given loop order and number of external vertices) are planar. To derive our main results we establish two-sided bounds for divided differences, and in particular generalize Hunter's positivity theorem to a larger class of functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A set of 3+1 equations for stochastic inflation incorporating all metric and scalar matter degrees of freedom, first presented in previous work, are re-derived in a gauge invariant manner. We then present numerical implementations of these stochastic equations, cast in the BSSN formulation of Numerical Relativity, demonstrating their efficacy in both a slow-roll and an ultra slow-roll scenario. We find the evolution is correctly reproduced for all the dynamical variables, and the energy and momentum constraints are well-satisfied. This demonstrates that the stochastic equations are theoretically and numerically robust and ready to be applied to a wider inflationary landscape. Our simulations result in real space realizations of the fully non-linear stochastic dynamics with gradient information retained. As a generalisation of standard stochastic inflation, inflationary numerical relativity and lattice cosmology, this work opens up the possibility for reliable predictions of non-perturbative phenomena and provides precise initial conditions for subsequent cosmological eras.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Relativistic Tidal Response of Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the nonlinear tidal response of relativistic neutron stars by computing the fully relativistic, static, quadratic Love numbers. Using both the worldline effective field theory for extended gravitating bodies and second-order perturbations of relativistic stellar models, we derive the nonlinear tidal deformation induced by an external gravito-electric tidal field to quadratic order. Through a suitable matching procedure, we provide for the first time the leading nonlinear tidal corrections to the conservative dynamics and gravitational-wave signal of binary systems. Quadratic Love numbers are enhanced more than the linear ones in the small-compactness limit. Because of this, despite entering the gravitational-wave phase at 8th post-Newtonian (PN) order, the leading quadratic Love number can be as important as the next-to-next-to-leading order linear tidal correction, which enters at 7th PN order, and is larger than the subleading point-particle contribution entering at 4th PN order. In particular, quadratic Love numbers can be as large as ~10% of the linear Love numbers in the late inspiral phase. Our approach provides a framework to also compute the (subleading) nonlinear effects induced by magnetic tidal fields and higher multipole moments, and sets the foundations for incorporating nonlinear tidal effects in high-precision gravitational-wave modeling.</description>

      <title>Quasitopological gravity and double-copy formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new approach to the quasitopological theory of gravity based on a modified classical double--copy construction. Focusing on static, spherically symmetric configurations, we show that all vacuum solutions of $D$--dimensional quasitopological gravity can be obtained from an auxiliary non--linear electrodynamics defined in a flat $(D+1)$--dimensional spacetime. The gravitational field equations reduce to an algebraic relation between a primary curvature invariant and the electric field strength, while the remaining dynamics is governed by a Gauss--law constraint for a point--like charge in the auxiliary space. This correspondence provides a transparent interpretation of higher--curvature gravitational interactions in terms of non--linear gauge dynamics and explains the absence of higher--derivative terms in the reduced equations. As illustrative examples, we apply the formalism to Born--Infeld and Hayward--type models, obtaining higher--dimensional regular black--hole solutions with a de~Sitter--like core. Our results extend the scope of the double--copy paradigm beyond Einstein gravity and suggest a unifying framework for a broad class of higher--curvature theories.</description>

      <title>Cherenkov radiation in isotropic chiral matter: unlocking threshold-free emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate Cherenkov radiation in isotropic chiral matter using Carroll-Field-Jackiw electrodynamics, with an axion angle linear in time, to describe a charge moving at constant velocity. By solving the modified Maxwell's equations in cylindrical coordinates and in the space-frequency domain, we derive closed expressions for the circularly polarized electromagnetic fields contributing independently to the radiation. The dispersion relations are obtained by imposing causality at a cylindrical surface at infinity, ensuring outgoing waves. Contrary to initial suppositions, each spectral energy distribution is gauge-invariant and positive, describing radiation at a characteristic angle. We characterize the angles and identify frequency ranges that allow for zero, one, or two Cherenkov cones. Notably, one sector of the model enables threshold-free Cherenkov radiation from slowly moving charges. Our results agree with partial findings in the nonrelativistic limit of earlier iterative analysis and clarify the regimes in which Cherenkov radiation arises in isotropic chiral matter.</description>

Abstract: In this letter, we derive the singular condition for black holes and demonstrate the potential resolution of the Schwarzschild black hole singularity in general relativity using non-perturbative $\alpha^{\prime}$ corrections of string theory. This work is motivated by the Belinskii, Khalatnikov and Lifshitz (BKL) proposal, which suggests that the structure of the black hole interior in vacuum Einstein's equations can be transformed into the Kasner universe near the singularity. This transformation allows for the description of the black hole interior using the $O\left(d,d\right)$ invariant anisotropic Hohm-Zwiebach action, which includes all orders of $\alpha^{\prime}$ corrections.</description>

      <title>Complexity Growth and the Krylov-Wigner function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13694v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For any state in a $D$-dimensional Hilbert space with a choice of basis, one can define a discrete version of the Wigner function -- a quasi-probability distribution which represents the state on a discrete phase space. The Wigner function can, in general, take on negative values, and the amount of negativity in the Wigner function has an operational meaning as a resource for quantum computation. In this note, we study the growth of Wigner negativity for a generic initial state under time evolution with chaotic Hamiltonians. We introduce the Krylov-Wigner function, i.e., the Wigner function defined with respect to the Krylov basis (with appropriate phases), and show that this choice of basis minimizes the early time growth of Wigner negativity in the large $D$ limit. We take this as evidence that the Krylov basis (with appropriate phases) is ideally suited for a dual, semi-classical description of chaotic quantum dynamics at large $D$. We also numerically study the time evolution of the Krylov-Wigner function and its negativity in random matrix theory for an initial pure state. We observe that the negativity rises gradually for a time of $O(D)$ and then saturates close to its upper bound of $\sqrt{D}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20855v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum photon effects in vacuum provide an interesting setting to test quantum electrodynamics, serving as a source for predictions about physics beyond the Standard Model. In this paper, we investigate these effects by calculating the one-loop Euler-Heisenberg-like effective action within a Lorentz-violating scalar quantum electrodynamics framework. In both CPT-even and CPT-odd scenarios, we obtain the exact result in all orders of the stress tensor $F_{\mu\nu}$ and evaluate explicitly the lower orders of this effective action. We identify the quantum effects coming from Lorentz violation in an explicitly gauge invariant way. Nonlinear Lorentz-violating contributions that may affect photon-photon scattering are explicitly evaluated.</description>

      <title>Confining Strings and the Worldsheet Axion from the Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03435v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a major update on the spectrum of closed flux tubes in $D=3+1$ $SU(N)$ gauge theories. We measure the excitation spectrum of confining strings wound around a spatial dimension of a size $R$. We do so for the $SU(N)$ Yang-Mills theory with $N=3,5,6$ and for two different values of the lattice spacing. We employ the generalized eigenvalue problem in combination with an extended basis of operators; this enables us to project onto all possible irreducible representations characterised by spin $|J_{\rm modulo \ 4}|$, transverse parity $P_{\perp}$, longitudinal parity $P_{\parallel}$ as well as by longitudinal momentum $p_{\parallel}=\frac{2 \pi q}{R}$, and extract accurate results for approximately $35$ lightest states. Applying the Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz (TBA) technique for calculating the finite volume spectrum, we confirm that the observed states are well described by the low energy effective theory of a long string consisting of two translational Goldstone bosons (``phonons"), along with a massive pseudoscalar (``the worldsheet axion") coupled to phonons through a $\theta$-term. Moreover, we find that the leading axion-axion and axion-phonon interactions are well approximated by the $T\bar{T}$ deformation of a free axion.</description>

      <title>Mass gap in non-perturbative quadratic $\mathcal{R}^2$ gravity via Dyson-Schwinger</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16445v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We apply in a simple model derived from quadratic $\mathcal{R}^2$ gravity the technique of Dyson-Schwinger equations to solve for its corresponding quantum theory. Particularly, we solve the classical equations of motion to get a solution to the hierarchy of Dyson-Schwinger equations in the limit of large Ricci scalar, assumed to be constant and larger than the square of the Starobinsky mass. Moving to the Einstein frame, the model admits Higgs-like solutions with a single particle having a finite mass. We quantize the scalar field showing the appearing of a mass gap through a Higgs-like solution. The presence of the mass gap, that increases with the square root of the Ricci scalar, shows how the effect of the scalar sector at low-energy becomes ineffective, making it relevant only at short distances.</description>

      <title>Probing Quantum Curves and Transitions in 5d SQFTs via Defects and Blowup Equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15591v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate codimension-2 defect partition functions and quantum Seiberg-Witten curves in 5d rank-1 supersymmetric QFTs, including non-Lagrangian and Kaluza-Klein theories. Using generalized blowup equations, we compute defect partition functions in the $\Omega$-background and show that, in the Nekrasov-Shatashvili limit, they satisfy certain difference equations that encode the quantization of classical Seiberg-Witten curves. Furthermore, we explore novel transitions in the defect partition functions and their relation to coordinate transformations of quantum Seiberg-Witten curves, with a focus on SL(2,$\mathbb{Z}$) transformations and Hanany-Witten transitions. These findings provide new insights into the interplay between codimension-2 defects, quantum curves, and the geometric structure of 5d supersymmetric QFTs.</description>

      <title>Quantum Signatures of Chaos from Free Probability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20338v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A classical dynamical system can be viewed as a probability space equipped with a measure-preserving time evolution map, admitting a purely algebraic formulation in terms of the algebra of bounded functions on the phase space. Similarly, a quantum dynamical system can be formulated using an algebra of bounded operators in a non-commutative probability space equipped with a time evolution map. Chaos, in either setting, can be characterized by statistical independence between observables at $ t = 0 $ and $ t \to \infty $, leading to the vanishing of cumulants involving these observables. In the quantum case, the notion of independence is replaced by free independence, which only emerges in the thermodynamic limit (asymptotic freeness). In this work, we propose a definition of quantum chaos based on asymptotic freeness and investigate its emergence in quantum many-body systems including the mixed-field Ising model with a random magnetic field, a higher spin version of the same model, and the SYK model. The hallmark of asymptotic freeness is the emergence of the free convolution prediction for the spectrum of operators of the form $ A(0) + B(t) $, implying the vanishing of all free cumulants between $A(0)$ and $B(t)$ in the thermodynamic limit for an infinite-temperature thermal state. We systematically investigate the spectral properties of $ A(0) + B(t) $ in the above-mentioned models, show that fluctuations on top of the free convolution prediction follow universal Wigner-Dyson statistics, and discuss the connection with quantum chaos. Finally, we argue that free probability theory provides a rigorous framework for understanding quantum chaos, offering a unifying perspective that connects many different manifestations of it.</description>

      <title>Universal Box Operator: $\mathbf{O}(D,D)$-Symmetry and $\alpha^{\prime}$-Corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21143v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a fully covariant,$\mathbf{O}(D,D)$-symmetric d'Alembertian -- or box operator -- that acts on tensor fields of arbitrary rank and provides a universal kinetic term for all bosonic closed-string states. In its Riemannian parametrization, the operator packages the Riemann curvature, $H$-flux, and dilaton gradient into a single duality-covariant object. This yields $\mathbf{O}(D,D)$-symmetric gravitational-wave equations for the massless sector, governs the tachyon and all massive modes, and clarifies how higher excitations contribute to $\alpha^{\prime}$-corrections. The box operator thus supplies a unified description of closed-string dynamics across the entire spectrum. Our analysis shows that any apparent breaking of $\mathbf{O}(D,D)$ symmetry arises only after integrating out massive modes in a Wilsonian sense, where loop momentum integrals obscure half of the doubled momenta. We stand on the view that $\mathbf{O}(D,D)$ symmetry and doubled diffeomorphisms remain exact and undeformed at the fundamental level of string theory.</description>

Abstract: Krylov complexity has emerged as an important tool in the description of quantum information and, in particular, quantum chaos. Here we formulate Krylov complexity $K(t)$ for quantum mechanical systems as a path integral, and argue that at large times, for classical chaotic systems with at least two minima of the potential, that have a plateau for $K(t)$, the value of the plateau is described by quantum mechanical instantons, as is the case for standard transition amplitudes. We explain and test these ideas in a simple toy model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06465v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the renormalized stress-energy tensor for a massless quantum scalar field in the background of the horizonless Bardeen spacetime. Within the weak-field approximation, we show that the vacuum fluctuations differ significantly between conformally and nonconformally coupled fields, both in magnitude and in their behavior at short and intermediate distances. At large distances, we recover the universal asymptotic behavior previously observed in black hole and Newtonian star backgrounds. Going beyond the weak-field regime, we find that, for certain parameter ranges, the modes of the field can develop imaginary frequencies, leading to instabilities and an exponential growth of vacuum fluctuations. We also discuss critically the applicability of the anomaly-induced effective action for computing the renormalized stress-energy tensor in the conformally coupled case.</description>

      <title>Structure of renormalization constants for theories with multiple couplings in the MS-like subtraction schemes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03437v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For theories with multiple couplings we construct simple expressions for the four-dimensional (or, in general, integer-dimensional) renormalization constants assuming that all divergences are logarithmical. These expressions allow relating all coefficients at $\varepsilon$-poles, logarithms, and (if exist) mixed terms to the coefficients of the renormalization group functions in any order of the perturbation theory for MS-like renormalization prescriptions. The result admits such a formulation in that $\varepsilon$-poles and $\ln\Lambda/\mu$ enter on the same footing. For theories with two and three couplings we present explicit expressions for the pole/logarithm structure of renormalization constants in the lowest orders of the perturbation theory. They are verified by comparisons with the two-loop explicit calculation for ${\cal N}=1$ SQCD+SQED and also with the previously known three-loop calculations for the $\varphi^4$-theory with two couplings.</description>

Abstract: We identify what has been referred to as 'cut-off CFT' in holographic braneworld with $T^2$ or $T\bar T$ theory (depending on the dimension of the bulk), so that the holographic dual of AdS-gravity with Neumann boundary conditions is a $T^2$-deformed CFT that is set free. After making statements that apply for general dimensions higher than three, we focus on the case of a three-dimensional bulk. We find from bulk arguments that the effective theory on the brane is governed by a $T\bar T$-like flow equation, such that under certain assumptions the effective gravity theory on the brane is given by a $T\bar T$-like deformed timelike Liouville theory, which limits to the description of the holographic Weyl anomaly for branes that approach the asymptotic boundary.</description>

Abstract: In this letter, we study grand-canonical symmetric orbifolds of conformal field theories. We propose to define them as the direct sum of symmetric orbifolds of all degrees. The natural basis of operators is one that mixes all sectors. We describe this basis in terms of partial permutations, and explain how to define and calculate the operator product expansion in that framework. Our construction provides a conformal field theory interpretation of the central charge operator $\mathcal{I}$ in $AdS_3$ string theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.16586v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new action for entanglement entropy in the framework of the AdS$_{3}$/CFT$_{2}$ correspondence. This action is constructed directly from the entanglement entropy of the CFT$_{2}$, and we show that the Einstein equations of AdS$_{3}$ gravity can be derived from it. In the near-coincidence limit, using Riemann normal coordinates, the action reduces to a string worldsheet action in a curved background that naturally includes the symmetric spacetime metric, an antisymmetric Kalb-Ramond field, and a dilaton. The Kalb-Ramond field gives rise to a string charge density, from which we demonstrate that bit threads can be exactly reproduced. This correspondence provides a clear physical interpretation of bit threads. Exploiting this correspondence, we establish explicit relations between the emergent string worldsheet and the Ryu-Takayanagi (RT) surface, providing new insights into entanglement entropy. In particular, entanglement entropy can be computed from open string charge, while Bekenstein-Hawking entropy arises from closed string charge through open-closed string duality. These results suggest a unified picture in which the Susskind-Uglum conjecture, open-closed string duality, and the ER=EPR proposal emerge as equivalent manifestations of the same underlying principle. Finally, we propose a quantization of the RT surface, pointing to a possible connection with loop quantum gravity that refines Wall's conjecture.</description>

      <title>Generalisations of the Russo-Townsend formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20051v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As a generalisation of the recent construction by Russo and Townsend, we propose a new approach to generate $\mathsf{U}(1)$ duality-invariant models for nonlinear electrodynamics. It is based on the use of two building blocks: (i) a fixed (but otherwise arbitrary) model for self-dual nonlinear electrodynamics with Lagrangian $L(F_{\mu\nu};g)$ depending on a duality-invariant parameter $g$; and (ii) an arbitrary potential $W(\psi)$, with $\psi$ an auxiliary scalar field. It turns out that the model $\mathfrak{L}(F_{\mu\nu};\psi) = L(F_{\mu\nu};\psi) + W(\psi)$ leads to a self-dual theory for nonlinear electrodynamics upon elimination of $\psi$. As an illustration, we work out an example in which the seed Lagrangian $L(F_{\mu\nu};g)$ corresponds to the Born-Infeld model and a particular potential $W(\psi)$ is chosen such that integrating $\psi$ out gives the ModMaxBorn theory. We also briefly discuss supersymmetric generalisations of the proposed formulation.</description>

      <title>A 12d Origin of the Type IIB String Theory: A Review</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.10746v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We review several lines of evidence for a 12d interpretation of the type IIB brane solutions and effective actions. The axio-dilaton sector fits naturally into 12d gravity, as supported by brane geometries and supersymmetry. The special role of the D3 brane in a potential 12d interpretation of type IIB is reviewed, with emphasis on the connection between its SL(2, Z) self-duality and worldvolume electromagnetic duality. Whether the higher-derivative corrections of type IIB admit a 12d interpretation is discussed, and we suggest certain directions for future exploration.</description>

      <title>Universal Supercritical Behavior in Global Monopole-Charged AdS Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12723v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analytically investigate the Widom line and universal supercritical crossover for charged AdS black holes threaded by a global monopole. We compute thermodynamic variables in both the extended and canonical ensembles. We derive the scaled variance $\Omega$ using the Gibbs free energy and locate the Widom line as the extrema of this. Using mean-field expansion of the equation of state near criticality, we obtain closed-form expressions for the Widom line and the two branching crossover lines $L^\pm$. We show that the monopole parameter shifts the critical parameters but does not change the mean-field universal scaling: the leading linear term and the nonanalytic correction remain universal in both ensembles. We also verify this with numerical computation and show the Widom line and the two branching crossover lines $L^\pm$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19332v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the great interest in studying quantum and gravitational phenomena in a unified way, scalar bosons are considered in a cosmic string spacetime and in a non-inertial frame, with a generalized Coulomb-type interaction containing both inverse quadratic and inverse cubic corrections. Solutions for this generalized interaction are shown for an arbitrary state in the slow rotation limit in a quasi-exact manner and a discussion is given of the structure of the problem, whose special case appears in the form of a doubly confluent Heun differential equation. The previously known solution for the simplest case of this problem, corresponding to the ordinary Coulomb interaction, is recovered.</description>

      <title>Probing Entanglement Dynamics in the SYK Model using Quantum Computers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18580v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum computers are expected to be vital for exploring complex dynamics in many-body quantum systems. Thus, validating established results on current quantum computers is essential for evaluating their future utility. Hence, we investigate the entanglement entropy of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, a paradigmatic model of quantum chaos, many-body physics, and holographic duality, in current IBM's superconducting quantum computers. We implement optimized swap-based many-body interference protocol and randomized measurement protocol tailored for IBM quantum computers' limited qubit connectivity. Additionally, we employ quantum multi-programming that parallelizes circuit execution to improve the results obtained by the randomized measurement protocol. Finally, by incorporating the quantum error mitigation techniques into our implementation of the entropy measurement protocols on IBM quantum hardware, we show that the current noisy quantum computer can yield results aligned with theoretical expectations, therefore affirming its capability to explore chaotic quantum dynamics in complex quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Similarity in Higher-Order Classical Symplectic Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00498v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many theories of physical interest, which admit a Hamiltonian description, exhibit symmetries under a particular class of non - strictly canonical transformation, known as dynamical similarities. The presence of such symmetries allows a reduction process to be carried out, eliminating a single degree of freedom from the system, which we associate with an overall scale. This process of `contact reduction' leads to theories of a frictional nature, in which the physically-observable quantities form an autonomous subsystem, that evolves in a predictable manner. We demonstrate that this procedure has a natural generalisation to theories of higher order; detailed examples are provided, and physical implications discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14878v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We apply non-invertible selection rules coming from a fusion algebra to radiative neutrino mass models where fields are labeled by the elements in the algebra. Since non-invertible selection rules only hold at tree level, radiative corrections naturally explain the origin of tiny neutrino masses. Furthermore, a remnant symmetry of the fusion algebra protects the stability of dark matter, which is conventionally imposed in radiative neutrino models. We also find that interesting neutrino mass textures are realized by assigning fields to family-dependent elements in the algebra.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.24822v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a complete Lagrangian describing axion interactions with pseudoscalar and (axial-)vector mesons within the three light-flavor quark framework. This formulation incorporates both the standard chiral Lagrangian and the full Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) term. By including instanton effects associated with the anomalous $U(1)_A$ symmetry, we demonstrate that physical observables remain invariant under arbitrary chiral phase rotations of the quark fields. This comprehensive Lagrangian provides a robust and consistent framework for exploring axion phenomenology through its interactions with mesons and gauge bosons. As a demonstration, we compute the decay widths of GeV-scale axions into various mesonic final states for several benchmark axion models.</description>

      <title>Emergent Viscous Hydrodynamics From a Single Quantum Particle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06618v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate an explicit example of how spatial decoherence can lead to hydrodynamic behavior in the late-time, long-wavelength regime of open quantum systems. We focus on the case of a single non-relativistic quantum particle linearly coupled to a thermal bath of noninteracting harmonic oscillators at temperature $T$, a la Caldeira and Leggett. Taking advantage of decoherence in the position representation, we expand the reduced density matrix in powers of the off-diagonal spatial components, so that high-order terms are suppressed at late times. Truncating the resulting power series at second order leads to a set of dissipative transient hydrodynamic equations similar to the non-relativistic limit of equations widely used in simulations of the quark-gluon plasma formed in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions. Transport coefficients are directly determined by the damping constant $\gamma$, which quantifies the influence of the environment. The asymptotic limit of our hydrodynamic equations reduces to the celebrated Navier-Stokes equations for a compressible fluid in the presence of a drag force. Our results shed new light on the onset of hydrodynamic behavior in open quantum systems where a system with few degrees of freedom is coupled to a large thermal environment.</description>

      <title>Precision gravity constraints on large dark sectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02801v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: General relativity, treated as a low energy effective field theory, predicts quantum corrections to Newtons law of gravitation arising from loops of matter and graviton fields. While these corrections are negligible for the Standard Model particle content, the situation changes dramatically in the presence of a hidden or dark sector containing a very large number of light degrees of freedom. In such cases, loop induced modifications to the Newtonian potential can accumulate to levels testable in laboratory and astrophysical probes of gravity at short distances. In this work we systematically derive and constrain the impact of large dark sectors on precision tests of Newtons law, translating effective field theory predictions into the experimental language of Yukawa type deviations and inverse square law deformations. By mapping precision fifth force constraints onto bounds on species multiplicities and masses, we show that current and forthcoming experiments already impose nontrivial constraints on the size and structure of hidden sectors coupled only gravitationally. For truly massless hidden states, present data still permit multiplicities as large as 1e61, with modest spin dependence; for finite masses the constraints reduce to the familiar short range Yukawa parameterization. Our results provide a model independent framework for confronting dark sector scenarios with precision gravity data and clarify how non minimal scalar couplings, potential higher derivative poles at large species number, and Kaluza Klein towers fit within this picture. The approach is complementary to cosmological probes: Big Bang Nucleosynthesis and the Cosmic Microwave Background constrain relic abundances under specified production histories, whereas laboratory tests constrain the spectrum of light states irrespective of their cosmological population.</description>

Abstract: With regard to the observed dark matter density profile in galaxies and clusters, the scalar dark matter scenario has been previously studied for potential detectability through gravitational wave observations at measurable signal-to-noise ratios. In the present study, we consider the case of dark matter described by a massive vector field, also referred to as the Proca field. The density profile in the vicinity of the black hole is explicitly constructed for a broad range of dark matter mass, $\mu\sim 10^{-10}-10^{-15}{\mathrm eV}$, which allows it to exhibit both particle and wave-like characteristics. While in the particle regime, the computation of the DM density distribution is analytically tractable, we find it convenient to compute the same numerically in the wave regime. Nevertheless, in the outer region, the surrounding dark matter is assumed to follow a broken power-law distribution, represented by a Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile with a central spike. For the purpose of investigating the detectability of the vector dark matter in the gravitational wave spectrum, we have modelled a stellar-mass black hole ($1M_{\odot}$) inspiralling into a Schwarzschild black hole of mass $10^4M_{\odot}$ within such a vector dark matter environment. With this setup, we analyzed the dephasing in the gravitational wave strain induced by vector dark matter and performed a Fisher forecast for upcoming LISA observations, with particular emphasis on the distinctive features in both the particle and wave regimes of the dark matter. Additionally, most of the important results have been compared with the scalar dark matter case.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Decoherence from Imaginary-Order Spectral Deformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09236v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A mechanism of spontaneous decoherence is examined in which the generator of quantum dynamics is replaced by the imaginary-order (which is fundamentally different from real-order fractional calculus) spectral deformation $H^{1+i\beta}$ for a positive self-adjoint Hamiltonian $H$. The deformation modifies dynamical phases through the factor $E^{i\beta}=e^{i\beta\log E}$, whose rapid oscillation suppresses interference between distinct energies. A non-stationary-phase analysis yields quantitative estimates: oscillatory contributions to amplitudes or decoherence functionals decay at least as $\mathcal{O}(1/|\beta|)$. The kinematical structure of quantum mechanics -- the Hilbert-space inner product, projection operators, and the Born rule -- remains unchanged; the modification is entirely dynamical and acts only through spectral phases.
  Physical motivations for the deformation arise from clock imperfections, renormalization-group and effective-action corrections that introduce logarithmic spectral terms, and semiclassical gravity analyses in which complex actions produce spectral factors of the form $E^{i\beta}$. The mechanism is illustrated in examples relevant to quantum-gravity-inspired quantum mechanics.
  A detailed related-work analysis contrasts the present mechanism with Milburn-type intrinsic decoherence, Di\'osi-Penrose gravitational collapse, GRW/CSL models, clock-induced decoherence, and energy-conserving collapse models, as well as environmental frameworks such as Lindblad master equations, Caldeira-Leggett baths, and non-Hermitian Hamiltonian deformations. This positions $H^{1+i\beta}$ dynamics as a compact, testable, and genuinely novel phenomenological encapsulation of logarithmic spectral corrections arising in quantum-gravity-motivated effective theories, while remaining fully compatible with standard quantum kinematics.</description>

Abstract: We numerically investigate particle production by a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson (pNGB) in spontaneous baryogenesis, focusing on large initial misalignment angles. Our analysis confirms the established cubic dependence of the baryon asymmetry on the initial phase for small angles. However, this scaling breaks down for larger angles, with particle production saturating as the initial phase approaches ${\pi}$ in Minkowski spacetime.</description>
