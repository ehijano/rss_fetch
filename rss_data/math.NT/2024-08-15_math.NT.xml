      <title>The Iwasawa $\mu$-invariants of Elliptic Curves over $\mathbb{Q}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we discuss a longstanding conjecture of Greenberg in the Iwasawa theory of elliptic curves. Greenberg's conjecture states that if $E/\mathbb{Q}$ is an elliptic curve with good ordinary reduction at $p$, and $E[p]$ is irreducible as a Galois module, then the Selmer group of $E$ over the cyclotomic $\mathbb{Z}_p$ extension of $\mathbb{Q}$ has $\mu$-invariant zero. We prove that if $E$ is an elliptic curve over $\mathbb{Q}$, then we have $\mu=0$ for all but finitely many primes $p$ of good ordinary reduction.</description>

      <title>On the adelic Gaussian hypergeometric function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define the adelic hypergeometric function of special Gaussian type by means of a tower of hypergeometric curves. This function takes values in an adelic completed group ring and interpolates all the hypergeometric functions of the same type over all finite fields. It specializes at the unit argument to the adelic beta function of Ihara and Anderson. We prove some transformation formulas and a summation formula for the adelic hypergeometric function, which are known classically for complex hypergeometric functions.</description>

      <title>Ranks of Matrices of Logarithms of Algebraic Numbers II: The Matrix Coefficient Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many questions in number theory concern the nonvanishing of determinants of square matrices of logarithms (complex or p-adic) of algebraic numbers. We present a new conjecture that states that if such a matrix has vanishing determinant, then after a rational change of basis on the left and right, it can be made to have a vanishing coefficient.</description>

      <title>Algorithms for determination of t-module structures on some extension groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In \cite{kk04} the second and third author extended the methods of \cite{pr} and determined the \tm module structure on $\Ext^1(\Phi,\Psi )$ where $\Phi $ and $\Psi$ were Anderson \tm modules over $A={\mathbf F}_q[t]$ of some specific types. This approach involved the concept of biderivation and certain reduction algorithm. In this paper we generalize the results of \cite{pr} and \cite{kk04} and present complete algorithm for computation of \tm module structure on $\Ext^1(\Phi,\Psi )$ for \tm modules $\Phi $ and $\Psi$ such that $\rk \Phi &gt; \rk \Psi.$ The last condition is not sufficient for our algorithm to be executable. We show that it can be applied when the matrix at the biggest power of $\tau$ in $\Phi_t$ is invertible. We also introduce a notion of ${\tau}$-composition series which we find suitable for the additive category of \tm modules and show that under certain assumptions on the composition series of $\Phi $ and $\Psi$ our algorithm is also executable.</description>

      <title>Moments of random multiplicative functions over function fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Granville-Soundararajan, Harper-Nikeghbali-Radziwill, and Heap-Lindqvist independently established an asymptotic for the even natural moments of partial sums of random multiplicative functions defined over integers. Building on these works, we study the even natural moments of partial sums of Steinhaus random multiplicative functions defined over function fields. Using a combination of analytic arguments and combinatorial arguments, we obtain asymptotic expressions for all the even natural moments in the large field limit and large degree limit, as well as an exact expression for the fourth moment.</description>

      <title>Structure of Hecke algebras arising from types</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ denote a connected reductive group over a nonarchimedean local field $F$ of residue characteristic $p$, and let $\mathcal{C}$ denote an algebraically closed field of characteristic $\ell \neq p$. If $\rho$ is an irreducible, smooth $\mathcal{C}$-representation of a compact, open subgroup $K$ of $G(F)$, then the pair $(K,\rho)$ gives rise to a Hecke algebra $\mathcal{H}(G(F),(K, \rho))$. For a large class of pairs $(K,\rho)$, we show that $\mathcal{H}(G(F),(K, \rho))$ is a semi-direct product of an affine Hecke algebra with explicit parameters with a twisted group algebra, and that it is isomorphic to $\mathcal{H}(G^0(F),(K^0, \rho^0))$ for some reductive subgroup $G^0 \subset G$ with compact, open subgroup $K^0$ and depth-zero representation $\rho^0$ of $K^0$.
  The class of pairs that we consider includes all depth-zero types. In describing their Hecke algebras, we thus recover a result of Morris as a special case. In a second paper, we will show that our class also contains all the types constructed by Kim and Yu, and hence we obtain as a corollary that arbitrary Bernstein blocks are equivalent to depth-zero Bernstein blocks under minor tameness assumptions.
  The pairs to which our results apply are described in an axiomatic way so that the results can be applied to other constructions of types by only verifying that the relevant axioms are satisfied. The Hecke algebra isomorphisms are given in an explicit manner and are support preserving.</description>

      <title>Reduction to depth zero for tame p-adic groups via Hecke algebra isomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $F$ be a nonarchimedean local field of residual characteristic $p$. Let $G$ denote a connected reductive group over $F$ that splits over a tamely ramified extension of $F$. Let $(K ,\rho)$ be a type as constructed by Kim and Yu. We show that there exists a twisted Levi subgroup $G^0 \subset G$ and a type $(K^0, \rho^0)$ for $G^0$ such that the corresponding Hecke algebras $\mathcal{H}(G(F), (K, \rho))$ and $\mathcal{H}(G^0(F), (K^0, \rho^0))$ are isomorphic. If $p$ does not divide the order of the absolute Weyl group of $G$, then every Bernstein block is equivalent to modules over such a Hecke algebra. Hence, under this assumption on $p$, our result implies that every Bernstein block is equivalent to a depth-zero Bernstein block. This allows one to reduce many problems about (the category of) smooth, complex representations of $p$-adic groups to analogous problems about (the category of) depth-zero representations.
  Our isomorphism of Hecke algebras is very explicit and also includes an explicit description of the Hecke algebras as semi-direct products of an affine Hecke with a twisted group algebra. Moreover, we work with arbitrary algebraically closed fields of characteristic different from $p$ as our coefficient field.
  This paper relies on a prior axiomatic result about the structure of Hecke algebras by the same authors and a key ingredient consists of extending the quadratic character of Fintzen--Kaletha--Spice to the support of the Hecke algebra, which might be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Chern-Simons theories with defects, Rogers-Ramanujan type functions and eta-products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the line defect half-indices of 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric Chern-Simons (CS) theories with (special)unitary, symplectic, orthogonal and exceptional gauge groups. We find that they have several beautiful infinite product $q$-series expressions in terms of Ramanujan's general theta function. For the theories with fundamental chiral multiplets, the pairs of the Neumann half-indices and one-point functions of the fundamental Wilson lines form a basis for the line defect indices in terms of the Rogers-Ramanujan type functions. Furthermore, the theories with an adjoint chiral admit the expressions as the eta-products. In particular, for the $SU(N)_{-2N}$ CS theory, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the BPS boundary local operators and the $N$-core partitions.</description>

      <title>The geometric fundamental group of the affine line over a finite field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The affine line and the punctured affine line over a finite field F are taken as benchmarks for the problem of describing geometric \'etale fundamental groups. To this end, using a reformulation of Tannaka duality we construct for a projective variety X a (non-commutative) universal affine pro-algebraic group Lu(X), such that for any given affine subvariety U of X any finite and \'etale Galois covering of U over F is a pull-back of a Galois covering of a quotient Lu(X,U) of Lu(X). Then the geometric fundamental group of U is a completion of the k-points of Lu(X,U), where k is an algebraic closure of F. We obtain explicit descriptions of the universal affine groups Lu(X,U) for U the affine line and the punctured affine line over F.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.01759v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study arithmetic dynamical questions for formal groups and $p$-adic dynamical systems in higher dimensions, and thus we generalize some earlier results that appeared in the literature. We identify a certain class of higher-dimensional formal groups over the ring of $p$-adic integers such that any two formal groups in that class coincide if they share infinitely many torsion points. We also prove that if $\mathcal{D}_1$ and $\mathcal{D}_2$ are $d$-dimensional stable $p$-adic dynamical systems with infinitely many preperiodic points in common, then $\mathcal{D}_1$ and $\mathcal{D}_2$ coincide. As a useful application, we provide a sufficient condition for two abelian varieties to be isogenous just by looking at their $p$-power torsion points.</description>

Abstract: Let $Y\to X$ be an unramified Galois cover of curves over a perfect field $k$ of characteristic $p&gt;0$ with $\mathrm{Gal}(Y/X)\cong\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$, and let $J_X$ and $J_Y$ be the Jacobians of $X$ and $Y$ respectively. We consider the $p$-torsion subgroup schemes $J_X[p]$ and $J_Y[p]$, analyze the Galois-module structure of $J_Y[p]$, and find restrictions this structure imposes on $J_Y[p]$ (for example, as manifested in its Ekedahl--Oort type) taking $J_X[p]$ as given.</description>

      <title>The Average Size of 2-Selmer Groups of Elliptic Curves in Characteristic 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08493v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $K$ be the function field of a smooth curve $B$ over a finite field $k$ of arbitrary characteristic. We prove that the average size of the $2$-Selmer groups of elliptic curves $E/K$ is at most $1+2\zeta_B(2)\zeta_B(10)$, where $\zeta_B$ is the zeta function of the curve $B$. In particular, in the limit as $q=\#k\to\infty$ (with the genus $g(B)$ fixed), we see that the average size of 2-Selmer is bounded above by $3$, even in "bad" characteristics. This completes the proof that the average rank of elliptic curves, over $\textit{any}$ fixed global field, is finite. Handling the case of characteristic $2$ requires us to develop a new theory of integral models of 2-Selmer elements, dubbed "hyper-Weierstrass curves."</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05820v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sequences of the form $(\gcd(u_n,v_n))_{n \in \mathbb N}$, with $(u_n)_n$, $(v_n)_n$ sums of $S$-units, have been considered by several authors. The study of $\gcd(n,u_n)$ corresponds, following Silverman, to divisibility sequences arising from the split algebraic group $\mathbb G_{\mathrm{a}} \times \mathbb G_{\mathrm{m}}$; in this case, Sanna determined all asymptotic moments of the arithmetic function $\log\,\gcd (n,u_n)$ when $(u_n)_n$ is a Lucas sequence. Here, we characterize the asymptotic behavior of the moments themselves $\sum_{n \leq x}\,\gcd(n,u_n)^\lambda$, thus solving the moment problem for $\mathbb G_{\mathrm{a}} \times \mathbb G_{\mathrm{m}}$. We give both unconditional and conditional results, the latter only relying on standard conjectures in analytic number theory.</description>

      <title>On tame ramification and centers of $F$-purity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.02660v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a notion of tame ramification for general finite covers. When specialized to the separable case, it extends to higher dimensions the classical notion of tame ramification for Dedekind domains and curves and sits nicely in between other notions of tame ramification in arithmetic geometry. However, when applied to the Frobenius map, it naturally yields the notion of center of $F$-purity (aka compatibly $F$-split subvariety). As an application, we describe the behavior of centers of $F$-purity under finite covers -- it all comes down to a transitivity property for tame ramification in towers.</description>

      <title>On the distance problem over finite p-adic rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07325v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the distance problem in the setting of finite p-adic rings. In odd dimensions, our results are essentially sharp. In even dimensions, we clarify the conjecture and provide examples to support it. Surprisingly, compared to the finite field case, in this setting, we are able to provide a large family of sets such that the distance conjecture holds. By developing new restriction type estimates associated to circles and orbits, with a group theoretic argument, we will prove the $4/3$-parallel result in the two dimensions. This answers a question raised by Alex Iosevich. In a more general scenario, the existence/distribution of geometric/graph configurations will be also considered in this paper. Our results present improvements and extensions of recent results due to Ben Lichtin (2019, 2023). In comparison with Lichtin's method, our approach is much simpler and flexible, which is also one of the novelties in this paper.</description>
