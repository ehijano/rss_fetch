      <title>Kibble-Zurek dynamical scaling hypothesis in the Google analog-digital quantum simulator of the $XX$ model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The state-of-the-art tensor networks are employed to simulate the Hamiltonian ramp in the analog-digital quantum simulation of the quantum phase transition to the quasi-long-range ordered phase of the 2D square-lattice $XX$ model [Nature 638, 79 (2025)]. We focus on the quantum Kibble-Zurek (KZ) mechanism near the quantum critical point. Using the infinite projected entangled pair state (iPEPS), we simulate an infinite lattice and demonstrate the KZ scaling hypothesis for the $XX$ correlations across a wide range of ramp times. We use the time-dependent variational principle (TDVP) algorithm to simulate a finite $8\times 8$ lattice, similar to the one in the quantum simulation, and find that adiabatic finite-size effects dominate for longer ramp times, where the correlation length's growth with increasing ramp time saturates and the excitation energy's dependence on the ramp time crosses over to a power-law decay characteristic of adiabatic transitions.</description>

      <title>Constructing Quantum Many-Body Scars from Hilbert Space Fragmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum many-body scars (QMBS) are exotic many-body states that exhibit anomalous non-thermal behavior in an otherwise ergodic system. In this work, we demonstrate a simple, scalable and intuitive construction of QMBS in a kinetically constrained quantum model exhibiting weak Hilbert space fragmentation. We show that towers of exact QMBS can be constructed by injecting a quasiparticle excitation that partially activates the frozen regions in the lattice. Meanwhile, the inelastic collision between multiple quasiparticles allows for the construction of approximate scars, whose damping is governed by an emergent two-body loss. Our findings establish direct connections between quantum many-body scarring and Hilbert space fragmentation, paving the way for systematically constructing exact and approximate QMBS. The proposed model can be readily implemented in neutral-atom quantum simulators aided by strong Rydberg interactions.</description>

      <title>A cavity array microscope for parallel single-atom interfacing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutral atom arrays and optical cavity QED systems have developed in parallel as central pillars of modern experimental quantum science. While each platform has demonstrated exceptional capabilities-such as high-fidelity quantum logic in atom arrays, and strong light-matter coupling in cavities-their combination holds promise for realizing fast and non-destructive atom measurement, building large-scale quantum networks, and engineering hybrid atom-photon Hamiltonians. However, to date, experiments integrating the two platforms have been limited to interfacing the entire atom array with one global cavity mode, a configuration that constrains addressability, parallelism, and scalability. Here we introduce the cavity array microscope, an experimental platform where each individual atom is strongly coupled to its own individual cavity across a two-dimensional array of over 40 modes. Our approach requires no nanophotonic elements, and instead uses a new free-space cavity geometry with intra-cavity lenses to realize above-unity peak cooperativity with micron-scale mode waists and spacings, compatible with typical atom array length scales while keeping atoms far from dielectric surfaces. We achieve homogeneous atom-cavity coupling, and show fast, non-destructive, parallel readout on millisecond timescales, including cavity-resolved readout into a fiber array as a proof-of-principle for future networking applications. This platform is species-agnostic and scalable, and we expect key metrics to further improve in a next-generation realization anticipated to be compatible with glass-cell-based experiments. Our work unlocks, for the first time, the regime of many-cavity QED, and opens an unexplored frontier of large-scale quantum networking with atom arrays.</description>

      <title>Observation of Universal Expansion Anisotropy from Cold Atoms to Hot Quark-Gluon Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02847v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Azimuthal anisotropy has been ubiquitously observed in high-energy proton-proton, proton-nucleus, and nucleus-nucleus (heavy-ion) collisions, shaking the early belief that those anisotropies require an intense phase of multiple interactions between the created particles. This work reports a study of anisotropic expansion of cold $^{6}$Li Fermi gases, initially trapped in an anisotropic potential, as a function of the interaction strength that can be readily tuned by an external magnetic field. It is found that the expansion anisotropy builds up quickly at small interaction strength, without the need of a large amount of interactions. An unexpected and quantitative universal scaling of the expansion anisotropy is observed for the first time between cold atom and heavy-ion systems as a function of the number of collisions per particle or opacity ($n_{\rm coll}$), despite their vast differences in scale and physics. The expansion isotropy in both the cold atom gases and heavy-ion collisions increases smoothly and shows no sign of saturation in the observed opacity range, with an approximate power-law dependence of $\sqrt{n_{\rm coll}}$, characteristic of random walks. This universality potentially unifies a variety of vastly different physical systems, from weakly interacting dilute gases to the strongly interacting quark-gluon plasma of the early universe.</description>

      <title>Determining the $^3$P$_0$ excited-state tune-out wavelength of $^{174}$Yb in a triple-magic lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14163v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Precise state-dependent control of optical potentials is of great importance for various applications utilizing cold neutral atoms. In particular, tune-out wavelengths for the clock state pair in alkaline-earth(-like) atoms provide maximally state-selective trap conditions that hold promise for the realization of novel approaches in quantum computation and simulation. While several ground-state tune-out wavelengths have been determined, similar experimental studies for metastable excited states are challenged by inelastic collisions and Raman losses, so far prohibiting precise measurements of excited-state tune-out conditions. In this work we report on the measurement of a tune-out wavelength for the metastable $^3$P$_0$ clock state in $^{174}$Yb at $519.920(9)\,$THz. In order to circumvent collisional losses, we isolate individual $^3$P$_0$ atoms in a clock-magic-wavelength lattice at $759\,$nm. To minimize the limitation imposed by Raman scattering, we further implement resolved sideband cooling on the clock transition, which allows us to reduce the lattice depth and surpass lifetimes of $5\,$s. The precision of the tune-out measurement is further enhanced by fluorescence imaging in a triple-magic configuration, where we implement molasses cooling on the $^3$P$_1$ intercombination line and identify a magic angle of $38.5(9)^\circ$ in the clock-magic lattice.</description>

      <title>Universal Bound States with Bose-Fermi Duality in Microwave-Shielded Polar Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21535v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate universal bound states of microwave-shielded ultracold polar molecules. Under a highly elliptic microwave field, few-molecule scatterings in three dimension are shown to be governed by effective one-dimensional (1D) models. These models well reproduce the tetratomic (two-molecule) bound state and the Born-Oppenheimer potential in three-molecule sector. For hexatomic systems comprising three identical molecules, we find the lowest bound state emerge concurrently with tetratomic state, with binding energy exceeding twice of the latter. Strikingly, all these bound states display Bose-Fermi duality, i.e., they share identical energies and spatial densities in both bosonic and fermionic molecular systems. Universal features of these bound states are supported by the 1D nature of effective scattering and a large repulsive core in the reduced effective potential. For large molecule ensembles, our results suggest the formation of elongated self-bound droplets with crystalline patterns in both bosonic and fermionic polar molecules.</description>

      <title>Cavity-Mediated Gas-Liquid Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08830v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the gas-liquid transition in a binary Bose-Einstein condensate, where the two Zeeman-shifted hyperfine spin components are coupled by cavity-assisted Raman processes. Below a critical Zeeman field, the cavity becomes superradiant for an infinitesimally small pumping strength, where the enhanced superradiance is facilitated by the simultaneous formation of quantum droplet, a self-bound liquid phase stabilized by quantum fluctuations. Above the critical Zeeman field, the gas-liquid transition only takes place after the system becomes superradiant at a finite pumping strength. As the back action of the gas-liquid transition, the superradiant cavity field undergoes an abrupt jump at the first-order transition point. Furthermore, as a result of the fixed density ratio of the quantum droplet, the cavity field exhibits a linear scaling with the pumping strength in the liquid phase. These features serve as prominent signals for the cavity-mediated gas-liquid transition and coexistence, which derive from the interplay of Zeeman field, cavity-assisted spin mixing, and quantum fluctuations.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we show how one can restore an unknown nonlinear partial differential equation of a sine-Gordon type from its linearization around an unknown stationary kink. The key idea is to regard the ground state of the linear problem as the translation-related Goldstone mode of the nonlinear PDE sought after.</description>

      <title>Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations and integrable hyperbolic Landau-Zener models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17053v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the relationship between integrable Landau-Zener (LZ) models and Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov (KZ) equations. The latter are originally equations for the correlation functions of two-dimensional conformal field theories, but can also be interpreted as multi-time Schr\"odinger equations. The general LZ problem is to find probabilities of tunneling from eigenstates at $t=t_\text{in}$ to eigenstates at $t\to+\infty$ for an $N\times N$ time-dependent Hamiltonian $\hat H(t)$. A number of such problems are exactly solvable in the sense that their tunneling probabilities are elementary functions of Hamiltonian parameters. Recently, it has been proposed that exactly solvable LZ models of this type map to KZ equations. Here we use this connection to identify and solve a class of integrable LZ models with hyperbolic time dependence, $\hat H(t)=\hat A+\hat B/t$, for $N=2, 3$, and $4$, where $\hat A$ and $\hat B$ are time-independent matrices.</description>

      <title>Isotope-agnostic motional ground-state cooling of neutral Yb atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09031v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficient high-fidelity ground-state cooling of motional degrees of freedom is crucial for applications in quantum simulation, computing and metrology. Here, we demonstrate direct ground-state cooling of fermionic $^{171}$Yb and bosonic $^{174}$Yb atoms in two- and three-dimensional magic-wavelength optical lattices on the ultranarrow clock transition. Its high spectral resolution offers the potential for reaching extremely low temperatures. To ensure efficient cooling, we develop a chirped sideband cooling scheme, where we sweep the clock-laser frequency to mitigate the effects of spatial trap inhomogeneities. We further generalize the theoretical description of sideband spectra to higher-dimensional lattices for precise thermometry. We achieve 2D ground state fractions of $97\%$ for $^{171}$Yb with an average motional occupation of $\bar{n}\simeq0.015$ and provide a direct comparison with $^{174}$Yb, reaching similar cooling performance. Applying the same scheme in 3D results in $\bar{n}\simeq0.15$ limited by layer-to-layer inhomogeneities in the vertical direction. These results demonstrate efficient motional ground-state cooling in optical lattices, especially for bosonic alkaline-earth(-like) atoms, where other methods are not applicable, opening the door to novel protocols for quantum science applications with neutral atoms.</description>
