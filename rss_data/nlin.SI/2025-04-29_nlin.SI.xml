      <title>Baseband Modulational Instability and Manifestation of Breather and Super Rogue Wave Phenomena in Modified Noguchi Electrical Transmission Line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we report the emergence of breather and super rogue waves in a modified Noguchi electrical transmission line and demonstrate that both phenomena arise from baseband modulational instability. We then systematically examine the influence of three key parameters and time that appear in the solutions, on the structure and behavior of breathers and super rogue waves, how they control waveform amplitude, localization, and intensity. We also explore the intricate dynamics of wave propagation in nonlinear electrical line. Our findings provide valuable insights into the role of network parameters, such as inductances, capacitances, and nonlinear coefficients, in shaping wave behavior, offering not only practical guidelines for the design, stability, and experimental investigation of electrical transmission systems but also provides practical approaches for controlling and managing breather and super rogue wave phenomena in the transmission lines.</description>

      <title>Transmission of Positons in a Modified Noguchi Electrical Transmission Line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In previous studies, the propagation of localized pulses (solitons, rogue waves and breathers) in electrical transmission lines has been studied. In this work, we extend this study to explore the transmission of positon solutions or positons in the modified Noguchi electrical transmission line model. By converting the circuit equations into the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation, we identify positons, a special type of solution with algebraic decay and oscillatory patterns. Unlike solitons, which are used for stable energy transmission, positons provide persistent energy localization and controlled spreading over long distances. We consider second-order and third-order positon solutions and examine their transmission behaviour in electrical lines. We show that over long times, the amplitude and width of both second- and third-order positons remain largely unaffected, indicating stable transmission. We also analyze what are the parameters affect the amplitude and localization of this kind of waves. Our investigations reveal that the amplitude and localization of positons are significantly influenced by the parameter $\epsilon$ that appear in the solution. Our findings have practical implications for improving energy transmission in electrical systems, where the management of wave localization and dispersion is crucial.</description>

      <title>Algorithm classifying roots of star-shaped Kac-Moody root systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a star-shaped Kac-Moody root system, we provide an effective algorithm to obtain representatives of the Weyl group orbits of roots with a given norm and implement it as a computer program. We also explain the relationship between these orbits and Fuchsian differential equations on the Riemann sphere, as well as higher-dimensional Painleve-type equations.</description>

      <title>Cauchy-Jacobi orthogonal polynomials and the discrete CKP equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper intends to construct discrete spectral transformations for Cauchy-Jacobi orthogonal polynomials, and find its corresponding discrete integrable systems. It turns out that the normalization factor of Cauchy-Jacobi orthogonal polynomials acts as the $\tau$-function of the discrete CKP equation, which has applications in Yang-Baxter equation, integrable geometry, cluster algebra, and so on.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of McMillan mappings II. Axially symmetric map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05657v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate the transverse dynamics of a single particle in a model integrable accelerator lattice, based on a McMillan axially-symmetric electron lens. Although the McMillan e-lens has been considered as a device potentially capable of mitigating collective space charge forces, some of its fundamental properties have not been described yet. The main goal of our work is to close this gap and understand the limitations and potentials of this device. It is worth mentioning that the McMillan axially symmetric map provides the first-order approximations of dynamics for a general linear lattice plus an arbitrary thin lens with motion separable in polar coordinates. Therefore, advancements in its understanding should give us a better picture of more generic and not necessarily integrable round beams. In the first part of the article, we classify all possible regimes with stable trajectories and find the canonical action-angle variables. This provides an evaluation of the dynamical aperture, Poincar\'e rotation numbers as functions of amplitudes, and thus determines the spread in nonlinear tunes. Also, we provide a parameterization of invariant curves, allowing for the immediate determination of the map image forward and backward in time. The second part investigates the particle dynamics as a function of system parameters. We show that there are three fundamentally different configurations of the accelerator optics causing different regimes of nonlinear oscillations. Each regime is considered in great detail, including the limiting cases of large and small amplitudes. In addition, we analyze the dynamics in Cartesian coordinates and provide a description of observable variables and corresponding spectra.</description>

      <title>Symmetric Sextic Freud Weight</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08522v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the properties of the sequence of coefficients $(\beta_n)_{n\geq0}$ in the recurrence relation satisfied by the sequence of monic symmetric polynomials, orthogonal with respect to the symmetric sextic Freud weight $$\omega(x; \tau, t) = \exp(-x^6 + \tau x^4 + t x^2), \qquad x \in \mathbb{R}, $$ with real parameters $\tau$ and $t$. We derive a fourth-order nonlinear discrete equation satisfied by $\beta_n$, which is shown to be a special case of {the second} member of the discrete Painlev\'{e} I hierarchy. Further, we analyse differential and differential-difference equations satisfied by the recurrence coefficients. The emphasis is to offer a comprehensive study of the intricate evolution in the behaviour of these recurrence coefficients as the pair of parameters $(\tau,t)$ change. A comprehensive numerical and computational analysis is carried out for critical parameter ranges, and graphical plots are presented to illustrate the behaviour of the recurrence coefficients as well as the complexity of the associated Volterra lattice hierarchy. The corresponding symmetric sextic Freud polynomials are shown to satisfy a second-order differential equation with rational coefficients. The moments of the weight are examined in detail, including their integral representations, differential equations, and recursive structure. Closed-form expressions for moments are obtained in several special cases, and asymptotic expansions for the recurrence coefficients are provided. The results highlight rich algebraic and analytic structures underlying the symmetric sextic Freud weight and its connections to integrable systems.</description>

      <title>Spectral statistics of interpolating random circulant matrix and its applications to random circulant graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.16296v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a versatile matrix model of the form ${\bf A}+i {\bf B}$, where ${\bf A}$ and ${\bf B}$ are real random circulant matrices with independent but, in general, nonidentically distributed Gaussian entries. For this model, we derive exact results for the joint probability density function and find that it is a multivariate Gaussian. Arbitrary order marginal density therefore also readily follows. It is demonstrated that by adjusting the averages and variances of the Gaussian elements of ${\bf A}$ and ${\bf B}$, we can interpolate between a remarkably wide range of eigenvalue distributions in the complex plane. In particular, we can examine the crossover between a random real circulant matrix and a random complex circulant matrix. We also extend our study to include Wigner-like and Wishart-like matrices constructed from our general random circulant matrix. To validate our analytical findings, Monte Carlo simulations are conducted, which confirm the accuracy of our results. Additionally, we compare our analytical results with the spectra of adjacency matrices from various random circulant graphs. Despite the difference in entry distributions-Gaussian in our model and non-Gaussian in the adjacency matrices-the densities show excellent agreement in the large-dimension limit.</description>

      <title>On Integrable Nets in General and Concordant Chebyshev Nets in Particular</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12626v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider general integrable curve nets in Euclidean space as a particular integrable geometry invariant with respect to rigid motions and net-preserving reparameterisations. For the purpose of their description, we first give an overview of the most important second-order invariants and relations among them. As a particular integrable example, we reinterpret the result of I.S. Krasil'shchik and M. Marvan (see Section 2, Case 2 in [Acta Appl. Math. 56 (1999), 217-230]) as a curve net satisfying an $\mathbb R$-linear relation between the Schief curvature of the net and the Gauss curvature of the supporting surface. In the special case when the curvatures are proportional (concordant nets), we find a correspondence to pairs of pseudospherical surfaces of equal negative constant Gaussian curvatures. Conversely, we also show that two generic pseudospherical surfaces of equal negative constant Gaussian curvatures induce a concordant Chebyshev net. The construction generalises the well-known correspondence between pairs of curves and translation surfaces.</description>

      <title>New negative grade solitonic sector for supersymmetric KdV and mKdV hierarchies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00280v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A systematic construction for supersymmetric negative graded (non-local) flows for mKdV and KdV based on $sl(2,1)$ with a principal gradation is proposed in this paper. We show that smKdV and sKdV can be mapped onto each other through a gauge super Miura transformation, together with an additional condition for the negative flows, which ensure the supersymmetry of the negative sKdV flow. In addition, we classify both smKdV and sKdV flows with respect to the vacuum (boundary) solutions. These are classified according to zero or non-zero vacuum. Each vacuum solution is used to derive both soliton solutions and the corresponding Heisenberg subalgebra for the smKdV hierarchy. We present the new solutions corresponding to non-zero bosonic and fermionic vacuum by constructing the deformed vertex operators. Finally, the gauge Miura transformation is employed to obtain the sKdV solutions, which exhibit a rich degeneracy due to both multiple gauge super Miura transformations and multiple vacuum possibilities.</description>

      <title>Spectral theory of soliton gases for the defocusing NLS equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01132v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we derive Nonlinear Dispersion Relations (NDR) for the defocusing NLS (dark) soliton gas using the idea of thermodynamic limit of quasimomentum and quasienergy differentials on the underlying family of Riemann surfaces. It turns out that the obtained NDR are closely connected with the recently studied NDR for circular soliton gas for the focusing NLS. We find solutions for the kinetic equation for the defocusing NLS soliton condensate, which is defined by the endpoints of the spectral support $\Gamma$ for the NDR. It turns out that, similarly to KdV soliton condensates (\cite{CERT}), the evolution of these endpoints is governed by the defocusing NLS-Whitham equations (\cite{Kodama}). We also study the Riemann problem for step initial data and the kurtosis of genus zero and one defNLS condensates, where we proved that the kurtosis of genus one condensate can not exceed 3/2, whereas for genus zero condensate the kurtosis is always 1.</description>

      <title>Simple and accurate nonlinear pendulum motion for the full range of amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16816v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A simple closed-form formula for the period of a pendulum with finite amplitude is proposed. It reproduces the exact analytical forms both in the small and large amplitude limits, while in the mid-amplitude range maintains average error of 0.06% and maximum error of 0.17%. The accuracy should be sufficient for typical engineering applications. Its unique simplicity should be useful in a theoretical development that requires trackable mathematical framework or in an introductory physics course that aims to discuss a finite amplitude pendulum. A simple and formally exact solution of angular displacement for the full range of amplitudes is illustrated.</description>

      <title>Three-local Charge Conservation Implies Quantum Integrability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17773v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is shown that the existence of a local conserved charge supported by three neighboring sites, or its local version, Reshetikhin's condition, suffices to guarantee the existence of all higher conserved charges and hence the integrability of a quantum spin chain. This explains the 'coincidence' that no counterexample is known to Grabowski and Mathieu's long-standing conjecture despite the folklore that the conservation of local charges of order higher than 4 imposes additional constraints not implied by the conservation of the three-local charge.</description>
