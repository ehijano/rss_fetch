      <title>Performance Evaluation of an RFSoC Operating in a 1.25 Tesla Magnetic Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Belle II experiment at the SuperKEKB collider is preparing for an upgrade after 2027-2028 to handle higher luminosity and increased background rates. A Radio Frequency System-on-Chip (RFSoC) has been identified as a potential candidate for a common front-end upgrade for subsystems requiring high-speed waveform digitization. The RFSoC's ADC and DAC channels were tested across various magnetic field strengths and a few different field orientations. Power consumption and boot memory functionality were also assessed. Results indicate stable operation with negligible performance degradation, suggesting the RFSoC's viability for high-speed digitization tasks in high magnetic field environments.</description>

      <title>Ultraviolet cross-luminescence in ternary chlorides of alkali and alkaline-earth metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: After the discovery of a cross-luminescence (CL) in BaF2 in 1982, a large number of CL scintillators were investigated. However, no CL scintillator superior to BaF2 has been discovered, and the research of CL scintillators has subsided. Recent technological development in medical imaging and high-energy physics created a new demand for ultra-fast scintillators further supported by the development of UV-sensitive semiconductor photodetectors. As a consequence, renewed interest in CL scintillators appeared. To satisfy the requirements of fast timing applications high photo-detection efficiency, e. i. a good spectral match between the scintillator and photodetector must be achieved. Cesium-based ternary chlorides could provide a red-shift (~1.5 eV) of CL towards the sensitive region of the photodetector (PMT or SiPM) while keeping light output and timing characteristics comparable to BaF2.</description>

      <title>Comparison of Impedance Matching Networks for Scanning Microwave Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a definition of the gain and added noise of impedance matching networks for scanning microwave microscopy is given. This definition can be used to compare different impedance matching techniques independently of the instrument used to measure the S-parameter. As a demonstration, impedance matching devices consisting of a Beatty line, a tuner, and interferometric setups with and without amplifiers have been investigated. Measurement frequencies up to 28 GHz are used, and the maximal resulting gain found was 9504.7 per Siemens.</description>

      <title>Advanced Halide Scintillators: From the Bulk to Nano</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Halide scintillators play a crucial role in the detection of ionizing radiation since the discovery of scintillation in NaI:Tl in 1948. The discovery of NaI:Tl motivated the research and development (R&amp;D) of halide scintillators resulting in the development of CsI:Tl, CsI:Na, CaF$_2$:Eu, etc. Later, the R&amp;D shifted toward oxide materials due to their high mechanical and chemical stability, good scintillation properties, and relative ease of bulk single crystal growth. However, the development in crystal growth technology allowed for the growth of high-quality single crystals of hygroscopic and mechanically fragile materials including SrI$_2$ and LaBr$_3$. Scintillators based on these materials exhibit excellent performance and push the limits of inorganic scintillators. These results motivated intense research of a large variety of halide-based scintillators. Moreover, materials based on lead halide perovskites found application in the fields of photovoltaics, solid-state lighting, and lasers. The first studies show also the significant potential of lead halide perovskites as ultrafast scintillators in the form of NCs. The purpose of this review is to summarize the R&amp;D in the field of halide scintillators during the last decade and to highlight perspectives for future development.</description>

      <title>Numerical Studies of Straw Tube Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The charged particles are tracked in the high energy physics detectors to provide the information of their properties. One of the tracking detector is straw tube detector that has been used by many experiments. The aim of this paper is to study the different properties of particles using different gas composition. The gas mixture that shows maximum transition radiation among xenon gas mixtures was found to be $XeHeCH_{4}$ :: 30:55:15. The gas mixture that has shown maximum primary ionization has been $XeCO_{2}O_{2}$ :: 70:27:3. The simulated detector has been also used for the identification of different particles.</description>

      <title>New interferometric aperture masking technique for full transverse beam characterization using synchrotron radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emittance measurements using synchrotron radiation are usually performed using x-rays to avoid diffraction limits. Interferometric techniques using visible light are also used to measure either the horizontal or the vertical beam projection. Several measurements rotating the interferometry axis are needed to obtain a full beam reconstruction. In this report we present a new interferometric multi-aperture masking technique and data analysis, inspired by astronomical methods, that are able to provide a full 2-D transverse beam reconstruction in a single acquisition. Results of beam characterization obtained at ALBA synchrotron light source will also been shown.</description>

      <title>Room temperature operation of germanium-silicon single-photon avalanche diode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10379v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ability to detect single photons has led to the advancement of numerous research fields. Although various types of single-photon detector have been developed, because of two main factors - that is, (1) the need for operating at cryogenic temperature and (2) the incompatibility with complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) fabrication processes - so far, to our knowledge, only Si-based single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) has gained mainstream success and has been used in consumer electronics. With the growing demand to shift the operation wavelength from near-infrared to short-wavelength infrared (SWIR) for better safety and performance, an alternative solution is required because Si has negligible optical absorption for wavelengths beyond 1 {\mu}m. Here we report a CMOS-compatible, high-performing germanium-silicon SPAD operated at room temperature, featuring a noise-equivalent power improvement over the previous Ge-based SPADs by 2-3.5 orders of magnitude. Key parameters such as dark count rate, single-photon detection probability at 1,310 nm, timing jitter, after-pulsing characteristic time and after-pulsing probability are, respectively, measured as 19 kHz {\mu}m^2, 12%, 188 ps, ~90 ns and &lt;1%, with a low breakdown voltage of 10.26 V and a small excess bias of 0.75 V. Three-dimensional point-cloud images are captured with direct time-of-flight technique as proof of concept. This work paves the way towards using single-photon-sensitive SWIR sensors, imagers and photonic integrated circuits in everyday life.</description>
