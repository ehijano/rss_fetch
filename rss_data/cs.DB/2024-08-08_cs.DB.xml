      <title>Mapping the Provenance Ontology to Basic Formal Ontology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Provenance Ontology (PROV-O) is a World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) recommended ontology used to structure data about provenance across a wide variety of domains. Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) is a top-level ontology ISO/IEC standard used to structure a wide variety of ontologies, such as the OBO Foundry ontologies and the Common Core Ontologies (CCO). To enhance interoperability between these two ontologies, their extensions, and data organized by them, an alignment is presented according to a specific mapping criteria and methodology which prioritizes structural and semantic considerations. The ontology alignment is evaluated by checking its logical consistency with canonical examples of PROV-O instances and querying terms that do not satisfy the mapping criteria as formalized in SPARQL. A variety of semantic web technologies are used in support of FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles.</description>

      <title>'Intelligence Studies Network': A human-curated database for indexing resources with open-source tools</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Intelligence Studies Network is a comprehensive resource database for publications, events, conferences, and calls for papers in the field of intelligence studies. It offers a novel solution for monitoring, indexing, and visualising resources. Sources are automatically monitored and added to a manually curated database, ensuring the relevance of items to intelligence studies. Curated outputs are stored in a group library on Zotero, an open-source reference management tool. The metadata of items in Zotero is enriched with OpenAlex, an open access bibliographic database. Finally, outputs are listed and visualised on a Streamlit app, an open-source Python framework for building apps. This paper aims to explain the Intelligence Studies Network database and provide a detailed guide on data sources and the workflow. This study demonstrates that it is possible to create a specialised academic database by using open source tools.</description>

      <title>Data Mesh: a Systematic Gray Literature Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.01062v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data mesh is an emerging domain-driven decentralized data architecture that aims to minimize or avoid operational bottlenecks associated with centralized, monolithic data architectures in enterprises. The topic has picked the practitioners' interest, and there is considerable gray literature on it. At the same time, we observe a lack of academic attempts at defining and building upon the concept. Hence, in this article, we aim to start from the foundations and characterize the data mesh architecture regarding its design principles, architectural components, capabilities, and organizational roles. We systematically collected, analyzed, and synthesized 114 industrial gray literature articles. The review provides insights into practitioners' perspectives on the four key principles of data mesh: data as a product, domain ownership of data, self-serve data platform, and federated computational governance. Moreover, due to the comparability of data mesh and SOA (service-oriented architecture), we mapped the findings from the gray literature into the reference architectures from the SOA academic literature to create the reference architectures for describing three key dimensions of data mesh: organization of capabilities and roles, development, and runtime. Finally, we discuss open research issues in data mesh, partially based on the findings from the gray literature.</description>

      <title>A general framework for distributed approximate similarity search with arbitrary distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13795v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Similarity search is a central problem in domains such as information management and retrieval or data analysis. Many similarity search algorithms are designed or specifically adapted to metric distances. Thus, they are unsuitable for alternatives like the cosine distance, which has become quite common, for example, with embeddings and in text mining. This paper presents GDASC (General Distributed Approximate Similarity search with Clustering), a general framework for distributed approximate similarity search that accepts arbitrary distances. This framework can build a multilevel index structure, by selecting a clustering algorithm, the number of prototypes in each cluster and any arbitrary distance function. As a result, this framework effectively overcomes the limitation of using metric distances and can address situations involving cosine similarity or other non-standard similarity measures. Experimental results using k-medoids clustering in GDASC with real datasets confirm the applicability of this approach for approximate similarity search, improving the performance of extant algorithms for this purpose.</description>
