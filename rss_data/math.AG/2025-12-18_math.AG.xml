      <title>A Kronecker algorithm for locally closed sets over a perfect field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a probabilistic algorithm of Kronecker type for computing a Kronecker representation of a zero-dimensional linear section of an algebraic variety $V$ defined over a perfect field $k$. The variety $V$ is the Zariski closure of the set of common zeros $\{F_1=0,\ldots,F_r=0,G\not=0\}$ of multivariate polynomials $F_1,\ldots,F_r\in k[X_1,\ldots,X_n]$ outside a prescribed hypersurface $\{G=0\}$. We assume that $F_1,\ldots,F_r$ satisfy natural geometric conditions, such as regularity and radicality, in the local ring $k[X_1,\ldots,X_n]_G$. Our approach combines homotopic deformation techniques with symbolic Newton-Hensel lifting and elimination. We discuss the concept of lifting curves as intermediate geometric objects that enable efficient computation.
  The complexity of the algorithm is expressed in terms of the degrees and arithmetic size of the input and achieves soft-quadratic complexity in these parameters. We provide detailed complexity analyses for arbitrary perfect fields, as well as for two important cases in computer algebra: finite fields and the field of rational numbers. For each case, we obtain sharp bounds on the size of the base field or required primes.</description>

      <title>Large orders of automorphisms of smooth curves in $\mathbb P^1\times \mathbb P^1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For $a,b\geq 3$, we calculate the orders of automorphisms of smooth curves with bidegree $(a,b)$ in the product $\pp$ of the projective line $\mathbb P^1$. We identify smooth curves in $\pp$ which have automorphisms with the largest orders. In addition, we study the relationship between symmetry and geometric structure of curves. We provide a sufficient condition for the quotient space by an automorphism to be $\mathbb P^1$.</description>

      <title>Multi-Component Open/Relative/Local Correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a toric Calabi-Yau 3-orbifold relative to s Aganagic-Vafa outer branes, we prove a correspondence among the genus-zero open Gromov-Witten invariants with maximal winding at each brane and: (i) closed invariants of a toric Calabi-Yau (3+s)-orbifold; (ii) formal relative invariants of a formal toric Calabi-Yau (FTCY) 3-orbifold with maximal tangency to s divisors; (iii) formal relative invariants of a sequence of FTCY intermediate geometries interpolating dimensions 3 and 3+s. The correspondence provides examples of the log/local principle of van Garrel-Graber-Ruddat in the multi-component setting and the refined conjecture of Brini-Bousseau-van Garrel via intermediate geometries. It also establishes the multi-component case of the open/closed correspondence proposed by Lerche-Mayr and studied by Liu-Yu. As an application, we obtain examples of the conjecture of Klemm-Pandharipande on the integrality of BPS invariants of higher-dimensional toric Calabi-Yau manifolds. Along the way, we set the basic stages of the relative Gromov-Witten theory of higher-dimensional FTCY orbifolds, generalizing the case of smooth 3-folds by Li-Liu-Liu-Zhou.</description>

      <title>The period-index problem for hyperk\"ahler varieties: Lower and upper bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is expected that a stronger form of the period-index conjecture holds for hyperk\"ahler varieties. Following ideas of Hotchkiss, we provide further evidence for this expectation by proving a version in which the index is replaced by the Hodge-theoretic index. We also show that the hyperk\"ahler period-index conjecture is optimal. As an application, we prove that Mumford-Tate general hyperk\"ahler varieties cannot be covered by families of elliptic curves passing through a fixed point. By extending work of Hotchkiss, Maulik, Shen, Yin, and Zhang, we prove the hyperk\"ahler period-index conjecture for non-special coprime Brauer class on hyperk\"ahler varieties of K3^n-type without any restriction on the Picard number.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the sheaf of $\mathbb A^1$-connected components of a quasi-split group over a perfect field is a strictly $\mathbb A^1$-invariant sheaf with (Voevodsky) transfers. As a consequence, we show that the norm principle holds for any quasi-split group over a perfect field.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolicity and fundamental groups of complex quasi-projective varieties (II): via non-abelian Hodge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is Part II of a series of three papers. We studies the hyperbolicity of complex quasi-projective varieties $X$ in the presence of a big and reductive representation $\varrho: \pi_1(X)\to {\rm GL}_N(\mathbb{C})$. For any Galois conjugate variety $X^\sigma$ with $\sigma \in {\rm Aut}(\mathbb{C}/\mathbb{Q})$, we prove the generalized Green-Griffiths-Lang conjecture. When $\varrho$ is furthermore large, we show that the special subsets of $X^\sigma$ describing the non-hyperbolicity locus coincide, and that this locus is proper exactly when $X$ is of log general type. Moreover, if the Zariski closure of $\rho(\pi_1(X))$ is semisimple, we prove that there exists a proper Zariski closed subset $Z \subsetneq X^\sigma$ such that every subvariety not contained in $Z$ is of log general type and all entire curves in $X^\sigma$ are contained in $Z$. This result extends the theorems of the third author (2010) and of Campana-Claudon-Eyssidieux (2015) from projective to quasi-projective varieties, and yields stronger conclusions even in the projective case.</description>

      <title>Regions surrounded by cylinders of circles of fixed radii and exposition of their shapes by natural graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate regions formed by cylinders of circles of fixed radii. We investigate graphs obtained by collapsing each level set of the functions represented by the natural projections of them to the $1$-dimensional line. Some specific trees obtained in simple ways from so-called balanced trees are shown to be realized as such graphs. Related studies on regions in the Euclidean plane surrounded by real algebraic curves are presented by several researchers. One of pioneering studies is presented by Bodin, Popescu-Pampu and Sorea in 2022--3 as an elementary and surprisingly new study. The author has been interested in related studies and also in constructing natural and explicit real algebraic maps onto such regions, generalizing the canonical projections of the unit spheres. Such studies in real algebraic geometry, different from theory of existence in the last century, mainly studied by Nash and Tognoli, are remarked.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the cohomological interpretation of anti-holomorphic derivatives of the isomonodromic deformation of a Higgs bundle, as established in our previous work \cite{HSZ}, to provide a short new proof of the non-existence of holomorphic isomonodromic deformation of a generic $\SL$-Higgs bundle and of any non-unitary rank 2 Higgs bundle over the Teichm\"uller space $\mathcal T_g$, which were previously proved in \cite{biswas}. We also prove the non-existence of holomorphic isomonodromic deformation of any non-unitary rank 3 Higgs bundle over the Teichm\"uller space $\mathcal T_g$.</description>

      <title>Equidimensional morphisms onto splinters are pure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that a Noetherian ring $R$ is a splinter if and only if for every equidimensional surjective morphism $\operatorname{Spec}(S) \to \operatorname{Spec}(R)$, the map $R \to S$ is pure. This yields a large, nontrivial class of ring maps that are automatically pure. More generally, we prove that a locally Noetherian scheme $Y$ is locally a splinter if and only if every locally equidimensional morphism $X \to Y$ is strongly pure. Special cases of our results show that equidimensional fibrations over normal $\mathbf{Q}$-schemes or regular schemes of arbitrary characteristic are strongly pure. The main ingredient is a new factorization result for locally equidimensional morphisms of schemes, which is of independent interest. Additionally, we prove a weak Boutot-type theorem for $F$-rationality, which says that $F$-rationality descends under pure ring maps that are locally equidimensional under universally catenary assumptions. This statement is false without the locally equidimensional hypothesis.</description>

      <title>Calabi-Yau Threefolds from Vex Triangulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the birational geometry (i.e., K\"ahler moduli space) of Calabi--Yau (CY) threefold hypersurfaces in toric varieties arising from four-dimensional reflexive polytopes. In particular, it has been observed that the birational classes of these geometries are not exhausted by toric hypersurfaces arising from fine, regular, star triangulations (FRSTs). We begin by introducing a classification problem: enumeration of birational classes of toric varieties, which is equivalent to enumeration of certain triangulations/fans. We consider this problem from the complementary perspectives of triangulation theory and toric geometry, reviewing both theories in detail; this culminates in an explanation of how to generate all fine regular triangulations of a vector configuration (i.e., fine regular simplicial fans). We then apply this theory to the Kreuzer--Skarke (KS) database, where we encounter both FRSTs and vex triangulations. We study the non-weak-Fano toric varieties arising from vex triangulations, along with their CY hypersurfaces. In particular, we show that all fine regular triangulations of a fixed 4D reflexive polytope give rise to smooth birational CY hypersurfaces, extending Batyrev's result from FRSTs to vex triangulations. We exhaustively enumerate all $24,023,940$ fine regular triangulations in the KS database with $h^{1,1}\leq 7$, of which over $70\%$ are vex triangulations, and provide an upper bound of $10^{979}$ for fine regular triangulations in the entire KS database. We conclude that vex triangulations of four-dimensional reflexive polytopes give rise to a large number of smooth Calabi--Yau threefolds and importantly provide toric descriptions for novel regions in the K\"ahler moduli space.</description>

      <title>Quantization in mixed polarization via transverse Poincar\'e-Birkhoff-Witt theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On a prequantizable K\"ahler manifold $(M, \omega, L)$, Chan-Leung-Li constructed a genuine (non-asymptotic) action of a subalgebra of the Berezin-Toeplitz star product on $H^0(M, L^{\otimes k})$ for each level $k$ [14]. We extend their framework to any non-singular polarization $P$ by developing a theory of transverse differential operators associated to $P$:
  (1) For any pair of locally free $P$-modules $E, E'$, we construct a Poincar\'e-Birkhoff-Witt isomorphism for the bundle $\widetilde{D}(E, E')$ of transverse differential operators from $E$ to $E'$. When $E, E'$ are trivial rank-$1$ $P$-modules, this recovers the PBW theorem of Laurent-Gengoux-Sti\'enon-Xu [29] for the Lie pair $(TM_\mathbb{C}, P)$.
  (2) Using these PBW isomorphisms, we show that the Grothendieck connections on the transeverse jet bundle of $L^{\otimes k}$ give rise to a deformation quantization $(C_M^\infty[[\hbar]], \star)$ together with a sheaf of subalgebras $C_{M, \hbar}^{&lt;\infty}$ that acts on $P$-polarized sections of $L^{\otimes k}$. We obtain a geometric interpretation of $(C_{M, \hbar}^{&lt;\infty}, \star)$ by evaluating at $\hbar = \tfrac{\sqrt{-1}}{k}$, yielding a sheaf $O_k^{(&lt;\infty)}$, and proving that $O_k^{(&lt;\infty)} \cong \widetilde{D}_{L^{\otimes k}}$ as sheaves of filtered algebras, where $\widetilde{D}_{L^{\otimes k}}$ is the sheaf of transverse differential operators on $L^{\otimes k}$. When $P$ is a K\"ahler polarization, this recovers the result of Chan-Leung-Li [14].
  As an application, we study symplectic tori and derive asymptotic expansions for the Toeplitz-type operators in real polarization introduced in [35].</description>

      <title>The Kodaira dimension of even-dimensional ball quotients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22203v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that, up to scaling, there exist only finitely many isometry classes of Hermitian lattices over $O_E$ of signature $(1,n)$ that admit ball quotients of non-general type, where $n&gt;12$ is even and $E=\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-D})$ for an odd discriminant $-D&lt;-3$. Furthermore, we show that even-dimensional ball quotients, associated with arithmetic subgroups of $\mathrm{U}(1,n)$ defined over $E$, are always of general type if $n &gt; 207$, or $n&gt;12$ and $D&gt;2557$. To establish these results, we construct a nontrivial full-level cusp form of weight $n$ on the $n$-dimensional complex ball.

      <title>Hilbert property for low-genus families and degree-one del Pezzo surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13967v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the Hilbert property is satisfied by certain del Pezzo surfaces of degree one and Picard rank 1 over fields finitely generated over $\mathbb{Q}$. We generalize results of the first author on elliptic surfaces and employ constructions used by Desjardins and the third author to prove density of rational points. Our results are the first on the Hilbert property for minimal del Pezzo surfaces of degree one without a conic fibration.</description>

      <title>Torsion points of small order on cyclic covers of $\mathbb P^1$. II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16912v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $d\geq 2$ be an integer, $K_0$ a perfect field such that $char(K_0)$ does not divide $d$, $n &gt; d$ an integer prime to $d$, $f(x)\in K_0[x]$ a degree $n$ monic polynomial without repeated roots, and $C_{f,d}$ a smooth projective model of the affine curve $y^d=f(x)$. Let $J(C_{f,d})$ be the Jacobian of the $K_0$-curve $C_{f,d} $. We identify $C_{f,d}$ with its canonical image in $J(C_{f,d})$ (such that the infinite point of $C_{f,d}$ goes to the zero of the group law on $J(C_{f,d})$).
  We say that an integer $m&gt;1$ is $(n,d)$-reachable over $K_0$ if there exists a polynomial $f(x)$ as above such that $C_{f,d}(K_0)$ contains a torsion point of order $m$.
  Earlier we proved that if $m$ is $(n,d)$-reachable, then either $m=d$ or $m \geq n$ (in addition, both $d$ and $n$ are $(n,d)$-reachable).
  In the present paper we prove the following.
  If $n&lt;m&lt;2n$ and if $m$ is $(n,d)$-reachable over $K_0$, then either $d|m$ or $m \equiv n \bmod d$.
  If either $char(K_0)=0$ or $K_0$ in infinite and $char(K_0)&gt;n$, then $d\cdot [(n+d)/d]$ is $(n,d)$-reachable if and only if $n-(d-1)\cdot [(n+d)/d]\ge 0$.
  If $char(K_0)=0$, then $n+d$ is $(n,d)$-reachable if and only if $d^2-2d&lt;n$.
  If $d=2$ (the hyperelliptic case) and $char(K_0)=0$, then $m$ is $(n,d)$-reachable if $n+1 \le m \le 2n+1$. (The case when $n \le m \le 3(n-1)/2$ was done earlier by E.V. Flynn.)</description>

      <title>Logarithmic de Rham Stacks and Non-Abelian Hodge Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04300v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we introduce the logarithmic de Rham stack of a pair (X, D), for a smooth variety X over a field k of positive characteristic p, and D a strict normal crossings divisor on X. Using this stack, we prove a new version of logarithmic Cartier descent, and a new logarithmic non-abelian Hodge theorem for curves, both stated using a certain logarithmic Frobenius twist. Our logarithmic non-abelian Hodge theorem implies an earlier logarithmic non-abelian Hodge theorem of de Cataldo-Zhang.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14464v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $C$ be an irreducible smooth projective curve of genus $g\geq 2$ over an algebraically closed field. We prove that the moduli stack of semi-stable vector bundles on $C$ of fixed rank and determinant is $\mathbb{A}^1$--connected. We also show that the moduli stack of quasi-parabolic vector bundles with a fixed determinant and a given quasi-parabolic data along a set of points in $C$, as well as its open substacks consisting of $\boldsymbol{\alpha}$-semistable vector bundles for any system of weights $\boldsymbol{\alpha}$, are also $\mathbb{A}^1$-connected.</description>

      <title>Bloch-Beilinson conjectures for Hecke characters and Eisenstein cohomology of Picard surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.16435v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider certain families of Hecke characters $\phi$ over a quadratic imaginary field $F$. According to the Bloch-Beilinson conjectures, the order of vanishing of the $L$-function $L(\phi,s)$ at the central point $s=-1$ should be equal to the dimension of the space of extensions of the Tate motive $\mathbb{Q}(1)$ by the motive associated with $\phi$. In this article, we construct candidates for the corresponding extensions of Hodge structures, assuming that the sign of the functional equation of $L(\phi,s)$ is $-1$. This is accomplished through the cohomology of variations of Hodge structures over Picard modular surfaces associated with $F$ and Harder's theory of Eisenstein cohomology. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these extensions are naturally realized within certain biextensions. We outline a program to compute the biextension height and utilize it to establish the non-triviality of these extensions.</description>

      <title>Geometry and Optimization of Shallow Polynomial Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06074v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study shallow neural networks with monomial activations and output dimension one. The function space for these models can be identified with a set of symmetric tensors with bounded rank. We describe general features of these networks, focusing on the relationship between width and optimization. We then consider teacher-student problems, which can be viewed as problems of low-rank tensor approximation with respect to non-standard inner products that are induced by the data distribution. In this setting, we introduce a teacher-metric data discriminant which encodes the qualitative behavior of the optimization as a function of the training data distribution. Finally, we focus on networks with quadratic activations, presenting an in-depth analysis of the optimization landscape. In particular, we present a variation of the Eckart-Young Theorem characterizing all critical points and their Hessian signatures for teacher-student problems with quadratic networks and Gaussian training data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04191v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a connection between Gromov-Witten invariants and the number of fixed points of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms on a closed rational symplectic manifold via deformed Hamiltonian spectral invariants. We generalize Givental's symplectic fixed point theorem for Fano toric manifolds to closed rational symplectic manifolds which admit nonzero Gromov-Witten invariants with fixed marked points and one point insertion. We prove a new cuplength estimate of symplectic fixed points involved in deformed spectral invariants. We extend Schwarz's quantum cuplength to the notion of deformed quantum cuplength for symplectic periods and employ it to estimate the number of fixed points of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms on monotone symplectic manifolds with nonzero mixed Gromov-Witten invariants.</description>

      <title>Elliptic modular graph forms, equivariant iterated integrals and single-valued elliptic polylogarithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15883v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The low-energy expansion of genus-one string amplitudes produces infinite families of non-holomorphic modular forms after each step of integrating over a point on the torus worldsheet which are known as elliptic modular graph forms (eMGFs). We solve the differential equations of eMGFs depending on a single point $z$ and the modular parameter $\tau$ via iterated integrals over holomorphic modular forms which individually transform inhomogeneously under ${\rm SL}_2(\mathbb Z)$. Suitable generating series of these iterated integrals over $\tau$, their complex conjugates and single-valued multiple zeta values (svMZVs) are combined to attain equivariant transformations under ${\rm SL}_2(\mathbb Z)$ such that their components are modular forms.
  Our generating series of equivariant iterated integrals for eMGFs is related to elliptic multiple polylogarithms (eMPLs) through a gauge transform of the flat Calaque-Enriquez-Etingof connection. By converting iterated $\tau$-integrals to iterated integrals over points on a torus, we arrive at an explicit construction of single-valued eMPLs where all the monodromies in the points cancel. Each single-valued eMPL depending on a single point $z$ is found to be a finite combination of meromorphic eMPLs, their complex conjugates, svMZVs and equivariant iterated Eisenstein integrals. Our generating series determines the latter two admixtures via so-called zeta generators and Tsunogai derivations which act on the two generators $x$, $y$ of a free Lie algebra and where the coefficients of words in $x,y$ define the single-valued eMPLs.</description>

      <title>Explicit Uniform Lower Bounds for the Canonical Height on Elliptic Curves over Abelian Extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19712v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish an explicit lower bound for the N\'eron-Tate height on elliptic curves with complex multiplication, for nontorsion points defined over the maximal abelian extension of a number field. Building on a strategy developed by Amoroso, David, and Zannier, we provide an alternative proof of a theorem originally due to Baker. The novelty in our approach is that it produces a lower bound that is fully explicit and independent of the discriminant of the base field.</description>
