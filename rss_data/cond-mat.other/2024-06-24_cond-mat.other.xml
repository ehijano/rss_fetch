      <title>Structural chirality and related properties in the periodic inorganic solids: Review and perspectives</title>

Abstract: Chirality refers to the asymmetry of objects that cannot be superimposed on their mirror image. It is a concept that exists in various scientific fields and has profound consequences. Although these are perhaps most widely recognized within biology, chemistry, and pharmacology, recent advances in chiral phonons, topological systems, crystal enantiomorphic materials, and magneto-chiral materials have brought this topic to the forefront of condensed matter physics research. Our review discusses the symmetry requirements and the features associated with structural chirality in inorganic materials. This allows us to explore the nature of phase transitions in these systems, the coupling between order parameters, and their impact on the material's physical properties. We highlight essential contributions to the field, particularly recent progress in the study of chiral phonons, altermagnetism, magnetochirality between others. Despite the rarity of naturally occurring inorganic chiral crystals, this review also highlights a significant knowledge gap, presenting challenges and opportunities for structural chirality mostly at the fundamental level, e.g., chiral displacive phase transitions and ferrochirality, possibilities of tuning and switching structural chirality by external means (electric, magnetic, or strain fields), whether chirality could be an independent order parameter, and whether structural chirality could be quantified, etc. Beyond simply summarising this field of research, this review aims to inspire further research in materials science by addressing future challenges, encouraging the exploration of chirality beyond traditional boundaries, and seeking the development of innovative materials with superior or new properties.</description>

      <title>Electro-Optic Cavities for In-Situ Measurement of Cavity Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cavity electrodynamics offers a unique avenue for tailoring ground-state material properties, excited-state engineering, and versatile control of quantum matter. Merging these concepts with high-field physics in the terahertz (THz) spectral range opens the door to explore low-energy, field-driven cavity electrodynamics, emerging from fundamental resonances or order parameters. Despite this demand, leveraging the full potential of field-driven material control in cavities is hindered by the lack of direct access to the intra-cavity fields. Here, we demonstrate a new concept of active cavities, consisting of electro-optic Fabry-Perot resonators, which measure their intra-cavity electric fields on sub-cycle timescales. We thereby demonstrate quantitative retrieval of the cavity modes in amplitude and phase, over a broad THz frequency range. To enable simultaneous intra-cavity sampling alongside excited-state material control, we design a tunable multi-layer cavity, enabling deterministic design of hybrid cavities for polaritonic systems. Our theoretical models reveal the origin of the avoided crossings embedded in the intricate mode dispersion, and will enable fully-switchable polaritonic effects within arbitrary materials hosted by the hybrid cavity. Electro-optic cavities (EOCs) will therefore serve as integrated probes of light-matter interactions across all coupling regimes, laying the foundation for field-resolved intra-cavity quantum electrodynamics.</description>
