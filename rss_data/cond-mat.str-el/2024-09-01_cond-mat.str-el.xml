      <title>Collapse of susceptibility and non-trivial spin dynamics in the hyper-honeycomb magnet $\beta$-Li$_2$IrO$_3$ under high pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present high-pressure (2 GPa) $^7$Li nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements on single crystals of the hyper-honeycomb Kitaev magnet $\beta$-Li$_2$IrO$_3$. The spectra show evidence for a structural phase transition around 200 K and a coexistence of phases, consistent with the results of other measurement techniques. The NMR spectra and line shift measurements demonstrate a strong suppression of the local magnetic susceptibility at high pressure. However, the spin-lattice relaxation ($1/T_1$) shows a clear power-law temperature dependence. This is inconsistent with a gapped singlet ground state of dimers and tetramers, as was previously proposed, and is instead evocative of a more exotic quantum spin liquid-like ground state.</description>

      <title>Efficient and systematic calculation of arbitrary observables for the matrix product state excitation ansatz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical methods based on matrix product states (MPSs) are currently the de facto standard for calculating the ground state properties of (quasi-)one-dimensional quantum many-body systems. While the properties of the low-lying excitations in such systems are often studied in this MPS framework through _dynamics_ by means of time-evolution simulations, we can also look at their _statics_ by directly calculating eigenstates corresponding to these excitations. The so-called MPS excitation ansatz is a powerful method for finding such eigenstates with a single-particle character in the thermodynamic limit. Although this excitation ansatz has been used quite extensively, a general method for calculating expectation values for these states is lacking in the literature: we aim to fill this gap by presenting a recursive algorithm to calculate arbitrary observables expressed as matrix product operators. This method concisely encapsulates existing methods for -- as well as extensions to -- the excitation ansatz, such as excitations with a larger spatial support and multi-particle excitations, and is robust to handle further innovations. We demonstrate the versatility of our method by studying the low-lying excitations in the spin-1 Heisenberg chain and the one-dimensional Hubbard model, looking at how the excitations converge in the former, while in the latter, we present a novel method of targeting single-particle excitations inside of a continuum by minimizing the energy _variance_ rather than the energy itself. We hope that this technique will foster further advancements with the excitation ansatz.</description>

      <title>Multipolar multiferroics in $4d^2$/$5d^2$ Mott insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize conventional multiferroicity \ -- simultaneous existence of ferroelectric and ferromagnetic orders \ -- to multipolar degrees of freedom, examining its emergence in a $d^2$ Mott insulator with strong spin-orbit and Hund's couplings. Specifically, we investigate the origin of magnetic multipolar interactions in $d^2$ Mott insulators. In addition, we show that an admixture of quadrupolar and octupolar magnetic order simultaneously induces electrical quadrupolar and ferroelectric polarization. Our theoretical formalism extends the multiferroic framework to the higher-order sector, exploring the possibility of coexisting multipolar orders of the same and different ranks. We finally comment on some of the experimental signatures.</description>

      <title>Signatures of polarized chiral spin disproportionation in rare earth nickelates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In rare earth nickelates (RENiO$_3$), electron-lattice coupling drives a concurrent metal-to-insulator and bond disproportionation phase transition whose microscopic origin has long been the subject of active debate. Of several proposed mechanisms, here we test the hypothesis that pairs of self-doped ligand holes spatially condense to provide local spin moments that are antiferromagnetically coupled to Ni spins. These singlet-like states provide a basis for long-range bond and spiral spin order. Using magnetic resonant X-ray scattering on NdNiO$_3$ thin films, we observe the chiral nature of the spin-disproportionated state, with spin spirals propagating along the crystallographic (101)$_\mathrm{ortho}$ direction. These spin spirals are found to preferentially couple to X-ray helicity, establishing the presence of a hitherto-unobserved macroscopic chirality. The presence of this chiral magnetic configuration suggests a potential multiferroic coupling between the noncollinear magnetic arrangement and improper ferroelectric behavior as observed in prior studies on NdNiO$_3$ (101)$_\mathrm{ortho}$ films and RENiO$_3$ single crystals. Experimentally constrained theoretical double-cluster calculations confirm the presence of an energetically stable spin-disproportionated state with Zhang-Rice singlet-like combinations of Ni and ligand moments.</description>

      <title>SOLAX: A Python solver for fermionic quantum systems with neural network support</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerical modeling of fermionic many-body quantum systems presents similar challenges across various research domains, necessitating universal tools, including state-of-the-art machine learning techniques. Here, we introduce SOLAX, a Python library designed to compute and analyze fermionic quantum systems using the formalism of second quantization. SOLAX provides a modular framework for constructing and manipulating basis sets, quantum states, and operators, facilitating the simulation of electronic structures and determining many-body quantum states in finite-size Hilbert spaces. The library integrates machine learning capabilities to mitigate the exponential growth of Hilbert space dimensions in large quantum clusters. The core low-level functionalities are implemented using the recently developed Python library JAX. Demonstrated through its application to the Single Impurity Anderson Model, SOLAX offers a flexible and powerful tool for researchers addressing the challenges of many-body quantum systems across a broad spectrum of fields, including atomic physics, quantum chemistry, and condensed matter physics.</description>

      <title>Structural Evolution from Hyper-Honeycomb to Honeycomb Networks and Superconductivity in LaPt$_x$Si$_{2-x}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the crystal structures and superconductivity (SC) of LaPt$_{x}$Si$_{2-x}$ ($0.5 \leq x \leq 1.0$) that are solid solutions of LaSi$_{2}$ and LaPtSi with centrosymmetric tetragonal ($I4_{1}/amd$, $D_{4h}^{19}$, \#141) and non-centrosymmetric tetragonal ($I4_{1}md$, $C_{4v}^{11}$, \#109) structures, respectively. It was found that at $0.86 \leq x \leq 1.00$, the non-centrosymmetric tetragonal symmetry is preserved, while partial disorder appears in alternating Pt and Si of the hyper-honeycomb network. The superconducting transition temperature $T_{\rm c}$ was drastically reduced from 3.9 K to 1.5 K as $x$ varies from 1.0 to 0.86. Additionally, a hexagonal phase with an AlB$_{2}$-type structure ($P6/mmm$, $D_{6h}^{1}$, \#191) has been discovered at $0.50 \leq x \leq 0.71$ with a honeycomb network of statistically distributed Pt and Si atoms. The hexagonal phase exhibited SC at $T_{\rm c} = 0.38$ K. This system provides an opportunity to investigate the relationship between topological electronic states, SC, and disorders</description>

      <title>Manipulation by magnetic frustration in ferrotoroidal spin chains via curvature and torsion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Geometric effects in curvilinear nanomagnets can enable chiral, anisotropic and even magnetoelectric responses. Here, we study the effects of magnetic frustration in curvilinear (quasi-)1D magnets represented by spin chains arranged along closed space curves of constant torsion. Considering the cases of easy- and hard-axis anisotropy in ferro- and antiferromagnetic samples, we determine their ground states and analyze the related magnetoelectric multipoles. A constant torsion along the chain results in alternating regions of high and low curvature, facilitating the spin spiral state perturbed by the (anti)periodic boundary conditions on the magnetic order parameter. While easy-axis ferromagnetic chains develop a purely toroidal configuration with the magnetic toroidal moment oriented along the geometry symmetry axis, hard-axis antiferromagnetic chains support multiple magnetic toroidal domains. Our findings suggest that tailoring curvature and torsion of a spin chain enables a new physical mechanism for magnetic frustration, which can be observed in the inhomogeneity of the magnetic order parameter and in the local ferrotoroidic responses.</description>

      <title>Magnetic and crystal electric field studies in the rare-earth-based square lattice antiferromagnet NdKNaNbO$_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interplay of magnetic correlations, crystal electric field interactions, and spin-orbit coupling in low-dimensional frustrated magnets fosters novel ground states with unusual excitations. Here, we report the magnetic properties and crystal electric field (CEF) scheme of a rare-earth-based square-lattice antiferromagnet NdKNaNbO$_5$ investigated via magnetization, specific heat, electron spin resonance (ESR), and inelastic neutron scattering (INS) experiments. The low-temperature Curie-Weiss temperature $\theta_{\rm CW} \simeq -0.6$ K implies net antiferromagnetic interactions between the Nd$^{3+}$ ions. Two broad maxima are observed in the low temperature specific heat data in magnetic fields, indicating multilevel Schottky anomalies due to the effect of CEF. No magnetic long-range-order is detected down to 0.4 K. The CEF excitations of Kramers' ion Nd$^{3+}$ ($J=9/2$) probed via INS experiments evince dispersionless excitations characterizing the transitions among the CEF energy levels. The fit of the INS spectra enabled the mapping of the CEF Hamiltonian and the energy eigenvalues of the Kramers' doublets. The simulation using the obtained CEF parameters reproduces the broad maxima in specific heat in zero-field as well as in different applied fields. The significant contribution from $J_z = \pm 1/2$ state to the wave function of the ground state doublet indicates the role of strong quantum fluctuations at low temperatures. The magnetic ground state is found to be a Kramers' doublet with effective spin $J_{\rm eff} = 1/2$ at low temperatures.</description>

      <title>Local Density of States induced near Impurities in Mott Insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:1810.03309v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The local density of states near dopants or impurities has recently been probed by scanning tunneling microscopy in both the parent and very lightly doped compounds of the high-$T_c$ cuprate superconductors. Our calculations based on a slave-rotor description account for all the following key features of the observed local density of states: i) positions and amplitudes of the in-gap spectral weights of a single impurity; ii) the spectral weight transfer from the upper Hubbard band to the lower Hubbard band; iii) the difference between the cases of single and multiple impurities. For multiple impurities, our study explains the complete suppression of spectral weight observed at precisely the Fermi energy and links this property to zeros of the underlying bulk Green's function of the Mott insulating phase.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1909.11896v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel pairing mechanism for electrons, mediated by magnons. These paired bound states are termed ``magnetic doublons''. Applying numerically exact techniques (full diagonalization and the density-matrix renormalization group, DMRG) to the Kondo lattice model at strong exchange coupling $J$ for different fillings and magnetic configurations, we demonstrate that magnetic doublon excitations exist as composite objects with very weak dispersion. They are highly stable, support a novel ``inverse'' colossal magnetoresistance and potentially other effects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.04690v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate quantum order by disorder in a frustrated spin nanotube formed by wrapping a $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg model at 45$^\circ$ around a cylinder. Using Schwinger boson theory and Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG), we have computed the ground-state phase diagram to reveal a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ phase in which collinear spin stripes form a right or left handed helix around the nanotube. We have derived an analytic estimate for the critical $\eta_c=J_1/2J_2$ of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ helical phase transition, which is in agreement with the DMRG results. By evaluating the entanglement spectrum and nonlocal string order parameters we discuss the topology of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-helical phase.</description>

Abstract: TeNPy (short for 'Tensor Network Python') is a python library for the simulation of strongly correlated quantum systems with tensor networks. The philosophy of this library is to achieve a balance of readability and usability for new-comers, while at the same time providing powerful algorithms for experts. The focus is on MPS algorithms for 1D and 2D lattices, such as DMRG ground state search, as well as dynamics using TEBD, TDVP, or MPO evolution. This article is a companion to the recent version 1.0 release of TeNPy and gives a brief overview of the package.</description>

      <title>Enumeration of spin-space groups: Towards a complete description of symmetries of magnetic orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.10371v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symmetries of three-dimensional periodic scalar fields are described by 230 space groups (SGs). Symmetries of three-dimensional periodic (pseudo-) vector fields, however, are described by the spin-space groups (SSGs), which were initially used to describe the symmetries of magnetic orders. In SSGs, the real-space and spin degrees of freedom are unlocked in the sense that an operation could have different spacial and spin rotations. SSGs gives a complete symmetry description of magnetic structures, and have natural applications in the band theory of itinerary electrons in magnetically ordered systems with weak spin-orbit coupling. Altermagnetism, a concept raised recently that belongs to the symmetry-compensated collinear magnetic orders but has non-relativistic spin splitting, is well described by SSGs. Due to the vast number and complicated group structures, SSGs have not yet been systematically enumerated. In this work, we exhaust SSGs based on the invariant subgroups of SGs, with spin operations constructed from three-dimensional (3D) real representations of the quotient groups for the invariant subgroups. For collinear and coplanar magnetic orders, the spin operations can be reduced into lower dimensional real representations. As the number of SSGs is infinite, we only consider SSGs that describe magnetic unit cells up to 12 times crystal unit cells. We obtain 157,289 non-coplanar, 24,788 coplanar-non-collinear, and 1,421 collinear SSGs. The enumerated SSGs are stored in an online database at \url{https://cmpdc.iphy.ac.cn/ssg} with a user-friendly interface. We also develop an algorithm to identify SSG for realistic materials and find SSGs for 1,626 magnetic materials. Our results serve as a solid starting point for further studies of symmetry and topology in magnetically ordered materials.</description>

Abstract: The recent discovery of superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ with $T_\mathrm{c} \simeq 80~\mathrm{K}$ under high pressure opens up a new route to high-$T_\mathrm{c}$ superconductivity. This material realizes a bilayer square lattice model featuring a strong interlayer hybridization unlike many unconventional superconductors. A key question in this regard concerns how electronic correlations driven by the interlayer hybridization affect the low-energy electronic structure and the concomitant superconductivity. Here, we demonstrate using a cluster dynamical mean-field theory that the interlayer electronic correlations (IECs) induce a Lifshitz transition resulting in a change of Fermi surface topology. By solving an appropriate gap equation, we further show that the leading pairing instability, $s \pm$-wave, is enhanced by the IECs. The underlying mechanism is the quenching of a strong ferromagnetic channel, resulting from the Lifshitz transition driven by the IECs. Based on this picture, we provide a possible reason of why superconductivity emerges only under high pressure.</description>

      <title>Improved real-space parallelizable matrix-product state compression and its application to unitary quantum dynamics simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02667v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Towards the efficient simulation of near-term quantum devices using tensor network states, we introduce an improved real-space parallelizable matrix-product state (MPS) compression method. This method enables efficient compression of all virtual bonds in constant time, irrespective of the system size, with controlled accuracy, while it maintains the stability of the wavefunction norm without necessitating sequential renormalization procedures. In addition, we introduce a parallel regauging technique to partially restore the deviated canonical form, thereby improving the accuracy of the simulation in subsequent steps. We further apply this method to simulate unitary quantum dynamics and introduce an improved parallel time-evolving block-decimation (pTEBD) algorithm. We employ the improved pTEBD algorithm for extensive simulations of typical one- and two-dimensional quantum circuits, involving over 1000 qubits. The obtained numerical results unequivocally demonstrate that the improved pTEBD algorithm achieves the same level of simulation precision as the current state-of-the-art MPS algorithm but in polynomially shorter time, exhibiting nearly perfect weak scaling performance on a modern supercomputer.</description>

      <title>Ground-state phase diagram of the SU($4$) Heisenberg model on a plaquette lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05556v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the ground state of the SU($4$) Heisenberg model on a square lattice with spatial anisotropy on each plaquette bond using the tensor-network method based on infinite projected entangled pair states. We find that the SU($4$) singlet ground state appears in the strongly anisotropic limit, whereas N\'eel and valence-bond crystal orders coexist in the nearly isotropic limit. By examining the intermediate parameter region, we identify a phase transition between these phases. The nature of the phase transition is likely to be of first order, and the transition point is estimated to be around $J'/J\approx 0.85(5)$, where $J$ and $J'$ are the interaction strengths of intra- and interplaquette bonds, respectively. We also calculate the anisotropy dependence of singlet correlations on a plaquette bond, which will be useful for future experiments of ultracold atoms in optical lattices.</description>
