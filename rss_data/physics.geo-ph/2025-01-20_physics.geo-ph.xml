      <title>Calibration of the Polarimetric GNSS-R Sensor in the Rongowai Mission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polarimetric GNSS-R systems, equipped with an additional polarization channel, offer enhanced capabilities for separating vegetation and surface scattering effects, thereby improving GNSS-R land remote sensing applications such as soil moisture retrieval in vegetated and forested areas and biomass estimation. However, the effectiveness of these applications relies on accurate calibration of the polarimetric GNSS-R sensor. In the Rongowai mission, a newly developed Next Generation GNSS-R Receiver (NGRx) is installed on a domestic Air New Zealand airplane to collect data during its commercial flights. The NGRx processes multi-GNSS satellite signals simultaneously and utilizes a dual-channel (LHCP and RHCP) antenna, thereby improving spatial coverage and retrieval accuracy. The dual-polarized antenna also provides the possibility to examine the polarimetric GNSS-R system. In this article, a new methodology is developed to calibrate the Level-1 power measurement and the on-board antenna cross-pol gain by comparing measurements from inland lakes and ocean with modeled results. The calibration results in a 34% decrease in the uncertainty in co-pol reflectivity retrieval. The retrieved cross-pol and co-pol reflectivity after calibration are examined by their statistical distribution and spatial mapping with 1.5 km resolution, with multi-land surface types and incidence angles. These results validate the effectiveness of the calibration method and pave the way for future terrestrial science applications.</description>

      <title>Improved methodology for deep aquifer characterization using hydrogeological, self-potential, and magnetotellurics data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.10083v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Estimating subsurface properties like hydraulic conductivity using hydrogeological data alone is challenging in field sites with sparse wells. Geophysical data, including Self-potential (SP) and Magnetotelluric (MT), can improve understanding of hydrogeological structures and interpolate data between wells. However, determining hydraulic conductivity requires a proper petrophysical relationship between hydraulic conductivity and inferred geophysical properties, which may not exist or be unique. In this work, we propose a joint-inversion approach without assuming petrophysical relationships, using self-potential data to connect groundwater flow velocity to electrical potential differences, and MT data to estimate hydraulic conductivity and electrical conductivity. A spectral method is employed for the self-potential forward problem. To accelerate joint data inversion, a dimension reduction technique through the Principal Component Geostatistical Approach is used. The applicability and robustness of the joint-inversion method are demonstrated through inversion tests using hydrogeophysical data sets generated from subsurface models with and without petrophysical relationships. The joint hydraulic head-SP-MT data inversion can reasonably estimate hydraulic conductivity and electrical resistivity, even without knowledge of a one-to-one petrophysical relationship. On average, joint inversion yields a 25% improvement in hydraulic conductivity estimates compared to single data-type inversion. Our proposed joint inversion approach, with SP-data compensating for the absence of a known petrophysical relationship, provided close agreement with joint inversion of head and MT data using a known petrophysical relationship. Successful inversion tests demonstrate the usefulness of SP data in connecting hydrogeological properties and geophysical data without requiring a petrophysical relationship.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Event Categorization Matrix Approach for Explosion Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18227v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current efforts to correctly categorize natural events from suspected explosion sources with data that is collected by ground- or space-based sensors presents historical challenges that remain unaddressed by the Event Categorization Matrix (ECM) model. Smaller historical events (lower yield explosions) often include only sparse observations among few modalities and can therefore lack a complete set of discriminants. The covariance structures can also vary significantly between such observations of event (source-type) categories. Both obstacles are problematic for the ``classic'' Event Categorization Matrix model. Our work addresses this gap and presents a Bayesian update to the previous Event Categorization Matrix model, termed the Bayesian Event Categorization Matrix model, which can be trained on partial observations and does not rely on a pooled covariance structure. We further augment the Event Categorization Matrix model with Bayesian Decision Theory so that false negative or false positive rates of an event categorization can be reduced in an intuitive manner. To demonstrate improved categorization rates for the Bayesian Event Categorization Matrix model, we compare an array of Bayesian and classic models with multiple performance metrics using Monte Carlo experiments. We use both synthetic and real data. Our Bayesian models show consistent gains in overall accuracy and a lower false negative rates relative to the classic Event Categorization Matrix model. We propose future avenues to improve Bayesian Event Categorization Matrix models for further improving decision-making and predictive capability.</description>
