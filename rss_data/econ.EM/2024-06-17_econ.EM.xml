      <title>EM Estimation of Conditional Matrix Variate $t$ Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conditional matrix variate student $t$ distribution was introduced by Battulga (2024a). In this paper, we propose a new version of the conditional matrix variate student $t$ distribution. The paper provides EM algorithms, which estimate parameters of the conditional matrix variate student $t$ distributions, including general cases and special cases with Minnesota prior.</description>

      <title>Resilience of international oil trade networks under extreme event shock-recovery simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the frequent occurrence of black swan events, global energy security situation has become increasingly complex and severe. Assessing the resilience of the international oil trade network (iOTN) is crucial for evaluating its ability to withstand extreme shocks and recover thereafter, ensuring energy security. We overcomes the limitations of discrete historical data by developing a simulation model for extreme event shock-recovery in the iOTNs. We introduce network efficiency indicator to measure oil resource allocation efficiency and evaluate network performance. Then, construct a resilience index to explore the resilience of the iOTNs from dimensions of resistance and recoverability. Our findings indicate that extreme events can lead to sharp declines in performance of the iOTNs, especially when economies with significant trading positions and relations suffer shocks. The upward trend in recoverability and resilience reflects the self-organizing nature of the iOTNs, demonstrating its capacity for optimizing its own structure and functionality. Unlike traditional energy security research based solely on discrete historical data or resistance indicators, our model evaluates resilience from multiple dimensions, offering insights for global energy governance systems while providing diverse perspectives for various economies to mitigate risks and uphold energy security.</description>

      <title>Impact of the Availability of ChatGPT on Software Development: A Synthetic Difference in Differences Estimation using GitHub Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advancements in Artificial Intelligence, particularly with ChatGPT, have significantly impacted software development. Utilizing novel data from GitHub Innovation Graph, we hypothesize that ChatGPT enhances software production efficiency. Utilizing natural experiments where some governments banned ChatGPT, we employ Difference-in-Differences (DID), Synthetic Control (SC), and Synthetic Difference-in-Differences (SDID) methods to estimate its effects. Our findings indicate a significant positive impact on the number of git pushes, repositories, and unique developers per 100,000 people, particularly for high-level, general purpose, and shell scripting languages. These results suggest that AI tools like ChatGPT can substantially boost developer productivity, though further analysis is needed to address potential downsides such as low quality code and privacy concerns.</description>

      <title>Treatment Effects in Market Equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.11647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.11647v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Policy-relevant treatment effect estimation in a marketplace setting requires taking into account both the direct benefit of the treatment and any spillovers induced by changes to the market equilibrium. The standard way to address these challenges is to evaluate interventions via cluster-randomized experiments, where each cluster corresponds to an isolated market. This approach, however, cannot be used when we only have access to a single market (or a small number of markets). Here, we show how to identify and estimate policy-relevant treatment effects using a unit-level randomized trial run within a single large market. A standard Bernoulli-randomized trial allows consistent estimation of direct effects, and of treatment heterogeneity measures that can be used for welfare-improving targeting. Estimating spillovers - as well as providing confidence intervals for the direct effect - requires estimates of price elasticities, which we provide using an augmented experimental design. Our results rely on all spillovers being mediated via the (observed) prices of a finite number of traded goods, and the market power of any single unit decaying as the market gets large. We illustrate our results using a simulation calibrated to a conditional cash transfer experiment in the Philippines.</description>

      <title>Consider or Choose? The Role and Power of Consideration Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.04354v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consideration sets play a crucial role in discrete choice modeling, where customers are commonly assumed to go through a two-stage decision making process. Specifically, customers are assumed to form consideration sets in the first stage and then use a second-stage choice mechanism to pick the product with the highest utility from the consideration sets. Recent studies mostly aim to propose more powerful choice mechanisms based on advanced non-parametric models to improve prediction accuracy. In contrast, this paper takes a step back from exploring more complex second-stage choice mechanisms and instead focus on how effectively we can model customer choice relying only on the first-stage consideration set formation. To this end, we study a class of nonparametric choice models that is only specified by a distribution over consideration sets and has a bounded rationality interpretation. We denote it as the consideration set model. Intriguingly, we show that this class of choice models can be characterized by the axiom of symmetric demand cannibalization, which enables complete statistical identification. We further consider the model's downstream assortment planning as an application. We first present an exact description of the optimal assortment, proving that it is revenue-ordered based on the blocks defined by the consideration sets. Despite this compelling structure, we establish that the assortment optimization problem under this model is NP-hard even to approximate. This result shows that accounting for consideration sets in the model inevitably results in inapproximability in assortment planning, even though the consideration set model uses the simplest possible uniform second-stage choice mechanism. Finally, using a real-world dataset, we show the tremendous power of the first-stage consideration sets when modeling customers' decision-making processes.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous Treatment Effects and Causal Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01566v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The credibility revolution advances the use of research designs that permit identification and estimation of causal effects. However, understanding which mechanisms produce measured causal effects remains a challenge. A dominant current approach to the quantitative evaluation of mechanisms relies on the detection of heterogeneous treatment effects with respect to pre-treatment covariates. This paper develops a framework to understand when the existence of such heterogeneous treatment effects can support inferences about the activation of a mechanism. We show first that this design cannot provide evidence of mechanism activation without an additional, generally implicit, assumption. Further, even when this assumption is satisfied, if a measured outcome is produced by a non-linear transformation of a directly-affected outcome of theoretical interest, heterogeneous treatment effects are not informative of mechanism activation. We provide novel guidance for interpretation and research design in light of these findings.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Real-time Coupon Allocation in the Online Platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05987v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditionally, firms have offered coupons to customer groups at predetermined discount rates. However, advancements in machine learning and the availability of abundant customer data now enable platforms to provide real-time customized coupons to individuals. In this study, we partner with Meituan, a leading shopping platform, to develop a real-time, end-to-end coupon allocation system that is fast and effective in stimulating demand while adhering to marketing budgets when faced with uncertain traffic from a diverse customer base. Leveraging comprehensive customer and product features, we estimate Conversion Rates (CVR) under various coupon values and employ isotonic regression to ensure the monotonicity of predicted CVRs with respect to coupon value. Using calibrated CVR predictions as input, we propose a Lagrangian Dual-based algorithm that efficiently determines optimal coupon values for each arriving customer within 50 milliseconds. We theoretically and numerically investigate the model performance under parameter misspecifications and apply a control loop to adapt to real-time updated information, thereby better adhering to the marketing budget. Finally, we demonstrate through large-scale field experiments and observational data that our proposed coupon allocation algorithm outperforms traditional approaches in terms of both higher conversion rates and increased revenue. As of May 2024, Meituan has implemented our framework to distribute coupons to over 100 million users across more than 110 major cities in China, resulting in an additional CNY 8 million in annual profit. We demonstrate how to integrate a machine learning prediction model for estimating customer CVR, a Lagrangian Dual-based coupon value optimizer, and a control system to achieve real-time coupon delivery while dynamically adapting to random customer arrival patterns.</description>
