      <title>Constructing and explaining machine learning models for chemistry: example of the exploration and design of boron-based Lewis acids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of machine learning (ML) into chemistry offers transformative potential in the design of molecules. However, the focus has often been on creating highly efficient predictive models, sometimes at the expense of interpretability. We leverage explainable AI techniques to explore the design of boron-based Lewis acids, which play a pivotal role in organic reactions. Using Fluoride Ion Affinity as a proxy for Lewis acidity, we developed interpretable ML models based on chemically meaningful descriptors, including ab initio features and substituent-based parameters. By constraining the chemical space to well-defined molecular scaffolds, we achieved highly accurate predictions, surpassing conventional black-box deep learning models in low-data regime. Interpretability analyses of the models unraveled the origin of Lewis acidity in these compounds and identified actionable levers to modulate it. This work bridges ML and chemist's way of thinking, demonstrating how explainable models can inspire molecular design and enhance scientific understanding of chemical reactivity.</description>

      <title>Treatment of Thermal Non-Equilibrium Dissociation Rates: Application to $\rm H_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a detailed description of the thermochemical non-equilibrium dissociation of diatomic molecules, and applies this theory to the case of $\rm H_2$ dissociation. The master equations are used to derive corresponding aggregate rate constant expressions that hold for any degree of thermochemical non-equilibrium. These general expressions are analyzed in three key limits/ regimes: the thermal equilibrium limit, the quasi-steady-state (QSS) regime, and the pre-QSS regime. Under several simplifying assumptions, an analytical source term expression that holds in all of these regimes, and is only a function of the translational temperature, $T_{\rm t}$, and the fraction of dissociation, $\phi_{\rm A}$, is proposed. This expression has two input parameters: the QSS dissociation rate constant in the absence of recombination, $k_{\rm d,nr}(T_{\rm t})$, and a pre-QSS correction factor, $\eta(T_{\rm t})$. The value of $\eta(T_{\rm t})$ is evaluated by comparing the predictions of the proposed expression against existing master equation simulations of a 0-D isothermal and isochoric reactor for the case of $\rm H_2$ dissociation with the third-bodies $\rm H_2$, $\rm H$, and $\rm He$. Despite its simple functional form, the proposed expression is able to reproduce the master equation results for the majority of the tested conditions. The best fit of $k_{\rm d,nr}(T_{\rm t})$ is then evaluated by conducting a detailed literature review. Data from a wide range of experimental and computational studies are considered for the third-bodies $\rm H_2$, $\rm H$, and inert gases, and fits that are valid from 200 to 20,000 K are proposed. From this review, the uncertainty of the proposed fits are estimated to be less than a factor of two.</description>

      <title>QuantumBind-RBFE: Accurate Relative Binding Free Energy Calculations Using Neural Network Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of protein-ligand binding affinities is crucial in drug discovery, particularly during hit-to-lead and lead optimization phases, however, limitations in ligand force fields continue to impact prediction accuracy. In this work, we validate relative binding free energy (RBFE) accuracy using neural network potentials (NNPs) for the ligands. We utilize a novel NNP model, AceForce 1.0, based on the TensorNet architecture for small molecules that broadens the applicability to diverse drug-like compounds, including all important chemical elements and supporting charged molecules. Using established benchmarks, we show overall improved accuracy and correlation in binding affinity predictions compared with GAFF2 for molecular mechanics and ANI2-x for NNPs. Slightly less accuracy but comparable correlations with OPLS4. We also show that we can run the NNP simulations at 2 fs timestep, at least two times larger than previous NNP models, providing significant speed gains. The results show promise for further evolutions of free energy calculations using NNPs while demonstrating its practical use already with the current generation. The code and NNP model are publicly available for research use.</description>

      <title>Dissociation of Adsorbates via Electronic Energy Transfer from Aromatic Thin Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photofragment translational spectroscopy has been used to characterize the photodissociation of CH$_3$I and CF$_3$I adsorbed on thin films of a variety of aromatic molecules, initiated by near-UV light. Thin films (nominally 10 monolayers) of benzene, five substituted benzenes and two naphthalenes have been employed to study systematic changes in the photochemical activity. Illumination of these systems with 248nm light is found to result in a dissociation process for the CH$_3$I and CF$_3$I mediated by initial absorption in the aromatic thin film, followed by electronic energy transfer (EET) to the dissociating species. The effective cross sections for dissociation are found to be substantially increased via this mechanism, by amounts that differ depending on the aromatic molecule thin film used, and is connected to the aromatic photabsorption profile. Distinctive translational energy distributions for the CH$_3$ and CF$_3$ photofragments are found to vary systematically for the different aromatic molecule thin film used, and are related to the aromatic molecule excited states. The CH$_3$ and CF$_3$ photofragment kinetic energy distributions found for the aromatic thin films suggest that the dissociation occurs via EET to the $^3Q_1$ excited state of CH$_3$I and CF$_3$I.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unlike conventional thought, the H-O bond is flexible, instead, and sensitive to perturbation. This exercise empowers the electron and phonon spectroscopies with the Tight-binding approach, enabling a referential database to synchronically quantize the relaxation and flexibility of these identities for substances involving the H-O bond during phonon spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>C$_{60}$ building blocks with tuneable structures for tailored functionalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that C$_{60}$ fullerene molecules can serve as promising building blocks in the construction of versatile crystal structures with unique symmetries using first-principles calculations. These phases include quasi-2D layered structures and 3D van der Waals crystals where the molecules adopt varied orientations. The interplay of molecular arrangement and lattice symmetry results in a variety of tuneable crystal structures with distinct properties. Specifically, the electronic structures of these phases vary significantly, offering potential for fine-tuning the band gap for electronics and optoelectronics. Additionally, the optical properties of these materials are strongly influenced by their crystalline symmetry and molecular alignment, providing avenues for tailoring optical responses for photonics. Our findings highlight the potential of fullerene-based building blocks in the rational design of functional materials.</description>

      <title>Linear Scaling Calculation of Atomic Forces and Energies with Machine Learning Local Density Matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately calculating energies and atomic forces with linear-scaling methods is a crucial approach to accelerating and improving molecular dynamics simulations. In this paper, we introduce HamGNN-DM, a machine learning model designed to predict atomic forces and energies using local density matrices in molecular dynamics simulations. This approach achieves efficient predictions with a time complexity of O(n), making it highly suitable for large-scale systems. Experiments in different systems demonstrate that HamGNN-DM achieves DFT-level precision in predicting the atomic forces in different system sizes, which is vital for the molecular dynamics. Furthermore, this method provides valuable electronic structure information throughout the dynamics and exhibits robust performance.</description>

      <title>Trapped-Ion Quantum Simulation of Electron Transfer Models with Tunable Dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10368v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electron transfer is at the heart of many fundamental physical, chemical, and biochemical processes essential for life. The exact simulation of these reactions is often hindered by the large number of degrees of freedom and by the essential role of quantum effects. Here, we experimentally simulate a paradigmatic model of molecular electron transfer using a multispecies trapped-ion crystal, where the donor-acceptor gap, the electronic and vibronic couplings, and the bath relaxation dynamics can all be controlled independently. By manipulating both the ground-state and optical qubits, we observe the real-time dynamics of the spin excitation, measuring the transfer rate in several regimes of adiabaticity and relaxation dynamics. Our results provide a testing ground for increasingly rich models of molecular excitation transfer processes that are relevant for molecular electronics and light-harvesting systems.</description>

      <title>A Bayesian Flow Network Framework for Chemistry Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20294v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce ChemBFN, a language model that handles chemistry tasks based on Bayesian flow networks working on discrete data. A new accuracy schedule is proposed to improve the sampling quality by significantly reducing the reconstruction loss. We show evidence that our method is appropriate for generating molecules with satisfied diversity even when a smaller number of sampling steps is used. A classifier-free guidance method is adapted for conditional generation. It is also worthwhile to point out that after generative training, our model can be fine-tuned on regression and classification tasks with the state-of-the-art performance, which opens the gate of building all-in-one models in a single module style. Our model has been open sourced at https://github.com/Augus1999/bayesian-flow-network-for-chemistry.</description>

      <title>Entropy stabilized form chirality in curved rod nematics: structure and symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13325v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Monte Carlo molecular simulations of curve-shaped rods show the propensity of such shapes to polymorphism revealing both smectic and polar nematic phases. The nematic exhibits a nanoscale modulated local structure characterized by a unique, polar, $\rm{C}_2$-symmetry axis that tightly spirals generating a mirror-symmetry-breaking orgnization of the achiral rods=form chirality. A comprehensive characterization of the polarity and its symmetries in the nematic phase confirms that the nanoscale modulation is distinct from the elastic deformations of a uniaxial nematic director in the twist-bend nematic phase. Instead it is shown that, analogous to the isotropic-to-nematic transition, entropy stabilizes the roto-translating polar director in the polar-twisted nematic phase. The conflation of macroscale form chirality in ferroelectric nematics with that in the twist-bend nematic stems from the misattribution of the nanoscale modulation in the lower temperature nematic ''$\rm{N_X}$ phase'' found in CB7CB dimers.</description>

      <title>Reflections from the 2024 Large Language Model (LLM) Hackathon for Applications in Materials Science and Chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15221v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Here, we present the outcomes from the second Large Language Model (LLM) Hackathon for Applications in Materials Science and Chemistry, which engaged participants across global hybrid locations, resulting in 34 team submissions. The submissions spanned seven key application areas and demonstrated the diverse utility of LLMs for applications in (1) molecular and material property prediction; (2) molecular and material design; (3) automation and novel interfaces; (4) scientific communication and education; (5) research data management and automation; (6) hypothesis generation and evaluation; and (7) knowledge extraction and reasoning from scientific literature. Each team submission is presented in a summary table with links to the code and as brief papers in the appendix. Beyond team results, we discuss the hackathon event and its hybrid format, which included physical hubs in Toronto, Montreal, San Francisco, Berlin, Lausanne, and Tokyo, alongside a global online hub to enable local and virtual collaboration. Overall, the event highlighted significant improvements in LLM capabilities since the previous year's hackathon, suggesting continued expansion of LLMs for applications in materials science and chemistry research. These outcomes demonstrate the dual utility of LLMs as both multipurpose models for diverse machine learning tasks and platforms for rapid prototyping custom applications in scientific research.</description>
