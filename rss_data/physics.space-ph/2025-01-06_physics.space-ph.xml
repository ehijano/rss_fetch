      <title>Superstrong magnetic fields in sunspot bipolar light bridges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent solar observations of bipolar light bridges (BLBs) in sunspots have, in a few individual cases, revealed magnetic fields up to 8.2 kG, which is at least twice as strong as typical values measured in sunspot umbrae. However, the small number of such observations hinted that such strong fields in these bright photospheric features that separate two opposite-polarity umbrae, are a rare phenomenon. We determine the field strength in a large sample of BLBs with the aim of establishing how prevalent such strong fields are in BLBs. We apply a state-of-the-art inversion technique that accounts for the degradation of the data by the intrinsic point spread function of the telescope, to the so far largest set of spectropolarimetric observations, by Hinode/Solar Optical Telescope spectropolarimeter, of sunspots containing BLBs. We identified 98 individual BLBs within 51 distinct sunspot groups. Since 66.3% of the BLBs were observed multiple times, a total of 630 spectropolarimetric scans of these 98 BLBs were analysed. All analysed BLBs contain magnetic fields stronger than 4.5 kG at unit optical depth. The field strengths decrease faster with height than the fields in umbrae and penumbrae. BLBs display a unique continuum intensity and field strength combination, forming a population well separated from umbrae and the penumbrae. The high brightness of BLBs in spite of their very strong magnetic fields points to the presence of a so far largely unexplored regime of magnetoconvection.</description>

      <title>Continuous In-Situ and Remote Sun Observation for Space Weather Monitoring and Mitigation of Infrastructure Threats Through an Optimized Heliocentric Satellite Constellation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07777v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although vital for life on Earth, solar activity poses questions and increasing threats to humanity due to the Sun's unknown dynamics, intensified by our dependence on terrestrial and space-based infrastructure. This situation is compounded by significant gaps in our understanding of space weather phenomena, the Sun's magnetic field, and the need for rapid responses to unpredicted solar events. To address these issues, an optimized heliocentric satellite constellation is proposed that leverages satellites in an Elliptical Walker Constellation. This system offers (among others) equally distributed arguments of periapsis separations and cross-coupled true anomalies with respect to the Sun-centric coordinate frame. In this paper it is also demonstrated that this strategic multi-spacecraft configuration makes it possible to distinguish spatial and temporal changes in solar wind phenomena, reconstruct, in 3D, Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs), predict which space or ground-based infrastructure and when it will be affected by CMEs, maintain continuous coverage of the critical Sun-Earth line throughout the mission's duration, and protect future missions by providing simultaneously in-situ and remote measurements from small and cost-effective satellites.</description>
