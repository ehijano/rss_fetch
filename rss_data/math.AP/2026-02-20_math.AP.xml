      <title>Self-similar extinction for a fast diffusion equation with weighted absorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finite time extinction of any bounded solution to the fast diffusion equation with spatially inhomogeneous absorption $$ \partial_tu=\Delta u^m-|x|^{\sigma}u^p, \quad (x,t)\in\mathbb{R}^N\times(0,\infty), $$ with $N\geq1$ and exponents $$ p&gt;1, \quad m_c=\frac{(N-2)_+}{N}&lt;m&lt;1, \quad \sigma&gt;\sigma_*:=\frac{2(p-1)}{1-m}, $$ is established. Moreover, the existence of self-similar solutions of the form $$ U(x,t)=(T-t)^{\alpha}f(|x|(T-t)^{\beta}), \quad \alpha=\frac{\sigma+2}{(1-m)(\sigma-\sigma_*)}, \ \beta=\frac{p-m}{(1-m)(\sigma-\sigma_*)}, $$ with $f(0)&gt;0$, $f'(0)=0$ and $$ \lim\limits_{\xi\to\infty}\xi^{(\sigma+2)/(p-m)}f(\xi)=L\in(0,\infty). $$ is proved, together with some unbounded self-similar solutions as well. The property of finite time extinction is in striking contrast to the standard fast diffusion equation with absorption (that is, $\sigma=0$), where the strict positivity of solutions for any $t\in(0,\infty)$ is well-known.</description>

      <title>Divergence-form equations admitting nowhere $C^1$ Lipschitz weak solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a class of partial differential equations in divergence form that admit highly irregular Lipschitz weak solutions. By reformulating these divergence-form equations as a first-order partial differential relation and adapting the convex integration scheme recently developed in \cite{GKY26} for irregular diffusion equations, we show that the same structural Condition~$O_N$ introduced there also ensures the existence of Lipschitz weak solutions that are nowhere $C^1$ for the corresponding time-independent equations in bounded domains, under suitable boundary data. In particular, for the smooth strongly polyconvex functions on $\mathbb{R}^{2\times n}$ constructed in that paper for all $n \ge 2$, the associated Euler--Lagrange equations admit Lipschitz weak solutions that are nowhere $C^1$ and satisfy zero boundary conditions in any bounded domain of $\mathbb{R}^n$. Our approach relies on new building blocks constructed from the same wave cone and $\mathcal{T}_N$-configurations employed in the analysis of diffusion equations.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic stability of symmetric flows with viscous inflow boundary condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the two-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in a channel $\Omega=(0,L)\times(0,H)$ with small viscosity $\varepsilon\ll1$, an $\varepsilon$-Navier slip condition on the horizontal walls, and a viscous inflow condition for the perturbation stream function. For a broad class of symmetric base profiles $u_0(y)$ vanishing on the walls, we construct an exact steady solution $(u_s,v_s)$ that is $O(\varepsilon^{1/3})$-close to the shear $(u_0,0)$. We then develop a new weighted vorticity energy method to prove uniform linear stability and enhanced dissipation: perturbations decay exponentially in a weighted $L^2$ norm on the time scale $O(\varepsilon^{-1/3})$. In the short-channel regime $L\ll1$, the method yields nonlinear asymptotic stability with threshold $O(\varepsilon^{2/3})$. In the long-channel regime, assuming concavity together with a spectral condition, we introduce a quantity \textit{Rayleigh vorticity} to control the non-favorable terms and obtain nonlinear stability with threshold $O(\varepsilon^{5/6+})$.</description>

      <title>On sliding methods for mixed local and nonlocal equations and Gibbons' conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate elliptic and parabolic equations involving mixed local and nonlocal operators of the form $(-\Delta)^s-\Delta$, as well as their parabolic counterparts with both the Marchaud fractional time derivative and the classical first-order derivative.
  A major difficulty in this setting stems from the coexistence of operators with different nonlocal structures and incompatible scaling properties, which obstruct the direct use of classical sliding methods. To address this issue, we develop a refined sliding method suited to mixed local-nonlocal operators. As key technical ingredients, we establish new generalized weighted average inequalities, narrow region principles, and maximum principles in bounded and unbounded domains.
  These tools enable us to derive monotonicity and one-dimensional symmetry results for mixed elliptic equations in bounded domains, half-spaces, and the whole space, and to extend the analysis to parabolic equations with mixed time derivatives. As an application, we resolve the Gibbons' conjecture for a class of mixed fractional equations.</description>

      <title>Landau-de Gennes Energy with Weak Planar Anchoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study global minimizers of the Landau-de Gennes energy for the nematic liquid crystals in simply connected, bounded, smooth domains of dimension 3, subject to a weak planar anchoring. The boundary condition is degenerate. In the regime where the elastic constant tends to zero and the temperature is below the nematic-isotropic transition threshold, the bulk and surface energy enforce the energy minimizers to be uniaxial, with director fields lying in the tangent plane to the boundary in the sense of trace. We establish that the singular set of the limiting minimizer within the closure of the domain is a finite set by studying the associated harmonic map with a strong tangential boundary constraint. The structure of the singularities located on the boundary is also investigated.</description>

      <title>Derivation of variational membrane models in the context of anisotropic nonlocal hyperelasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the analysis of thin structures, we study the variational dimension reduction of hyperelastic energies involving nonlocal gradients to an effective membrane model. When rescaling the thin domain, isotropic interaction ranges naturally become anisotropic, leading to the development of a theory for anisotropic nonlocal gradients with direction-dependent interaction ranges. Unlike existing nonlocal derivatives with finite horizon, which are defined via interaction kernels supported on balls of positive radius, our formulation is based on ellipsoidal interaction regions whose principal radii may vanish independently. This yields a unified framework that interpolates between fully nonlocal, partially nonlocal, and purely local models. Employing these tools, we present a $\Gamma$-convergence analysis for the nonlocal thin-film energies. The limit functional retains the structural form of the classical membrane energy, and the classical local model is recovered precisely when all interaction radii vanish.</description>

      <title>Instability of two-pulse periodic waves with long wavelength in some Hamiltonian PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider quasilinear generalizations of the Korteweg-de Vries equation and dispersive perturbations of the Euler equations for compressible fluids, either in Lagrangian or in Eulerian coordinates. In particular, our framework includes hydrodynamic formulation of the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations. The periodic waves we study exhibit on each period two pulses, one converging to a bright soliton and one converging to a dark soliton, when wavelength goes to infinity. We show that such waves, for sufficiently large periods, are spectrally unstable. To do so, we combine two approaches. The first one is to calculate the asymptotic expansion of the Hessian matrix of the action integral and concludes using arXiv:1505.01382 as in arXiv:1710.03936 . This shows instability when both limiting solitary waves are stable. The second approach studies the convergence of the spectrum when the period goes to infinity and is applied in remaining cases, when one of the solitary waves is unstable. To carry out the latter, we prove the convergence of an appropriate renormalization of the periodic Evans function as in arXiv:1802.02830 .</description>

      <title>Asymptotic analysis for heterogeneous elastic energies with material voids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the effective behavior of heterogeneous energies arising in the modeling of material voids in geometrically linear elastic materials. Specifically, we consider functionals featuring bulk terms depending on the symmetrized gradient of the displacement and terms comparable to the surface area of the material voids inside the material. Under suitable growth conditions for the bulk and surface densities we prove that, as the microscale $\varepsilon$ tends to zero, the $\Gamma$-limit admits an integral representation that contains an additional surface term expressed by jump discontinuities of the displacement outside of the void region. This term is related to the phenomenon of collapsing of voids in the effective limit. Under a continuity assumption of the surface density at the $\varepsilon$-scale, we show that the limiting density related to jumps is twice the energy density for voids.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Maximal $L^p$-regularity Estimates for a Hypoelliptic Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the maximal regularity of a specific Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equation $\mathcal{A}u=f$ in the Euclidean space. The operator $\mathcal{A}=\Delta_{y}u-y\cdot \nabla_x{u}$ is an example of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck operators. We prove the existence of a solution that satisfies the anisotropic maximal regularity estimates. To prove this we also show a similar estimates and a weak (1, 1) estimate for $L=\partial_t-\mathcal{A}$, which is of independent interest. These results rely on the pointwise estimates of the fundamental solution of $L$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we characterize the wave front sets of solutions to fractional Schr\"{o}dinger equations \(i\partial_{t}u =(-\Delta)^{\theta/2}u + V(x)u\)
  with $0&lt;\theta &lt;2$ via the wave packet transform (short-time Fourier transform). We clarify the relationship between the order \(\theta\) of the fractional Laplacian and the growth rate of the potential in the problem of propagation of singularities. In particular, we present a theorem that bridges the propagation mechanisms of singularities for the Schr\"odinger and wave equations.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the optimization of the lowest eigenvalue of the magnetic Steklov problem on planar domains. In the bounded domain setting and for magnetic fields of moderate strengths, we prove that among all simply-connected smooth domains of given area, the disk maximises the lowest magnetic Steklov eigenvalue. For exterior domains, we establish a similar isoperimetric inequality for magnetic fields of moderate strength under fixed perimeter constraint and additional geometric and symmetry assumptions. The proofs rely on the method of torsion-type trial functions in the bounded domain case and on the method of trial functions dependent only on the distance to the boundary in the exterior domain case.</description>

      <title>Construction of two-bubble blow-up solutions for the mass-critical gKdV equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the mass-critical generalized Korteweg-de Vries equation, $$ \partial_{t}u+\partial_{x}\left( \partial_{x}^{2}u+u^{5}\right)=0,\quad (t,x)\in [0,\infty)\times \mathbb{R}.$$ We prove the existence of a global solution that blows up in infinite time and approaches the sum of two decoupled bubbles with opposite signs. The proof is inspired by the techniques developed for the two-dimensional mass-critical NLS equation in a similar context by Martel-Rapha\"el [37]. The main difficulty originates from the fact that the unstable directions related to scaling are excited by the nonlinear interactions. To overcome this difficulty, a refined approximate solution that involves some non-localized profiles is needed. In particular, a sharp understanding for the interactions between solitons and such profiles is also required.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.17570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider hypothetical solutions of 3D Euler which blow up in finite time in a self-similar fashion. We prove that if the initial data has finite kinetic energy, then the similarity exponent $\gamma$ which governs the rate of zooming in must be larger than $2/5$. If a smooth globally self-similar blowup profile exists, and this profile satisfies an outgoing property, we prove that $\gamma \geq 1/2$. For axisymmetric solutions, we establish the bound $\gamma\geq 1/2$ in more general settings, including ones in which the outgoing property is not present.</description>

Abstract: We consider a tagged particle in mean field interaction with a free gas of density N at equilibrium. In dimensions $d\geq4$, we prove the convergence of its trajectory, as N goes to infinity, to the one of a diffusion process associated with the linear Landau equation. The proof of the convergence of the martingale problem relies on two key ingredients: long time stability results of the microscopic dynamics, and controls on the probability of particle recollisions.</description>

      <title>Product Hardy Spaces on Spaces of Homogeneous Type: Discrete Product Calder\'on-Type Reproducing Formula, Atomic Characterization, and Product Calder\'on--Zygmund Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $i\in\{1,2\}$ and $X_i$ be a space of homogeneous type in the sense of Coifman and Weiss with the upper dimension $\omega_i$. Also let $\eta_i$ be the smoothness index of the Auscher--Hyt\"onen wavelet function $\psi^{k_i}_{\alpha_i}$ on $X_i$. In this article, for any $p\in(\max\{\frac{\omega_1}{\omega_1+\eta_1},\frac{\omega_2}{\omega_2+\eta_2}\}, 1]$, by regarding the product Carleson measure space $\mathrm{CMO}^p_{L^2}(X_1\times X_2)$ as the test function space and its dual space $(\mathrm{CMO}^p_{L^2}(X_1\times X_2))'$ as the corresponding distribution space, we introduce the product Hardy space $H^p(X_1\times X_2)$ in terms of wavelet coefficients. Moreover, we establish an atomic characterization of this product Hardy space and, as an application, obtain a criterion for the boundedness of linear operators from product Hardy spaces to corresponding Lebesgue spaces. To escape the wavelet reproducing formula, which is not useful for this atomic characterization because the wavelets have no bounded support, we establish a new discrete product Calder\'on-type reproducing formula, which holds in the product Hardy space and has bounded support. This reproducing formula also leads to the boundedness of product Calder\'on--Zygmund operators on the product Hardy space.</description>

      <title>Smoothing on $L^1$ for ground state transformed semigroups in non-local settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the $L^1$-smoothing properties for a broad class of semigroups arising from the ground state transformation of Schr\"odinger semigroups with confining potentials associated with non-local L\'evy operators, for which (asymptotic) ultracontractivity and hypercontractivity fail. Our work is inspired by Talagrand's convolution conjecture in the discrete cube setting, as well as by subsequent developments on the classical Ornstein--Uhlenbeck semigroup. The estimates we provide exhibit a clear dependence on the potential and the L\'evy measure defining the kinetic term operator, and they yield a description of the semigroups' action on $L^1$ in terms of Orlicz spaces. Our framework is quite general, encompassing fractional and relativistic Laplacians as kinetic operators. The results are illustrated by numerous examples demonstrating that the $L^1$-regularizing effects become stronger as $t \uparrow \infty$.</description>

      <title>Variance renormalisation in regularity structures -- the case of $2d$ gPAM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the variance renormalisation of a singular SPDE for which a Da Prato-Debussche trick is not applicable. The example taken is the $2$-dimensional generalised parabolic Anderson model (gPAM), driven by a much rougher than white noise, necessitating both a multiplicative and an additive renormalisation. To handle the discrepancy between the regularity structures of the approximate and the limiting equations, we consider models that lift $0$ noises to nontrivial models, in analogy with ``pure area'' from rough paths. The convergence to such a model is shown for the BPHZ model over the vanishing noise via graphical computations.</description>

      <title>Banach fixed point and flow approach for rough analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that the main algebraic assumption required to perform a fixed point argument for rough differential equations implies the algebraic assumption for the Bailleul flow approach. This assumption requires that the rough path associated with the equation is given by a Hopf algebra whose coproduct admits a cocycle and has a tree-like basis. We show that the Hopf algebra of multi-indices does not satisfy the cocycle condition. This is a rigorous result on the impossibility, observed in practice, of performing a fixed point argument for multi-indices rough paths and multi-indices in Regularity Structures.</description>

      <title>An Allen-Cahn equation with jump-diffusion noise for biological damage and repair processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper analyzes a stochastic Allen--Cahn equation for the dynamics of biomolecular damage and repair. The system is driven by two distinct noise processes: a multiplicative cylindrical Wiener process, modeling continuous background stochastic fluctuations, and a jump-type noise, modeling the abrupt, localized damage induced by external shocks. The drift of the equation is singular and covers the typical logarithmic Flory-Huggins potential required in phase-separation dynamics. We prove well-posedness of the model in a strong probabilistic sense, and analyze its long-time behavior in terms of existence and uniqueness of invariant measures, ergodicity, and mixing properties. Eventually, we present an Euler--Maruyama scheme to simulate the model and illustrate how it captures fundamental biological phenomena, such as damage clustering, stress-induced topology perturbations, and damage dynamics.</description>

      <title>A Lower Bound for the First Non-zero Basic Eigenvalue on a Singular Riemannian Foliation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide the lower bounds of the first non-zero basic eigenvalue on a closed singular Riemannian manifold $(M,\mathcal{F})$ with basic mean curvature that depends on the given non-negative lower bound of the Ricci curvature of $M$ and the diameter of the leaf space $M/\mathcal{F}$. These can be regarded as generalized versions of the Zhong-Yang estimate and a generalized Shi-Yang's estimate for singular Riemannian foliations with basic mean curvature. We also provide a rigidity result corresponding to the generalized Zhong-Yang estimate, which is a generalized Hang-Wang rigidity for singular Riemannian foliations with basic mean curvature. More precisely, when the first basic eigenvalue $\lambda_1^B$ is equal to $\frac{\pi^2}{d_{M/\mathcal{F}^2}} $, where $d_{M/\mathcal{F}}$ is the diameter of the leaf space, $M$ is isometric to a mapping torus of an isometry $\varphi:N\to N$ where $N$ is an $(n-1)$-dimensional Riemannian manifold of nonnegative Ricci curvature and $\mathcal{F}$ has the form $\{[\{\text{point}\}\times N]\}$.</description>

      <title>Optimal control of stochastic Volterra integral equations with completely monotone kernels and stochastic differential equations on Hilbert spaces with unbounded control and diffusion operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamic programming approach is one of the most powerful ones in optimal control. However, when dealing with optimal control problems of stochastic Volterra integral equations (SVIEs) with completely monotone kernels, deep mathematical difficulties arise and it is still not understood. These very classical problems have applications in most fields and have now become even more popular due to their applications in mathematical finance under rough volatility. In this article, we consider a class of optimal control problems of SVIEs with completely monotone kernels. Via a recent Markovian lift \cite{FGW2024}, the problem can be reformulated as an optimal control problem of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) on suitable Hilbert spaces, which due to the roughness of the kernel, presents a generator of an analytic semigroup and unbounded control and diffusion operators.
  This analysis leads us to study a general class of optimal control problems of abstract SDEs on Hilbert spaces with unbounded control and diffusion operators. This class includes optimal control problems of SVIEs with completely monotone kernels, but it is also motivated by other models. We analyze the regularity of the associated Ornstein-Uhlenbeck transition semigroup. We prove that the semigroup exhibits a new smoothing property in control directions through a general observation operator $\Gamma$, which we call $\Gamma$-smoothing. This allows us to establish existence and uniqueness of mild solutions of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, establish a verification theorem, and construct optimal feedback controls. We apply these results to optimal control problems of SVIEs with completely monotone kernels. To the best of our knowledge these are the first results of this kind for this abstract class of infinite dimensional problems and for the optimal control of SVIEs with completely monotone kernels.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.01299v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study capillary-gravity surface waves for fluid flows governed by Darcy's law. This includes flows in vertical Hele-Shaw cells and in porous media (the one-phase Muskat problem) with finite or infinite depth. The free boundary is acted upon by an external pressure posited to be in traveling wave form with an arbitrary periodic profile and an amplitude parameter. For any given wave speed, we first prove that there exists a unique local curve of small periodic traveling waves corresponding to small values of the parameter. Then we prove that as the parameter increases but could possibly be bounded, the curve belongs to a connected set $\mathcal{C}$ of traveling waves. The set $\mathcal{C}$ contains traveling waves that either have arbitrarily large gradients or are arbitrarily close to the rigid bottom in the finite depth case. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first construction of large traveling surface waves for a viscous free boundary problem.</description>

      <title>Transverse Instability of Stokes Waves at Finite Depth</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07169v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Stokes wave is a traveling free-surface periodic water wave that is constant in the direction transverse to the direction of propagation. In 1981 McLean discovered via numerical methods that Stokes waves are unstable with respect to transverse perturbations. In \cite{CreNguStr} for the case of infinite depth we proved rigorously that the spectrum of the water wave system linearized at small Stokes waves, with respect to transverse perturbations, contains unstable eigenvalues lying approximately on an ellipse. In this paper we consider the case of finite depth and prove that the same spectral instability result holds for all but finitely many values of the depth. The computations and some aspects of the theory are considerably more complicated in the finite depth case.</description>

Abstract: We address the direct scattering problem for a penetrable obstacle in an infinite elastic two--dimensional Kirchhoff--Love plate. Under the assumption that the plate's thickness is small relative to the wavelength of the incident wave, the propagation of perturbations on the plate is governed by the two-dimensional biharmonic wave equation, which we study in the frequency domain. With the help of an operator factorization, the scattering problem is analyzed from the perspective of a coupled boundary value problem involving the Helmholtz and modified Helmholtz equations. Well-posedness and reciprocity relations for the problem are established. Numerical examples for some special cases are provided to validate the theoretical findings.</description>

Abstract: Consider an $(n+1)$-dimensional circular cone with opening angle $\alpha \in (0,\pi)$. Using a free-boundary adaptation of the classical calibration method, we prove that, for $n \geq 4$, there exists a threshold $\bar{\alpha}(n) \in (0,\pi)$ such that if $\alpha \geq \bar{\alpha}(n)$, that is, the cone is wide enough, the intersection of the cone with an axial hyperplane is area-minimizing with respect to free-boundary variations inside the cone. This provides a counterexample to a recent Vertex-skipping Theorem proved by the author in collaboration with G.P. Leonardi, at least for $n\geq4$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we establish global $C^{1,\alpha}$-regularity for bounded generalized solutions of elliptic equations in divergence form with Musielak-Orlicz growth and subject to Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions. In fact, our findings extend and generalize several important regularity results in cases of special attention such as variable exponent spaces, Orlicz spaces, and some $(p,q)$ situations. We also point out new conditions in the analysis that focus on the interplay between non-standard growth conditions and the boundary behavior in such generalized examples.</description>

      <title>The Wasserstein gradient flow of the Sinkhorn divergence between Gaussian distributions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.10726v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Wasserstein gradient flow of the Sinkhorn divergence when both the source and the target are Gaussian distributions. We prove the existence of a flow that stays in the class of Gaussian distributions, and is unique in the larger class of measures with strongly-concave and smooth log-densities. We prove that the flow globally converges toward the target measure when the source's covariance matrix is not singular, and provide counter-examples to global convergence when it is, giving a first answer to an open question raised in [Carlier et al. 2024, \S4.2]. When the covariance matrix of the source distribution commutes with that of the target, we derive more quantitative results that showcase exponential convergence toward the target when the source and the target share their support, but dropping to linear rates (O(t^{-1})) if the target is concentrated on a strict subspace of the source's support.</description>

      <title>Interior Hessian estimates for Hessian quotient equations in dimension three</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14064v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish the interior Hessian estimates for $2$-convex solutions to $\frac{\sigma_2}{\sigma_1} (D^2 u) = \psi (x,u)$ in dimension three. In higher dimensions ($n \geq 4$), we prove the interior Hessian estimates for semi-convex solutions. We provide a new method to prove the doubling inequality for smooth solutions in dimensions three and four. In higher dimensions ($n\geq 5$) the doubling inequality is proved under an additional dynamic semi-convexity condition which is the same to that in \cite{SY2025}. The method also applies to the equation $\sigma_2 (D^2 u) = \psi (x, u, \nabla u)$.</description>

      <title>Uniform-in-time propagation of chaos for Consensus-Based Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08669v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the derivative-free global optimization algorithm Consensus-Based Optimization (CBO), establishing uniform-in-time propagation of chaos as well as an almost uniform-in-time stability result for the microscopic particle system. Moreover, we prove almost sure exponential convergence of the microscopic CBO system around a point close to the global minimizer. The proof of these results is based on a novel stability estimate for the weighted mean and on a quantitative concentration inequality for the microscopic particle system around the empirical mean. Our propagation of chaos result recovers the classical Monte Carlo rate, with a prefactor that depends explicitly on the parameters of the problem. Notably, in the case of CBO with anisotropic noise, this prefactor is independent of the problem dimension.</description>

      <title>Learning PDE Solvers with Physics and Data: A Unifying View of Physics-Informed Neural Networks and Neural Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14517v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) are central to scientific modeling. Modern workflows increasingly rely on learning-based components to support model reuse, inference, and integration across large computational processes. Despite the emergence of various physics-aware data-driven approaches, the field still lacks a unified perspective to uncover their relationships, limitations, and appropriate roles in scientific workflows. To this end, we propose a unifying perspective to place two dominant paradigms: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and Neural Operators (NOs), within a shared design space. We organize existing methods from three fundamental dimensions: what is learned, how physical structures are integrated into the learning process, and how the computational load is amortized across problem instances. In this way, many challenges can be best understood as consequences of these structural properties of learning PDEs. By analyzing advances through this unifying view, our survey aims to facilitate the development of reliable learning-based PDE solvers and catalyze a synthesis of physics and data.</description>

      <title>On the Calabi-Yau Conjectures for Minimal Hypersurfaces in Higher Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16048v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the Calabi-Yau conjectures for complete minimal hypersurfaces $\Sigma^{n}\subset \mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ in dimensions $n\ge 3$. These conjectures ask whether a complete minimal hypersurface must be unbounded, and more strongly, whether it must be proper. For the unboundedness question, we prove a chord-arc estimate for an embedded minimal disk with bounded curvature, showing that intrinsic distance is controlled by a polynomial of the extrinsic distance. On the other hand, using gluing techniques, we construct a complete, improperly embedded minimal hypersurface in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ for every $n\ge 3$. This example shows that the properness conjecture suggested by the deep work of Colding Minicozzi [CM08] in the case $n=2$ fails in higher dimensions.</description>
