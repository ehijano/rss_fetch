      <title>The local supersymmetries of a stack of branes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Local supersymmetries have been a guiding principle to construct smooth horizonless supergravity solutions. By computing brane densities from the brane low-energy effective action, we classify which BPS solutions have the maximal local supersymmetry structure, with sixteen supersymmetries. We find that whenever the gauge group is broken to its maximal abelian subgroup, the brane construction becomes purely geometric and one can identify the preserved local supercharges. This class of solution includes two- and three-charge monopoles, and polarised branes. On the contrary, we show that instantons involve pure non-abelian degrees of freedom that cannot have a geometric interpretation. Hence, we conjecture that such instantons cannot be fully captured by supergravity.</description>

      <title>Four Loop Renormalisation Group Equations in general Gross-Neveu-Yukawa Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute template formulae of all four-loop $\beta$-functions and anomalous dimensions of arbitrary renormalisable quantum field theories with fermions and scalar fields in the $\overline{\text{MS}}$ scheme. Using these results, novel contributions to the $\beta$-functions of the Higgs and top coupling are extracted. We discuss how four loops present a challenge to dimensional continuation from four to three dimensions and propose a solution.</description>

      <title>Weil-Petersson volumes for extended JT supergravity from ordinary differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work [1] produced an efficient method for computing Weil-Petersson volumes using two ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that appear naturally in double scaled random matrix models. One is the defining string equation of the model and the other is the Gel'fand-Dikii equation satisfied by the diagonal resolvent of an auxiliary Hamiltonian used to compute correlators of macroscopic loops. In concert, when applied to Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity, the recursive expansion of these two ODEs efficiently define, order by order in genus, the Weil-Petersson volumes $V_{g,1}(b)$ for bordered hyperbolic Riemann surfaces with one geodesic boundary (length $b$) and genus $g$. The method works equally well for both ordinary and ${ N}{=}1$ supersymmetric JT gravity cases. This paper explores the method to higher genus, verifying some conjectures of ref.[1], and deriving several useful recursive formulae for general use. The method is then applied to the new examples furnished by recent matrix model definitions of JT supergravity with extended supersymmetry, and several example expressions for the volumes are derived, confirming and extending ${ N}{=}2$ examples of Turiaci and Witten, and furnishing new formulae for the cases with small and large ${ N}{=}4$ supersymmetry. The prospects for extending the ODE method to the full set of $V_{g,n}(\{ b_i\})$, ($i=1,\ldots ,n$), are discussed.</description>

      <title>Virtual thermodynamic potential and black hole criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new way to relate the black hole thermodynamics and geometry by generalizing the Euclidean formalism to include "virtual geometries", which do not necessarily satisfy Einstein equations. This provides a physically well motivated route to study black hole criticality and obtain the Landau Ginzburg potential. We compute the "virtual thermodynamic potential" and show that it satisfies a modified quantum statistical relation that is compatible with the first law of black hole thermodynamics supplemented with an extra term, interpreted as virtual work in previous literature. The novelty is that, within our formalism, we can explicitly compute this term as the first derivative of the virtual thermodynamic potential with respect to the horizon radius that is considered as the order parameter. Imposing the physical condition that the first derivative vanishes is at the basis of the matching between the first law of black hole thermodynamics and (one of the) Einstein equations evaluated at the horizon. Interestingly, imposing the physical conditions that the second and third derivatives vanish, we can concretely study the criticality and existence of swallow tails. As a specific example, we apply this formalism to an exact four dimensional asymptotically flat hairy black hole, namely the generalized Kaluza Klein (KK) black hole when the dilaton potential is included, and show that it is thermodynamically stable and has a non-trivial critical behaviour corresponding to an inverted swallowtail.</description>

      <title>Chaotic signatures in free field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider free scalar relativistic field theory in finite volume taken out-of-equilibrium and show how the chaotic behavior emerges in such a quantum system for particular quench protocols. Namely, we show that for the operator local quench, correlation functions exhibit statistical properties quite close to that of the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble of random matrices. Moreover, we show that the spectral form factor for the excited state after the local quench reveals a dip-ramp-plateau structure which also supports our conjecture. Finally, we show that the spectral form factor computed directly from the spectrum clearly demonstrates this structure as well.</description>

      <title>Chaos dynamics of charged particles near Gibbons-Maeda-Garfinkle-Horowitz-Strominger black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Gibbons-Maeda-Garfinkle-Horowitz-Strominger (GMGHS) dilatonic black hole, a key solution in low-energy string theory, exhibits previously unexplored chaotic dynamics for charged test particles under electromagnetic influence. While characterizing such chaos necessitates high-precision numerical solutions, our prior research confirms the explicit symplectic algorithm as the optimal numerical integration tool for strongly curved gravitational celestial systems. Leveraging the Hamiltonian formulation of the GMGHS black hole, we develop an optimized fourth-order symplectic algorithm $PR{K_6}4$. This algorithm enables a systematic investigation of the chaotic motion employing four distinct chaos indicators: Shannon entropy, Poincare sections, the maximum Lyapunov exponents, and the Fast Lyapunov indicators. Our results demonstrate a critical dependence of chaos on both electric charge ($Q$, characterized by the Coulomb parameter $Q^*$) and magnetic charge ($Q_m$). Specifically, in electrically charged backgrounds, order-to-chaos transitions arise with increasing $Q$ or decreasing $Q^*$. Conversely, in magnetically charged backgrounds, chaos emerges as $Q_m$ increases. These findings validate Shannon entropy as a robust chaos indicator within relativistic frameworks and provide novel insights on the dynamics of string-theoretic black holes.</description>

      <title>An Extended Soliton's Zero Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum field theory in the presence of localized solitons is more complicated than vacuum sector quantum field theory, largely as a result of the soliton's zero modes. In the present work, we try to understand to what extent this situation carries over to extended solitons. To this end, we explicitly construct the quantum state corresponding to a domain wall string or membrane, treating the zero modes carefully. This is done both for compact and also infinitely extended solitons. As an application, we calculate the differential probability for a domain wall string's translation mode, with a given momentum, to be excited by a single quantum of incoming radiation.</description>

      <title>Gauge interactions and the Galilean limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gauge invariant minimal couplings for a class of relativistic free matter fields with global symmetry (related to usual charge conservation) have been obtained by incorporating an iterative Noether mechanism. Non-relativistic reduction of both matter and gauge sectors of the obtained interacting theory is then performed simultaneously which in turn yield a set of new effective actions which are invariant under the Galilean relativistic framework. To be precise, we show that one can obtain the Schr\"odinger field theory coupled to Galilean electromagnetism from the scalar quantum electrodynamics theory. Higher derivative corrections have also been included for which the non-relativistic reduction has been carried out once again. Inclusion of higher derivative corrections is also consistent in this context. On the other hand, the action for quantum electrodynamics leads to the Galilean Pauli-Schr\"odinger theory where the gauge field is non-relativistic or Galilean. Further, some novel relations are found (in both the electric and magnetic limits) between various components appearing in the Galilean avatar of electrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics in the Sine-Gordon model: the NLIE approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we derive Kl\"umper-Batchelor-Pearce-Destri-de Vega type nonlinear integral equations for describing the thermodynamics in the sine-Gordon model, when a chemical potential coupled to the topological charge
  is also present in the theory. The equations are valid at any value of the coupling constant and are particularly useful for computing the expectation values of local operators and some currents as functions of the temperature and the chemical potential. The equations are also extended to the case, when an extra term corresponding to the momentum conservation, is added to the thermodynamic potential.
  The benefits of this description are twofold. On the one hand, it can serve as an appropriate testing ground for other promising theoretical methods, like the method of random surfaces. On the other hand, the efficient computation of vertex operator expectation values, allows one to provide useful theoretical data, for the experimentally measurable coherence factors of a tunnel-coupled cold atomic condensate system.</description>

Abstract: We identify boundary terms renormalizing the free on-shell actions for massless fields of arbitrary spin, including electromagnetism and linearized gravity, with boundary conditions allowing for supertranslation-like asymptotic symmetries. Our focus is on null infinity, in any spacetime dimensions. We also comment on the renormalization of the corresponding asymptotic charges.</description>

      <title>Dimensional Regularization of Bubble Diagrams in de Sitter Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Correlators of large-scale fluctuations produced during cosmic inflation are major observables of inflationary cosmology. In cosmological collider physics, many interesting correlators are generated through loop processes. However, ultraviolet divergences often appear when computing the loop correlators, and a regularization is required. In this work, K\"all\'en-Lehmann representation and dimensional regularization are used to analytically compute various correlators with a bubble loop of massive bulk propagators in de Sitter spacetime. Examples include 4-point and 2-point correlators with 1-loop bubbe exchanges of derivatively coupled massive scalars or massive spin-1 bosons.</description>

      <title>A general fusion procedure for open $\mathfrak{gl}(N)$ spin chains: Application to the ABJM spin chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate a general fusion procedure for open $\mathfrak{gl}(N)$ spin chains. We construct the fused boundary reflection matrices and the corresponding fused reflection equations. By using the intertwining relation between the fused reflection matrices and the fusion operator, we identify the invariant subspace of the fused reflection matrices carrying the irreducible representations of $\mathfrak{gl}(N)$. We also construct the fused transfer matrix and evaluate it explicitly in the total tensor product space and the invariant subspaces. Finally, we demonstrate that the ABJM spin chain model originates from such fusion procedure and derive three classes of boundary reflection matrices solutions on the anti-fundamental representation space of $\mathfrak{su}(4)$.</description>

      <title>Jet Quenching in Holographic QCD as an Indicator of Phase Transitions in Anisotropic Regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we employ the gauge/gravity duality to study jet quenching (JQ) phenomena in the quark-gluon plasma. For this purpose, we implement holographic QCD models constructed from an Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton gravity at finite temperature and finite chemical potential for light and heavy quarks. The models capture both the confinement and deconfinement phases of QCD and the first-order phase transitions. We calculate the JQ parameter in different models and compare them with the experimental data obtained in heavy-ions studies. In particular, we investigate how JQ, as a function of temperature $T$, chemical potential $\mu$, and magnetic field $c_B$, serves as a probe for identifying first-order phase transitions within the $(T,\mu,c_B)$ parameter space of holographic QCD. Particular attention is paid to the dependence of JQ on the parameter $\nu$, which characterizes longitudinal versus transverse anisotropy relative to the heavy-ion collision axis. By analyzing the dependence of the JQ parameters on these thermodynamic variables, we map critical regions associated with phase boundaries. We compare our findings to earlier studies of the running coupling constant's behavior within the gauge-gravity duality framework. This approach provides new insights into the interplay between non-perturbative dynamics and phase structure in strongly coupled systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a noncommutative algebra $A$ and an antilinear automorphism $\rho$ of $A$ there is a notion of a positive trace. Positive traces appear in study of supersymmetric gauge theories. We classify positive traces on $A$ in two cases. The first case is when $A$ is a quantization of a Kleinian singularity of type $D$, with certain restriction on the quantization parameter. The second case is when $A=K^{\operatorname{SL}(2,\mathbb{C}[[t]])\rtimes \mathbb{C}_q^{\times}}(\operatorname{Gr}_{\operatorname{PGL}_2})$ is an algebra containing $K$-theoretic Coulomb branches of pure $\operatorname{SL}(2)$ and $\operatorname{PGL}(2)$ gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian Analysis of 4-dimensional Spacetime in Bondi-like Coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.10746</link>
      <description>arXiv:1804.10746v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the Hamiltonian formulation of gravity in 4-dimensional spacetime under Bondi-like coordinates{v, r, x^a, a=2, 3}. In Bondi-like coordinates, the 3-dimensional hypersurface is a null hypersurface and the evolution direction is the advanced time v. The internal symmetry group SO(1,3) of the 4-dimensional spacetime is decomposed into SO(1,1), SO(2), and T^\pm(2), whose Lie algebra so(1,3) is decomposed into so(1,1), so(2), t^\pm(2) correspondingly. The SO(1,1) symmetry is very obvious in this kind of decomposition, which is very useful in so(1,1) BF theory. General relativity can be reformulated as the 4-dimensional coframe (e^I_\mu) and connection ({\omega}^{IJ}_\mu) dynamics of gravity based on this kind of decomposition in the Bondi-like coordinate system. The coframe consists of 2 null 1-forms e^-, e^+ and 2 spacelike 1-forms e^2, e^3. The Palatini action is used. The Hamiltonian analysis is conducted by the Dirac's methods. The consistency analysis of constraints has been done completely. There are 2 scalar constraints and one 2-dimensional vector constraint. The torsion-free conditions are acquired from the consistency conditions of the primary constraints about {\pi}^\mu_{IJ}. The consistency conditions of the primary constraints {\pi}^0_{IJ}=0 can be reformulated as Gauss constraints. The conditions of the Lagrange multipliers have been acquired. The Poisson brackets among the constraints have been calculated. There are 46 constraints including 6 first class constraints {\pi}^0_{IJ}=0 and 40 second class constraints. The local physical degrees of freedom is 2. The integrability conditions of Lagrange multipliers n_0, l_0, and e^A_0 are Ricci identities. The equations of motion of the canonical variables have also been shown.</description>

      <title>Quantum estimation of cosmological parameters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how well future cosmological experiments can reconstruct the mechanism that generated primordial inhomogeneities is key to assessing the extent to which cosmology can inform fundamental physics. In this work, we apply a quantum metrology tool - the quantum Fisher information - to the squeezed quantum state describing cosmological perturbations at the end of inflation. This quantifies the ultimate precision achievable in parameter estimation, assuming ideal access to early-universe information. By comparing the quantum Fisher information to its classical counterpart - derived from measurements of the curvature perturbation power spectrum alone (homodyne measurement) - we evaluate how close current observations come to this quantum limit. Focusing on the tensor-to-scalar ratio as a case study, we find that the gap between classical and quantum Fisher information grows exponentially with the number of e-folds a mode spends outside the horizon. This suggests the existence of a highly efficient (but presently inaccessible) optimal measurement. Conversely, we show that accessing the decaying mode of inflationary perturbations is a necessary (but not sufficient) condition for exponentially improving the inference of the tensor-to-scalar ratio.</description>

      <title>Connecting Early Dark Energy to Late Dark Energy by the Diluting Matter Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we study a scale invariant gravity theory containing two scalar fields, dust particles and a measure defined from degrees of freedom independent of the metric. The integration of the degrees of freedom that define the measure spontaneously break the scale symmetry, leaving us in the Einstein frame with an effective potential that is dependent on the density of the particles. The potential contains three flat regions, one for inflation, another for early dark energy and the third for late dark energy. At a certain point, as the matter dilutes, tunneling from the early dark energy to the late dark energy can start efficiently. This mechanism naturally alleviated the observed Hubble tension by modifying the sound horizon prior to recombination while preserving late-time cosmology. Moreover, the model predictions are consistent with observations from the reduced CMB, BAO, and local measurement of $H_0$, providing a coherent and unified description of the universe. In this context, the Bayesian analysis of these datasets confirms the viability of our scenario, with the best-fit parameters indicating an early dark energy fraction of approximately 30$\%$ at a redshift of $z'=5000$.</description>

      <title>Dominance of scale anomaly in confining pressure inside pions on light front in the top-down holographic QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we analyze the energy density and the stress distribution inside the pion derived from gravitational form factors in top-down holographic QCD. In particular, we show that the dominance of the scale anomaly in the confining pressure, previously observed in the instant form for the nucleon, also holds for the pion in the light-front form. Furthermore, we find that in large-$N_c$ QCD described by this approach, the scalar glueball plays a mediating role in transmitting the confining pressure. These findings support the universal role of the scale anomaly in the stability of hadrons.</description>

      <title>Doubly Separable Spacetimes and Symmetry Constraints on their Self-Gravitating Matter Content</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A popular approach to constructing exact stationary and axisymmetric nonvacuum solutions in general relativity has been to use solution-generating techniques. Here we revisit a recent variant of the Newman-Janis-Azreg-Ainou algorithm, restricted to asymptotically-flat spacetimes, and demonstrate that this method exclusively generates Konoplya-Stuchlik-Zhidenko spacetimes. Therefore, the equations for geodesic motion and scalar-wave propagation are both separable. We call these "doubly separable" spacetimes. We identify a subclass of the spacetimes that might admit a separable Dirac equation by explicitly obtaining the Killing-Yano tensor. The high degree of symmetry in these spacetimes suggests that the self-gravitating matter must also be in specialized field configurations. For this reason, we investigate whether these spacetimes can even be sourced by arbitrary types of matter. We show that doubly separable spacetimes cannot be sourced by massless real scalar fields or perfect fluids, and that electromagnetic fields lead only to the Kerr-Newman family. Notably, this rules out the elusive spinning counterpart of the Janis-Newman-Winicour naked singularity spacetime, which contains a scalar field, as a member of this metric class. While the algorithm generates spacetimes with rich symmetry structures, valuable for studying phenomena like black hole shadows and quasinormal modes, our results highlight the need for caution when using it to construct physically consistent solutions with prespecified matter content.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal modes of noncommutative geometry-inspired dirty black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the quasinormal modes (QNMs) of noncommutative geometry-inspired dirty black holes, focusing on both non-extremal and extremal configurations. These gravitational objects, characterized by smeared energy distributions within a modified de Sitter-like equation of state, modify the classical Schwarzschild metric and regularize central singularities. We employ a spectral method based on Chebyshev polynomials to solve the eigenvalue problem for scalar, electromagnetic, and gravitational perturbations. Our results reveal new overdamped modes indicative of rapid decay without oscillation, particularly prominent in near-extremal and extremal regimes. Additionally, we establish that the QNMs converge to classical Schwarzschild values for large mass parameters, validating our method's robustness. Our findings highlight the impact of dirtiness and noncommutative effects on black hole QNM spectra, offering potential observational signatures for distinguishing these objects in gravitational-wave detections.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a static traversable wormhole sustained by a combination of a minimally coupled scalar field and an electric field, with exotic matter sourced by Casimir energy. Considering two scenarios, where the Casimir plate separation is either radially variable or fixed, we derive analytical near-throat solutions for both massless and massive scalar fields. To ensure consistency of the field equations, a thermal tensor is also incorporated, consisting solely of pressure terms that vanish at the throat. In all cases, we obtain well-behaved wormhole manifolds with throat sizes that scale proportionally with the number of elementary charges the wormhole can support.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of large scalar inhomogeneities during the kination epoch, a period in which the universe's dynamics are dominated by the kinetic energy of a scalar field, by fully evolving the Einstein equations using numerical relativity. By tracking the non-linear growth of scalar perturbations with both sub-horizon and super-horizon initial wavelengths, we are able to compare their evolution to perturbative results. Our key findings show that in the deep sub-horizon limit, the perturbative behaviour remains valid, whereas in the super-horizon regime, non-linear dynamics exhibit a much richer phenomenology. Finally, we discuss the possibility of primordial black hole formation from the collapse of such perturbations and assess whether this process could serve as a viable mechanism to reheat the universe in the post-inflationary era.</description>

      <title>Triggering Electron Capture Supernovae: Dark Matter Effects in Degenerate White-Dwarf-like Cores of Super-Asymptotic Giant Branch Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electron-capture supernovae (ECSNe) have emerged as a compelling formation channel for low-mass neutron stars, bolstered by decades of theoretical work and increasingly supported by observational evidence, including the recent identification of SN~2018zd. Motivated by this, we investigate the influence of fermionic asymmetric dark matter (ADM) on the equilibrium structure of progenitor cores and the formation of their neutron star remnants. Using a general relativistic two-fluid formalism, we model the coupled evolution of ordinary matter (OM) and ADM, treated as separately conserved fluids interacting solely through gravity. Our analysis focuses on neon-rich white dwarfs (Ne WDs), which are typical progenitor cores for ECSNe. We assume conservation of both baryon number ($N_B$) and dark matter particle number ($N_D$) during collapse, allowing for a consistent mapping between progenitor and remnant configurations. We find that ADM significantly enhances the central density of the WD progenitor. This lowers the threshold gravitational mass $M^*$ required to initiate electron capture, enabling ECSNe from lower-mass progenitors. The resulting remnants are stable, dark matter-admixed neutron stars with gravitational masses potentially well below current observational bounds. Moreover, we find that the conversion energy during the WD-to-NS conversion is also significantly reduced for higher ADM particle masses and fractions, suggesting that unusually low-energy ECSNe may serve as potential indicators of ADM involvement in stellar collapse.</description>

      <title>Gravity-Induced Photon Interactions and Infrared Consistency in any Dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07254v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the four-photon ($F^4$) operators generated by loops of charged particles of spin $0$, $\frac{1}{2}$, $1$ in the presence of gravity and in any spacetime dimension $d$. To this end, we expand the one-loop effective action via the heat kernel coefficients, which capture both the gravity-induced renormalization of the $F^4$ operators and the low-energy Einstein-Maxwell effective field theory (EFT) produced by massive charged particles. We set positivity bounds on the $F^4$ operators using standard arguments from extremal black holes (for $d\geq 4$) and from infrared (IR) consistency of four-photon scattering (for $d\geq 3$). We find that both approaches yield nearly equivalent results, even though in the amplitudes we discard the graviton $t$-channel pole and use the vanishing of the Gauss-Bonnet term at quadratic order for any $d$. The positivity bounds constrain the charge-to-mass ratio of the heavy particles. If the Planckian $F^4$ operators are sufficiently small or negative, such bounds produce a version of the $d$-dimensional Weak Gravity Conjecture (WGC) in most, but not all, dimensions. In the special case of $d=6$, the gravity-induced beta functions of $F^4$ operators from charged particles of any spin are positive, leading to WGC-like bounds with a logarithmic enhancement. In $d=9,10$, the WGC fails to guarantee extremal black hole decay in the infrared EFT, thereby requiring the existence of sufficiently large Planckian $F^4$ operators.</description>

      <title>Shear transport in far-from-equilibrium isotropization of supersymmetric Yang-Mills plasma</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10706v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We holographically study the far-from-equilibrium isotropization dynamics of the strongly coupled $\mathcal{N}=4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills plasma. The dual gravitational background is driven to be out of equilibrium and anisotropic by a time-dependent change in boundary conditions. At late times, the system relaxes and asymptotically approaches a static configuration. The large initial energy densities accelerate the isotropization significantly compared to the initial geometry corresponding to the supersymmetric Yang-Mills vacuum. We analyze shear transport during isotropization by directly computing the time-dependent stress tensor, which is now a nonlinear function of the shear rate. The shear viscosity far from equilibrium displays much richer dynamics than its near-equilibrium counterpart. Moreover, we uncover that the equilibrium viscosity-to-entropy ratio at late times depends on the details of the quench function and the initial data, which could be due to a resummation of the hydrodynamic description. In particular, this ratio can be parametrically smaller than the Kovtun-Son-Starinets bound calculated from linear response theory.</description>

      <title>The moments of the spectral form factor in SYK</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18737v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In chaotic quantum systems the spectral form factor exhibits a universal linear ramp and plateau structure with superimposed erratic oscillations. The mean signal and the statistics of the noise can be probed by the moments of the spectral form factor, also known as higher-point spectral form factors. We identify saddle points in the SYK model that describe the moments during the ramp region. Perturbative corrections around the saddle point indicate that SYK mimics random matrix statistics for the low order moments, while large deviations for the high order moments arise from fluctuations near the edge of the spectrum. The leading correction scales inversely with the number of random parameters in the SYK Hamiltonian and is amplified in a sparsified version of the SYK model, which we study numerically, even in regimes where a linear ramp persists. Finally, we study the $q=2$ SYK model, whose spectral form factor exhibits an exponential ramp with increased noise. These findings reveal how deviations from random matrix universality arise in disordered systems and motivate their interpretation from a bulk gravitational perspective.</description>

      <title>String stars in $d\geq 7$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19888v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We raise a thermodynamic puzzle for Horowitz--Polchinski (HP) solutions in the presence of extra compact dimensions and show that it can be resolved by the existence of higher-dimensional string stars. We provide non-trivial evidence for the existence of such string stars in spacetime dimensions $d\geq 7$ as higher-dimensional counterparts of HP solutions. In particular, we explicitly construct string star solutions in $d=7$ that are under perturbative control. In $d&gt;7$, at the Hagedorn temperature, we identify these string stars as a specific normalizable representative of a new one-parameter bounded family of Euclidean solutions which can be under perturbative control. The higher-order $\alpha'$ corrections play a crucial role in our arguments and, as pointed by other works, nullify the previous arguments against the existence of string stars in $d\geq 7$. The higher-dimensional string stars have non-zero free energy at Hagedorn temperature and their mass and free energy are of the same order as those of a string-sized black hole. In $d&gt;7$, these solutions are string sized, but in $d=7$, the size of these solutions diverges as $\sim (T_{\rm H}-T)^{-1/4}$ near the Hagedorn temperature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09785v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a systematic study of one-loop quantum corrections in scalar effective field theories from a geometric viewpoint, emphasizing the role of field-space curvature and its renormalisation. By treating the scalar fields as coordinates on a Riemannian manifold, we exploit field redefinition invariance to maintain manifest coordinate independence of physical observables. Focusing on the non-linear sigma model (NLSM) and \(\phi^4\) theory, we demonstrate how loop corrections induce momentum- and scale-dependent shifts in the curvature of the field-space manifold. These corrections can be elegantly captured through the recently proposed geometry-kinematics duality, which generalizes the colour-kinematics duality in gauge theories to curved field-space backgrounds. Our results highlight a universal structure emerging in the contractions of Riemann tensors that contribute to renormalisation of the field-space curvature. In particular, we find explicit expressions and a universal structure for the running curvature and Ricci scalar in simple models, illustrating how quantum effects reshape the underlying geometry. This geometric formulation unifies a broad class of scalar EFTs, providing insight into the interplay of curvature, scattering amplitudes, and renormalisation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17152v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a version of fluctuating relativistic hydrodynamics in a way very different from the usual derivation: Instead of treating it as a coarse-grained deterministic theory expanded in gradients of equilibrium quantities, we treat it as a stochastic theory, characterized by partition functions in each cells, expanded in cumulants. We show that the Gaussian ansatz allows us, via the gravitational Ward identities acting as a constraint between the variance and the average, to maintain full general covariance, with hydrodynamic flow emerging as an approximate Killing vector. If the symmetry of relativistic hydrodynamics, volume-preserving diffeomorphisms, is preserved, we show that linear response formulae are also generally covariant. We discuss our results and argue that in this approach, the applicability of the effective theory is parametrized around a very different quantity than the Knudsen number, offering hope of understanding the applicability of hydrodynamics to small systems.</description>

      <title>Beyond Noether: A Covariant Study of Poisson-Lie Symmetries in Low Dimensional Field Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14942v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore global Poisson-Lie (PL) symmetries using a Lagrangian, or ``covariant phase space" approach, that manifestly preserves spacetime covariance. PL symmetries are the classical analog of quantum-group symmetries. In the Noetherian framework symmetries leave the Lagrangian invariant up to boundary terms and necessarily yield (on closed manifolds) $\mathfrak{g}^{*}$-valued conserved charges which serve as Hamiltonian generators of the symmetry itself. Non-trivial PL symmetries transcend this framework by failing to be symplectomorphisms and by admitting (conserved) non-Abelian group-valued momentum maps. In this paper we discuss various structural and conceptual challenges associated with the implementation of PL symmetries in field theory, focusing in particular on non-locality. We examine these issues through explicit examples of low-dimensional field theories with non-trivial PL symmetries: the deformed spinning top (or, the particle with curved momentum and configuration space) in 0+1D; the non-linear $\sigma$-model by Klim\v{c}\'ik and \v{S}evera (KS) in 1+1D; and gravity with a cosmological constant in 2+1D. Although these examples touch on systems of different dimensionality, they are all ultimately underpinned by 2D $\sigma$-models, specifically the A-model and KS model.</description>

      <title>The Yang-Baxter integrability of the critical Ising chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03668v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the one dimensional, critical transverse field Ising model is Yang-Baxter integrable. This is done by constructing commuting transfer matrices built out of a $R$-matrix satisfying the Yang-Baxter equation with additive spectral parameters. The $R$-matrix is non-local, as it is expressed in terms of Majorana fermions. It is also non-regular. Nevertheless, we show that the quantum inverse scattering method can still be suitably adapted. We then recursively obtain the conserved quantities [in the infinite volume] by the boost operator method. Remarkably, among the conserved charges we also find the Kramers-Wannier duality and other non-invertible symmetries for the periodic transverse field Ising model.</description>

      <title>Dyon Loops and Abelian Instantons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14867v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct Abelian gauge field configurations that carry non-zero instanton number. Each such "Abelian instanton" is generated by a closed magnetic worldline in four-dimensional Euclidean space, provided the Abelian gauge field has non-trivial winding along the closed worldline. The resulting field configuration corresponds to a Euclidean dyon loop featuring non-zero instanton number. We embed these dyon loops in a UV-complete theory using the Georgi-Glashow model and show that the full instanton charge is borne entirely by the unbroken $U(1)$ sector. In this same model, using a numerical relaxation procedure, we show that Euclidean dyon loops are a continuous deformation of small BPST instantons.</description>

      <title>Quantum Gravity Corrections to the Scalar Quasi-Normal Modes in Near-Extremal Reissener-Nordstr\"{o}m Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22945v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate quantum corrections to scalar quasi-normal modes (QNMs) in the near-extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole background with quantum correction in the near-horizon AdS$_2\times \mathrm{S}^2$ region. By performing a dimensional reduction, we obtain an effective Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity theory, whose quantum fluctuations are captured by the Schwarzian action. Using path integral techniques, we derive the quantum-corrected scalar field equation, which modifies the effective potential governing the QNMs. These corrections are extended from the near-horizon region to the full spacetime via a matching procedure. We compute the corrected QNMs using both the third-order WKB method and the Prony method and find consistent results. Our analysis reveals that quantum corrections can lead to substantial shifts in the real parts of QNM frequencies, particularly for small-mass or near-extremal black holes, while the imaginary parts remain relatively stable. This suggests that quantum gravity effects may leave observable imprints on black hole perturbation spectra, which could be potentially relevant for primordial or microscopic black holes.</description>

      <title>$T\bar{T}$-deformed correlators from a 2D gravity description</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16256v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study correlators in two-dimensional $T\bar{T}$-deformed conformal field theories by interpreting the $T\bar{T}$ deformation as a coupling to two-dimensional gravity. To demonstrate the utility of the massive gravity framework as a particular realization of the gravitational interpretation, we show how the $T\bar{T}$-deformed correlators at finite coupling can be computed by adopting a judicious parametrization of the 2D metric and a preferred choice of zweibeins. To illustrate how this method works in practice, we compute the leading logarithmic contributions to two- and three-point functions to all orders in the $T\bar{T}$ coupling, reproducing a known result while producing new findings. This framework generalizes the random geometry approach to finite coupling.</description>

      <title>Nonperturbative effects in $T\bar{T}$-deformed conformal field theories: A toy model for Planckian physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16262v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a nonperturbative completion of two-point correlators in $T\bar{T}$-deformed conformal field theories (CFTs), and analyze their behavior at distance scales shorter than the fundamental length scale set by the $T\bar{T}$ deformation. Building on the interpretation of the $T\bar{T}$ deformation as a coupling to two-dimensional quantum gravity with a unique built-in length scale, we advance the study of $T\bar{T}$-deformed CFTs as a toy model for Planckian physics. As we probe shorter distances, trans-Planckian oscillations are followed by a super-Planckian regime in which correlations are typically suppressed by geometric randomness, in contrast to the power-law growth characteristic of CFTs. Moreover, their dependence on distance becomes exponentially weaker, suggesting that the underlying geometric structure has been largely erased -- a behavior broadly consistent with expectations for quantum spacetime in this regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10228v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Entanglement and stabilizer entropy are both involved in the onset of complex behavior in quantum many-body systems. Their interplay is at the root of complexity of simulability, scrambling, thermalization and typicality. In this work, we study the dynamics of entanglement, stabilizer entropy, and the anti-flatness of the entanglement spectrum after a quantum quench in a spin chain. We find that free-fermion theories show a gap in the long-time behavior of these resources compared to their random matrix theory value while non-integrable models saturate it.</description>

      <title>Probing loop quantum effects through solar system experiments: observational signatures and parameter constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03218v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study investigates quantum gravity effects within the framework of an effective loop quantum gravity (LQG) black hole model parameterized by $\zeta$, utilizing precision measurements from solar system experiments and astrophysical observations. We analyze three classical tests of general relativity (GR): (1) Light deflection constrained by very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) observations of quasar radio signals, (2) Shapiro time delay measurements from the Cassini mission, and (3) Mercury's perihelion precession determined by MESSENGER mission data. Additionally, we extend our analysis to Earth-orbiting LAGEOS satellites and the relativistic trajectory of the S2 star orbiting the Galactic Center supermassive black hole Sagittarius $\rm{A}^*$ (Sgr $\rm{A}^{*}$). Our multi-probe approach reveals that the tightest constraint on the LQG parameter comes from Mercury's perihelion precession, yielding an upper bound $\zeta \lesssim 10^{-2}$. These results establish new observational benchmarks for probing quantum gravity effects.</description>

      <title>Finite time path field theory and a new type of universal quantum spin chain quench behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17402v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss different quench protocols for Ising and XY spin chains in a transverse magnetic field. With a sudden local magnetic field quench as a starting point, we generalize our approach to a large class of local non-sudden quenches. Using finite time path field theory (FTPFT) perturbative methods, we show that the difference between the sudden quench and a class of quenches with non-sudden switching on the perturbation vanishes exponentially with time, apart from non-substantial modifications that are systematically accounted for. As the consequence of causality and analytic properties of functions describing the discussed class of quenches, this is true at any order of perturbation expansion and thus for the resummed perturbation series. The only requirements on functions describing the perturbation strength switched on at a finite time $t=0$ are as follows: (1) their Fourier transform $f(p)$ is a function that is analytic everywhere in the lower complex semiplane, except at the simple pole at $p=0$ and possibly others with $\Im (p) &lt; 0$; and (2) $f(p)/p$ converges to zero at infinity in the lower complex semiplane. A prototypical function of this class is $\tanh(\eta t)$, to which the perturbation strength is proportional after the switching at time $t=0$. In the limit of large $\eta$, such a perturbation approaches the case of a sudden quench. It is shown that, because of this new type of universal behavior of Loschmidt echo (LE) that emerges in an exponentially short time scale, our previous results for the sudden local magnetic field quench of Ising and XY chains, obtained by the resummation of the perturbative expansion, extend in the long-time limit to all non-sudden quench protocols in this class, with non-substantial modifications systematically taken into account. We also show that analogous universal behavior exists in disorder quenches, and ultimately global ones.</description>

      <title>Asymgenesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10655v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a framework based on the standard type-I seesaw model that relates the baryon asymmetry of the universe to the dark matter (DM) density. The framework, which we name "Asymgenesis", relies on the presence of primordial charge asymmetries seeded either in the dark sector or in the visible sector. A higher-dimensional portal operator reshuffles this initial asymmetry into both sectors, eventually resulting in a nonzero $B-L$ asymmetry and an asymmetric DM component. Compared to conventional asymmetric-dark-matter (ADM) schemes, our framework imposes far milder requirements on the portal interaction. In particular, the portal interaction need not violate $B-L$, and the temperature scales of efficient $B-L$ violation and efficient charge-transfer interaction mediated by the portal operator can be separated. We develop the formalism in detail and argue that the flexibility of our framework enlarges the model-building landscape for ADM.</description>
