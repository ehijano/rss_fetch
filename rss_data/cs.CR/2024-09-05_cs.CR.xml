      <title>A Digital signature scheme based on Module-LWE and Module-SIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an improved version of the digital signature scheme proposed by Sharafi and Daghigh based on Module-LWE and Module-SIS problems. Our proposed signature scheme has a notably higher security level and smaller decoding failure probability, than the ones in the Sharaf-Daghigh scheme, at the expense of enlarging the module of the underlying basic ring.</description>

      <title>RAMBO: Leaking Secrets from Air-Gap Computers by Spelling Covert Radio Signals from Computer RAM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Air-gapped systems are physically separated from external networks, including the Internet. This isolation is achieved by keeping the air-gap computers disconnected from wired or wireless networks, preventing direct or remote communication with other devices or networks. Air-gap measures may be used in sensitive environments where security and isolation are critical to prevent private and confidential information leakage.
  In this paper, we present an attack allowing adversaries to leak information from air-gapped computers. We show that malware on a compromised computer can generate radio signals from memory buses (RAM). Using software-generated radio signals, malware can encode sensitive information such as files, images, keylogging, biometric information, and encryption keys. With software-defined radio (SDR) hardware, and a simple off-the-shelf antenna, an attacker can intercept transmitted raw radio signals from a distance. The signals can then be decoded and translated back into binary information. We discuss the design and implementation and present related work and evaluation results. This paper presents fast modification methods to leak data from air-gapped computers at 1000 bits per second. Finally, we propose countermeasures to mitigate this out-of-band air-gap threat.</description>

      <title>Dissecting Payload-based Transaction Phishing on Ethereum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, a more advanced form of phishing has arisen on Ethereum, surpassing early-stage, simple transaction phishing. This new form, which we refer to as payload-based transaction phishing (PTXPHISH), manipulates smart contract interactions through the execution of malicious payloads to deceive users. PTXPHISH has rapidly emerged as a significant threat, leading to incidents that caused losses exceeding \$70 million in 2023 reports. Despite its substantial impact, no previous studies have systematically explored PTXPHISH
  In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study of the PTXPHISH on Ethereum. Firstly, we conduct a long-term data collection and put considerable effort into establishing the first ground-truth PTXPHISH dataset, consisting of 5,000 phishing transactions. Based on the dataset, we dissect PTXPHISH, categorizing phishing tactics into four primary categories and eleven sub-categories. Secondly, we propose a rule-based multi-dimensional detection approach to identify PTXPHISH, achieving over 99% accuracy in the ground-truth dataset. Finally, we conducted a large-scale detection spanning 300 days and discovered a total of 130,637 phishing transactions on Ethereum, resulting in losses exceeding $341.9 million. Our in-depth analysis of these phishing transactions yielded valuable and insightful findings.
  Furthermore, our work has made significant contributions to mitigating real-world threats. We have reported 1,726 phishing addresses to the community, accounting for 42.7% of total community contributions during the same period. Additionally, we have sent 2,539 on-chain alert messages, assisting 1,980 victims. This research serves as a valuable reference in combating the emerging PTXPHISH and safeguarding users' assets.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Attacks on Machine Learning-Aided Visualizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Research in ML4VIS investigates how to use machine learning (ML) techniques to generate visualizations, and the field is rapidly growing with high societal impact. However, as with any computational pipeline that employs ML processes, ML4VIS approaches are susceptible to a range of ML-specific adversarial attacks. These attacks can manipulate visualization generations, causing analysts to be tricked and their judgments to be impaired. Due to a lack of synthesis from both visualization and ML perspectives, this security aspect is largely overlooked by the current ML4VIS literature. To bridge this gap, we investigate the potential vulnerabilities of ML-aided visualizations from adversarial attacks using a holistic lens of both visualization and ML perspectives. We first identify the attack surface (i.e., attack entry points) that is unique in ML-aided visualizations. We then exemplify five different adversarial attacks. These examples highlight the range of possible attacks when considering the attack surface and multiple different adversary capabilities. Our results show that adversaries can induce various attacks, such as creating arbitrary and deceptive visualizations, by systematically identifying input attributes that are influential in ML inferences. Based on our observations of the attack surface characteristics and the attack examples, we underline the importance of comprehensive studies of security issues and defense mechanisms as a call of urgency for the ML4VIS community.</description>

      <title>ResiLogic: Leveraging Composability and Diversity to Design Fault and Intrusion Resilient Chips</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A long-standing challenge is the design of chips resilient to faults and glitches. Both fine-grained gate diversity and coarse-grained modular redundancy have been used in the past. However, these approaches have not been well-studied under other threat models where some stakeholders in the supply chain are untrusted. Increasing digital sovereignty tensions raise concerns regarding the use of foreign off-the-shelf tools and IPs, or off-sourcing fabrication, driving research into the design of resilient chips under this threat model. This paper addresses a threat model considering three pertinent attacks to resilience: distribution, zonal, and compound attacks. To mitigate these attacks, we introduce the \texttt{ResiLogic} framework that exploits \textit{Diversity by Composability}: constructing diverse circuits composed of smaller diverse ones by design. This gives designer the capability to create circuits at design time without requiring extra redundancy in space or cost. Using this approach at different levels of granularity is shown to improve the resilience of circuit design in \texttt{ResiLogic} against the three considered attacks by a factor of five. Additionally, we also make a case to show how E-Graphs can be utilized to generate diverse circuits under given rewrite rules.</description>

      <title>Advancing Cyber Incident Timeline Analysis Through Rule Based AI and Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Timeline Analysis (TA) is a key part of Timeline Forensics (TF) in Digital Forensics (DF), focusing primarily on examining and analysing temporal digital artefacts such as timestamps, derived from event logs, file metadata, and other related data to correlate events resulting from cyber incidents and reconstruct their chronological timeline. Traditional tools often struggle to efficiently process the vast volume and variety of data acquired during DF investigations and Incident Response (IR) processes. This paper presents a novel framework, GenDFIR, that combines Rule-Based Artificial Intelligence (R-BAI) algorithms with Large Language Models (LLMs) to advance and automate the TA process. Our approach consists of two main stages (1) We use R-BAI to identify and select anomalous digital artefacts based on predefined rules. (2) The selected artefacts are then converted into embeddings for processing by an LLM with the help of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) agent. The LLM consequently leverages its capabilities to perform automated TA on the artefacts and predict potential incident scenarios. To validate our framework, we evaluate GenDFIR performance, efficiency, and reliability using various metrics across synthetic cyber incident simulation scenarios. This paper presents a proof of concept, where the findings demonstrate the significant potential of integrating R-BAI and LLMs for TA. This novel approach highlights the power of Generative AI (GenAI), specifically LLMs, and opens new avenues for advanced threat detection and incident reconstruction, representing a significant step forward in the field.</description>

      <title>SoK: Bitcoin Layer Two (L2)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) on constructing Layer Two (L2) solutions for Bitcoin.
  We carefully examine a representative subset of ongoing Bitcoin L2 solutions (40 out of 335 extensively investigated cases) and provide a concise yet impactful identification of six classic design patterns through two approaches (i.e., modifying transactions \&amp; creating proofs). Notably, we are the first to incorporate the inscription technology (emerged in mid-2023), along with a series of related innovations. We further establish a reference framework that serves as a baseline criterion ideally suited for evaluating the security aspects of Bitcoin L2 solutions, and which can also be extended to broader L2 applications. We apply this framework to evaluate each of the projects we investigated.
  We find that the inscription-based approaches introduce new functionality (i.e., programability) to Bitcoin systems, whereas existing proof-based solutions primarily address scalability challenges. Our security analysis reveals new attack vectors targeting data/state (availability, verification), assets (withdrawal, recovery), and users (disputes, censorship).</description>

      <title>Alignment-Aware Model Extraction Attacks on Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model extraction attacks (MEAs) on large language models (LLMs) have received increasing research attention lately. Existing attack methods on LLMs inherit the extraction strategies from those designed for deep neural networks (DNNs) yet neglect the inconsistency of training tasks between MEA and LLMs' alignments. As such, they result in poor attack performances. To tackle this issue, we present Locality Reinforced Distillation (LoRD), a novel model extraction attack algorithm specifically for LLMs. In particular, we design a policy-gradient-style training task, which utilizes victim models' responses as a signal to guide the crafting of preference for the local model. Theoretical analysis has shown that i) LoRD's convergence procedure in MEAs is consistent with the alignments of LLMs, and ii) LoRD can reduce query complexity while mitigating watermark protection through exploration-based stealing. Extensive experiments on domain-specific extractions demonstrate the superiority of our method by examining the extraction of various state-of-the-art commercial LLMs.</description>

      <title>RTFM: How hard are IoT platform providers making it for their developers?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Internet of Things (IoT) devices routinely have security issues, but are the platform designers providing enough support to IoT developers for them to easily implement security features for their platforms? We surveyed the documentation, code and guidance from nine IoT manufacturers to look at what guidance they provided for implementing three security features required by several security standards (secure boot, device identity keys and unique per device passwords). We find that more needs to be done to support developers if we want them to adopt security features -- especially in the face of incoming legislation that will require developers to implement them.</description>

      <title>Obsidian: Cooperative State-Space Exploration for Performant Inference on Secure ML Accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trusted execution environments (TEEs) for machine learning accelerators are indispensable in secure and efficient ML inference. Optimizing workloads through state-space exploration for the accelerator architectures improves performance and energy consumption. However, such explorations are expensive and slow due to the large search space. Current research has to use fast analytical models that forego critical hardware details and cross-layer opportunities unique to the hardware security primitives. While cycle-accurate models can theoretically reach better designs, their high runtime cost restricts them to a smaller state space.
  We present Obsidian, an optimization framework for finding the optimal mapping from ML kernels to a secure ML accelerator. Obsidian addresses the above challenge by exploring the state space using analytical and cycle-accurate models cooperatively. The two main exploration components include: (1) A secure accelerator analytical model, that includes the effect of secure hardware while traversing the large mapping state space and produce the best m model mappings; (2) A compiler profiling step on a cycle-accurate model, that captures runtime bottlenecks to further improve execution runtime, energy and resource utilization and find the optimal model mapping.
  We compare our results to a baseline secure accelerator, comprising of the state-of-the-art security schemes obtained from guardnn [ 33 ] and sesame [11]. The analytical model reduces the inference latency by 20.5% for a cloud and 8.4% for an edge deployment with an energy improvement of 24% and 19% respectively. The cycle-accurate model, further reduces the latency by 9.1% for a cloud and 12.2% for an edge with an energy improvement of 13.8% and 13.1%.</description>

      <title>J\"ager: Automated Telephone Call Traceback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unsolicited telephone calls that facilitate fraud or unlawful telemarketing continue to overwhelm network users and the regulators who prosecute them. The first step in prosecuting phone abuse is traceback -- identifying the call originator. This fundamental investigative task currently requires hours of manual effort per call. In this paper, we introduce J\"ager, a distributed secure call traceback system. J\"ager can trace a call in a few seconds, even with partial deployment, while cryptographically preserving the privacy of call parties, carrier trade secrets like peers and call volume, and limiting the threat of bulk analysis. We establish definitions and requirements of secure traceback, then develop a suite of protocols that meet these requirements using witness encryption, oblivious pseudorandom functions, and group signatures. We prove these protocols secure in the universal composibility framework. We then demonstrate that J\"ager has low compute and bandwidth costs per call, and these costs scale linearly with call volume. J\"ager provides an efficient, secure, privacy-preserving system to revolutionize telephone abuse investigation with minimal costs to operators.</description>

      <title>State Machine Mutation-based Testing Framework for Wireless Communication Protocols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes Proteus, a protocol state machine, property-guided, and budget-aware automated testing approach for discovering logical vulnerabilities in wireless protocol implementations. Proteus maintains its budget awareness by generating test cases (i.e., each being a sequence of protocol messages) that are not only meaningful (i.e., the test case mostly follows the desirable protocol flow except for some controlled deviations) but also have a high probability of violating the desirable properties. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we evaluated Proteus in two different protocol implementations, namely 4G LTE and BLE, across 23 consumer devices (11 for 4G LTE and 12 for BLE). Proteus discovered 26 unique vulnerabilities, including 113 instances. Affected vendors have positively acknowledged 12 vulnerabilities through 5 CVEs.</description>

      <title>SpecMon: Modular Black-Box Runtime Monitoring of Security Protocols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There exists a verification gap between formal protocol specifications and their actual implementations, which this work aims to bridge via monitoring for compliance to the formal specification. We instrument the networking and cryptographic library the application uses to obtain a stream of events. This is possible even without source code access. We then use an efficient algorithm to match these observations to traces that are valid in the specification model. In contrast to prior work, our algorithm can handle non-determinism and thus, multiple sessions. It also achieves a low overhead, which we demonstrate on the WireGuard reference implementation and a case study from prior work. We find that the reference Tamarin model for WireGuard can be used with little change: We only need to specify wire formats and correct some small inaccuracies that we discovered while conducting the case study. We also provide a soundness result for our algorithm that ensures it accepts only event streams that are valid according to the specification model.</description>

      <title>The Role of Transformer Models in Advancing Blockchain Technology: A Systematic Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02139v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As blockchain technology rapidly evolves, the demand for enhanced efficiency, security, and scalability grows.Transformer models, as powerful deep learning architectures,have shown unprecedented potential in addressing various blockchain challenges. However, a systematic review of Transformer applications in blockchain is lacking. This paper aims to fill this research gap by surveying over 200 relevant papers, comprehensively reviewing practical cases and research progress of Transformers in blockchain applications. Our survey covers key areas including anomaly detection, smart contract security analysis, cryptocurrency prediction and trend analysis, and code summary generation. To clearly articulate the advancements of Transformers across various blockchain domains, we adopt a domain-oriented classification system, organizing and introducing representative methods based on major challenges in current blockchain research. For each research domain,we first introduce its background and objectives, then review previous representative methods and analyze their limitations,and finally introduce the advancements brought by Transformer models. Furthermore, we explore the challenges of utilizing Transformer, such as data privacy, model complexity, and real-time processing requirements. Finally, this article proposes future research directions, emphasizing the importance of exploring the Transformer architecture in depth to adapt it to specific blockchain applications, and discusses its potential role in promoting the development of blockchain technology. This review aims to provide new perspectives and a research foundation for the integrated development of blockchain technology and machine learning, supporting further innovation and application expansion of blockchain technology.</description>

      <title>NoiseAttack: An Evasive Sample-Specific Multi-Targeted Backdoor Attack Through White Gaussian Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Backdoor attacks pose a significant threat when using third-party data for deep learning development. In these attacks, data can be manipulated to cause a trained model to behave improperly when a specific trigger pattern is applied, providing the adversary with unauthorized advantages. While most existing works focus on designing trigger patterns in both visible and invisible to poison the victim class, they typically result in a single targeted class upon the success of the backdoor attack, meaning that the victim class can only be converted to another class based on the adversary predefined value. In this paper, we address this issue by introducing a novel sample-specific multi-targeted backdoor attack, namely NoiseAttack. Specifically, we adopt White Gaussian Noise (WGN) with various Power Spectral Densities (PSD) as our underlying triggers, coupled with a unique training strategy to execute the backdoor attack. This work is the first of its kind to launch a vision backdoor attack with the intent to generate multiple targeted classes with minimal input configuration. Furthermore, our extensive experimental results demonstrate that NoiseAttack can achieve a high attack success rate against popular network architectures and datasets, as well as bypass state-of-the-art backdoor detection methods.

      <title>Learning Privacy-Preserving Student Networks via Discriminative-Generative Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While deep models have proved successful in learning rich knowledge from massive well-annotated data, they may pose a privacy leakage risk in practical deployment. It is necessary to find an effective trade-off between high utility and strong privacy. In this work, we propose a discriminative-generative distillation approach to learn privacy-preserving deep models. Our key idea is taking models as bridge to distill knowledge from private data and then transfer it to learn a student network via two streams. First, discriminative stream trains a baseline classifier on private data and an ensemble of teachers on multiple disjoint private subsets, respectively. Then, generative stream takes the classifier as a fixed discriminator and trains a generator in a data-free manner. After that, the generator is used to generate massive synthetic data which are further applied to train a variational autoencoder (VAE). Among these synthetic data, a few of them are fed into the teacher ensemble to query labels via differentially private aggregation, while most of them are embedded to the trained VAE for reconstructing synthetic data. Finally, a semi-supervised student learning is performed to simultaneously handle two tasks: knowledge transfer from the teachers with distillation on few privately labeled synthetic data, and knowledge enhancement with tangent-normal adversarial regularization on many triples of reconstructed synthetic data. In this way, our approach can control query cost over private data and mitigate accuracy degradation in a unified manner, leading to a privacy-preserving student model. Extensive experiments and analysis clearly show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Transfer-based Adversarial Poisoning Attacks for Online (MIMO-)Deep Receviers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02430v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, the design of wireless receivers using deep neural networks (DNNs), known as deep receivers, has attracted extensive attention for ensuring reliable communication in complex channel environments. To adapt quickly to dynamic channels, online learning has been adopted to update the weights of deep receivers with over-the-air data (e.g., pilots). However, the fragility of neural models and the openness of wireless channels expose these systems to malicious attacks. To this end, understanding these attack methods is essential for robust receiver design. In this paper, we propose a transfer-based adversarial poisoning attack method for online receivers.Without knowledge of the attack target, adversarial perturbations are injected to the pilots, poisoning the online deep receiver and impairing its ability to adapt to dynamic channels and nonlinear effects. In particular, our attack method targets Deep Soft Interference Cancellation (DeepSIC)[1] using online meta-learning. As a classical model-driven deep receiver, DeepSIC incorporates wireless domain knowledge into its architecture. This integration allows it to adapt efficiently to time-varying channels with only a small number of pilots, achieving optimal performance in a multi-input and multi-output (MIMO) scenario.The deep receiver in this scenario has a number of applications in the field of wireless communication, which motivates our study of the attack methods targeting it.Specifically, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our attack in simulations on synthetic linear, synthetic nonlinear, static, and COST 2100 channels. Simulation results indicate that the proposed poisoning attack significantly reduces the performance of online receivers in rapidly changing scenarios.</description>

      <title>AdvSecureNet: A Python Toolkit for Adversarial Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Several tools have been developed to research these vulnerabilities, but they often lack comprehensive features and flexibility. We introduce AdvSecureNet, a PyTorch based toolkit for adversarial machine learning that is the first to natively support multi-GPU setups for attacks, defenses, and evaluation. It is the first toolkit that supports both CLI and API interfaces and external YAML configuration files to enhance versatility and reproducibility. The toolkit includes multiple attacks, defenses and evaluation metrics. Rigiorous software engineering practices are followed to ensure high code quality and maintainability. The project is available as an open-source project on GitHub at https://github.com/melihcatal/advsecurenet and installable via PyPI.</description>

      <title>Recoverable Anonymization for Pose Estimation: A Privacy-Enhancing Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human pose estimation (HPE) is crucial for various applications. However, deploying HPE algorithms in surveillance contexts raises significant privacy concerns due to the potential leakage of sensitive personal information (SPI) such as facial features, and ethnicity. Existing privacy-enhancing methods often compromise either privacy or performance, or they require costly additional modalities. We propose a novel privacy-enhancing system that generates privacy-enhanced portraits while maintaining high HPE performance. Our key innovations include the reversible recovery of SPI for authorized personnel and the preservation of contextual information. By jointly optimizing a privacy-enhancing module, a privacy recovery module, and a pose estimator, our system ensures robust privacy protection, efficient SPI recovery, and high-performance HPE. Experimental results demonstrate the system's robust performance in privacy enhancement, SPI recovery, and HPE.</description>

      <title>Does the Vulnerability Threaten Our Projects? Automated Vulnerable API Detection for Third-Party Libraries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Developers usually use TPLs to facilitate the development of the projects to avoid reinventing the wheels, however, the vulnerable TPLs indeed cause severe security threats. The majority of existing research only considered whether projects used vulnerable TPLs but neglected whether the vulnerable code of the TPLs was indeed used by the projects, which inevitably results in false positives and further requires additional patching efforts and maintenance costs. To address this, we propose VAScanner, which can effectively identify vulnerable root methods causing vulnerabilities in TPLs and further identify all vulnerable APIs of TPLs used by Java projects. Specifically, we first collect the initial patch methods from the patch commits and extract accurate patch methods by employing a patch-unrelated sifting mechanism, then we further identify the vulnerable root methods for each vulnerability by employing an augmentation mechanism. Based on them, we leverage backward call graph analysis to identify all vulnerable APIs for each vulnerable TPL version and construct a database consisting of 90,749 (2,410,779 with library versions) vulnerable APIs with 1.45% false positive proportion with a 95% CI of [1.31%, 1.59%] from 362 TPLs with 14,775 versions. Our experiments show VAScanner eliminates 5.78% false positives and 2.16% false negatives owing to the proposed sifting and augmentation mechanisms. Besides, it outperforms the state-of-the-art method-level tool in analyzing direct dependencies, Eclipse Steady, achieving more effective detection of vulnerable APIs. Furthermore, in a large-scale analysis of 3,147 projects using vulnerable TPLs, we find only 21.51% of projects (with 1.83% false positive proportion and a 95% CI of [0.71%, 4.61%]) were threatened through vulnerable APIs by vulnerable TPLs, demonstrating that VAScanner can potentially reduce false positives significantly.</description>

      <title>Boosting Certificate Robustness for Time Series Classification with Efficient Self-Ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, the issue of adversarial robustness in the time series domain has garnered significant attention. However, the available defense mechanisms remain limited, with adversarial training being the predominant approach, though it does not provide theoretical guarantees. Randomized Smoothing has emerged as a standout method due to its ability to certify a provable lower bound on robustness radius under $\ell_p$-ball attacks. Recognizing its success, research in the time series domain has started focusing on these aspects. However, existing research predominantly focuses on time series forecasting, or under the non-$\ell_p$ robustness in statistic feature augmentation for time series classification~(TSC). Our review found that Randomized Smoothing performs modestly in TSC, struggling to provide effective assurances on datasets with poor robustness. Therefore, we propose a self-ensemble method to enhance the lower bound of the probability confidence of predicted labels by reducing the variance of classification margins, thereby certifying a larger radius. This approach also addresses the computational overhead issue of Deep Ensemble~(DE) while remaining competitive and, in some cases, outperforming it in terms of robustness. Both theoretical analysis and experimental results validate the effectiveness of our method, demonstrating superior performance in robustness testing compared to baseline approaches.</description>

      <title>CONClave -- Secure and Robust Cooperative Perception for CAVs Using Authenticated Consensus and Trust Scoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Connected Autonomous Vehicles have great potential to improve automobile safety and traffic flow, especially in cooperative applications where perception data is shared between vehicles. However, this cooperation must be secured from malicious intent and unintentional errors that could cause accidents. Previous works typically address singular security or reliability issues for cooperative driving in specific scenarios rather than the set of errors together. In this paper, we propose CONClave, a tightly coupled authentication, consensus, and trust scoring mechanism that provides comprehensive security and reliability for cooperative perception in autonomous vehicles. CONClave benefits from the pipelined nature of the steps such that faults can be detected significantly faster and with less compute. Overall, CONClave shows huge promise in preventing security flaws, detecting even relatively minor sensing faults, and increasing the robustness and accuracy of cooperative perception in CAVs while adding minimal overhead.</description>

      <title>Jailbreaking Prompt Attack: A Controllable Adversarial Attack against Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02928v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models can be maliciously used to generate harmful content such as sexually explicit, unfaithful, and misleading or Not-Safe-for-Work (NSFW) images. Previous attacks largely depend on the availability of the diffusion model or involve a lengthy optimization process. In this work, we investigate a more practical and universal attack that does not require the presence of a target model and demonstrate that the high-dimensional text embedding space inherently contains NSFW concepts that can be exploited to generate harmful images. We present the Jailbreaking Prompt Attack (JPA). JPA first searches for the target malicious concepts in the text embedding space using a group of antonyms generated by ChatGPT. Subsequently, a prefix prompt is optimized in the discrete vocabulary space to align malicious concepts semantically in the text embedding space. We further introduce a soft assignment with gradient masking technique that allows us to perform gradient ascent in the discrete vocabulary space.
  We perform extensive experiments with open-sourced T2I models, e.g. stable-diffusion-v1-4 and closed-sourced online services, e.g. DALLE2, Midjourney with black-box safety checkers. Results show that (1) JPA bypasses both text and image safety checkers (2) while preserving high semantic alignment with the target prompt. (3) JPA demonstrates a much faster speed than previous methods and can be executed in a fully automated manner. These merits render it a valuable tool for robustness evaluation in future text-to-image generation research.</description>

Abstract: Decentralized Intelligence Network (DIN) is a theoretical framework designed to address challenges in AI development, particularly focusing on data fragmentation and siloing issues. It facilitates effective AI training within sovereign data networks by overcoming barriers to accessing diverse data sources, leveraging: 1) personal data stores to ensure data sovereignty, where data remains securely within Participants' control; 2) a scalable federated learning protocol implemented on a public blockchain for decentralized AI training, where only model parameter updates are shared, keeping data within the personal data stores; and 3) a scalable, trustless cryptographic rewards mechanism on a public blockchain to incentivize participation and ensure fair reward distribution through a decentralized auditing protocol. This approach guarantees that no entity can prevent or control access to training data or influence financial benefits, as coordination and reward distribution are managed on the public blockchain with an immutable record. The framework supports effective AI training by allowing Participants to maintain control over their data, benefit financially, and contribute to a decentralized, scalable ecosystem that leverages collective AI to develop beneficial algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05997v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the advancements in quantum computing, transitioning to post-quantum cryptography is becoming increasingly critical to maintain the security of modern systems. This paper introduces a formal definition of the cryptographic migration problem and explores its complexities using a suitable directed graph model. Characteristics of the resulting migration graphs are analyzed and trade-offs discussed. By using classical mathematical results from combinatorics, probability theory and combinatorial analysis, we assess the challenges of migrating ``random'' large cryptographic IT-infrastructures. We show that any sufficiently large migration project that follows our model has an intrinsic complexity, either due to many dependent (comparatively easy) migration steps or due to at least one complicated migration step. This proves that in a suitable sense cryptographic migration is hard in general. Furthermore, we analyze the proposed model with respect to practical applicability and explain the difficulties that emerge when we try to model real-world migration projects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06240v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Decentralized Health Intelligence Network (DHIN) extends the Decentralized Intelligence Network (DIN) framework to address challenges in healthcare data sovereignty and AI utilization. Building upon DIN's core principles, DHIN introduces healthcare-specific components to tackle data fragmentation across providers and institutions, establishing a sovereign architecture for healthcare provision. It facilitates effective AI utilization by overcoming barriers to accessing diverse health data sources. This comprehensive framework leverages: 1) self-sovereign identity architecture coupled with a personal health record (PHR), extending DIN's personal data stores concept to ensure health data sovereignty; 2) a scalable federated learning (FL) protocol implemented on a public blockchain for decentralized AI training in healthcare, tailored for medical data; and 3) a scalable, trustless rewards mechanism adapted from DIN to incentivize participation in healthcare AI development. DHIN operates on a public blockchain with an immutable record, ensuring that no entity can control access to health data or determine financial benefits. It supports effective AI training while allowing patients to maintain control over their health data, benefit financially, and contribute to a decentralized ecosystem. Unique to DHIN, patients receive rewards in digital wallets as an incentive to opt into the FL protocol, with a long-term roadmap to fund decentralized insurance solutions. This approach introduces a novel, self-financed healthcare model that adapts to individual needs, complements existing systems, and redefines universal coverage, showcasing how DIN principles can transform healthcare data management and AI utilization while empowering patients.</description>

      <title>$\textit{MMJ-Bench}$: A Comprehensive Study on Jailbreak Attacks and Defenses for Vision Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08464v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As deep learning advances, Large Language Models (LLMs) and their multimodal counterparts, Vision-Language Models (VLMs), have shown exceptional performance in many real-world tasks. However, VLMs face significant security challenges, such as jailbreak attacks, where attackers attempt to bypass the model's safety alignment to elicit harmful responses. The threat of jailbreak attacks on VLMs arises from both the inherent vulnerabilities of LLMs and the multiple information channels that VLMs process. While various attacks and defenses have been proposed, there is a notable gap in unified and comprehensive evaluations, as each method is evaluated on different dataset and metrics, making it impossible to compare the effectiveness of each method. To address this gap, we introduce \textit{MMJ-Bench}, a unified pipeline for evaluating jailbreak attacks and defense techniques for VLMs. Through extensive experiments, we assess the effectiveness of various attack methods against SoTA VLMs and evaluate the impact of defense mechanisms on both defense effectiveness and model utility for normal tasks.

      <title>Different Victims, Same Layout: Email Visual Similarity Detection for Enhanced Email Protection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16945v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the pursuit of an effective spam detection system, the focus has often been on identifying known spam patterns either through rule-based detection systems or machine learning (ML) solutions that rely on keywords. However, both systems are susceptible to evasion techniques and zero-day attacks that can be achieved at low cost. Therefore, an email that bypassed the defense system once can do it again in the following days, even though rules are updated or the ML models are retrained. The recurrence of failures to detect emails that exhibit layout similarities to previously undetected spam is concerning for customers and can erode their trust in a company. Our observations show that threat actors reuse email kits extensively and can bypass detection with little effort, for example, by making changes to the content of emails. In this work, we propose an email visual similarity detection approach, named Pisco, to improve the detection capabilities of an email threat defense system. We apply our proof of concept to some real-world samples received from different sources. Our results show that email kits are being reused extensively and visually similar emails are sent to our customers at various time intervals. Therefore, this method could be very helpful in situations where detection engines that rely on textual features and keywords are bypassed, an occurrence our observations show happens frequently.</description>

      <title>Is Difficulty Calibration All We Need? Towards More Practical Membership Inference Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00426v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The vulnerability of machine learning models to Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) has garnered considerable attention in recent years. These attacks determine whether a data sample belongs to the model's training set or not. Recent research has focused on reference-based attacks, which leverage difficulty calibration with independently trained reference models. While empirical studies have demonstrated its effectiveness, there is a notable gap in our understanding of the circumstances under which it succeeds or fails. In this paper, we take a further step towards a deeper understanding of the role of difficulty calibration. Our observations reveal inherent limitations in calibration methods, leading to the misclassification of non-members and suboptimal performance, particularly on high-loss samples. We further identify that these errors stem from an imperfect sampling of the potential distribution and a strong dependence of membership scores on the model parameters. By shedding light on these issues, we propose RAPID: a query-efficient and computation-efficient MIA that directly \textbf{R}e-lever\textbf{A}ges the original membershi\textbf{P} scores to m\textbf{I}tigate the errors in \textbf{D}ifficulty calibration. Our experimental results, spanning 9 datasets and 5 model architectures, demonstrate that RAPID outperforms previous state-of-the-art attacks (e.g., LiRA and Canary offline) across different metrics while remaining computationally efficient. Our observations and analysis challenge the current de facto paradigm of difficulty calibration in high-precision inference, encouraging greater attention to the persistent risks posed by MIAs in more practical scenarios.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Vulnerability of Private Fine-Tuning in Split-Based Frameworks for Large Language Models: A Bidirectionally Enhanced Attack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00960v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in pre-trained large language models (LLMs) have significantly influenced various domains. Adapting these models for specific tasks often involves fine-tuning (FT) with private, domain-specific data. However, privacy concerns keep this data undisclosed, and the computational demands for deploying LLMs pose challenges for resource-limited data holders. This has sparked interest in split learning (SL), a Model-as-a-Service (MaaS) paradigm that divides LLMs into smaller segments for distributed training and deployment, transmitting only intermediate activations instead of raw data. SL has garnered substantial interest in both industry and academia as it aims to balance user data privacy, model ownership, and resource challenges in the private fine-tuning of LLMs. Despite its privacy claims, this paper reveals significant vulnerabilities arising from the combination of SL and LLM-FT: the Not-too-far property of fine-tuning and the auto-regressive nature of LLMs. Exploiting these vulnerabilities, we propose Bidirectional Semi-white-box Reconstruction (BiSR), the first data reconstruction attack (DRA) designed to target both the forward and backward propagation processes of SL. BiSR utilizes pre-trained weights as prior knowledge, combining a learning-based attack with a bidirectional optimization-based approach for highly effective data reconstruction. Additionally, it incorporates a Noise-adaptive Mixture of Experts (NaMoE) model to enhance reconstruction performance under perturbation. We conducted systematic experiments on various mainstream LLMs and different setups, empirically demonstrating BiSR's state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, we thoroughly examined three representative defense mechanisms, showcasing our method's capability to reconstruct private data even in the presence of these defenses.</description>

      <title>Locally Private Histograms in All Privacy Regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04888v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Frequency estimation, a.k.a. histograms, is a workhorse of data analysis, and as such has been thoroughly studied under differentially privacy. In particular, computing histograms in the \emph{local} model of privacy has been the focus of a fruitful recent line of work, and various algorithms have been proposed, achieving the order-optimal $\ell_\infty$ error in the high-privacy (small $\varepsilon$) regime while balancing other considerations such as time- and communication-efficiency. However, to the best of our knowledge, the picture is much less clear when it comes to the medium- or low-privacy regime (large $\varepsilon$), despite its increased relevance in practice. In this paper, we investigate locally private histograms, and the very related distribution learning task, in this medium-to-low privacy regime, and establish near-tight (and somewhat unexpected) bounds on the $\ell_\infty$ error achievable. As a direct corollary of our results, we obtain a protocol for histograms in the \emph{shuffle} model of differential privacy, with accuracy matching previous algorithms but significantly better message and communication complexity.
  Our theoretical findings emerge from a novel analysis, which appears to improve bounds across the board for the locally private histogram problem. We back our theoretical findings by an empirical comparison of existing algorithms in all privacy regimes, to assess their typical performance and behaviour beyond the worst-case setting.</description>

      <title>LLM Defenses Are Not Robust to Multi-Turn Human Jailbreaks Yet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15221v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent large language model (LLM) defenses have greatly improved models' ability to refuse harmful queries, even when adversarially attacked. However, LLM defenses are primarily evaluated against automated adversarial attacks in a single turn of conversation, an insufficient threat model for real-world malicious use. We demonstrate that multi-turn human jailbreaks uncover significant vulnerabilities, exceeding 70% attack success rate (ASR) on HarmBench against defenses that report single-digit ASRs with automated single-turn attacks. Human jailbreaks also reveal vulnerabilities in machine unlearning defenses, successfully recovering dual-use biosecurity knowledge from unlearned models. We compile these results into Multi-Turn Human Jailbreaks (MHJ), a dataset of 2,912 prompts across 537 multi-turn jailbreaks. We publicly release MHJ alongside a compendium of jailbreak tactics developed across dozens of commercial red teaming engagements, supporting research towards stronger LLM defenses.</description>
