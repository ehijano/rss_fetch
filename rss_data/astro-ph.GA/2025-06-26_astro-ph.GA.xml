      <title>Observability of Isolated Stellar-mass Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar-mass black holes (BHs) represent the natural end states of massive stars. It is estimated that $10^8$ stellar-mass BHs are present in the Milky Way galaxy, a significant fraction of which are expected to be isolated. Despite their expected abundance, only about 20 have been detected so far - mostly in binary systems - with just one confirmed isolated black hole (IsoBH) identified via astrometric microlensing. In this study, we investigate the potential for detecting electromagnetic emissions from IsoBHs by generating synthetic model spectra of their emissions in different types of interstellar medium environments. These model spectra are then compared with current observational capabilities. We show that photons emitted by IsoBHs - especially those accreting material in dense environments or within the Solar neighborhood - should be readily detectable. However, confidently identifying these sources remains highly challenging. We conclude that a number of IsoBHs must already exist in current astronomical catalogs but have not been identified as such. We outline possible strategies for detection and identification of IsoBHs using the current and upcoming telescopes.</description>

      <title>Compact Ionized Gas Region Surrounded by Porous Neutral Gas in a Dusty Lyman Break Galaxy at Redshift $z=8.312$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Porous interstellar medium (ISM) structure in galaxies at the epoch of reionization (EoR) gives us a hint to understand what types of galaxies contribute to reionization. Although recent studies have pointed out the positive correlation between high ionizing photon escape fractions and high [O III] $88~\mu\mathrm{m}$-to-[C II] $158~\mu\mathrm{m}$ ratios found in UV-luminous star-forming galaxies at $z &gt; 6$ with ALMA, previous studies have paid little attention to the neutral gas porosity that allows ionizing photons to escape. Here, we present a detailed analysis of a $z=8.312$ Lyman break galaxy, MACS0416_Y1 with a high $L_\mathrm{[OIII]88}/L_\mathrm{[CII]158}$ ratio ($\approx9$) and dust continuum detection. We construct a multi-phase ISM model incorporating the neutral gas covering fraction ($cov_\mathrm{PDR}$). The best-fit model reveals a $cov_\mathrm{PDR}\approx25 \%$, indicating that $\approx75 \%$ of the ionized gas region is exposed to intercloud space. We confirm that our conclusions hold even when varying star-formation history, stellar age, gas/stellar metallicity, and carbon-to-oxygen abundance ratio. This finding meets one of the necessary conditions for galaxies to have a non-zero escape fraction of ionizing photons and supports recent studies that galaxies with a high [O III] $88~\mu\mathrm{m}/$[C II] $158~\mu\mathrm{m}$ ratio, such as MACS0416_Y1, could contribute to cosmic reionization. Furthermore, the modeled H II region with the best-fitting parameters has a typical size ($D=0.90~\mathrm{pc}$) and gas density ($\log n_\mathrm{H,c}/\mathrm{cm^{-3}}=2.7$) that are comparable to local compact H II regions. This suggests that the H II regions in MACS0416_Y1 are in an early evolutionary stage.</description>

      <title>Dynamical friction and massive black hole orbits: analytical predictions and numerical solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the orbital decay of a massive BH embedded in a dark matter halo and a stellar bulge, using both analytical and numerical simulations with the aim of developing and validating a reliable dynamical friction (DF) correction across simulation resolutions. We develop a Python-based library to solve the equations of motion of the BH and provide an analytical framework for the numerical results. Then, we carry out simulations at different resolutions and for different softening choices using the Tree-PM code OpenGADGET3, where we implement an improved DF correction based on a kernel-weighted local density estimation. Our results demonstrate that the DF correction significantly accelerates BH sinking and ensures convergence with increasing resolution, closely matching analytical predictions. We find that in low-resolution regimes - particularly when the BH mass is smaller than that of the background particles - our DF model still effectively controls BH dynamics. Contrary to expectations, the inclusion of a stellar bulge can delay sinking due to numerical heating, an effect partially mitigated by the DF correction. We conclude that our refined DF implementation provides a robust framework for modeling BH dynamics both in controlled simulation setups of galaxies and in large-scale cosmological simulations. This will be crucial for future simulation campaigns, to enable more accurate predictions of AGN accretion and feedback, and to estimate gravitational-wave event rates.</description>

      <title>The Importance of the Population III Initial Mass Function in Determining the Characteristics of the Earliest Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use large-scale cosmological simulations to study the prospect of observing Population III (Pop III) bright galaxies with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). To quantify the impact of radiative transfer (RT), we compare a simulation that includes moment-based RT with one in which RT is handled approximately. Both simulations include a subgrid model of turbulent mixing, which is essential in tracking the formation of Pop III stars. We find that RT has a minor impact on our results and that the overall star formation rate densities for both simulations are in fair agreement with observations and other simulations. While our overall galaxy luminosity functions are consistent with current high-redshift observations, we predict a drop of a factor of at least 6 in detectable galaxy counts at $z = 14$ as compared to $z = 12$ at $M_{ab}$ $\le$ -16. Modeling Pop III stars according to a lognormal, top-heavy initial mass function (IMF), we find that these stars contribute no more than about 1 percent of the flux of potentially detectable lensed galaxies at $z = 12$-14 with $M_{ab} \le -15$. This is because a top-heavy Pop III IMF results in 99 percent of Pop III stellar mass being recycled within 10 Myr, well before the approx. 30 Myr timescale on which galaxies recover from supernova feedback and heating. These effects conspire to quickly extinguish Pop III star formation, making their detection difficult even for JWST.</description>

      <title>The Low Mass Dwarf Host Galaxy of Non-Repeating FRB 20230708A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Very Large Telescope/X-Shooter spectroscopy for the host galaxies of 12 fast radio bursts (FRBs) detected by the Australian SKA Pathfinder (ASKAP) observed through the ESO Large Programme "FURBY", which imposes strict selection criteria on the included FRBs and their host galaxies to produce a homogeneous and well-defined sample. We describe the data reduction and analysis of these spectra and report their redshifts, line-emission fluxes, and derived host properties. From the present sample, this paper focuses on the faint host of FRB ($m_R = 22.53 \pm 0.02$) identified at low redshift ($z=0.1050$). This indicates an intrinsically very low-luminosity galaxy ($L \approx 10^8 L_\odot$), making it the lowest-luminosity non-repeating FRB host to date by a factor of $\sim 3$, and slightly dimmer than the lowest-luminosity host for repeating FRBs. Our SED fitting analysis reveals a low stellar mass ($M_* \approx 10^{8.0} M_\odot$), low star formation rate (${\rm SFR} \approx 0.04 M_\odot \rm yr^{-1}$), and very low metallicity ($12+\log(\text{O}/\text{H})\sim(7.99-8.3)$), distinct from the more massive galaxies ($\log(M/M_\odot) \sim 10$) that are commonly identified for non-repeating FRBs. Its discovery demonstrates that FRBs can arise in among the faintest, metal-poor galaxies of the universe. In turn, this suggests that at least one FRB progenitor channel must include stars (or their remnants) created in very low metallicity environments. This indicates better prospects for detecting FRBs from the high-$z$ universe where young, low-mass galaxies proliferate.</description>

      <title>Blowing star formation away in AGN Hosts (BAH) -- III: Feeding and feedback in 3C\:293 observed with JWST NIRSpec</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use JWST/NIRSpec observations of the radio galaxy 3C 293 to map the emission, extinction, and kinematics of hot molecular and ionized gas, as well as stellar kinematics, within the inner ~ 2 kpc. The stellar velocity field is well described by a rotating disk model, with its kinematical center offset by ~ 0.5 arcsec from the continuum peak. The hot molecular gas is traced by the H$_2$2.12$\mu$m emission line, and the ionized gas by [Fe II]1.64$\mu$m and Pa$\alpha$. The gas presents three main kinematic components: a rotating disk seen as a narrow component ($\sigma$ ~ 100 kms$^{-1}$); a blueshifted broad outflow ($\sigma$ ~ 250 kms$^{-1}$); and a fast ionized outflow as a very broad component ($\sigma$ ~ 640 kms$^{-1}$). Extinction maps reveal high A$_V$ values, up to ~ 35, spatially coincident with dust lanes seen in optical images. In addition to the disk and outflows components, inflows along the dust lanes are detected in H$_2$ gas, with a mass inflow rate of $\dot{M}_{in}$ ~ 8 x 10$^{-3}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, comparable to the AGN accretion rate. For the outflows, we derive peak mass-outflow rates of 0.14 $\pm$ 0.04 M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$ (molecular) and 5.5 $\pm$ 1.44 M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$ (ionized). The outflow, driven by the radio jet, has a kinetic power of 4.5% of the jet power - enough to suppress star formation. Our results highlight 3C 293's turbulent post-merger history and JWST's unique capability to probe dust-obscured AGN.</description>

      <title>ALMA Observations of Molecular Complexity in the Large Magellanic Cloud: Probing the Star-forming Region N160</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hot cores are small ($\lesssim$0.1 pc), dense ($\geq$10$^6$ cm$^{-3}$), and hot ($&gt;$100 K) regions around massive protostars and are one of the main production sites of complex organic molecules (COMs, $\geq6$ atoms, including carbon). The Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is an ideal place to study hot core and COM formation in an environment that is different from our Galaxy, though prior to this study there have only been nine detections of extragalactic hot cores (seven in the LMC and two in the Small Magellanic Cloud, SMC). Here, we report 1.2 mm continuum and molecular line observations with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in the star-forming region N160 that we named N160A-mm. We identify six 1.2 mm continuum sources, four of which are associated with methanol (CH$_3$OH) emission. Another COM, methyl cyanide (CH$_3$CN) is associated with the brightest source, N160A-mmA, the most chemically rich source in the field. Using the XCLASS software, we perform spectral modeling to estimate rotational temperatures and total column densities of detected molecular species for four sources. Based on the temperature exceeding 100 K, small size, and high H$_2$ number density, we identify N160A-mmA as a hot core. We compare the molecular abundances of this newly detected hot core with those previously detected in the LMC and SMC, as well as with a sample of Galactic hot cores, and discuss the complex nature of N160A-mmA.</description>

      <title>A Glimpse of Satellite Galaxies in the Milky Way with the 2.5-meter Wide Field Survey Telescope (WFST): Bootes III and Draco</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We carry out deep imaging of the Milky Way satellite galaxies, Bootes III and Draco, with WFST as one pilot observing program to demonstrate the capability of WFST. Combining catalogs with PS1 DR2 and Gaia DR3, we derive proper motions for candidate member stars in these two satellite galaxies over a 12-year time baseline, yielding uncertainties of ~1.8 mas/yr at 21 mag and ~3.0 mas/yr at 22 mag in the r band. The proper motions derived from bright and faint stars are consistent, indicating no significant variation in proper motion across stellar luminosity as these galaxies undergo tidal interactions with the MW. Meanwhile, we suggest that Bootes III represents the bound remnant of the progenitor galaxy that gave rise to the Styx stream, as evidenced by its elongated density profile and overdensity in both spatial and kinematic space. This is the first paper to use WFST to measure the proper motions of faint stars in Milky Way satellite galaxies. More detailed analyses will be presented in forthcoming papers from the wide field survey (WFS) program.</description>

      <title>Balmer Decrement and IRX Break in Tracing Dust Attenuation at Scales of Individual Star-forming Regions in NGC 628</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the relationships between infrared excess (IRX=$L_{\rm IR}/L_{\rm UV}$) and Balmer decrement (${\rm H}\alpha/{\rm H}\beta$) as indicators of dust attenuation for 609 ${\rm {H\,{\small II}}}$ regions at scales of $\sim 50-200$ pc in NGC 628, utilizing data from AstroSat, James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE). Our findings indicate that about three fifths of the sample ${\rm {H\,{\small II}}}$ regions reside within the regime occupied by local star-forming galaxies (SFGs) along the dust attenuation correlation described by their corresponding color excess parameters $E(B-V)_{\rm IRX} = 0.51\,E(B-V)_{{\rm H}\alpha/{\rm H}\beta}$. Nearly 27$\%$ of the sample exhibits $E(B-V)_{\rm IRX}&gt; E(B-V)_{{\rm H}\alpha/{\rm H}\beta}$, while a small fraction ($\sim 13\%$) displays significantly lower $E(B-V)_{\rm IRX}$ compared to $E(B-V)_{{\rm H}\alpha/{\rm H}\beta}$. These results suggest that the correlation between the two dust attenuation indicators no longer holds for spatially resolved ${\rm {H\,{\small II}}}$ regions. Furthermore, the ratio of $E(B-V)_{\rm IRX}$ to $E(B-V)_{{\rm H}\alpha/{\rm H}\beta}$ remains unaffected by various physical parameters of the ${\rm {H\,{\small II}}}$ regions, including star formation rate (SFR), SFR surface density, infrared luminosity ($L_{\rm IR}$), $L_{\rm IR}$ surface density, stellar mass, gas-phase metallicity, circularized radius, and the distance to galactic center. We argue that the ratio is primarily influenced by the evolution of surrounding interstellar medium (ISM) of the star-forming regions, transitioning from an early dense and thick phase to the late blown-away stage.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Machine Learning for Accurate and Fast Stellar Mass Estimation of Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unveiling the evolutionary history of galaxies necessitates a precise understanding of their physical properties. Traditionally, astronomers achieve this through spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting. However, this approach can be computationally intensive and time-consuming, particularly for large datasets. This study investigates the viability of machine learning (ML) algorithms as an alternative to traditional SED-fitting for estimating stellar masses in galaxies. We compare a diverse range of unsupervised and supervised learning approaches including prominent algorithms such as K-means, HDBSCAN, Parametric t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (Pt-SNE), Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Random Forest, and Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) against the well-established LePhare code, which performs SED-fitting as a benchmark. We train various ML algorithms using simple model SEDs in photometric space, generated with the BC03 code. These trained algorithms are then employed to estimate the stellar masses of galaxies within a subset of the COSMOS survey dataset. The performance of these ML methods is subsequently evaluated and compared with the results obtained from LePhare, focusing on both accuracy and execution time. Our evaluation reveals that ML algorithms can achieve comparable accuracy to LePhare while offering significant speed advantages (1,000 to 100,000 times faster). K-means and HDBSCAN emerge as top performers among our selected ML algorithms. Supervised learning algorithms like Random Forest and manifold learning techniques such as Pt-SNE and SOM also show promising results. These findings suggest that ML algorithms hold significant promise as a viable alternative to traditional SED-fitting methods for estimating the stellar masses of galaxies.</description>

      <title>A Joint JWST and HST View of Omega Centauri: Multiple Stellar Populations and Their Kinematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We combine F115W and F277W images collected with the Near Infrared Camera of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) with multi-band, multi-epoch Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations of Omega Centauri to investigate its multiple stellar populations and internal kinematics. Our study focuses on a region spanning $\sim$0.9 to $\sim$2.3 half-light radii from the cluster center, largely unexplored by HST and JWST. Using chromosome maps, we identify the principal populations along the upper main sequence and among M-dwarfs, distinguishing lower-stream (LS) stars, chemically akin to first-generation globular cluster stars with similar metallicities, and upper-stream (US) stars, enriched in helium and nitrogen but oxygen-poor. Both streams also host subpopulations with varying metallicities. We find radially anisotropic motions, with US stars exhibiting significantly stronger anisotropy than LS stars. Subdividing the US into extreme and intermediate light-element populations reveals a gradient in anisotropy, with intermediate stars lying between the LS and extreme US populations. However, metal-rich and metal-poor stars within each stream show moderate kinematic differences. The LS stars show higher angular momentum and dispersion compared to US stars, and also exhibit stronger systemic rotation and tangential proper-motion skewness, further highlighting their kinematic divergence. Finally, leveraging a mass range of $\sim$0.15 - 0.7 solar masses, we detect a low degree of energy equipartition for all cluster stars, which decreases with radial distance from the cluster center.</description>

      <title>Accreted Globular Clusters and Horizontal Branch Morphology in the Outer Halo of M31</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: M31 hosts a rich population of outer halo ($R_{\rm{proj}} &gt; 25$ kpc) globular clusters (GCs), many of which show strong evidence for spatial and/or kinematical associations with large-scale tidal debris features. We present deep Hubble Space Telescope photometry of 48 halo GCs, including 18 with clear ties to stellar streams and 13 with potential associations. Using the colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs), we quantify the horizontal branch (HB) morphologies and employ new empirical relationships, calibrated on Milky Way (MW) GCs, to consistently derive metallicities and line-of-sight extinctions. We find a remarkable correlation between HB morphology and the presence of substructure: GCs with very red HBs are almost exclusively associated with substructure, while non-substructure GCs have extended blue HBs. This provides the first direct evidence that red HB halo clusters originate from satellite accretion, a notion introduced nearly 50 years ago from MW studies which has remained unconfirmed until now. In addition to a more metal-rich tail, the substructure GC sample also contains a few clusters with very low metallicities and red HBs, unlike any objects known in the MW. We suggest these are recently accreted young clusters, supporting the growing evidence that M31 has experienced a more prolonged accretion history than the MW.</description>

      <title>Hiding behind a curtain of dust: Gas and dust properties of an ultra-luminous strongly-lensed z = 3.75 galaxy behind the Milky Way disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed analysis of J154506, a strongly lensed submillimeter galaxy (SMG) behind the Lupus-I molecular cloud, and characterization of its physical properties. Using a combination of archival and new data (including sub-arcsecond resolution ($\sim0.75$) ALMA observations, VLT/MUSE and FORS2 optical data, as well as spectral scans from the ACA and the LMT) we identify two high-significance (SNR&gt;5) emission lines at 97.0 and 145.5 GHz, corresponding to CO(4-3) and CO(6-5), respectively. These detections yield a spectroscopic redshift of $z_{\rm{spec}}=3.7515\pm 0.0005$. We also report the detection of the [CII] 158 $\mu$m fine-structure line at 400 GHz using the Atacama Pathfinder Experiment (APEX), further confirming the redshift and providing insights into J154506's physical properties. By modeling ALMA Band 6 and 7 continuum data in the uv-plane, we derive an average magnification factor of $6.0 \pm 0.4$ and our analysis reveals a relatively cold dust ($\sim$37 K) in a starburst galaxy with a high intrinsic dust mass ($\sim2.5\times10^{9}~\rm{M}_{\odot}$) and infrared (IR) luminosity ($\sim6\times10^{12}~\rm{L}_{\odot}$). The dust SED is best reproduced by a model dominated by moderately dense molecular gas ($10^2-10^4\rm{cm}^{-3}$), indicating that the far-infrared emission arises primarily from diffuse regions rather than compact, high-pressure environments typical of extreme starbursts or AGN. This is supported by the close-to-unity ratio between the dust and kinetic temperatures, which argues against highly energetic heating mechanisms. The CO excitation ladder peaks close to CO(5-4) and is dominated by slightly denser molecular gas. Our results underscore the unique power of far-IR and submillimeter observations to both uncover and characterize scarce, strongly lensed, high-redshift galaxies, even when obscured by foreground molecular clouds.</description>

      <title>Probing Obscured Star Formation in Galaxy Clusters Using JWST Medium Band Images: 3.3$\mu\rm m$ PAH Emitter Sample in Abell 2744</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Star-forming galaxies in galaxy clusters play a crucial role in understanding the advanced stages of galaxy evolution within dense environments. We present a sample of 3.3$\mu$m PAH-bright galaxies in the Abell 2744 (A2744) galaxy cluster. Using F430M medium band images, we select PAH emitters in the galaxy cluster, which capture the 3.3$\mu$m PAH emission at the redshift of A2744. Our multi-wavelength study demonstrates consistent star formation rates (SFRs) derived from PAH emission and SED fitting, indicating the 3.3 $\mu$m PAH flux estimated from medium band image alone can reveal the entirety of star formation, immune to dust obscuration. We find that the PAH emitters are located in relatively low mass surface density regions of A2744, with SFRs aligning with the field star-forming main sequence at $z=0.3$. The PAH emission morphologies show more asymmetry than that of the F444W image when asymmetry index $&gt; 0.4$. With these results, we suggest that these star-forming galaxies in A2744 are in the stage of falling into the cluster from the field, and have not been quenched yet. We further explore a potential link between these galaxies and cosmic filaments being accreted onto the cluster, which may channel gas inflows to fuel star formation. JWST medium-band imaging provides a powerful new tool for identifying heavily dust-obscured star-forming populations. Future HI and low-J CO observations should be prioritized to resolve the cold gas kinematics and star formation processes in these systems, which would directly test the role of environmental stripping versus filamentary gas supply.</description>

      <title>An H$\alpha$ Cloud in the HI Tail: Recent Star Formation in the Outskirts of NGC 4258 Revealed by Nanshan 1-m Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present first-light deep H$\alpha$ imaging taken with the Nanshan 1-meter wide-field telescope on the local galaxy NGC 4258, alongside archival data from Hubble Space telescope (HST), Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope, and The Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey. The H$\alpha$ image shows ongoing star formation not only inside the galaxy but also in an HI cloud in the eastern HI tail, which is roughly 16 kpc away from the main galaxy. The HST images reveal several ultra-blue compact objects ($\rm F555W - F814W &lt;-0.5 mag,\, FWHM\sim 0.2''$) in the H$\alpha$ bright region, aligned with the HI tail, suggesting the presence of young open cluster candidate in the HI tail. Our results suggest that wide field H$\alpha$ imaging is a valuable tool for investigating recent star formation in the extended regions of NGC 4258. Furthermore, the star formation in diffuse HI tails could highlight an potential aspect of galaxy stellar halo formation, warranting further investigation of the impact of star formation in halos on galaxy evolution.</description>

      <title>Rubidium Abundances in Cool Giants from High-Resolution H-band Spectra: A New Diagnostic for Galactic Chemical Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Galactic Center and inner disk of the Milky Way contain complex stellar populations obscured by heavy dust extinction. To study their chemical composition, high-resolution near-infrared (near-IR) spectroscopy is necessary. Expanding the set of elements measurable in the near-IR, especially neutron-capture elements, improves our ability to trace nucleosynthesis and Galactic chemical evolution. This work aims to identify and characterize a spectral line suitable for determining rubidium (Rb) abundances. Rb is produced in roughly equal parts by the r- and s-processes. We analyze high-resolution (R = 45,000) IGRINS near-IR spectra of 40 M giants in the solar neighborhood, most observed with Gemini South. We perform spectral synthesis of the Rb I line at 15289.48 A, using new log(gf) values and including an astrophysical calibration of the blending Fe I lines. The resulting [Rb/Fe] ratios are compared to other neutron-capture elements and interpreted with chemical evolution models. We demonstrate that the used Rb line is a reliable abundance indicator in M giants and the coolest K giants, but becomes too weak at higher temperatures. [Rb/Fe] shows a decreasing trend with metallicity, mirroring that of ytterbium (Yb), another mixed r-/s-process element. Our results agree with optical studies, validating the use of this near-IR line. Comparisons with chemical evolution models confirm that both s- and r-process sources are needed to explain the Rb trend. This work adds Rb to the list of elements measurable in high-resolution H- and K-band spectra, enabling studies of one more neutron-capture element in dust-obscured regions like the Galactic Center and inner disk.</description>

      <title>Investigating the clumpy star formation in an interacting dwarf irregular galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clumpy morphologies are more frequent in distant and low-mass star-forming galaxies. Therefore the less numerous nearby galaxies presenting kpc-sized clumps represent unique laboratories from which to address the mechanisms driving clump formation and study why such structures become less common in the local Universe, and why they tend to exhibit smaller sizes and lower star formation rates compared to their high-$z$ counterparts. We use high spatial resolution Integral Field Unit observations from VLT/MUSE to investigate the properties of several kpc-sized clumps seen in SDSS J020536-081424, a $z \approx 0.04$ dwarf irregular galaxy interacting with its more massive companion Mrk 1172 ($\log (M/M_{\odot}) \sim 11$). H$\alpha$ channel maps reveal that the clumps are embedded within a rotating ionised gas component, possibly a disk. Self-consistent full-spectral fitting of the clump spectra with $\mathrm{FADO}$ indicates that their young ($t \leq 10$ Myr) populations have lower stellar metallicities compared to the older ($t \gtrsim 100$ Myr) ones, although these estimates are subject to significant degeneracies. The clumpy SF in SDSS J020536-081424 seems to occur in the disk, which dominates the stellar emission. Gas-phase metallicities derived through strong-line calibrations exhibit a flat distribution around $Z_{\mathrm{gas}} \approx 0.3\,Z_{\odot}$, likely caused by efficient galactic-scale metal mixing processes. There is no evidence for a strong anti-correlation between $Z_{\mathrm{gas}}$ and $\mathrm{SFR}$, although clump sizes are likely overestimated due to seeing limitations. The lower $Z_{\ast}$ of younger stellar populations compared to the disk suggests clump formation driven by accretion of metal-poor gas in SDSS J020536-081424.</description>

      <title>Element nucleosynthetic origins from abundance spatial distributions beyond the Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An element's astrophysical origin should be reflected in the spatial distribution of its abundance, yielding measurably different spatial distributions for elements with different nucleosynthetic sites. However, most extragalactic multi-element analyses of gas-phase abundances to date have been limited to small numbers of sightlines, making statistical characterization of differences in spatial distributions of elements impossible. Here we use integrated field spectroscopic data covering the full face of the nearby dwarf galaxy NGC 5253 sampled at 3.5-pc resolution to produce maps of the abundances of oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur using independent direct methods. We find strong evidence for differences in the elements' spatial statistics that mirror their predicted nucleosynthetic origins: the spatial distributions of oxygen and sulfur, both predominantly produced in core-collapse supernovae, indicate that initial injection occurs on larger scales than for nitrogen, which is predominantly produced by asymptotic giant branch stars. All elements are well-correlated but oxygen and sulfur are much better correlated with each other than with nitrogen, consistent with recent results for stellar abundances in the Milky Way. These findings both open a new avenue to test nucleosynthetic models, and make predictions for the structure of stellar chemical abundance distributions.</description>

      <title>Sifting for a Stream: The Morphology of the $300S$ Stellar Stream</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar streams are sensitive laboratories for understanding the small-scale structure in our Galaxy's gravitational field. Here, we analyze the morphology of the $300S$ stellar stream, which has an eccentric, retrograde orbit and thus could be an especially powerful probe of both baryonic and dark substructures within the Milky Way. Due to extensive background contamination from the Sagittarius stream (Sgr), we perform an analysis combining Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey photometry, $\textit{Gaia}$ DR3 proper motions, and spectroscopy from the Southern Stellar Stream Spectroscopic Survey ($\textit{S}^5$). We redetermine the stream coordinate system and distance gradient, then apply two approaches to describe $300S$'s morphology. In the first, we analyze stars from $\textit{Gaia}$ using proper motions to remove Sgr. In the second, we generate a simultaneous model of $300S$ and Sgr based purely on photometric information. Both approaches agree within their respective domains and describe the stream over a region spanning $33^\circ$. Overall, $300S$ has three well-defined density peaks and smooth variations in stream width. Furthermore, $300S$ has a possible gap of $\sim 4.7^\circ$ and a kink. Dynamical modeling of the kink implies that $300S$ was dramatically influenced by the Large Magellanic Cloud. This is the first model of $300S$'s morphology across its entire known footprint, opening the door for deeper analysis to constrain the structures of the Milky Way.</description>

      <title>Low-metallicity massive single stars with rotation. III. Source of ionization and C-IV emission in I Zw 18</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chemically-homogeneously evolving stars have been proposed to account for several exotic phenomena, including gravitational-wave emissions and gamma-ray bursts. Here we study whether these stars can explain the metal-poor dwarf galaxy, I Zwicky 18. We apply our synthetic spectral models from Paper II to (i) establish a classification sequence for these hot stars, (ii) predict the photonionizing flux and the strength of emission lines from a IZw18-like stellar population, and (iii) compare our predictions to available observations of this galaxy. Adding two new models computed with PoWR, we report (i) these stars to follow a unique sequence of classes: O-&gt;WN-&gt;WO (i.e. without ever being WC). From our population synthesis with standard assumptions, we predict that (ii) the source of the UV C-IV and other emission bumps is a couple dozen WO-type Wolf-Rayet stars (not WC as previously assumed) which are the result of chem.-hom. evolution, while these, combined with the rest of the O-star population, account for the He-II ionizing flux and spectral hardness. Contrasting our results against published optical and UV data and accounting for different aperture sizes and spatial regions probed by the observations, we find that (iii) our models are highly consistent with them. Since our "massive Pop II stars" might just as well exist in early star-forming regions, our findings have implications for upcoming JWST surveys; and given that our results apply for binary populations too as long as the same fraction (10%) of the systems evolves chem. homogeneously, we conclude that the stellar progenitors of gravitational waves may very well exist today in IZw18.</description>

      <title>Achieving Gender Representation in Lead-Author Publications in the ASTRO3D Centre of Excellence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the publication rates of 400 research-focused members in the ASTRO3D Centre of Excellence by gender, project, and year from January 2018 to January 2024 (six years). Of the 443 refereed publications led by ASTRO3D members, women were first-author on 38% which is nearly double that of the astronomy field in the same period (~20%). We record a high-water mark in 2022: 46% of ASTRO3D publications were led by females and 45% of research members identified as female. Using the nine research projects in ASTRO3D, we show that the combination of female leadership and higher fraction of female members correlates with a higher fraction of female-led publications. We find no correlation between the fraction of female-led publications and project size. Our findings demonstrate that gender representation in refereed publications can be achieved within ~5 years by combining evidence-based recruitment strategies with representation in supervisors and collaborations. We recommend that strategies for improving STEM participation focus on both female leadership and female representation to maximize effectiveness.</description>

      <title>James Webb Space Telescope observations of the white dwarf cooling sequence of 47 Tucanae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a study of the white dwarf (WD) cooling sequence of the globular cluster 47 Tucanae (47 Tuc or NGC 104) using deep infrared observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). By combining these data with ultra-deep optical imaging from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) taken ~12 years earlier, we derived precise proper motions (PMs) and isolated a clean sample of WD cluster members. We estimated the cluster's age by comparing the observed WD cooling sequence luminosity function (LF), derived from JWST photometry, with theoretical models, obtaining a value of 11.8 +/- 0.5 Gyr, in agreement with main sequence turn-off ages, and ages determined from the masses and radii of two eclipsing binaries in the cluster. The age determined from the infrared LF is consistent with the optical LF based on the HST photometry. However, small discrepancies exist between the shape of the observed and theoretical LFs. To investigate these differences, we tested the cooling times of WD models populating the bright part of the observed cooling sequence against a semi-empirical calibration from the literature, based on bright WDs in 47 Tuc, finding agreement within less than 2 sigma. A more detailed analysis of dynamical effects and the impact of multiple stellar populations on the WD mass distribution in the observed field will be essential for addressing this discrepancy in future studies.</description>

This is fundamental for many astrophysical issues on all scales, ranging from stellar evolution to the chemical composition, formation and evolution of stellar clusters and galaxies. Among these processes, convective-envelope overshooting is in dire need of a systematic calibration and comparison with predictions from multi-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations. The Red Giant Branch bump (RGBb) is an ideal calibrator of overshooting processes, since its luminosity depends on the maximum depth reached by the convective envelope after the first dredge-up. Indeed, a more efficient overshooting produces a discontinuity in the Hydrogen mass fraction profile deeper in the stellar interior and consequently a less luminous RGBb. In this work, we calibrated the overshooting efficiency by comparing the RGBb location predicted by stellar models with observations of stellar clusters with HST and Gaia photometry, as well as solar-like oscillating giants in the Kepler field. We explored the metallicity range between -2.02 dex and +0.35 dex and found overshooting efficiencies ranging from $0.009^{+0.015}_{-0.016}$ to $0.062^{+0.017}_{-0.015}$. In particular, we found that the overshooting efficiency decreases linearly with [M/H], with a slope of $(-0.010\pm0.006)$ dex$^{-1}$. We suggest a possible explanation for this trend, linking it to the efficiency of turbulent entrainment at different metallicities.</description>

      <title>Stellar Dynamics in Open Clusters Increases the Binary Fraction and Mass Ratios: Evidence from Photometric Binaries in 35 Open Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the Bayesian Analysis of Stellar Evolution-9 (BASE-9) code and Gaia DR3, Pan-STARRS, and 2MASS data, we identify photometric binaries in 35 open clusters (OCs) and constrain their masses. We find a strong correlation between the binary fraction and cluster dynamical age and an even stronger correlation between core binary fraction and cluster dynamical age. We find the binary mass-ratio (q) distribution of dynamically young OCs is statistically distinct from that of the old OCs. On average, dynamically young OCs display multi-modal q distributions rising toward unity and toward our detection limit of q=0.5 while more dynamically evolved clusters display more uniform q distributions often with a peak near q=1. Interestingly, the uniform q distribution with a peak near q=1 is consistent with binaries in the field. We also observe a similar transition from multi-modal to unimodal q distributions when comparing low mass to high mass OCs in our sample. Lastly, we find a correlation between the median q of the binary population in a cluster and the cluster dynamical age. We interpret these results as an indication that dynamical encounters tend to increase the fraction of high-mass-ratio binaries within a given cluster -- particularly within the cluster's core where stellar dynamics are likely more important. This may be the result of stellar exchanges that tend to produce binaries with larger q and/or the preferential disruption or evaporation of lower q binaries.</description>

      <title>KMT-2022-BLG-0086: Another binary-lens binary-source microlensing event</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the analysis of a microlensing event KMT-2022-BLG-0086 of which the overall light curve is not described by a binary-lens single-source (2L1S) model, which suggests the existence of an extra lens or an extra source. We found that the event is best explained by the binary-lens binary-source (2L2S) model, but the 2L2S model is only favored over the triple-lens single-source (3L1S) model by $\Delta\chi^{2} \simeq 9$. Although the event has noticeable anomalies around the peak of the light curve, they are not enough covered to constrain the angular Einstein radius $\theta_{\rm E}$, thus we only measure the minimum angular Einstein radius $\theta_{\rm E,min}$. From the Bayesian analysis, it is found that that the binary lens system is a binary star with masses of $(m_1,m_2)=(0.46^{+0.35}_{-0.25}\, M_\odot, 0.75^{+0.67}_{-0.55}\, M_\odot)$ at a distance of $D_{\rm L}=5.87^{+1.21}_{-1.79}$ kpc, while the triple lens system is a brown dwarf or a massive giant planet in a low-mass binary-star system with masses of $(m_1,m_2,m_3)=(0.43^{+0.41}_{-0.35}\, M_\odot, 0.056^{+0.055}_{-0.047}\, M_\odot, 20.84^{+20.20}_{-17.04}\, M_{\rm J})$ at a distance of $D_{\rm L}=4.06^{+1.39}_{-3.28}$ kpc, indicating a disk lens system. The 2L2S model yields the relative lens-source proper motion of $\mu_{\rm rel} \geqslant 4.6\, \rm mas\, yr^{-1}$ that is consistent with the Bayesian result, whereas the 3L1S model yields $\mu_{\rm rel} \geqslant 18.9\, \rm mas\, yr^{-1}$, which is more than three times larger than that of a typical disk object of $\sim 6\, \rm mas\, yr^{-1}$ and thus is not consistent with the Bayesian result. This suggests that the event is likely caused by the binary-lens binary-source model.</description>

      <title>Hunting for UVdim stars in Galactic Open clusters. Clues from ultraviolet photometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Split main-sequences (MSs) and extended main-sequence turn-offs (eMSTOs) have been observed in nearly all Magellanic Clouds clusters younger than 2 Gyr. More recently, Hubble Space Telescope (HST) ultraviolet photometry uncovered a puzzling new population of UV-absorbed stars, dubbed UVdim, in five Magellanic Clouds clusters aged between 40 and 200 Myr, as well as in one 1.5 Gyr-old cluster. These UVdim stars predominantly lie on the blue MS, which is composed of slow rotators, and their distinct UV properties are believed to stem from dusty circumstellar disks. Although eMSTOs are common in both Magellanic Clouds and Galactic open clusters (OCs) of comparable ages, UVdim stars have not yet been investigated in Galactic OCs. In this work, we fill that gap by combining Swift/UVOT, SkyMapper, and Gaia photometry to extend the search for UVdim stars to 35 Galactic OCs younger than 2 Gyr. By constructing colour-colour diagrams analogous to those employed with HST WFC3/UVIS, we find no evidence of UVdim-like stars in most Galactic open clusters and identify possible UVdim candidates in only five systems. The rarity of UVdim stars in young OCs suggests a potential difference between Magellanic Cloud clusters and their Milky Way counterparts, although the underlying reason remains unclear.</description>

      <title>The Kaleidoscope Survey: Strong Gravitational Lensing in Galaxy Clusters with Radial Arcs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We measure the dark matter density profiles of six galaxy clusters: A383, MS 2137-23, MACS J0326.8-0043, MACS J1427.6-2521, MACS J0417.5-1154, and MACS J0949.8+1708. Each cluster contains at least one radial arc, a unique physical feature that allows for more precise measurements of the inner mass profile (R &lt; 50 kpc) from strong lensing. We present the first strong lensing analysis for MACS J0326 and MACS J1427. We use a combination of HST imaging and VLT/MUSE observations from the ESO Kaleidoscope Clusters Survey, a large `filler' program, to identify and measure redshifts for multiply-imaged systems and obtain the 2-D stellar velocity dispersion for each centrally-located brightest cluster galaxy (BCG). The BCG kinematics are used to subtract the baryonic mass component from the inner mass profile. We find total mass density profiles consistent with previous works using a combination of strong lensing and BCG kinematics. The overall shape of these profiles appears core-like, with an average dark matter slope measurement of $\gamma$~0.66. These results demonstrate the ongoing need for the construction of observational models for galaxy clusters, and show how galaxy-scale kinematics can be used to disentangle baryonic and dark matter concentrations in cluster cores.</description>

      <title>JWST/MIRI reveals the true number density of massive galaxies in the early Universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02399v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Early JWST studies reporting an unexpected abundance of massive galaxies at $z \sim 5$--$8$ challenge galaxy formation models in the $\Lambda$CDM framework. Previous stellar mass ($M_\star$) estimates suffered from large uncertainties due to the lack of rest-frame near-infrared data. Using deep JWST/NIRCam and MIRI photometry from PRIMER, we systematically analyze massive galaxies at $z \sim 3$--$8$, leveraging rest-frame $\gtrsim 1\,\mu$m constraints. We find MIRI is critical for robust $M_\star$ measurements for massive galaxies at $z &gt; 5$: excluding MIRI overestimates $M_\star$ by $\sim 0.4$ dex on average for $M_\star &gt; 10^{10}\,M_\odot$ galaxies, with no significant effects at lower masses. This reduces number densities of $M_\star &gt; 10^{10}\,M_\odot$ ($10^{10.3}\,M_\odot$) galaxies by $\sim 36\%$ ($55\%$). MIRI inclusion also reduces ``Little Red Dots'' (LRDs) contamination in massive galaxy samples, lowering the LRD fraction from $\sim 32\%$ to $\sim 13\%$ at $M_\star &gt; 10^{10.3}\,M_\odot$. Assuming pure stellar origins, LRDs exhibit $M_\star \sim 10^{9\text{--}10.5}\,M_\odot$ with MIRI constraints, rarely exceeding $10^{10.5}\,M_\odot$. Within standard $\Lambda$CDM, our results indicate a moderate increase in the baryon-to-star conversion efficiency ($\epsilon$) toward higher redshifts and masses at $z &gt; 3$. For the most massive $z \sim 8$ galaxies, $\epsilon \sim 0.3$, compared to $\epsilon \lesssim 0.2$ for typical galaxies at $z &lt; 3$. This result is consistent with models where high gas densities and short free-fall times suppress stellar feedback in massive high-$z$ halos.</description>

      <title>Chemical Abundances of Early Quiescent Galaxies: New Observations and Modelling Impacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03549v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent stellar chemical abundance measurements of a handful of $z\sim2$ quiescent galaxies have suggested these galaxies exhibit a remarkably strong $\alpha$-enhancement compared to their local and intermediate redshift counterparts. This apparent chemical evolution following quenching suggests that even the innermost regions of massive early-type galaxies may have experienced substantial mixing of stars in mergers, challenging a purely inside-out growth model. However, larger samples are needed to determine whether a high $\alpha$-enhancement ([Mg/Fe] $\approx 0.5$) is common in $z \sim 2$ quiescent galaxies, and a comparative analysis is needed to determine whether it is consistently inferred using different stellar population synthesis models. We report age and stellar chemical abundance measurements for a sample of four gravitationally lensed quiescent galaxies at $z\sim2.1-2.65$ based on Magellan/FIRE spectroscopy. For three of these galaxies we constrain the $\alpha$-enhancement, and in two cases we measure high values comparable to earlier results when the spectra are analyzed consistently. We also find that the choice of modeling approach can exert a significant effect on the measured abundances. This model dependence can be partly, but not entirely, explained by the complex abundance patterns of $\alpha$ elements in galaxies, which has been observed at lower redshifts and in one $z \sim 2$ quiescent galaxy. Our investigation highlights the importance of independently varying abundance of $\alpha$ elements when fitting the spectra of such galaxies. Observations with JWST will soon deliver precise and spatially resolved abundances of these and other quiescent galaxies at cosmic noon, opening a new window into their evolution.</description>

Abstract: Using a semi-analytic approach, we estimate halo spins for a large sample of HI-rich galaxies from the Arecibo Legacy Fast Alfa Survey and examine the correlation between HI mass fractions and halo spins. Our analysis reveals a strong correlation between halo spin and the HI-to-stellar mass ratio in both low-mass and massive galaxy samples. This finding suggests a universal formation scenario: higher halo spin reduces angular momentum loss and gas condensation, leading to lower star formation rates and weaker feedback, which in turn helps retain gas within dark matter halos.</description>

      <title>On the nature of buckling instability in galactic bars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12308v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many strong simulated galactic bars experience buckling instability, which manifests itself as a vertical distortion out of the disk plane, and later dissipates. Using a simulation of an isolated Milky Way-like galaxy, I demonstrate that the phenomenon can be divided into two distinct phases. In the first one, the distortion grows and its pattern speed remains equal to the pattern speed of the bar, so that the distortion remains stationary in the reference frame of the bar. The growth can be described with the mechanism of a driven harmonic oscillator with time-dependent force, which decreases the vertical frequencies of the stars. At the end of this phase, most bar-supporting orbits have banana-like shapes with a resonant vertical-to-horizontal frequency ratio close to two. The increase of amplitudes of vertical oscillations leads to the decrease of the amplitudes of horizontal oscillations and the shrinking of the bar. The mass redistribution causes the harmonic oscillators to respond adiabatically and increase the horizontal frequencies. In the following second phase of buckling, the pattern speed of the distortion increases - reaching one third of the circular frequency - but it decreases with radius. The distortion propagates as a kinematic bending wave and winds up, leaving behind a pronounced boxy/peanut shape. The increased horizontal frequencies cause the weakening of the bar and the transformation of banana-like orbits into pretzel-like ones, except in the outer part of the bar, where the banana-like orbits and the distortion survive. The results strongly suggest that the buckling of galactic bars is not related to the fire-hose instability, but it can be fully explained by the mechanism of vertical resonance creating the distortion that later winds up.</description>

      <title>The THESAN-ZOOM project: Long-term imprints of external reionization on galaxy evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02927v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of ionizing external ultraviolet (UV) radiation on low-mass haloes ($M_{h}&lt;10^{10}M_\odot$) at high redshift using $1140M_\odot$ baryonic resolution zoom-in simulations of seven regions from the THESAN-ZOOM project. We compare three simulation sets that differ in the treatment of external UV radiation: one employing a uniform UV background initiated at z=10.6 in addition to radiation transport for local sources, another with the same background starting at z=5.5, and the default configuration in which the large-scale radiation field from the parent THESAN-1 simulation box acts as a boundary condition. The multi-phase interstellar medium (ISM) model, combined with its high mass resolution, allows us to resolve all star-forming haloes and capture the back-reaction of ionizing radiation on galaxy properties during the epoch of reionization. When present, external UV radiation efficiently unbinds gas in haloes with masses below $10^9M_\odot$ and suppresses subsequent star formation. As a result, in simulations with early reionization, minihaloes fail to form stars from pristine gas, leading to reduced metal enrichment of gas later accreted by more massive haloes. Consequently, haloes with masses below $10^{10}M_\odot$ at all simulated epochs (z&gt;3) exhibit lower metallicities and altered metallicity distributions. The more accurate and realistic shielding from external UV radiation, achieved through self-consistent radiative transfer, permits the existence of a cold but low-density gas phase down to z=3. These findings highlight the importance of capturing a patchy reionization history in high-resolution simulations targeting high-redshift galaxy formation. We conclude that at minimum, a semi-numerical model that incorporates spatially inhomogeneous reionization and a non-uniform metallicity floor is necessary to accurately emulate metal enrichment in minihaloes.</description>

      <title>Euclid Quick Data Release (Q1). The Strong Lensing Discovery Engine C: Finding lenses with machine learning</title>

Abstract: Strong gravitational lensing has the potential to provide a powerful probe of astrophysics and cosmology, but fewer than 1000 strong lenses have been confirmed so far. With a 0.16'' resolution covering a third of the sky, the Euclid telescope will revolutionise the identification of strong lenses, with 170 000 lenses forecasted to be discovered amongst the 1.5 billion galaxies it will observe. We present an analysis of the performance of five machine-learning models at finding strong gravitational lenses in the quick release of Euclid data (Q1) covering 63 deg2. The models have been validated by citizen scientists and expert visual inspection. We focus on the best-performing network: a fine-tuned version of the Zoobot pretrained model originally trained to classify galaxy morphologies in heterogeneous astronomical imaging surveys. Of the one million Q1 objects that Zoobot was tasked to find strong lenses within, the top 1000 ranked objects contain 122 grade A lenses (almost-certain lenses) and 41 grade B lenses (probable lenses). A deeper search with the five networks combined with visual inspection yielded 250 (247) grade A (B) lenses, of which 224 (182) are ranked in the top 20 000 by Zoobot. When extrapolated to the full Euclid survey, the highest ranked one million images will contain 75 000 grade A or B strong gravitational lenses.</description>

      <title>JWST Observations of Photo-dissociation Regions. II. Aliphatic/Aromatic Carbonaceous Dust, Ices, and Gas Phase Spectral Line Inventory</title>

Abstract: This paper provides an overview of the spectroscopic data obtained by the JWST Guaranteed Time Observations (GTO) program 1192, "The Physics and Chemistry of PDR Fronts", including an inventory of the spatially resolved dust, gas, and molecular content in the Horsehead nebula and the NW filament of NGC~7023. We demonstrate the unique capability of this high spatial resolution data set to elucidate the evolution of gas and dust at the interface between stars and their natal clouds at the scale at which the physics and chemistry occur. The Disassociation Regions (PDRs) in the Horsehead nebula and the North West (NW) filament of NGC 7023 were mapped with a spectral resolution 1000-3000 and a spatial resolution of ~2e-4 pc between 0.97-28um. Spectra extracted from template regions yield a large number of atomic, ionized, and molecular lines. Full line lists and extracted spectra for all 10 regions are provided through CDS. Absorption from H$_2$O, CO$_2$, and CO ices are identified in 3 regions in NGC 7023. In this overview, we have focused on the spectral region between 3 and 5 um which is dominated by emission from aromatic and aliphatic carbon bonds to illustrate the power of the data set. We confirm the entrainment of aromatic carbonaceous species in the photo-evaporative flow from the PDR surface into the H\,{\sc{ii}} region in the Horsehead. No aliphatic emission is present in the outflow, indicating the complete removal of aliphatic bonds when exposed to strong UV fields. There is a clear detection of deuterium substitution in the carbon bonds. Aliphatic D-substitution is more efficient relative to aromatic D-substitution, ranging from N$_{D}$/N$_{H}$ ~ 0.1-0.3 for aliphatics compared to ~0.03 for the aromatics.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter Spike surrounding Supermassive Black Holes Binary and the Nanohertz Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.17143v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The NANOGrav, PPTA, EPTA, CPTA and MPTA collaborations have reported compelling evidence for the existence of the Stochastic Gravitational-Wave Background (SGWB). This inferred background's amplitude and frequency spectrum align closely with the astrophysical predictions for a signal originating from the population of supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries. Considering these findings, we explore the possibility of detecting dark matter (DM) spikes surrounding SMBHs, which could alter the gravitational-wave waveform and influence the SGWB. We show that the evolution of SMBH binaries, driven by both gravitational radiation and the dynamic friction of the surrounding DM spike, presents observable effects in the nHz frequency domain of the SGWB. We also employ the Bayesian inference method to fit the SGWB spectra from the NANOGrav, EPTA, and PPTA. The model with DM spike improves the fittings to the former two data sets. The spike slope $\gamma_{\rm sp}$ is slightly smaller than 1, which may suggest that the spike is flattened during the inspiral of the SMBHBs.</description>

      <title>Caught in the cosmic web: environmental effects on subhalo abundance and internal density profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09226v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the high-resolution $N$-body cosmological simulation COLOR, we explore the cosmic web (CW) environmental effects on subhalo populations and their internal properties. We use CaCTus, which incorporates an implementation of the state-of-the-art segmentation method NEXUS+, to delineate the simulation volume into nodes, filaments, walls, and voids. We group host haloes by virial mass and segment each mass bin into consecutive CW elements. This reveals that subhalo populations in hosts within specific environments differ on average from the cosmic mean. The subhalo mass function is affected strongly, where hosts in filaments typically contain more subhaloes ($5$ to $20\%$), while hosts in voids are subhalo-poor, with $25\%$ fewer subhaloes. We find that the abundance of the most massive subhaloes, with reduced masses of $\mu\equiv M_\mathrm{sub}/M_{200}$ is most sensitive to the CW environment. A corresponding picture emerges when looking at subhalo mass fractions, $f_\mathrm{sub}$, where the filament hosts are significantly more `granular' (having higher $f_\mathrm{sub}$) than the cosmic mean, while the void hosts have much smoother density distributions (with $f_\mathrm{sub}$ lower by $2$ - $20\%$ than the mean). Finally, when we look at the subhalo internal kinematic $V_{\rm max}$-$R_{\rm max}$ relations, we find that subhaloes located in the void and wall hosts exhibit density profiles with lower concentrations than the mean, while the filament hosts demonstrate much more concentrated mass profiles. Across all our samples, the effect of the CW environment generally strengthens with decreasing host halo virial mass. Our results show that host location in the large-scale CW introduces significant systematic effects on internal subhalo properties and population statistics.</description>

      <title>Regression for Astronomical Data with Realistic Distributions, Errors and Non-linearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08747v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have developed a new regression technique, the maximum likelihood (ML)-based method and its variant, the KS-test based method, designed to obtain unbiased regression results from typical astronomical data. A normalizing flow model is employed to automatically estimate the unobservable intrinsic distribution of the independent variable as well as the unobservable correlation between uncertainty level and intrinsic value of both independent and dependent variables from the observed data points in a variational inference based empirical Bayes approach. By incorporating these estimated distributions, our method comprehensively accounts for the uncertainties associated with both independent and dependent variables. Our test on both mock data and real astronomical data from PHANGS-ALMA and PHANGS-JWST demonstrates that, given a sufficiently large sample size (&gt; 1000), both the ML-based method and the KS-test based method significantly outperform the existing widely-used methods, particularly in cases of low signal-to-noise ratios. The KS-test based method exhibits remarkable robustness against deviations from underlying assumptions, complex intrinsic distributions, varying correlations between uncertainty levels and intrinsic values, inaccuracies in uncertainty estimations, outliers, and saturation effects. For sample sizes between 300 and 1000, the ML-based method yields the best performance. In the low data regime (&lt; 300), the ML-based method maintains comparable performance to other state-of-the-art methods. A GPU-compatible Python implementation of our methods, nicknamed ``raddest'', will be made publicly available upon acceptance of this paper.</description>
