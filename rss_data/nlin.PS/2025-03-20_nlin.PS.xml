      <title>Beating stripe solitons arising from helicoidal spin-orbit coupling in Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the model of a spatially non-uniform two-component Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) featuring the helicoidal spin-orbit coupling (SOC), gives rise to dark-bright soliton complexes characterized by spatiotemporal periodic oscillations in each component. These solitons are formed by the superposition of dark and bright ones, and exhibit a beating state over time and a striped state across space, earning them the designation of beating stripe solitons. Our analysis demonstrates that helicoidal SOC significantly affects the formation and dynamical properties of these solitons, also serving as the primary driver for spin oscillations. Through the nonlinear superposition of the beating stripe solitons, a range of intricate scenarios of the interaction between multiple solitons emerges, including head-on collisions, bound states, and parallel states.</description>

      <title>Instability of the peaked traveling wave in a local model for shallow water waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The traveling wave with the peaked profile arises in the limit of the family of traveling waves with the smooth profiles. We study the linear and nonlinear stability of the peaked traveling wave by using a local model for shallow water waves, which is related to the Hunter--Saxton equation. The evolution problem is well-defined in the function space $H^1_{\rm per} \cap W^{1,\infty}$, where we derive the linearized equations of motion and study the nonlinear evolution of co-periodic perturbations to the peaked periodic wave by using methods of characteristics. Within the linearized equations, we prove the spectral instability of the peaked traveling wave from the spectrum of the linearized operator in a Hilbert space, which completely covers the closed vertical strip with a specific half-width. Within the nonlinear equations, we prove the nonlinear instability of the peaked traveling wave by showing that the gradient of perturbations grow at the wave peak. By using numerical approximations of the smooth traveling waves and the spectrum of their associated linearized operator, we show that the spectral instability of the peaked traveling wave cannot be obtained in the limit along the family of the spectrally stable smooth traveling waves.</description>

      <title>Kink breathers on a traveling wave background in the defocusing modified Korteweg--de Vries equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We characterize a general traveling periodic wave of the defocusing mKdV (modified Korteweg--de Vries) equation by using a quotient of products of Jacobi's elliptic theta functions. Compared to the standing periodic wave of the defocusing NLS (nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger) equation, these solutions are special cases of Riemann's theta function of genus two. Based on our characterization, we derive a new two-parameter solution form which defines a general three-parameter solution form with the scaling transformation. Eigenfunctions of the Lax system for the general traveling periodic wave are also characterized as quotients of products of Jacobi's theta functions. As the main outcome of our analytical computations, we derive a new solution of the defocusing mKdV equation which describes the kink breather propagating on a general traveling wave background.</description>
