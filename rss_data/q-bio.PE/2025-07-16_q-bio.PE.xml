      <title>Probabilistic Modeling of Antibody Kinetics Post Infection and Vaccination: A Markov Chain Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the dynamics of antibody levels is crucial for characterizing the time-dependent response to immune events: either infections or vaccinations. The sequence and timing of these events significantly influence antibody level changes. Despite extensive interest in the topic in the recent years and many experimental studies, the effect of immune event sequences on antibody levels is not well understood. Moreover, disease or vaccination prevalence in the population are time-dependent. This, alongside the complexities of personal antibody kinetics, makes it difficult to analyze a sample immune measurement from a population. As a solution, we design a rigorous mathematical characterization in terms of a time-inhomogeneous Markov chain model for event-to-event transitions coupled with a probabilistic framework for the post-event antibody kinetics of multiple immune events. We demonstrate that this is an ideal model for immune event sequences, referred to as personal trajectories. This novel modeling framework surpasses the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) characterizations by rigorously tracking the probability distribution of population antibody response across time. To illustrate our ideas, we apply our mathematical framework to longitudinal severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) data from individuals with multiple documented infection and vaccination events. Our work is an important step towards a comprehensive understanding of antibody kinetics that could lead to an effective way to analyze the protective power of natural immunity or vaccination, predict missed immune events at an individual level, and inform booster timing recommendations.</description>

      <title>Modelling the interaction between ethnicity and infectious disease transmission dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During the COVID-19 pandemic, Aotearoa followed an elimination strategy followed by a mitigation strategy, which saw high success and kept health impact low. However, there were inequities in health outcomes, notably that M\=aori and Pacific Peoples had lower vaccine coverage and experienced higher age-standardised rates of hospitalisation and death. Models provide predictions of disease spread and the burden of disease, which can effectively inform policy, but are often not good at including inequities/heterogeneity. Despite the differences in health outcomes by ethnicity, most models have not explicitly considered ethnic heterogeneities as factors. We developed such a model to investigate the first Omicron wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Aotearoa, which was the first time there was widespread community transmission of SARS-CoV-2. We analysed three models for contact patterns within and between ethnicities -- proportionate mixing, assortative mixing, and empirically derived mixing -- and fit them using ethnicity-specific data on reported cases and spatially disaggregated population counts. We found that M\=aori, Pacific, and Asian contact rates were between 1.17-2.46, 1.60-3.89, and 0.83-0.92 times the European rates, respectively. We then found that from the parameters considered in the model, the disparity in transmission rates explained the majority of the observed disparity in attack rates, while assortativity and vaccine rates explained comparably less.</description>

      <title>Order-Dependent Dissimilarity Measures on Phylogenetic Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ordered leaf attachment, Phylo2Vec, and HOP are three recently introduced vector representations for rooted phylogenetic trees where the representation is determined by an ordering of the underlying leaf set X. Comparing the vectors of two rooted phylogenetic X-trees T and T' for a fixed ordering on X leads to polynomial-time computable measure for the dissimilarity of T and T', albeit dependent on the choice of the leaf ordering. For each of ordered leaf attachment, Phylo2Vec, and HOP, we compare this measure with the rooted subtree prune and regraft distance (rSPR), the hybrid number, and the temporal tree-child hybrid number of T and T'. Although there is no direct relationship between rSPR and any of the three vector-based measures, we show that, when minimized over all orderings, the hybrid number is equivalent to HOP, and an upper bound on the other two. Moreover, when minimized over all orderings induced by common cherry-picking sequences of T and T', the temporal tree-child hybrid number of T and T' is equivalent to each of the three vector-based measures.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Ecological Measures Of Functional Diversity</title>

Abstract: Understanding functional diversity, the range and variability of species' roles and actions within their communities, is key to predicting and preserving the functions that sustain both nature and human well-being. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of the literature on functional diversity measurement. We begin by consolidating essential criteria that effective measures of functional diversity should meet. We then evaluate fifteen widely used functional diversity metrics against these criteria and assess their performance across six synthetic ecosystem scenarios where optimal behavior is known. Surprisingly, our analysis reveals that none of the widely used metrics fully satisfy all the established requirements, and all fail in at least one ecosystem scenario. In particular, we find that almost all metrics flagrantly violate set monotonicity and distance monotonicity, requirements that adding a novel species should increase diversity, and that the magnitude of that increase should grow with trait dissimilarity. We also find that metrics fail to decline when rare, functionally extreme species are lost, and even increase when a perfectly redundant species is added. These critical flaws leave them blind to the very biodiversity loss that functional diversity measures are intended to detect. Our findings underscore the urgent need to develop a new generation of functional diversity metrics that more accurately reflect ecological realities.</description>

      <title>Geometric Learning Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14728v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a unified geometric framework for modeling learning dynamics in physical, biological, and machine learning systems. The theory reveals three fundamental regimes, each emerging from the power-law relationship $g \propto \kappa^\alpha$ between the metric tensor $g$ in the space of trainable variables and the noise covariance matrix $\kappa$. The quantum regime corresponds to $\alpha = 1$ and describes Schr\"odinger-like dynamics that emerges from a discrete shift symmetry. The efficient learning regime corresponds to $\alpha = \tfrac{1}{2}$ and describes very fast machine learning algorithms. The equilibration regime corresponds to $\alpha = 0$ and describes classical models of biological evolution. We argue that the emergence of the intermediate regime $\alpha = \tfrac{1}{2}$ is a key mechanism underlying the emergence of biological complexity.</description>
