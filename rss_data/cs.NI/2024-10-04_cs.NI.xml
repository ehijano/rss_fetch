      <title>On the Resilience of Fast Failover Routing Against Dynamic Link Failures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern communication networks feature local fast failover mechanisms in the data plane, to swiftly respond to link failures with pre-installed rerouting rules. This paper explores resilient routing meant to tolerate $\leq k$ simultaneous link failures, ensuring packet delivery, provided that the source and destination remain connected. While past theoretical works studied failover routing under static link failures, i.e., links which permanently and simultaneously fail, real-world networks often face link flapping--dynamic down states caused by, e.g., numerous short-lived software-related faults. Thus, in this initial work, we re-investigate the resilience of failover routing against link flapping, by categorizing link failures into static, semi-dynamic (removing the assumption that links fail simultaneously), and dynamic (removing the assumption that links fail permanently) types, shedding light on the capabilities and limitations of failover routing under these scenarios.
  We show that $k$-edge-connected graphs exhibit $(k-1)$-resilient routing against dynamic failures for $k \leq 5$. We further show that this result extends to arbitrary $k$ if it is possible to rewrite $\log k$ bits in the packet header.
  Rewriting $3$ bits suffices to cope with $k$ semi-dynamic failures. However, on general graphs, tolerating $2$ dynamic failures becomes impossible without bit-rewriting. Even by rewriting $\log k$ bits, resilient routing cannot resolve $k$ dynamic failures, demonstrating the limitation of local fast rerouting.</description>

      <title>Clid: Identifying TLS Clients With Unsupervised Learning on Domain Names</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Clid, a Transport Layer Security (TLS) client identification tool based on unsupervised learning on domain names in the server name indication (SNI) field. Clid aims to provide some information on a wide range of clients, even though it may not be able to identify a definitive characteristic about each one of the clients. This is a different approach from that of many existing rule-based client identification tools that rely on hardcoded databases to identify granular characteristics of a few clients. Often times, these tools can identify only a small number of clients in a real-world network as their databases grow outdated, which motivates an alternative approach like Clid. For this research, we utilize some 345 million anonymized TLS handshakes collected from a large university campus network. From each handshake, we create a TCP fingerprint that identifies each unique client that corresponds to a physical device on the network. Clid uses Bayesian optimization to find the 'optimal' DBSCAN clustering of clients and domain names for a set of TLS connections. Clid maps each client cluster to one or more domain clusters that are most strongly associated with it based on the frequency and exclusivity of their TLS connections. While learning highly associated domain names of a client may not immediately tell us specific characteristics of the client like its the operating system, manufacturer, or TLS configuration, it may serve as a strong first step to doing so. We evaluate Clid's performance on various subsets of our captured TLS handshakes and on different parameter settings that affect the granularity of identification results. Our experiments show that Clid is able to identify 'strongly associated' domain names for at least 60% of all clients in all our experiments.</description>

      <title>Lossy Cooperative UAV Relaying Networks: Outage Probability Analysis and Location Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, performance of a lossy cooperative unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) relay communication system is analyzed. In this system, the UAV relay adopts lossy forward (LF) strategy and the receiver has certain distortion requirements for the received information. For the system described above, we first derive the achievable rate distortion region of the system. Then, on the basis of the region analysis, the system outage probability when the channel suffers Nakagami-$m$ fading is analyzed. Finally, we design an optimal relay position identification algorithm based on the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm, which determines the optimal UAV position to minimize the outage probability. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can optimize the UAV position and reduce the system outage probability effectively.</description>

      <title>Resource Allocation Based on Optimal Transport Theory in ISAC-Enabled Multi-UAV Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the resource allocation optimization for cooperative communication with non-cooperative localization in integrated sensing and communications (ISAC)-enabled multi-unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) cooperative networks. Our goal is to maximize the weighted sum of the system's average sum rate and the localization quality of service (QoS) by jointly optimizing cell association, communication power allocation, and sensing power allocation. Since the formulated problem is a mixed-integer nonconvex problem, we propose the alternating iteration algorithm based on optimal transport theory (AIBOT) to solve the optimization problem more effectively. Simulation results demonstrate that the AIBOT can improve the system sum rate by nearly 12% and reduce the localization Cr'amer-Rao bound (CRB) by almost 29% compared to benchmark algorithms.</description>

      <title>MTDNS: Moving Target Defense for Resilient DNS Infrastructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the most critical components of the Internet that an attacker could exploit is the DNS (Domain Name System) protocol and infrastructure. Researchers have been constantly developing methods to detect and defend against the attacks against DNS, specifically DNS flooding attacks. However, most solutions discard packets for defensive approaches, which can cause legitimate packets to be dropped, making them highly dependable on detection strategies. In this paper, we propose MTDNS, a resilient MTD-based approach that employs Moving Target Defense techniques through Software Defined Networking (SDN) switches to redirect traffic to alternate DNS servers that are dynamically created and run under the Network Function Virtualization (NFV) framework. The proposed approach is implemented in a testbed environment by running our DNS servers as separate Virtual Network Functions, NFV Manager, SDN switches, and an SDN Controller. The experimental result shows that the MTDNS approach achieves a much higher success rate in resolving DNS queries and significantly reduces average latency even if there is a DNS flooding attack.</description>

      <title>Federated Reinforcement Learning to Optimize Teleoperated Driving Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several sixth generation (6G) use cases have tight requirements in terms of reliability and latency, in particular teleoperated driving (TD). To address those requirements, Predictive Quality of Service (PQoS), possibly combined with reinforcement learning (RL), has emerged as a valid approach to dynamically adapt the configuration of the TD application (e.g., the level of compression of automotive data) to the experienced network conditions. In this work, we explore different classes of RL algorithms for PQoS, namely MAB (stateless), SARSA (stateful on-policy), Q-Learning (stateful off-policy), and DSARSA and DDQN (with Neural Network (NN) approximation). We trained the agents in a federated learning (FL) setup to improve the convergence time and fairness, and to promote privacy and security. The goal is to optimize the trade-off between Quality of Service (QoS), measured in terms of the end-to-end latency, and Quality of Experience (QoE), measured in terms of the quality of the resulting compression operation. We show that Q-Learning uses a small number of learnable parameters, and is the best approach to perform PQoS in the TD scenario in terms of average reward, convergence, and computational cost.</description>

      <title>AirTags for Human Localization, Not Just Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Indoor localization has become increasingly important due to its wide-ranging applications in indoor navigation, emergency services, the Internet of Things (IoT), and accessibility for individuals with special needs. Traditional localization systems often require extensive calibration to achieve high accuracy. We introduce UbiLoc, an innovative, calibration-free indoor localization system that leverages Apple AirTags in a novel way to localize users instead of tracking objects. By utilizing the ubiquitous presence of AirTags and their Ultra-Wideband (UWB) technology, UbiLoc achieves centimeter-level accuracy, surpassing traditional WiFi and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) systems. UbiLoc addresses key challenges, including ranging errors caused by multipath and noise, through a novel AirTag selection technique. The system operates without the need for manual calibration, ensuring robustness and self-maintenance. Deployed on various Apple devices and tested in real-world environments, UbiLoc achieved median localization errors as low as 26 cm in a campus building and 31.5 cm in an apartment setting. These results demonstrate that UbiLoc is the first system to offer reliable, cm-level accuracy using widely available technology without requiring calibration, making it a promising solution for next-generation indoor localization systems.</description>

      <title>Load Balancing-based Topology Adaptation for Integrated Access and Backhaul Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated access and backhaul (IAB) technology is a flexible solution for network densification. IAB nodes can also be deployed in moving nodes such as buses and trains, i.e., mobile IAB (mIAB). As mIAB nodes can move around the coverage area, the connection between mIAB nodes and their parent macro base stations (BSs), IAB donor, is sometimes required to change in order to keep an acceptable backhaul link, the so called topology adaptation (TA). The change from one IAB donor to another may strongly impact the system load distribution, possibly causing unsatisfactory backhaul service due to the lack of radio resources. Based on this, TA should consider both backhaul link quality and traffic load. In this work, we propose a load balancing algorithm based on TA for IAB networks, and compare it with an approach in which TA is triggered based on reference signal received power (RSRP) only. The results show that our proposed algorithm improves the passengers worst connections throughput in uplink (UL) and, more modestly, also in downlink (DL), without impairing the pedestrian quality of service (QoS) significantly.</description>

      <title>Optimal Digital Twinning of Random Systems with Twinning Rate Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the massive advancements in processing power, Digital Twins (DTs) have become powerful tools to monitor and analyze physical entities. However, due to the potentially very high number of Physical Systems (PSs) to be tracked and emulated, for instance, in a factory environment or an Internet of Things (IoT) network, continuous twinning might become infeasible. In this paper, a DT system is investigated with a set of random PSs, where the twinning rate is limited due to resource constraints. Three cost functions are considered to quantify and penalize the twinning delay. For these cost functions, the optimal twinning problem under twinning rate constraints is formulated. In a numerical example, the proposed cost functions are evaluated for two, one push-based and one pull-based, benchmark twinning policies. The proposed methodology is the first to investigate the optimal twinning problem with random PSs and twinning rate constraints, and serves as a guideline for real-world implementations on how frequently PSs should be twinned.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Approaches for Active Queue Management: A Survey, Taxonomy, and Future Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active Queue Management (AQM), a network-layer congestion control technique endorsed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), encourages routers to discard packets before the occurrence of buffer overflow. Traditional AQM techniques often employ heuristic approaches that require meticulous parameter adjustments, limiting their real-world applicability. In contrast, Machine Learning (ML) approaches offer highly adaptive, data-driven solutions custom to dynamic network conditions. Consequently, many researchers have adapted ML for AQM throughout the years, resulting in a wide variety of algorithms ranging from predicting congestion via supervised learning to discovering optimal packet-dropping policies with reinforcement learning. Despite these remarkable advancements, no previous work has compiled these methods in the form of a survey article. This paper presents the first thorough documentation and analysis of ML-based algorithms for AQM, in which the strengths and limitations of each proposed method are evaluated and compared. In addition, a novel taxonomy of ML approaches based on methodology is also established. The review is concluded by discussing unexplored research gaps and potential new directions for more robust ML-AQM methods.</description>

      <title>Research Directions and Modeling Guidelines for Industrial Internet of Things Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) paradigm has emerged as a transformative force, revolutionizing industrial processes by integrating advanced wireless technologies into traditional procedures to enhance their efficiency. The importance of this paradigm shift has produced a massive, yet heterogeneous, proliferation of scientific contributions. However, these works lack a standardized and cohesive characterization of the IIoT framework coming from different entities, like the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) or the 5G Alliance for Connected Industries and Automation (5G-ACIA), resulting in divergent perspectives and potentially hindering interoperability. To bridge this gap, this article offers a unified characterization of (i) the main IIoT application domains, (ii) their respective requirements, (iii) the principal technological gaps existing in the current literature, and, most importantly, (iv) we propose a systematic approach for assessing and addressing the identified research challenges. Therefore, this article serves as a roadmap for future research endeavors, promoting a unified vision of the IIoT paradigm and fostering collaborative efforts to advance the field.</description>

      <title>User-centric Immersive Communications in 6G: A Data-oriented Approach via Digital Twin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we present a novel user-centric service provision for immersive communications (IC) in 6G to deal with the uncertainty of individual user behaviors while satisfying unique requirements on the quality of multi-sensory experience. To this end, we propose a data-oriented approach for network resource management, featuring personalized data management that can support network modeling tailored to different user demands. Our approach leverages the digital twin (DT) technique as a key enabler. Particularly, a DT is established for each user, and the data attributes in the DT are customized based on the characteristics of the user. The DT functions, corresponding to various data operations, are customized in the development, evaluation, and update of network models to meet unique user demands. A trace-driven case study demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach in achieving user-centric IC and the significance of personalized data management in 6G.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although people spend most of their time indoors, outdoor tracking systems, such as the Global Positioning System (GPS), are predominantly used for location-based services. These systems are accurate outdoors, easy to use, and operate autonomously on each mobile device. In contrast, Indoor Tracking Systems~(ITS) lack standardization and are often difficult to operate because they require costly infrastructure. In this paper, we propose an indoor tracking algorithm that uses collected data from inertial sensors embedded in most mobile devices. In this setting, mobile devices autonomously estimate their location, hence removing the burden of deploying and maintaining complex and scattered hardware infrastructure. In addition, these devices collaborate by anonymously exchanging data with other nearby devices, using wireless communication, such as Bluetooth, to correct errors in their location estimates. Our collaborative algorithm relies on low-complexity geometry operations and can be deployed on any recent mobile device with commercial-grade sensors. We evaluate our solution on real-life data collected by different devices. Experimentation with 16 simultaneously moving and collaborating devices shows an average accuracy improvement of 44% compared to the standalone Pedestrian Dead Reckoning algorithm.</description>

      <title>SC-CDM: Enhancing Quality of Image Semantic Communication with a Compact Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semantic Communication (SC) is an emerging technology that has attracted much attention in the sixth-generation (6G) mobile communication systems. However, few literature has fully considered the perceptual quality of the reconstructed image. To solve this problem, we propose a generative SC for wireless image transmission (denoted as SC-CDM). This approach leverages compact diffusion models to improve the fidelity and semantic accuracy of the images reconstructed after transmission, ensuring that the essential content is preserved even in bandwidth-constrained environments. Specifically, we aim to redesign the swin Transformer as a new backbone for efficient semantic feature extraction and compression. Next, the receiver integrates the slim prior and image reconstruction networks. Compared to traditional Diffusion Models (DMs), it leverages DMs' robust distribution mapping capability to generate a compact condition vector, guiding image recovery, thus enhancing the perceptual details of the reconstructed images. Finally, a series of evaluation and ablation studies are conducted to validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed algorithm and further increase the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) by over 17% on top of CNN-based DeepJSCC.</description>

      <title>Cellular Network Densification: a System-level Analysis with IAB, NCR and RIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the number of user equipments increases in fifth generation (5G) and beyond, it is desired to densify the cellular network with auxiliary nodes assisting the base stations. Examples of these nodes are integrated access and backhaul (IAB) nodes, network-controlled repeaters (NCRs) and reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs). In this context, this work presents a system level overview of these three nodes. Moreover, this work evaluates through simulations the impact of network planning aiming at enhancing the performance of a network used to cover an outdoor sport event. We show that, in the considered scenario, in general, IAB nodes provide an improved signal to interference-plus-noise ratio and throughput, compared to NCRs and RISs. However, there are situations where NCR outperforms IAB due to higher level of interference caused by the latter. Finally, we show that the deployment of these nodes in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) also achieves performance gains due to their aerial mobility. However, UAV constraints related to aerial deployment may prevent these nodes from reaching results as good as the ones achieved by their stationary deployment.</description>

      <title>Data Similarity-Based One-Shot Clustering for Multi-Task Hierarchical Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the problem of cluster identity estimation in a hierarchical federated learning setting in which users work toward learning different tasks. To overcome the challenge of task heterogeneity, users need to be grouped in a way such that users with the same task are in the same group, conducting training together, while sharing the weights of feature extraction layers with the other groups. Toward that end, we propose a one-shot clustering algorithm that can effectively identify and group users based on their data similarity. This enables more efficient collaboration and sharing of a common layer representation within the federated learning system. Our proposed algorithm not only enhances the clustering process, but also overcomes challenges related to privacy concerns, communication overhead, and the need for prior knowledge about learning models or loss function behaviors. We validate our proposed algorithm using various datasets such as CIFAR-10 and Fashion MNIST, and show that it outperforms the baseline in terms of accuracy and variance reduction.</description>

  Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, due to the possibility of their fast deployment, are considered an essential element of the future wireless 6G communication systems. However, an essential enabler for their use as access points is to provide a sufficient throughput wireless backhaul link. Thus, in this paper we consider the aspect of extension of network coverage with the use of drone-based relaying and reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) for backhauling. Presented results of simulation experiments indicate that the use of RIS allows for significant improvement of network coverage without the need to use additional relays.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00453v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The NetMob24 dataset offers a unique opportunity for researchers from a range of academic fields to access comprehensive spatiotemporal data sets spanning four countries (India, Mexico, Indonesia, and Colombia) over the course of two years (2019 and 2020). This dataset, developed in collaboration with Cuebiq (Also referred to as Spectus), comprises privacy-preserving aggregated data sets derived from mobile application (app) data collected from users who have voluntarily consented to anonymous data collection for research purposes. It is our hope that this reference dataset will foster the production of new research methods and the reproducibility of research outcomes.</description>

      <title>Asynchronous Federated Reinforcement Learning with Policy Gradient Updates: Algorithm Design and Convergence Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08003v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To improve the efficiency of reinforcement learning (RL), we propose a novel asynchronous federated reinforcement learning (FedRL) framework termed AFedPG, which constructs a global model through collaboration among $N$ agents using policy gradient (PG) updates. To address the challenge of lagged policies in asynchronous settings, we design a delay-adaptive lookahead technique \textit{specifically for FedRL} that can effectively handle heterogeneous arrival times of policy gradients. We analyze the theoretical global convergence bound of AFedPG, and characterize the advantage of the proposed algorithm in terms of both the sample complexity and time complexity. Specifically, our AFedPG method achieves $O(\frac{{\epsilon}^{-2.5}}{N})$ sample complexity for global convergence at each agent on average. Compared to the single agent setting with $O(\epsilon^{-2.5})$ sample complexity, it enjoys a linear speedup with respect to the number of agents. Moreover, compared to synchronous FedPG, AFedPG improves the time complexity from $O(\frac{t_{\max}}{N})$ to $O({\sum_{i=1}^{N} \frac{1}{t_{i}}})^{-1}$, where $t_{i}$ denotes the time consumption in each iteration at agent $i$, and $t_{\max}$ is the largest one. The latter complexity $O({\sum_{i=1}^{N} \frac{1}{t_{i}}})^{-1}$ is always smaller than the former one, and this improvement becomes significant in large-scale federated settings with heterogeneous computing powers ($t_{\max}\gg t_{\min}$). Finally, we empirically verify the improved performance of AFedPG in four widely-used MuJoCo environments with varying numbers of agents. We also demonstrate the advantages of AFedPG in various computing heterogeneity scenarios.</description>
