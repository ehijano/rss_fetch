      <title>Cryptocurrency Time Series on the Binary Complexity-Entropy Plane: Ranking Efficiency from the Perspective of Complex Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the first application of a tailored Complexity-Entropy Plane designed for binary sequences and structures. We do so by considering the daily up/down price fluctuations of the largest cryptocurrencies in terms of capitalization (stable-coins excluded) that are worth $circa \,\, 90 \%$ of the total crypto market capitalization. With that, we focus on the basic elements of price motion that compare with the random walk backbone features associated with mathematical properties of the Efficient Market Hypothesis. From the location of each crypto on the Binary Complexity-Plane (BiCEP) we define an inefficiency score, $\mathcal I$, and rank them accordingly. The results based on the BiCEP analysis, which we substantiate with statistical testing, indicate that only Shiba Inu (SHIB) is significantly inefficient, whereas the largest stake of crypto trading is reckoned to operate in close-to-efficient conditions. Generically, our $\mathcal I$-based ranking hints the design and consensus architecture of a crypto is at least as relevant to efficiency as the features that are usually taken into account in the appraisal of the efficiency of financial instruments, namely canonical fiat money. Lastly, this set of results supports the validity of the binary complexity analysis.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear interactions between the Amazon River basin and the Tropical North Atlantic at interannual timescales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the physical processes involved in the potential influence of Amazon (AM) hydroclimatology over the Tropical North Atlantic (TNA) Sea Surface Temperatures (SST) at interannual timescales, by analyzing time series of the precipitation index (P-E) over AM, as well as the surface atmospheric pressure gradient between both regions, and TNA SSTs. We use a recurrence joint probability based analysis that accounts for the lagged nonlinear dependency between time series, which also allows quantifying the statistical significance, based on a twin surrogates technique of the recurrence analysis. By means of such nonlinear dependence analysis we find that at interannual timescales AM hydrology influences future states of the TNA SSTs from 0 to 2 months later with a 90% to 95% statistical confidence. It also unveils the existence of two-way feedback mechanisms between the variables involved in the processes: (i) precipitation over AM leads the atmospheric pressure gradient between TNA and AM from 0 and 2 month lags, (ii) the pressure gradient leads the trade zonal winds over the TNA from 0 to 3 months and from 7 to 12 months, (iii) the zonal winds lead the SSTs from 0 to 3 months, and (iv) the SSTs lead precipitation over AM by 1 month lag. The analyses were made for time series spanning from 1979 to 2008, and for extreme precipitation events in the AM during the years 1999, 2005, 2009 and 2010. We also evaluated the monthly mean conditions of the relevant variables during the extreme AM droughts of 1963, 1980, 1983, 1997, 1998, 2005, and 2010, and also during the floods of 1989, 1999, and 2009. Our results confirm that the Amazon River basin acts as a land surface-atmosphere bridge that links the Tropical Pacific and TNA SSTs at interannual timescales. ...</description>
