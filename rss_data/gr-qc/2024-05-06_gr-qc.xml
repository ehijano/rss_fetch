      <title>Emergent gravity from the correlation of spin-$\tfrac{1}{2}$ systems coupled with a scalar field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces several ideas of emergent gravity, which come from a system similar to an ensemble of quantum spin-$\tfrac{1}{2}$ particles. To derive a physically relevant theory, the model is constructed by quantizing a scalar field in curved space-time. The quantization is based on a classical discretization of the system, but contrary to famous approaches, like loop quantum gravity or causal triangulation, a Monte-Carlo based approach is used instead of a simplicial approximation of the space-time manifold. This avoids conceptual issues related to the choice of the lattice. Moreover, this allows us to easily encode the geometric structures of space, given by the geodesic length between points, into the mean value of a correlation operator between two spin-like systems. Numerical investigations show the relevance of the approach, and the presence of two regimes: a classical and a quantum regime. The latter is obtained when the density of points reaches a given threshold. Finally, a multi-scale analysis is given, where the classical model is recovered from the full quantum one. Each step of the classical limit is illustrated with numerical computations, showing the very good convergence towards the classical limit and the computational efficiency of the theory.</description>

      <title>No black holes from light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that it is not possible to concentrate enough light to precipitate the formation of an event horizon. We argue that the dissipative quantum effects coming from the self-interaction of light (such as vacuum polarization) are enough to prevent any meaningful buildup of energy that could create a black hole in any realistic scenario.</description>

      <title>Violation of Hod's Conjecture and Probing it with Optical properties of a 5-D black hole in Einstein Gauss-Bonnet Bumblebee theory of gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, the quasinormal modes of a $5$-D black hole in Einstein Gauss-Bonnet Bumblebee theory of gravity have been investigated with the help of the Pad\'e averaged higher order WKB approximation method and the validity of Hod's conjecture has been studied. It is found that the presence of Lorentz symmetry breaking due to the Bumblebee field favours Hod's conjecture. But in the case of the Gauss-Bonnet term, an increase in the coupling parameter increases the chances of violation of Hod's conjecture. We further investigated the optical properties of the black hole {\it viz.}, shadow and emission rate. It is found that a black hole with a lower lifetime favours Hod's conjecture.</description>

      <title>Spectrum of Primordial Gravitational Waves in Presence of a Cosmic String</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider an inflating universe with long straight cosmic string along z-axis. We show that the effect of cosmic string can be taken as a perturbation on the background of FRW metric. Then by doing cosmological perturbations on this inflating cosmic string background, we find linearized Einstein field equations. We show that at leading order (ignoring the mixing terms of cosmic string perturbations with gravitational tensor perturbations), the cosmic string appears as an inhomogeneous term on the right hand side of wave equation of tensor perturbations . Then by finding analytical solution of the wave equation for slow-roll inflation, we show how it effects on the spectrum of primordial gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>An emergent cosmological model from running Newton constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an emergent cosmological model rooted in the Asymptotically Safe antiscreening behavior of the Newton constant at Planckian energies. Distinguishing itself from prior approaches, our model encapsulates the variable nature of $G$ through a multiplicative coupling within the matter Lagrangian, characterized by a conserved energy-momentum tensor. The universe emerges from a quasi-de Sitter phase, transitioning to standard cosmological evolution post-Planck Era. Our analysis demonstrates the feasibility of constraining the transition scale to nearly classical cosmology using Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data and the potential to empirically probe the antiscreening trait of Newton's constant, as predicted by Asymptotic Safety.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of dynamic singularity formation in spacetime, focusing on scalar field collapse models, is analysed. We revisit key findings regarding open spatial topologies, concentrating on minimal conditions necessary for singularity and apparent horizon formation. Moreover, we examine the stability of initial data in the dynamical system governed by Einstein's equations, considering variations in parameters that influence naked singularity formation. We illustrate how these results apply to a family of scalar field models, concluding with a discussion on the concept of genericity in singularity studies.</description>

      <title>Constant Velocity Physical Warp Drive Solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Warp drives are exotic solutions of general relativity that offer novel means of transportation. In this study, we present a solution for a constant-velocity subluminal warp drive that satisfies all of the energy conditions. The solution involves combining a stable matter shell with a shift vector distribution that closely matches well-known warp drive solutions such as the Alcubierre metric. We generate the spacetime metric numerically, evaluate the energy conditions, and confirm that the shift vector distribution cannot be reduced to a coordinate transformation. This study demonstrates that classic warp drive spacetimes can be made to satisfy the energy conditions by adding a regular matter shell with a positive ADM mass.</description>

      <title>Cosmology with Higher-Derivative Gravities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an ingenious approach to explore cosmological implications of higher-derivative gravity theories. The key novelty lies in the characterization of the additional massive spin-0 modes constructed from Hubble derivatives as an effective density, with the corresponding pressure uniquely determined by energy conservation, while terms with no Hubble derivatives directly alter Friedmann equations. This classification of the various high-derivative contributions to Friedmann equations develops insight about their cosmological impacts and is essential for understanding the universe's evolution across energy scales. Various examples of higher-derivative gravity theories illustrate the power of this method in efficiently solving Friedmann equations and exploring new phenomena. Using CMB and BAO data, we apply this method to assess the observational feasibility of wall-bouncing universes, as predicted by scenarios with, e.g., certain third order modifications to general relativity. These models also provide an inflationary phase without the need to introduce extra scalar fields.</description>

      <title>Topological symmetry-restored phase of gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a topological quantum field theory phase for four-dimensional gravity. We show it is able to generate, not only General Relativity, but the whole family of Lovelock-Cartan theories of gravity. This is accomplished due to the existence of a topological symmetry that, when explicitly broken, via the introduction of a mass scale, releases the local degrees of freedom of gravity. Additionally, we introduce an extended notion of the (anti-)self-dual Landau gauge conditions to evaluate the Ward identities, counterterms, and prove the quantum stability of the model, to all orders in perturbation theory, using the algebraic renormalization technique.</description>

      <title>Cosmological sector of Loop Quantum Gravity: a Yang-Mills approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we address the issue of the loss of SU(2) internal symmetry in Loop Quantum Cosmology and its relationship with Loop Quantum Gravity. Drawing inspiration from Yang-Mills theory and employing the framework of fiber bundle theory, we successfully identify a cosmological sector for General Relativity in Ashtekar variables, which preserves the SU(2) structure of the theory and the diffeomorphism gauge symmetry. Additionally, we proceed to quantize it using the machinery of Loop Quantum Gravity, uncovering that the resulting spin-network states exhibit distinctive symmetry properties and encompass the usual states of Loop Quantum Cosmology.</description>

      <title>Primordial power spectrum at N3LO in effective theories of inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a systematic framework to compute the primordial power spectrum up to next-to-next-to-next to leading order (N3LO) in the Hubble-flow parameters for a large class of effective theories of inflation. We assume that the quadratic action for perturbations is characterized by two functions of time, the kinetic amplitude and the speed of sound, that are independent of the Fourier mode $k$. Using the Green's function method introduced by Stewart $\&amp;$ Gong and developed by Auclair $\&amp;$ Ringeval, we determine the primordial power spectrum, including its amplitude, spectral indices, their running and running of their running, starting from a given generic action for perturbations. As a check, we reproduce the state-of-the-art results for scalar and the tensor power spectrum of the simplest "vanilla" models of single-field inflation. The framework applies to Weinberg's effective field theory of inflation (with the condition of no parity violation) and to effective theory of spontaneous de Sitter-symmetry breaking. As a concrete application, we provide the expression for the N3LO power spectrum of $R+R^2$ Starobinsky inflation, without a field redefinition. All expressions are provided in terms of an expansion in one single parameter, the number of inflationary e-foldings $N_*$. Surprisingly we find that, compared to previous leading-order calculations, for $N_* = 55$ the N3LO correction results in a $7\%$ decrease of the predicted tensor-to-scalar ratio, in addition to a deviation from the consistency relation. These results provide precise theoretical predictions for the next generation of CMB observations.</description>

      <title>Gravitational lensing of a Schwarzschild-like black hole in Kalb-Ramond gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the gravitational lensing effect for the Schwarzschild-like black hole spacetime in the background of a Kalb-Ramond (KR) field proposed in [K.~Yang et. al., Phys. Rev. D 108 (2023) 124004]. The solution is characterized by a single extra parameter $l$, which is associated to the Lorentz symmetry breaking induced by the KR field. First, we calculate the exact deflection angle of massive and massless particles for finite distances using elliptic integrals. Then we study this effect in the weak and strong field regimes, discussing the correction of the KR parameter on the coefficients of the expansions in both limits. We also find that increasing $l$ decreases the deflection angle. Furthermore, we use the available data from the Sagittarius $A^{\star}$ object, which is believed to be a supermassive black hole at the center of our galaxy, to calculate relevant observables, such as, the image position, luminosity, and delay time. The values found could be potentially measured in the weak field regime, though for strong fields one would have to wait for the next generation of interferometers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nilpotent deformations of an arbitrary background spacetime are considered . Those are of the form $\bg_{\m\n}+ l_\m l_\n$ with $l^2=0$. The relationship between the Ricci tensor of the background metric and the Ricci tensor of the deformed metric is found exactly. It consists of two terms. one is essentially the Fierz-Pauli operator, and the other is new. When the background is flat, the Kerr-Schild family is recovered. Novel examples for more general backgrounds are discussed.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Lorentz symmetry-breaking constraints in Kalb-Ramond gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study timelike and lightlike geodesics in Kalb-Ramond (KR) gravity around a black hole with the goal of constraining the Lorentz symmetry-breaking parameter $l$. The analysis involves studying the precession of the S2 star periastron orbiting Sgr A* and geodesic precession around the Earth. The ratio of precession frequencies for General Relativity (GR) and KR gravity is computed, with Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) results providing a parameter range for the spontaneous symmetry-breaking of $-0.185022 \leq l \leq 0.060938$. Utilizing the geodesic precession frequency from the Gravity Probe B (GP-B), the $l$ parameter is further constrained to $-6.30714 \times 10^{-12} \leq l \leq 3.90708 \times 10^{-12}$, which is consistent with the Schwarzschild limits. Moreover, for timelike geodesics, the innermost circular orbit (ICO) and innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) are determined and analyzed to illustrate the impact of the symmetry breaking term. Zoom-whirl obstructions are compared with the Schwarzschild solution. Lower and upper limits of the photon sphere for lightlike geodesics are established to demonstrate the influence of KR gravity on the photon sphere. Additionally, the shadow radius is determined for two observers, one situated at a finite distance from the KR black hole, and the other located at an infinite distance, to constrain the symmetry-breaking parameter $l$, with comparisons made to EHT results. The bounds for $l$ derived from constraints on the photon sphere radius for lightlike geodesics yield $-0.0700225 \leq l \leq 0.189785$ using EHT data. The findings of this paper align with experimental results in the $l \rightarrow 0$ limit.</description>

      <title>Phase transition between shock formation and stability in cosmological fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a novel phase transition from stable to unstable fluid behaviour for fluid-filled cosmological spacetimes undergoing decelerated expansion. This transition occurs when the fluid speed of sound $c_S$ exceeds a critical value relative to the expansion rate $a(t) = t^\alpha$ of spacetime. We present an explicit relationship between $\alpha$ and $c_S$ , which subdivides the $(\alpha,c_S)$-parameter space into two regions. Using rigorous techniques, we establish stability of quiet fluid solutions in the first stable region. Numerical experiments reveal that the complement of the stable region consists of unstable solutions, implying sharpness of our stability result. We provide a definitive analytical bound and high-precision numerical evidence for the exact location of the critical line separating the stable from the unstable region.</description>

      <title>Off-equatorial deflections and gravitational lensing. II. In general stationary and axisymmetric spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we develop a general perturbative procedure to find the off-equatorial plane deflections in the weak deflection limit in general stationary and axisymmetric spacetimes satisfying some common variable separation conditions. Deflections of both null and timelike rays with the finite distance effect of the source and detector taken into account are obtained as dual series of $M/r_0$ and $r_0/r_{s,d}$. These deflections allow a set of exact gravitational lensing equations from which the images' apparent angular positions are solved. The method and general results are then applied to the Kerr-Newmann, Kerr-Sen, and rotating Simpson-Visser spacetimes to study the effect of the spin and characteristic (effective) charge of the spacetimes and the source altitude on the deflection angles and image apparent angles. It is found that in general, both the spacetime spin and charge only affect the deflections from the second non-trivial order, while the source altitude influences the deflection from the leading order. Because of these, it is found that in gravitational lensing in realistic situations, it is hard to measure the effects of the spacetime spin and charge from the images' apparent locations. We also presented the off-equatorial deflections in the rotating Bardeen, Hayward, Ghosh, and Tinchev black hole spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Polarization Detection with Pyramid Constellation of Gravitational Wave Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In general relativity (GR), gravitational wave (GW) polarization modes are tensor named as plus and cross modes, which have been detected from the LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA collaborations. The other GW modes beyond GR, called as two scalar polarization modes and two vector modes, have being probed especially with an expected network of Advanced LIGO, Advanced Virgo, and KAGRA. For the space-based GW detection, the LISA - Taiji networks can perform the detection of GW polarizations. For the first time, we have come up with the pyramid constellation of gravitational wave observatory(PCGO) for GW polarization detection. The configuration of PCGO can be simultaneously sensitive to the six polarization modes of GWs. The response intensity of six detector arms changes with the detector positions on orbit in one year period. The newly added three arms have a different response of GWs from the triangle arms, comparing to LISA, Taiji and Tianqin. That indicates that there are more freedoms for the polarization component extraction from the total polarization signals of GWs. Comparing to LISA, Taiji and Tianqin configuration, PCGO has more combinations of optical paths of time delay interferometer (TDI) to suppress the frequency noise. The unequal arm Michelson TDI configuration and the Sagnac TDI configuration are equally effective for elimination of the laser frequency noise.</description>

      <title>Classical general relativity effects by magnetars with slow rotation and a magnetic dipole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this contribution, the classical tests of general relativity using the Gutsunaev-Manko metric with slow rotation are obtained. This metric represents the spacetime of an object endowed with mass, magnetic dipole moment and angular moment. These tests are the deflection of light, time delay, precession of the periastron and gravitational redshift. We also provide numerical estimations for real magnetars and magnetar candidates from the McGill magnetar catalogue, and for the Sun in the cycles of low activity. Our results find that the magnetic dipole contribution to the deflection of light is significant when compared to the rotation contribution. The magnetic dipole contributions to the periastron precession and the time delay are 3 and 6 orders of magnitude lower than the rotation contribution respectively. For the gravitational redshift, the contribution is negligible within the approximation presented.</description>

      <title>Prolonging The Inevitable: Maximising survival time of an engine-equipped spacecraft between spatial hypersurfaces, as applied to the Schwarzschild spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fate of an astronaut unfortunate -- or foolish -- enough to find themselves hurtling towards spaghettification after passing the event horizon of a black hole is a common anecdote told by scientists to the regular population. However, despite the fact the Schwarzschild spacetime has been discovered over a century ago, the simple question of how long can such a space traveller live has not been fully elaborated on since. In fact, a few textbooks even give a mistaken or easily misread description of what happens. We address those inconsistencies. We calculate the proper time a space traveller equipped with means of propulsion can expect to live in these circumstances, giving analytical expressions (as elliptic integrals) wherever possible. We prove a principle that explains the best strategy to extend their life, and show its' generalisation for other spacetimes. Finally, we give quantitative answers to what gains due to optimal control can be expected in typical and somewhat `realistic' circumstances.</description>

      <title>Regular black holes and their relationship to polymerized models and mimetic gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present further applications of the formalism introduced by the authors in arXiv:2308.10949, which allows embedding of a broad class of generalized LTB models into effective spherically symmetric spacetimes. We focus on regular black hole models, where a broad class of models can be considered, including for example LQG-inspired models as well as the model with a regular center, e.g. of Bardeen and Hayward. For a certain class of regular black hole models, we can formulate a Birkhoff-like theorem in LTB coordinates. We further show that depending on the properties of the polymerization functions characterizing such regular black hole models in this formalism, the uniqueness of the effective spherically symmetric vacuum solutions might not be given in general in Schwarzschild-like coordinates. Furthermore, we introduce a reconstruction algorithm that allows for a subclass of this models to construct from a given metric in Schwarzschild-like coordinates the corresponding effective spherically symmetric model, its dynamics as an 1+1-dimensional field theory as well as a corresponding covariant Lagrangian of extended mimetic gravity in four dimensions. Such a reconstruction allows us to obtain Lagrangians of extended mimetic gravity models for black holes with a regular center, e.g. the Bardeen and Hayward metric as well as for effective LQG inspired models. Moreover, the reconstruction enables us to extend regular black hole models to general inhomogeneous dust collapse models. For the latter, within this formalism, we can investigate and look at the physical properties of the models such as the existence of weak shell-crossing singularities from a novel perspective.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Cosmic Space and Horizon Thermodynamics from Kaniadakis Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Utilizing Kaniadakis entropy associated with the apparent horizon of the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) Universe and applying the emergence of cosmic space paradigm, we deduce the modified Friedmann equation for a non-flat (n+1)-dimensional universe. Employing the first law of thermodynamics, we arrive at the same modified Friedmann equation, showing the connection between emergence of cosmic space and first law of thermodynamics. We also establish the condition to satisfy the Generalized second law of thermodynamics within the Kaniadakis framework. Our study illuminates the intricate connection between the law of emergence and horizon thermodynamics, offering a deeper insight through the lens of Kaniadakis entropy.</description>

      <title>Observability of spin precession in the presence of a black-hole remnant kick</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Remnants of binary black-hole mergers can gain significant recoil or kick velocities when the binaries are asymmetric. The kick is the consequence of anisotropic emission of gravitational waves, which may leave a characteristic imprint in the observed signal. So far, only one gravitational-wave event supports a non-zero kick velocity: GW200129_065458. This signal is also the first to show evidence for spin-precession. For most other gravitational-wave observations, spin orientations are poorly constrained as this would require large signal-to-noise ratios, unequal mass ratios or inclined systems. Here we investigate whether the imprint of the kick can help to extract more information about the spins. We perform an injection and recovery study comparing binary black-hole signals with significantly different kick magnitudes, but the same spin magnitudes and spin tilts. To exclude the impact of higher signal harmonics in parameter estimation, we focus on equal-mass binaries that are oriented face-on. We generate signals with PhenomXO4a, which includes mode asymmetries. These asymmetries are the main cause for the kick in precessing binaries. For comparison with an equivalent model without asymmetries, we repeat the same injections with PhenomXPHM. We find that signals with large kicks necessarily include large asymmetries, and these give more structure to the signal, leading to more informative measurements of the spins and mass ratio. Our results also complement previous findings that argued precession in equal-mass, face-on or face-away binaries is nearly impossible to identify. In contrast, we find that in the presence of a remnant kick, even those signals become more informative and allow determining precession with signal-to-noise ratios observable already by current gravitational-wave detectors.</description>

Abstract: This article explores the differences between frame and coordinate transformations in relativistic theories. We highlight the key role of tetrad fields in connecting spacetime and frame indices. Using Maxwell's electrodynamics as an example, we show that Maxwell's equations are invariant under coordinate transformations but exhibit covariant behavior under frame transformations. We also analyze the energy-momentum of an electromagnetic field in different frames, providing deeper insights into the implications of different frames of reference and coordinate systems.</description>

      <title>Enhanced primordial gravitational waves from a stiff post-inflationary era due to an oscillating inflaton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate two classes of inflationary models, which lead to a stiff period after inflation that boosts the signal of primordial gravitational waves (GWs). In both families of models studied, we consider an oscillating scalar condensate, which when far away from the minimum it is overdamped by a warped kinetic term, a la $\alpha$-attractors. This leads to successful inflation. The oscillating condensate is in danger of becoming fragmented by resonant effects when non-linearities take over. Consequently, the stiff phase cannot be prolonged enough to enhance primordial GWs at frequencies observable in the near future for low orders of the envisaged scalar potential. However, this is not the case for a higher-order scalar potential. Indeed, we show that this case results in a boosted GW spectrum that overlaps with future observations without generating too much GW radiation to de-stabilise Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. For example, taking $\alpha={\cal O}(1)$, we find that the GW signal can be safely enhanced up to $\Omega_{\rm GW}(f)\sim 10^{-11}$ at frequency $f\sim 10^2\,$Hz, which will be observable by the Einstein Telescope (ET). Our mechanism ends up with a characteristic GW spectrum, which if observed, can lead to the determination of the inflation energy scale, the reheating temperature and the shape (steepness) of the scalar potential around the minimum.</description>

      <title>Topology of restricted phase space thermodynamics in Kerr-Sen-Ads black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the thermodynamic topology of the Kerr-Sen-Ads black hole in restricted phase space. In the restricted phase space, a new parameter, central charge $C$, and its conjugate parameter $\mu$ are introduced, omitting the well-known $PdV$ term in the first law of black hole thermodynamics. We study the local and global topology of the black hole by considering the black hole solution as topological defects in the free energy landscape. We compute the winding number and the total topological number at the thermodynamic defects. For our analysis, we have considered five ensembles of Kerr-Sen-Ads black holes in restricted phase space: fixed $(Q, J, C)$, fixed $(\phi, J, C)$, fixed $(Q,\Omega, C)$, fixed $(Q, J, \mu)$, and fixed $(\phi,\Omega, C)$, where $Q$ is the electric charge, $J$ is the angular momentum, $C$ is the central charge, $\phi$ is the electric potential conjugate to charge, $\Omega$ is the angular frequency conjugate to $J$, and finally, $\mu$ is the chemical potential. In the fixed $(Q, J, C)$, fixed $(\phi, J, C)$, and fixed $(Q, J, \mu)$ ensembles, we find a topological charge of $+1$. In the fixed $(Q,\Omega, C)$ and fixed $(\phi, \Omega, C)$ ensembles, depending on the values of the thermodynamic parameters, we find topological charges of $-1$, $0$, and $+1$. Interestingly, in ensembles where we find the topological charge to be $0$, we observe both Hawking-Page and Davies type phase transitions. We show that both types of these phase transitions can be studied using a common vector field, and the topological charges associated with Davies type and Hawking-Page phase transitions are $-1$ and $+1$, respectively.</description>

      <title>Prospects for the Observation of Continuous Gravitational Waves from Deformed Fast-spinning White Dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There has been a growing interest within the astrophysics community in highly magnetized and fast-spinning white dwarfs (WDs), commonly referred to as HMWDs. WDs with these characteristics are quite uncommon and possess magnetic fields $\geqslant 10^6$ G, along with short rotation periods ranging from seconds to just a few minutes. Based on our previous work, we analyze the emission of Gravitational Waves (GWs) in HMWDs through two mechanisms: matter accretion and magnetic deformation, which arise due to the asymmetry surrounding the star's rotational axis. Here, we perform a thorough self-consistent analysis, accounting for rotation and employing a realistic equation of state to investigate the stability of stars. Our investigation focuses on the emission of gravitational radiation from six rapidly spinning WDs: five of them are situated within binary systems, while one is an AXP, proposed as a magnetic accreting WD. Furthermore, we apply the matter accretion mechanism alongside the magnetic deformation mechanism to assess the influence of one process on the other. Our discoveries indicate that these WDs could potentially act as GW sources for BBO and DECIGO, depending on specific parameters, such as their mass, the angle ($\alpha$) between the magnetic and rotational axes, and the accumulated mass ($\delta m$) at their magnetic poles, which is influenced by the effect of matter accretion. However, detecting this particular class of stars using the LISA and TianQin space detectors seems unlikely due to the challenging combination of parameters such as a large $\delta m$, a large $\alpha$ angle and a small WD mass value.</description>

      <title>Dark Energy predictions from GREA: Background and linear perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: General Relativistic Entropic Acceleration (GREA) theory provides a covariant formalism for out-of-equilibrium phenomena in GR, extending the Einstein equations with an entropic force that behaves like bulk viscosity with a negative effective pressure. In particular, the growth of entropy associated with the homogeneous causal horizon can explain the present acceleration of the Universe, without introducing a cosmological constant. The dynamics of the accelerated Universe is characterized by a single parameter $\alpha$, the ratio of the causal horizon to the curvature scale, which provides a unique history of the Universe distinguishable from that of LCDM. In particular, we explain the coincidence problem and the Hubble tension by shifting the coasting point to higher redshifts. All background observables are correlated among themselves due to their common dependence on $\alpha$. This scenario gives a specific evolution for the effective equation of state parameter, $w(a)$. Furthermore, we study the linear growth of matter perturbations in the context of a homogeneous expanding background driven by the entropy of the causal horizon. We find that the rate of growth of matter fluctuations in GREA slows down due to the accelerated expansion and alleviates the $\sigma_8$ tension of LCDM. We compute the growth function of matter fluctuations, the redshift space distortions in the galaxy correlation function, as well as the redshift evolution of the BAO scale, and find that the ISW effect is significantly larger than in LCDM. It is interesting to note that many of the tensions and anomalies of the standard model of cosmology are alleviated by the inclusion of this transient period of acceleration of the Universe based on known fundamental physics. In the near future we will be able to constrain this theory with present data from deep galaxy surveys.</description>

      <title>Silk Damping in Scalar-Induced Gravitational Waves: A Novel Probe for New Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Silk damping is well known in the study of cosmic microwave background (CMB) and accounts for suppression of the angular power spectrum of CMB on large angular multipoles. In this Letter, we study the effect of Silk damping on the scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs). Resulting from the dissipation of cosmic fluid, the Silk damping notably suppresses the energy-density spectrum of SIGWs on scales comparable to a diffusion scale at the decoupling time of feebly-interacting particles. The effect offers a novel observable for probing the underlying particle interaction, especially for those mediated by heavy gauge bosons beyond the standard model of particles. We anticipate that pulsar timing arrays are sensitive to gauge bosons with mass $\sim10^{3}-10^{4}\,\mathrm{GeV}$, while space- and ground-based interferometers to those with mass $\sim10^7-10^{12}\,\mathrm{GeV}$, leading to essential complements to on-going and future experiments of high-energy physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the gauge theory formulation of Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity and propose Korteweg-de Vries asymptotic conditions that generalize the asymptotic dynamics of the theory. They permit to construct an enlarged set of boundary actions formed by higher order generalizations of the Schwarzian derivative that contain the Schwarzian as lower term in a tower of SL$(2,\mathbb{R})$ invariants. They are extracted from the KdV Hamiltonians and can be obtained recursively. As a result, the conformal symmetry breaking observed in nearly AdS$_{2}$ is characterized by a much larger set of dynamical modes associated to the stationary KdV hierarchy. We study quantum perturbation theory for the generalized Schwarzian action including the symplectic measure and compute the one-loop correction to the partition function. We find that that despite the non-linear nature of the higher-Schwarzian contribution, it acquires a manageable expression that renders a curious leading temperature dependence on the entropy $S=\#T^{a}$ for $a$ an odd integer.</description>

Abstract: We propose an anisotropy quantifier of the HI 21-cm signal traditionally used to clock the astrophysics of the reionization era as a post-reionization dark energy diagnostic. We find that the anisotropy probe can be measured at SNR $\sim 10$ in both auto-correlation and in cross-correlation with the Ly-$\alpha$ forest over a wide $z$ and $k-$range. We propose to use the BAO signature on the anisotropy signal to measure $( H(z), D_A(z))$. Subsequently, we put constraints on a dark energy model involving a negative cosmological constant on top of a quintessence scalar field and find that such a model is consistent with futuristic observations.</description>

Abstract: Exploring the inverse problem tied to the Page curve phenomenon and island paradigm, we investigate the geometric conditions underpinning black hole evaporation where information is preserved and islands manifest, giving rise to the characteristic Page curve. Focusing on a broad class of static black hole metrics in asymptotically Minkowski or (anti-)de Sitter spacetimes, we derive a pivotal constraint on the blacken factor $f(r)$ for which the island exists and reproduce the Page curve. Specifically, we reveal that a sufficient yet not universally necessary criterion -- manifested in the negativity of the second derivative of $f(r)$, i.e. $f^{\prime \prime} (r)&lt;0$, in proximity to the event horizon where $r \sim r_h+ {\cal O} (G_N)$, ensures the emergence of Page curves in a manner transcending specific theoretical models. This pivotal finding, supported by the tenets of the quantum focusing conjecture.</description>

      <title>Accretion Efficiency Evolution of Central Supermassive Black Holes in Quasars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ongoing debate regarding the most accurate accretion model for supermassive black holes at the center of quasars has remained a contentious issue in astrophysics. One significant challenge is the variation in calculated accretion efficiency, with values exceeding the standard range of $0.038 &lt; \epsilon &lt; 0.42$. This discrepancy is especially pronounced in high redshift supermassive black holes, necessitating the development of a comprehensive model that can address the accretion efficiency for supermassive black holes in both the low and high redshift ranges. In this study, we have focused on low redshift ($z &lt; 0.5$) PG quasars (79 quasars) and high redshift ($z \geq 3$) quasars with standard disks from the flux- and volume-limited QUOTAS+QuasarNET dataset (76 quasars) to establish a model for accretion efficiency. An interesting trend is revealed where in redshift larger than 3, accretion efficiency increases as redshift decreases, while in redshift lower than 0.5, accretion efficiency decreases with reducing redshift. This suggests a peak in accretion efficiency between the low and high redshift quasars. This peak is recognized for the flux- and volume-limited QUOTAS+QuasarNET+DL11 dataset, which is $z \sim 2.675$, and it seems to be related to the peak of the star formation rate. ($1 &lt; z_{SFR} &lt; 3$). This result can potentially lead to a more accurate correlation between the star formation rate in quasars and their relationship with the mass of the central supermassive black holes with a more comprehensive disk model in future studies.</description>

      <title>Probing flavor violation and baryogenesis via primordial gravitational waves</title>

Abstract: We show that observations of primordial gravitational waves of inflationary origin can shed light into the scale of flavor violation in a flavon model which also explains the mass hierarchy of fermions. The energy density stored in oscillations of the flavon field around the minimum of its potential redshifts as matter and is expected to dominate over radiation in the early universe. At the same time, the evolution of primordial gravitational waves acts as bookkeeping to understand the expansion history of the universe. Importantly, the gravitational wave spectrum is different if there is an early flavon dominated era compared to radiation domination expected from a standard cosmological model and this spectrum gets damped by the entropy released in flavon decays, determined by the mass of the flavon field $m_S$ and new scale of flavor violation $\Lambda_{\rm FV}$. We derive analytical expressions of the frequency above which the spectrum is damped, as-well-as the amount of damping, in terms of $m_S$ and $\Lambda_{\rm FV}$. We show that the damping of the gravitational wave spectrum would be detectable at BBO, DECIGO, U-DECIGO, $\mu-$ARES, LISA, CE and ET detectors for $\Lambda_{\rm FV}=10^{5-10}$ GeV and $m_S=\mathcal{O({\rm TeV})}$. Furthermore, the flavon decays can source the baryon asymmetry of the universe. We identify the $m_S-\Lambda_{\rm FV}$ parameter space where the observed baryon asymmetry $\eta \sim 10^{-10}$ is produced and can be tested by gravitational wave detectors like LISA and ET. We also discuss our results in the context of the recently measured stochastic gravitational background signals by NANOGrav.</description>

      <title>Modeling non stationary noise in pulsar timing array data analysis</title>

Abstract: Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) collaborations recently reported evidence for the presence of a gravitational wave background (GWB) in their datasets. The main candidate that is expected to produce such a GWB is the population of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHB). Some analyses showed that the recovered signal may exhibit time-dependent properties, i.e. non-stationarity. In this paper, we propose an approximated non-stationary Gaussian process (GP) model obtained from the perturbation of stationary processes. The presented method is applied to the second data release of the European pulsar timing array to search for non-stationary features in the GWB. We analyzed the data in different time slices and showed that the inferred properties of the GWB evolve with time. We find no evidence for such non-stationary behavior and the Bayes factor in favor of the latter is $\mathcal{B}^{NS}_{S} = 1.5$. We argue that the evolution of the GWB properties most likely comes from the \mf{improvement of the observation cadence} with time and \mf{better} characterization of the noise of individual pulsars. Such non-stationary GWB could also be produced by the leakage of non-stationary features in the noise of individual pulsars or by the presence of an eccentric single source.</description>

      <title>The Decoherent Arrow of Time and the Entanglement Past Hypothesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03418v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: If an asymmetry in time does not arise from the fundamental dynamical laws of physics, it may be found in special boundary conditions. The argument normally goes that since thermodynamic entropy in the past is lower than in the future according to the Second Law of Thermodynamics, then tracing this back to the time around the Big Bang means the universe must have started off in a state of very low thermodynamic entropy: the Thermodynamic Past Hypothesis. In this paper, we consider another boundary condition that plays a similar role, but for the decoherent arrow of time, i.e. the quantum state of the universe is more mixed in the future than in the past. According to what we call the Entanglement Past Hypothesis, the initial quantum state of the universe had very low entanglement entropy. We clarify the content of the Entanglement Past Hypothesis, compare it with the Thermodynamic Past Hypothesis, and identify some challenges and open questions for future research.</description>

      <title>Robustness of inflation to kinetic inhomogeneities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of large inhomogeneities in both the inflaton field and its momentum. We find that in general, large kinetic perturbations reduce the number of e-folds of inflation. In particular, we observe that inflationary models with sub-Planckian characteristic scales are not robust even to kinetic energy densities that are sub-dominant to the potential energy density. This strengthens the results of our previous work. In inflationary models with super-Planckian characteristic scales, despite a reduction in the number of e-folds, inflation is robust even when the potential energy density is initially sub-dominant. For the cases we study, the robustness of inflation strongly depends on whether the inflaton field is driven into the reheating phase by the inhomogeneous scalar dynamics.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Hubble Tension and $\sigma_8$ Discrepancy in f(Q) Cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we incorporated a three-parameter family, of the metric incompatible modification of standard general relativity $f(Q)$ models into the Boltzmann code MGCLASS at both the background and perturbation levels, in order to conduct a Bayesian study employing probes that include the cosmic microwave background (CMB), baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), weak lensing (WL), alone or its correlation with galaxy clustering (3$\times$2pt) and growth measurements $f \sigma_8$, for each submodel. Our analysis focused on the impact of the Hubble tension in $H_0$ and the discrepancy in $\sigma_8$ resulting from the inclusion of our model parameters, namely $M$, $\alpha$ and $\beta$. We find that none of the sub models, considered alone or combined, were able of alleviating the Hubble tension with only reducing it to 3 $\sigma$ in the least constraining, highest degree of freedom case while we found that the $\sigma_8$ discrepancy, already strongly mitigated on WL linear scales, especially when we let all our model's parameters as free, appears again when considering the more constraining 3$\times$2pt probe. Among the parameters considered, we found that $\beta$, acting in scaling both the gravitational and the Hubble parameter, had the most impact in reducing the discrepancy, with data preferring far from $\Lambda$CDM alike values, before the combination with $f \sigma_8$ constrain it back to its general relativity values.</description>

Abstract: The extensive catalog of waveforms, with details of binary black hole inspiral and merger, offer an opportunity to understand black hole interactions beyond the large separation regime. We envision a research program that focuses on the transfer of angular momentum from spin of the individual holes to the orbital angular momentum and the role of tidal coupling in the process. That analysis will require the formulation of an expression for the orbital angular momentum of a binary, an expression that is useful at small separations, since that regime is well out of the range of Newtonian approximations and is where tidal coupling should be most interesting. We report here such an expression, a binary orbital angular momentum based on numerical relativity results for quasi-circular orbits, that agrees remarkably well with a similar quantity constructed with particle-perturbation techniques for the Kerr geometry.</description>

      <title>Adaptive asymptotic solutions of inflationary models in the Hamilton-Jacobi formalism: Application to T-models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.05650v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a method to compute the slow-roll expansion for the Hubble parameter in inflationary models in a flat Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker spacetime that is applicable to a wide class of potentials including monomial, polynomial, or rational functions of the inflaton, as well as polynomial or rational functions of the exponential of the inflaton. The method, formulated within the Hamilton-Jacobi formalism, adapts the form of the slow-roll expansion to the analytic form of the inflationary potential, thus allowing a consistent order-by-order computation amenable to Pad\'e summation. Using T-models as an example, we show that Pad\'e summation extends the domain of validity of this adapted slow-roll expansion to the end of inflation. Likewise, Pad\'e summation extends the domain of validity of kinetic-dominance asymptotic expansions of the Hubble parameter into the fast-roll regime, where they can be matched to the aforesaid Pad\'e-summed slow-roll expansions. This matching in turn determines the relation between the expansions for the number $N$ of e-folds and allows us to compute the total amount of inflation as a function of the initial data or, conversely, to select initial data that correspond to a fixed total amount of inflation. Using the slow-roll stage expansions, we also derive expansions for the corresponding spectral index $n_s$ accurate to order $1/N^2$, and tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ accurate to order $1/N^3$ for these T-models.</description>

Abstract: By refining the method proposed in arXiv:2010.07660, entropy current and entropy density for a relativistic hydrostatic equilibrium system with spherical symmetry are constructed as a non-Noether conserved charge in the Einstein gravity with cosmological constant. It is shown that the constructed entropy density satisfies both the local Euler relation and the first law of thermodynamics non-perturbatively with respect to the Newton constant. Finally the established relativistic thermodynamics is applied to one of the systems with uniform energy density as a crude model of a degenerate star and its local thermodynamic observables are determined analytically.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.03771v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the rate of change of mass and angular momentum of a black hole, namely tidal heating, in an eccentric orbit. The change is caused due to the tidal field of the orbiting companion. We compute the result for both the spinning and non-spinning black holes in the leading order of the mean motion, namely $\xi$. We demonstrate that the rates get enhanced significantly for nonzero eccentricity. Since eccentricity in a binary evolves with time we also express the results in terms of an initial eccentricity and azimuthal frequency $\xi_{\phi}$. In the process, we developed a prescription that can be used to compute all physical quantities in a series expansion of initial eccentricity, $e_0$. These results are computed taking account of the spin of the binary components. The prescription can be used to compute very high-order corrections of initial eccentricity. We use it to find the contribution to eccentricity up to $\mathcal{O}(e_0^5)$ in the spinning binary. We also provide an approximate expression for $\mathcal{O}(e_0^n)$, where $n$ is any odd number. With this, we compute approximate expression for $\mathcal{O}(e_0^7)$ and $\mathcal{O}(e_0^9)$ for non-spinning binary. Using the computed expression of eccentricity, we derived the rate of change of mass and angular momentum of a black hole, both rotating and non-rotating, in terms of initial eccentricity and azimuthal frequency up to $\mathcal{O}(e_0^6)$. We also compute leading order dephasing in both cases analytically up to $\mathcal{O}(e_0^6)$ and study its impact.</description>

Abstract: Palatini $F(R)$ gravity proved to be a powerful tool in order to realize asymptotically flat inflaton potentials. Unfortunately, it also inevitably implies higher-order inflaton kinetic terms in the Einstein frame that might jeopardize the evolution of the system out of the slow-roll regime. We prove that a $F(R+X)$ gravity, where $X$ is the inflaton kinetic term, solves the issue. Moreover, when $F$ is a quadratic function such a choice easily leads to a new class of inflationary attractors, fractional attractors, that generalizes the already well-known polynomial $\alpha$-attractors.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the requirement of suppressing spacetime geometries with a curvature singularity via destructive interference in the Lorentzian gravitational path integral as a constraint on the microscopic action for gravity. Based on simple examples of static spherically symmetric spacetimes, we demonstrate that complete singularity suppression in the path integral stipulates that the action for gravity be of infinite order in the curvature.</description>

Abstract: We have investigated the motion for photons in the Kerr black hole spacetime under the axion-photon coupling. The birefringence phenomena arising from the axion-photon coupling can be negligible in the weak coupling approximation because the leading-order contributions to the equations of motion come from the square term of the coupling parameter. We find that the coupling parameter makes the size of shadows slightly increase for arbitrary spin parameter. For the rapid rotating black hole case with a larger coupling, we find that there exist a pedicel-like structure appeared in the left of the D-type like shadows.Comparing the shadow size of the Kerr black hole with the shadow size of the Sgr A* and M87* black holes, we find that there is room for such a theoretical model of the axion-photon coupling.</description>

      <title>A Realist Interpretation of Unitarity in Quantum Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.15157v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unitarity is a difficult concept to implement in canonical quantum gravity because of state non-normalizability and the problem of time. We take a realist approach based on pilot-wave theory to address this issue in the Ashtekar formulation of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation. We use the postulate of a definite configuration in the theory to define a global time for the gravitational-fermionic system recently discussed in (Phys. Rev. D 106.10 (2022): 106012), by parameterizing a variation of a Weyl-spinor that depends on the Kodama state. The total Hamiltonian constraint yields a time-dependent Schrodinger equation, without semi-classical approximations, which we use to derive a local continuity equation over the configuration space. We implement the reality conditions at the level of the guidance equation, and obtain a real spin-connection, extrinsic curvature and triad along the system trajectory. We obtain quantum corrections to deSitter spacetime from the guidance equation. The non-normalizable Kodama state is naturally factored out of the full quantum state in the conserved current density, opening the possibility for quantum-mechanical unitarity. We also give a pilot-wave generalisation of the notion of unitarity applicable to non-normalizable states, and show the existence of equilibrium density for our system. Lastly, we find unitary states in mini-superspace by finding an approximate solution to the Hamiltonian constraint.</description>

      <title>Dark matter signatures of black holes with Yukawa potential</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.17081v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study uses a nonsingular Yukawa--modified potential to obtain a static and spherically symmetric black hole solution with a cosmological constant. Such Yukawa--like corrections are encoded in two parameters, $\alpha$ and $\lambda$, that modify Newton's law of gravity in large distances, and a deformation parameter $\ell_0$, which plays an essential role in short distances. The most significant effect is encoded in $\alpha$, which modifies the total black hole mass with an extra mass proportional to $\alpha M$, mimicking the dark matter effects at large distances from the black hole. On the other hand, the effect due to $\lambda$ is small for astrophysical values. We scrutinize the \textit{quasinormal} frequencies and shadows associated with a spherically symmetric black hole and the thermodynamical behavior influenced by the Yukawa potential. In particular, the thermodynamics of this black hole displays a rich behavior, including possible phase transitions. We use the WKB method to probe the \textit{quasinormal} modes of massless scalar, electromagnetic, and gravitational field perturbations. In order to check the influence of the parameters on the shadow radius, we consider astrophysical data to determine their values, incorporating information on an optically thin radiating and infalling gas surrounding a black hole to model the black hole shadow image. In particular, we consider Sgr A* black hole as an example and we find that its shadow radius changes by order of $10^{-9}$, meaning that the shadow radius of a black hole with Yukawa potential practically gives rise to the same result encountered in the Schwarzschild black hole. Also, in the eikonal regime, using astrophysical data for Yukawa parameters, we show that the value of the real part of the QNMs frequencies changes by $10^{-18}$.</description>

Abstract: Considering an arbitrary dimensional FLRW universe in the framework of a generalized S\'{a}ez--Ballester (SB) theory, we establish a noncommutative (NC) cosmological model. We concentrate on the predictions of NC model and compare them with their commutative counterparts in both the classical and quantum regimes. For the classic case, taking a very small NC parameter, we apply two different methods to analyze the model features. First, we show through numerical analysis that our NC model is a successful inflationary model capable of overcoming the graceful exit and horizon problems. Furthermore, the NC traces are visible the late time, which supports the UV/IR mixing characteristic of the NC models. In the second method, we show that our NC model can correspond to the previously developed NC inflationary models. In the commutative quantum case, we obtain an exact wave function and then use the WKB approximation to show that the solutions of the corresponding classical regime are recovered. Finally, with regard to the NC quantum level, we focus on the special case for which we show that a constant of motion exists. The latter helps us to conveniently transform the corresponding complicated NC-WDW equation into an ordinary differential equation, which can be easily solved numerically for the general case or analytically for some special cases. The resultant solutions show a damping behavior in the wave function associated with the proposed NC model, which may be important in determining the viable initial states for the very early universe.</description>

      <title>New binary black hole mergers in the LIGO-Virgo O3b data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06061v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the detection of 6 new candidate binary black hole (BBH) merger signals in the publicly released data from the second half of the third observing run (O3b) of advanced LIGO and advanced Virgo. The LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) collaboration reported 35 compact binary coalescences (CBCs) in their analysis of the O3b data [1], with 30 BBH mergers having coincidence in the Hanford and Livingston detectors. We confirm 17 of these for a total of 23 detections in our analysis of the Hanford-Livingston coincident O3b data. We identify candidates using a search pipeline employing aligned-spin quadrupole-only waveforms. Our pipeline is similar to the one used in our O3a coincident analysis [2], except for a few improvements in the veto procedure and the ranking statistic, and we continue to use an astrophysical probability of one half as our detection threshold, following the approach of the LVK catalogs. Most of the new candidates reported in this work are placed in the upper and lower-mass gap of the black hole (BH) mass distribution. We also identify a possible neutron star-black hole (NSBH) merger. We expect these events to help inform the black hole mass and spin distributions inferred in a full population analysis.</description>

      <title>Membrane Models as a Means of Propulsion in General Relativity: Super-Luminal Warp-Drive that Satisfies the Weak Energy Condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07193v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Presented are toy-models for sub-luminal and super-luminal warp-drives in 3+1 dimensions. The models are constructed in a chimeric manner - as different bulk space-times separated by thin membranes. The membranes contain perfect-fluid-like stress-energy tensors. The Israel junction conditions relate this stress-energy to a jump in extrinsic curvature across the brane, which in turn manifests as apparent acceleration in the bulk space-times. The acceleration on either side of the brane may be set individually by choice of model parameters. The Weak Energy Condition (WEC) is shown to be satisfied everywhere in both models. Although the branes in these toy models are not compact, it is demonstrated that super-luminal warp-drive is possible that satisfies the WEC. Additionally, the nature of these models provides framework for speculation on a mechanism for transition from sub-luminal to super-luminal warp. Neither quantum effects nor stability of the models is considered.</description>

      <title>The effect of scalar hair on the charged black hole with the images from accretions disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10946v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the optical properties of a charged black hole with scalar hair (CSH) within the context of four-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton gravity. To achieve this, we consider three distinct toy models of thin accretion disks. The presence of dilaton coupling allows us to express both the solutions of CSH and the Reissner-Nordstr\"om (RN) black hole in terms of their mass ($M$) and charge ($Q$). Our findings reveal differences in the effective potentials $V_{eff}$, photon sphere radii $r_{ph}$, and innermost stable circular orbit $r_{isco}$ between the CSH and RN black hole cases, which become increasingly pronounced as the charge parameter $Q$ increases. However, no noticeable distinctions are observed concerning the critical impact parameter $b_{ph}$. When the ratio of the photon ring band and the lensed ring band exceeds 0.1, it may suggest the presence of a charged black hole with scalar hair. Furthermore, our results underscore the significant influence of the charge parameter $Q$ on the brightness distributions of the direct, lensed ring, and photon ring for three standard emission functions. These findings emphasize the potential for distinguishing between CSH and RN black holes through an analysis of direct intensity and peak brightness in specific accretion disk models.</description>

      <title>Black holes immersed in dark matter: energy condition and sound speed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01277v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study the impact of the environment around a black hole in detail. We introduce non-vanishing radial pressure in a manner analogous to compact stars. We examine both isotropic and anisotropic fluid configurations with and without radial pressure respectively. Our focus extends beyond just dark matter density to the vital role of the energy condition and sound speed in the spacetime of a black hole immersed in matter. In cases of anisotropic pressure with vanishing radial pressure, all profiles violate the dominant energy condition near the BH, and the tangential sound speed exceeds light speed for all dark matter profiles. In our second approach, without assuming vanishing radial pressure, we observe similar violations and superluminal sound speeds. To rectify this, we introduce a hard cutoff for the sound speed, ensuring it remains subluminal. As a consequence, the energy condition is also satisfied. However, this results in increased density and pressure near the BH. This raises questions about the sound speed and its impact on the density structure, as well as questions about the validity of the model itself. With the matter distribution, we also compute the metric for different configurations. It reveals sensitivity to the profile structure. The metric components point towards the horizon structure.</description>

      <title>Analytical Insights into Constant-Roll Condition: Extending the Paradigm to Non-Canonical Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05998v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the prospect of generalizing the constant-roll condition in canonical inflationary model to non-canonical models. To find a natural generalization, we focus on three manifestations of this condition and construct constant-roll models corresponding to each manifestation. These models are not equivalent but reduce to the familiar constant-roll model in canonical limit. To showcase the applicability of our generalized mechanism, we examine a specific class of non-canonical models, which can be viewed as extensions of k/G inflation. In these models sound speed is constant. We conduct a comparative study, and with an analytical examination of the model, specify instances when our constant-roll conditions yield dissimilar outcomes and when they exhibit analogies. We also apply our findings to scrutinize another kinetically driven inflationary model with varying sound speed. We demonstrate that each of our constant-roll conditions leads to a unique set of solutions. Afterward, we construct a four-stage constant-roll kinetically driven inflation that complies with CMB constraints, it sustains for a sufficiently long period of time, and finally gracefully exits. In this model the spectrum of curvature perturbations is enhanced in a brief phase of non-slow-roll inflationary evolution. Employing numerical methods, we analyse this scenario to elucidate how altering the constant-roll condition impacts the power spectrum and the model's dynamics.</description>

      <title>Supporting traversable wormholes: the case for noncommutative geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08392v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While wormholes may be just as good a prediction of Einstein's theory as black holes, they are subject to severe restrictions from quantum field theory. In particular, a wormhole can only be held open by violating the null energy condition, calling for the existence of "exotic matter," a condition that many researchers consider completely unphysical, enough to rule out macroscopic traversable wormholes. An equally serious problem is the enormous radial tension at the throat of a typical Morris-Thorne wormhole unless the wormhole has an extremely large throat size. It has been proposed that noncommutative geometry, an offshoot of string theory, may be the proper tool for addressing these issues. The purpose of this paper is two-fold: (1) to refine previous arguments to make a stronger and more detailed case for this proposal and (2) to obtain a complete wormhole solution from the given conditions.</description>

      <title>Phase space path integral approach to the kinetics of black hole phase transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.02260v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We employ the approach of path integral in the phase space to study the kinetics of state switching associated with black hole phase transitions. Under the assumption that the state switching process of the black hole is described by the stochastic Langevin equation based on the free energy landscape, we derived the Martin-Siggia-Rose-Janssen-de Dominicis (MSRJD) functional and obtained the path integral expression of the transition probability. The MSRJD functional inherently represents the path integral in the phase space, allowing us to extract the effective Hamiltonian for the dynamics of state switching process. By solving the Hamiltonian equations of motion, we obtain the kinetic path in the phase space using an example of the RNAdS black hole. Furthermore, the dominant kinetic path within the configuration space is calculated. We also discuss the kinetic rate by using the functional formalism. Finally, we examine two further examples: Hawking-Page phase transition and Gauss-Bonnet black hole phase transition at the triple point. Our analysis demonstrates that, concerning the Hawking-Page phase transition, while a dominant kinetic path in the phase space from the large SAdS black hole to the thermal AdS space is present, there is no kinetic path for the inverse process. For the Gauss-Bonnet black hole phase transition at the triple point, the state switching processes between the small, the intermediate and the large Gauss-Bonnet black holes constitute a chemical reaction cycle.</description>

      <title>Quantum ballet by gravitational waves: Generating entanglement's dance of revival-collapse and memory within the quantum system</title>

Abstract: Recent proposals are emerging for the experimental detection of entanglement mediated by classical gravity, carrying significant theoretical and observational implications. In fact, the detection of gravitational waves (GWs) in LIGO provides an alternative laboratory for testing various gravity-related properties. By employing LIGO's arms as oscillators interacting with gravitational waves (GWs), our study demonstrates the potential for generating quantum entanglement between two mutually orthogonal modes of simple harmonic oscillators. Our findings reveal unique entanglement dynamics, including periodic "collapse and revival" influenced by GW oscillations, alongside a distinct "quantum memory effect." Effectively, each harmonic oscillator feels a temperature. We believe that these forecasts may hold significance towards both theoretically probing and experimentally verifying various properties of classical gravitational waves.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.02850v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We quantize a homogeneous and isotropic universe for two models of modified teleparallel gravity, wherein an arbitrary function of the boundary term, namely $B$, is present in the action and in the other model a scalar field that is non-minimally coupled to both the torsion and boundary term. In this regard, we study exact solutions of both the classical and quantum frameworks by utilizing the corresponding Wheeler-DeWitt (WDW) equations of the models. To correspond to the comprehensive classical and quantum levels, in the second model, we propose an appropriate initial condition for the wave packets and observe that they closely adhere to the classical trajectories and reach their peak. We quantify this correspondence using the de-Broglie Bohm interpretation of quantum mechanics. According to this proposal, the classical and Bohmian trajectories coincide when the quantum potential vanishes along the Bohmian paths. Furthermore, we apply the de-parameterization technique to our model in the realm of the problem of time in quantum cosmological models based on the WDW equation, utilizing the global internal time denoted as $\chi$, which represents a scalar field.</description>

      <title>Preventing the Destruction of Kerr Black Hole Event Horizons with Cold Dark Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11482v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since the proposal of the Weak Cosmic Censorship Conjecture, research on this conjecture has been abundant. Therefore, investigating this conjecture in black holes that are closer to those existing in the real universe, namely rotating black holes enveloped by dark matter, holds greater physical significance. Additionally, for a black hole that exists in the universe, it serves as a natural laboratory where we can verify the conjecture by absorbing particles through accretion disks. In this paper, we conduct research by employing the method of shooting a test particle and a scalar field into the Kerr-like black hole immersed in dark matter halos. In our analysis using a test particle, we not only confine ourselves to first-order scenarios but also extend to higher-order cases. Our analysis results indicate that, in extremal scenarios, neither a test particle nor a scalar field can disrupt the black hole's event horizon. In near-extremal scenarios, the incident scalar field cannot make the black hole over-spin, while when a test particle is incident, there exists an extremely narrow range that can disrupt the black hole's event horizon. In summary, due to the presence of dark matter halos hindering black hole over-spin, it seems that cold dark matter plays a supervisory role. Without considering cold dark matter, our conclusions align with previous studies.</description>

Abstract: We show that a globally hyperbolic spacetime containing a trapped surface and satisfying the strong energy condition and a condition on certain radial tidal forces must be timelike geodesically incomplete. This constitutes a "timelike" version of Penrose's celebrated singularity theorem. Recall that the latter concludes that certain spacetimes are null incomplete, providing the first theoretical evidence that black holes actually exist in our Universe. By concluding timelike instead of null incompleteness, we obtain, at the expense of stronger assumptions, a clearer physical interpretation and the existence of an event horizon.</description>

      <title>Symplectic mechanics of relativistic spinning compact bodies II.: Canonical formalism in the Schwarzschild spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05049v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work constitutes the second part of a series of studies that aim to utilise tools from Hamiltonian mechanics to investigate the motion of an extended body in general relativity. The first part of this work [Refs. [1, 2]] constructed a ten-dimensional, covariant Hamiltonian framework encompassing all the linear-in-spin corrections to the geodesic motion in arbitrary spacetime. This framework was proven to be integrable in the Schwarzschild and Kerr spacetimes, specifically. The present work translates this abstract integrability result into tangible applications for linear-in-spin Hamiltonian dynamics of a compact object in a Schwarzschild spacetime. In particular, a canonical system of coordinates is constructed explicitly, which exploits the spherical symmetry of the Schwarzschild spacetime. These coordinates are based on a relativistic generalization of the classical Andoyer variables of Newtonian rigid body motion. This canonical setup allows us to derive ready-to-use formulae for action-angle coordinates and gauge-invariant Hamiltonian frequencies, which automatically include all linear-in-spin effects. No external parameters or ad hoc choices are necessary, and the framework can be used to find complete solutions by quadrature of generic (bound or unbound), linear-in-spin orbits, including orbital inclination, precession and eccentricity, as well as spin precession. The efficacy of the formalism is demonstrated here in the context of circular orbits with arbitrary spin and orbital precession, with the results validated against known results in the literature.</description>

Abstract: Fractional differential calculus is a mathematical tool that has found applications in the study of social and physical behaviors considered ``anomalous''. It is often used when traditional integer derivatives models fail to represent cases where the power law is observed accurately. Fractional calculus must reflect non-local, frequency- and history-dependent properties of power-law phenomena. This tool has various important applications, such as fractional mass conservation, electrochemical analysis, groundwater flow problems, and fractional spatiotemporal diffusion equations. It can also be used in cosmology to explain late-time cosmic acceleration without the need for dark energy. We review some models using fractional differential equations. We look at the Einstein--Hilbert action, which is based on a fractional derivative action, and add a scalar field, $\phi$, to create a non-minimal interaction theory with the coupling, $\xi R \phi^2 $, between gravity and the scalar field, where $\xi$ is the interaction constant. By employing various mathematical approaches, we can offer precise schemes to find analytical and numerical approximations of the solutions. Moreover, we comprehensively study the modified cosmological equations and analyze the solution space using the theory of dynamical systems and asymptotic expansion methods. This enables us to provide a qualitative description of cosmologies with a scalar field based on fractional calculus formalism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13996v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using effective field theory methods, we compute in detail the Lagrangian for the conservative dynamics of compact binary systems, for spinless constituents and in the gravitationally bound case, in massless scalar-tensor (ST) and Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity (EsGB) to the second post-Newtonian (2PN) order. We employ the Kaluza-Klein parametrization of the metric, and demonstrate that, also in this case, a significant reduction in the number of diagrams is achieved. Still, to the 2PN accuracy, an additional 39 diagrams involving scalar interactions must be added to the pure general relativistic result. Diagrams involving the Gauss-Bonnet term at the formal 1PN order are computed and shown to scale as a 3PN correction when observational constraints are taken into account. We also investigate at which order the additional $\mathcal{O}(G^3)$ topologies contribute. Finally, the results derived in this paper provide an essential step toward the correct derivation of the conservative dynamics at the 3PN level in ST and EsGB theories.</description>

      <title>Globally hyperbolic evaporating black hole and the information loss issue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19140v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the information loss issue for completely evaporating black holes in the context of a globally hyperbolic spacetime that maintains unchanged the entire semiclassical picture except for the ``last evaporation breath,'' which pertains to full quantum gravity. Even though observers outside the black hole cannot access information that enters the horizon, there is no actual loss of information since it is carried over from one Cauchy surface to the next (provided the evolution is unitary).</description>

      <title>Bounds on the mass of superradiantly unstable scalar fields around Kerr black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01003v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we compute numerical bounds on the mass $\mu$ of superradiantly unstable scalar fields in a Kerr black hole background using the continued fraction method. We show that the normalized upper bound on the mass $\mu$ increases with the angular momentum number $\ell$ and the azimuthal number $m$, approaching the most stringent analytical bound known to date when $\ell=m \gg 1$. We also provide an analytical fit to the numerically determined mass bound as a function of the dimensionless spin parameter $a/M$ of the black hole with an accuracy of the order $0.1\%$ for the fundamental mode with $\ell=m=1$, and of the order $1\%$ for higher-order modes (up to $\ell=m=20$). We argue that this analytical fit is particularly useful in astrophysical scenarios, since the lowest $\ell=m$ modes are capable of producing the strongest observable imprints of superradiance.</description>

      <title>Bubble wall velocity and gravitational wave in the minimal left-right symmetric model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01949v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The bubble wall velocity in the first order phase transition plays an important role in determining both the amplitude and the pivot frequency of stochastic gravitational wave background. In the framework of the minimal left-right symmetric model, we study the wall velocity when the first order phase transition can occur. The wall velocity can be determined by matching the distribution functions in the free particle approximation and the local thermal equilibrium approximation. It is found that the wall velocity can be determined in the range $ 0.2 &lt; v_w &lt; 0.5 $ for the parameter space with the first order phase transition. It is also found that for the case when the wall velocity is close to the speed of sound, the peak amplitude of gravitational wave spectrum can be larger than that in the runaway case. Moreover, It is also found that there exists an approximate power law between the wall velocity and pressure difference between broken and symmetry phases, and the power index is equal to 0.41 or so.</description>

      <title>Constraints on dark photon dark matter using data from LIGO's and Virgo's third observing run</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.13085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.13085v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a search for dark photon dark matter that could couple to gravitational-wave interferometers using data from Advanced LIGO and Virgo's third observing run. To perform this analysis, we use two methods, one based on cross-correlation of the strain channels in the two nearly aligned LIGO detectors, and one that looks for excess power in the strain channels of the LIGO and Virgo detectors. The excess power method optimizes the Fourier Transform coherence time as a function of frequency, to account for the expected signal width due to Doppler modulations. We do not find any evidence of dark photon dark matter with a mass between $m_{\rm A} \sim 10^{-14}-10^{-11}$ eV/$c^2$, which corresponds to frequencies between 10-2000 Hz, and therefore provide upper limits on the square of the minimum coupling of dark photons to baryons, i.e. $U(1)_{\rm B}$ dark matter. For the cross-correlation method, the best median constraint on the squared coupling is $\sim2.65\times10^{-46}$ at $m_{\rm A}\sim4.31\times10^{-13}$ eV/$c^2$; for the other analysis, the best constraint is $\sim 2.4\times 10^{-47}$ at $m_{\rm A}\sim 5.7\times 10^{-13}$ eV/$c^2$. These limits improve upon those obtained in direct dark matter detection experiments by a factor of $\sim100$ for $m_{\rm A}\sim [2-4]\times 10^{-13}$ eV/$c^2$, and are, in absolute terms, the most stringent constraint so far in a large mass range $m_A\sim$ $2\times 10^{-13}-8\times 10^{-12}$ eV/$c^2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.00709v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I explore whether distinguishing features of phase transitions and/or the inflationary energy scale can be imprinted on cosmological observables due to entanglement during inflation, given a spectator scalar field with a Higgs-like potential. As a consequence of this analysis, I also present results that illustrate the variety of features a Higgs-like spectator can imprint on the primordial power spectrum due to entanglement, as well as how easy it might be to distinguish such spectra from other similar scalar field results at the level of CMB residuals. I utilize the technical framework for dynamically generated entangled states developed in ( arXiv:2211.11079 [hep-th] , arXiv:2104.13410 [hep-th] ) to obtain my results.</description>

      <title>The state of the dark energy equation of state circa 2023</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.14802v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We critically examine the state of current constraints on the dark energy (DE) equation of state (EoS) $w$. Our study is motivated by the observation that, while broadly consistent with the cosmological constant value $w=-1$, several independent probes appear to point towards a slightly phantom EoS ($w \sim -1.03$) which, if confirmed, could have important implications for the Hubble tension. We pay attention to the apparent preference for phantom DE from Planck Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data alone, whose origin we study in detail and attribute to a wide range of (physical and geometrical) effects. We deem the combination of Planck CMB, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, Type Ia Supernovae, and Cosmic Chronometers data to be particularly trustworthy, inferring from this final consensus dataset $w=-1.013^{+0.038}_{-0.043}$, in excellent agreement with the cosmological constant value. Overall, despite a few scattered hints, we find no compelling evidence forcing us away from the cosmological constant (yet).</description>

      <title>Approximate CFTs and Random Tensor Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.03829v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A key issue in both the field of quantum chaos and quantum gravity is an effective description of chaotic conformal field theories (CFTs), that is CFTs that have a quantum ergodic limit. We develop a framework incorporating the constraints of conformal symmetry and locality, allowing the definition of ensembles of `CFT data'. These ensembles take on the same role as the ensembles of random Hamiltonians in more conventional quantum ergodic phases of many-body quantum systems. To describe individual members of the ensembles, we introduce the notion of approximate CFT, defined as a collection of `CFT data' satisfying the usual CFT constraints approximately, i.e. up to small deviations. We show that they generically exist by providing concrete examples. Ensembles of approximate CFTs are very natural in holography, as every member of the ensemble is indistinguishable from a true CFT for low-energy probes that only have access to information from semi-classical gravity. To specify these ensembles, we impose successively higher moments of the CFT constraints. Lastly, we propose a theory of pure gravity in AdS$_3$ as a random matrix/tensor model implementing approximate CFT constraints. This tensor model is the maximum ignorance ensemble compatible with conformal symmetry, crossing invariance, and a primary gap to the black-hole threshold. The resulting theory is a random matrix/tensor model governed by the Virasoro 6j-symbol.</description>

      <title>Probing Parity Violation in the Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background with Astrometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.16666v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Astrometry holds the potential for testing fundamental physics through the effects of the Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background (SGWB) in the $\sim 1-100$ nHz frequency band on precision measurements of stellar positions. Such measurements are complementary to tests made possible by the detection of the SGWB using Pulsar Timing Arrays. Here, the feasibility of using astrometry for the identification of parity-violating signals within the SGWB is investigated. This is achieved by defining and quantifying a non-vanishing $EB$ correlation function within astrometric correlation functions, and investigating how one might estimate the detectability of such signals.</description>

      <title>Search for Non-Tensorial Gravitational-Wave Backgrounds in the NANOGrav 15-Year Data Set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.11238v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent detection of a stochastic signal in the NANOGrav 15-year data set has aroused great interest in uncovering its origin. However, the evidence for the Hellings-Downs correlations, a key signature of the gravitational-wave background (GWB) predicted by general relativity, remains inconclusive. In this letter, we search for an isotropic non-tensorial GWB, allowed by general metric theories of gravity, in the NANOGrav 15-year data set. Our analysis reveals a Bayes factor of approximately 2.5, comparing the quadrupolar (tensor transverse, TT) correlations to the scalar transverse (ST) correlations, suggesting that the ST correlations provide a comparable explanation for the observed stochastic signal in the NANOGrav data. We obtain the median and the $90\%$ equal-tail amplitudes as $\mathcal{A}_\mathrm{ST} = 7.8^{+5.1}_{-3.5} \times 10^{-15}$ at the frequency of 1/year. Furthermore, we find that the vector longitudinal (VL) and scalar longitudinal (SL) correlations are weakly and strongly disfavoured by data, respectively, yielding upper limits on the amplitudes: $\mathcal{A}_\mathrm{VL}^{95\%} \lesssim 1.7 \times 10^{-15}$ and $\mathcal{A}_\mathrm{SL}^{95\%} \lesssim 7.4 \times 10^{-17}$. Lastly, we fit the NANOGrav data with the general transverse (GT) correlations parameterized by a free parameter $\alpha$. Our analysis yields $\alpha=1.74^{+1.18}_{-1.41}$, thus excluding both the TT ($\alpha=3$) and ST ($\alpha=0$) models at the $90\%$ confidence level.</description>

      <title>fkPT: Constraining scale-dependent modified gravity with the full-shape galaxy power spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10510v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modified gravity models with scale-dependent linear growth typically exhibit an enhancement in the power spectrum beyond a certain scale. The conventional methods for extracting cosmological information usually involve inferring modified gravity effects via Redshift Space Distortions (RSD), particularly through the time evolution of $f\sigma_8$. However, classical galaxy RSD clustering analyses encounter difficulties in accurately capturing the spectrum's enhanced power, which is better obtained from the broad-band power spectrum. In this sense, full-shape analyses aim to consider survey data using comprehensive and precise models of the whole power spectrum. Yet, a major challenge in this approach is the slow computation of non-linear loop integrals for scale-dependent modified gravity, precluding the estimation of cosmological parameters using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. Based on recent studies, in this work we develop a perturbation theory tailored for Modified Gravity, or analogous scenarios introducing additional scales, such as in the presence of massive neutrinos. Our approach only needs the calculation of the scale-dependent growth rate $f(k,t)$ and the limit of the perturbative kernels at large scales. We called this approximate technique as fk-Perturbation Theory and implemented it into the code fkpt, capable of computing the redshift space galaxy power spectrum in a fraction of a second. We validate our modeling and code with the $f(R)$ theory MG-GLAM and General Relativity NSeries sets of simulations. The code is available at https://github.com/alejandroaviles/fkpt</description>

      <title>Decoherence out of fire: Purity loss in expanding and contracting universes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.02832v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate quantum decoherence in a class of models which interpolates between expanding (inflation) and contracting (ekpyrosis) scenarios. For the cases which result in a scale-invariant power spectrum, we find that ekpyrotic universes lead to complete decoherence of the curvature perturbation before the bounce. This is in stark contrast to the inflationary case, where recoherence has been previously observed in some situations. Although the purity can be computed for couplings of all sizes, we also study the purity perturbatively and observe that late-time (secular growth) breakdown of perturbation theory often occurs in these cases. Instead, we establish a simple yet powerful late-time purity resummation which captures the exact evolution to a remarkable level, while maintaining analytical control. We conclude that the cosmological background plays a crucial role in the decoupling of the heavy fields during inflation and alternatives.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17730v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel correlation, $n_s$ - $\Delta N$, connecting CMB parameters to the required total e-folds for eternal inflation. This correlation provides a robust tool for evaluating eternal (string) inflation models using CMB data and explores the impact of quantum fluctuations on non-attractor phases. By generalizing eternal inflation criteria, our parameterization simplifies rigorous testing of predictions and reveals a link between refined de Sitter conjecture parameters and the eternal nature of the cosmic landscape. This points to a general tendency towards eternal behavior in low-energy effective field theories within the landscape, opening the possibility for our cosmic stage to potentially embrace a 'multiverse' scenario.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the relationships between classical observables in cosmology and the classical limit of quantum scattering amplitudes. We first look at the relation between Bogoliubov transformations and the notion of classical limit. Then, we compute the cosmological redshift for a particle in a cosmological background and the emitted gravitational waveform from a quantum field theory basis and its classical limit. We observe that there is no interpretation for the geodesic redshift purely in terms of on-shell amplitudes in flat space, given that the classical limit of a scalar 2-point vanishes when considering an FRW background with two asymptotically flat in and out regions. We resolve this apparent conundrum and recover the correct observable by showing that the action of Hermitian operators differ between the in and out regions, unlike standard approaches in flat spacetime. We then show that radiation reaction corrections to the redshift enter already at order $G$. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the emitted waveform can be represented solely in terms of an on-shell 3-point amplitude in flat space without energy conservation, providing a closed formula for the waveform in an impulsive FRW.</description>

      <title>The universal thermodynamic properties of Extremely Compact Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13166v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An extremely compact object (ECO) is defined as a quantum object without horizon, whose radius is just a small distance $s$ outside its Schwarzschild radius. We show that any ECO of mass $M$ in $d+1$ dimensions with $s\ll (M/m_p)^{2/(d-2)(d+1)}l_p$ must have (at leading order) the same thermodynamic properties -- temperature, entropy and radiation rates -- as the corresponding semiclassical black hole of mass $M$. An essential aspect of the argument involves showing that the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation has no consistent solution in the region just outside the ECO surface, unless this region is filled with radiation at the (appropriately blueshifted) Hawking temperature. In string theory it has been found that black hole microstates are fuzzballs -- objects with no horizon -- which are expected to have a radius that is only a little larger than the horizon radius. Thus the arguments of this paper provide a nice closure to the fuzzball paradigm: the absence of a horizon removes the information paradox, and the thermodynamic properties of the semiclassical hole are nonetheless recovered to an excellent approximation.</description>

      <title>Local-in-time Conservative Binary Dynamics at Fourth Post-Minkowskian Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04853v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Leveraging scattering information to describe binary systems in generic orbits requires identifying local- and nonlocal-in-time tail effects. We report here the derivation of the universal (non-spinning) local-in-time conservative dynamics at fourth Post-Minkowskian order, i.e. ${\cal O}(G^4)$. This is achieved by computing the nonlocal-in-time contribution to the deflection angle, and removing it from the full conservative value in [2112.11296,2210.05541]. Unlike the total result, the integration problem involves two scales, velocity and mass ratio, and features multiple polylogarithms, complete elliptic and iterated elliptic integrals, notably in the mass ratio. We reconstruct the local radial action, center-of-mass momentum and Hamiltonian, as well as the exact logarithmic-dependent part(s), all valid for generic orbits. We incorporate the remaining nonlocal terms for elliptic-like motion to sixth Post-Newtonian order. The combined Hamiltonian is in perfect agreement in the overlap with the Post-Newtonian state of the art. The results presented here provide the most accurate description of gravitationally-bound binaries harnessing scattering data to date, readily applicable to waveform modelling.</description>

      <title>Consistency of JWST Black Hole Observations with NANOGrav Gravitational Wave Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19650v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: JWST observations have opened a new chapter in studies of supermassive black holes (SMBHs), stimulating discussion of two puzzles: the abundance of SMBHs in the early Universe and the fraction of dual AGNs. In this paper we argue that the answers to these puzzles may be linked to an interpretation of the data on the nHz gravitational wave (GWs) discovered by NANOGrav and other Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs) in terms of SMBH binaries losing energy by interactions with their environments as well as by GW emission. According to this interpretation, the SMBHs in low-$z$ AGNs are the tip of the iceberg of the local SMBH population, which are mainly in inactive galaxies. This interpretation would favour the observability of GW signals from BH binaries in LISA and deciHz GW detectors.</description>

      <title>Phantom matter: a challenging solution to the cosmological tensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18845v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The idea of composite dark energy (DE) is quite natural since on general grounds we expect that the vacuum energy (associated to the cosmological term $\Lambda$) may appear in combination with other effective forms of DE, denoted $X$. This was indeed the old proposal from 2006 (cf. Ref. [42]), called the `$\Lambda$XCDM model'. In the current work, we deal with a simplified version of this model and exploit the possibility that $X$ behaves as `phantom matter' (PM), which appears in stringy versions of the running vacuum model (RVM). Unlike phantom DE, it satisfies the strong energy condition like usual matter, hence bringing to bear positive pressure at the expense of negative energy. Bubbles of PM may appear in the manner of a transitory `phantom vacuum' tunneled into the late universe before it heads towards a new de Sitter era, thereby offering a crop field for the growing of structures earlier than expected. Using SNIa, cosmic chronometers, transversal BAO, LSS data and the full CMB likelihood from Planck 2018, we find that the tensions virtually disappear in this stringy RVM scenario characterized by axionic dark matter. The value of $H_0$ emerging from our analysis proves compatible with SH0ES to within less than $0.25\sigma$ and the LSS growth tension is nonexistent. The statistical information criteria point to very strong evidence in favor of the PM solution. Finally, our approach favors quintessence-like behavior of the DE below $z\simeq 1.5$ at $\gtrsim 3\sigma$ CL, which is compatible with the recent DESI measurements.</description>

      <title>Inflationary complexity of thermal state</title>

Abstract: In this work, we systematically investigate the inflationary complexity of the two-mode squeezed state with thermal effect for the single field inflation, modified dispersion relation, and non-trivial sound speed with the method of closed system and open system, respectively. Since the various quantum gravitational framework could lead to this kind of modified dispersion relation and non-trivial sound speed, so that our analysis is valid for most inflationary models. $(a)$. The numeric of Krylov complexity in the method of the closed system indicates that the evolution of Krylov complexity highly depends on the squeezed angle parameter once taking the thermal effect into account, which will decay into some very tiny values, but the Krylov complexity will always enhance without thermal effect. $(b)$. The numeric of circuit complexity shows that the evolution is always increasing no matter whether there are thermal effects or not which is independent of the evolution of squeezed angle parameter. $(c)$. By utilizing the method of open system, we first construct the wave function. Our investigations show the evolution of Krylov complexity will enhance upon some peaks factoring in the thermal effects and the Krylov complexity will always increase without thermal effect. $(d)$. We also calculate the Krylov entropy in the method of closed system and open system, which indicates that the hotter the universe is, the more chaotic the universe becomes. Furthermore, our derivation for the Krylov complexity and Krylov entropy could nicely recover into the case of closed system under the weak dissipative approximation, which confirms the validity of construction for the wave function. Finally, our numeric of Lanczos coefficient shows that the non-trivial sound speed has minimal chaos compared to the other two cases.</description>
