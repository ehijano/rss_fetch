      <title>Lengths of Orthogonal Geodesic Chords on Riemannian Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $N$ be a closed submanifold of a complete manifold, $M$. Then under certain topological conditions, there exists an orthogonal geodesic chord beginning and ending in $N$. In this paper we establish an upper bound for the length of such a geodesic chord in terms of geometric bounds on $M$. For example, if $N$ is a $2$-dimensional sphere embedded in a closed Riemannian $n$-manifold, then there exists an orthogonal geodesic chord in $M$ with endpoints on $N$ that has length at most $$ (4d+96D +8232\sqrt{A})(2n+1) $$ where $d$ is the diameter of $M$, and $A$ and $D$ are the area and intrinsic diameter of $N$, respectively.</description>

      <title>Reduction principles for proper actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the core of a proper action by a Lie group $G$ on a smooth manifold $M$, extending the construction for $G$ compact by Skjelbred and Straume. Moreover, we show that many properties of a proper $G$-action on $M$ are determined by the action of a group $G'$ on the corresponding core $_cM$. We say that such properties admit a reduction principle. In particular, we prove that a proper isometric $G$-action on $M$ is polar (resp. hyperpolar) if and only if the $G'$-action on $_cM$ is polar (resp. hyperpolar). In the case of a proper action by syplectomorphisms on a symplectic manifold, we show that a reduction principle holds for coisotropic and infinitesimally almost homogeneous actions. We further study the coisotropic condition for the case of a proper Hamiltonian action and its relation with the symplectic stratification described by Lermann and Bates. In particular, we obtain several characterizations for coisotropic actions, some of which extend known results for the action of a compact group of holomorphic automorphisms on a compact K\"ahler manifold obtained by Huckleberry and Wurzbacher. Finally, we study some applications of the core construction for the action of a compact Lie group on a K\"ahler manifold by holomorphic isometries.</description>

      <title>Ricci Flow on Weighted Digraphs with Balancing Factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ricci curvature and Ricci flow have proven to be powerful tools for analyzing the geometry of discrete structures, particularly on undirected graphs, where they have been applied to tasks ranging from community detection to graph representation learning. However, their development on directed graphs remains limited, with Ricci flow being especially underexplored. In this work, we introduce a rigorous formulation of Ricci flow on directed weighted graphs, which evolves edge weights while preserving distances, and establish both the existence and uniqueness of its solutions. To capture the essence of asymmetry in directed networks and to enhance the capability of modeling more flexible structures, we incorporate a node-wise balancing factor that regulates between outflow and inflow. Building on the continuous Ricci flow evolution framework, we propose a discrete Ricci flow algorithm that is applicable to numerical computing. Numerical studies on various directed graph examples demonstrate the capacity of the proposed flow to reveal structural asymmetry and dynamic evolutions.</description>

Abstract: We prove that the conjectured capillary Blaschke-Santal\'o inequality holds for any unconditional, strictly convex capillary hypersurface when $\theta \in \left(0, \tfrac{\pi}{2}\right)$. Moreover, for $\theta \in \left(\tfrac{\pi}{2}, \pi\right)$, we show that the capillary volume product has no finite upper bound.</description>

      <title>On the Poincar\'e-Einstein manifolds with cylindrical conformal infinity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove several rigidity and quantitative rigidity results for asymptotically hyperbolic Poincar\'e-Einstein manifolds whose conformal infinities are diffeomorphic to a cylinder $S^1 \times S^{n - 1}$. It is a basic fact that the Riemannian product $S^1 \times S^{n - 1}$ can bound, in addition to a complete hyperbolic metric on $S^1 \times D^n$, other Poincar\'e-Einstein metrics such as the AdS-Schwarzschild metrics on $D^2 \times S^{n - 1}$.
  The main result shows that any Poincar\'e-Einstein filling of $S^1 \times S^{n - 1}$ must be hyperbolic if it is non-positively curved. As corollaries, the Poincar\'e-Einstein filling of $S^1 \times S^{n - 1}$ is unique when the length of circle factor is sufficiently large or the $L^2$-energy of the Weyl curvature is sufficiently small relative to the Yamabe constant of the conformal infinity. To prove the Weyl pinching rigidity, we established a new $\epsilon$-regularity for the Weyl curvature of a general class of Poincar\'e-Einstein manifolds with conformal infinity of positive Yamabe type, which includes non-compact and volume-collapsed families of Poincar\'e-Einstein spaces in all dimensions.</description>

      <title>St\"ackel and Eisenhart lifts, Haantjes geometry and Gravitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of St\"ackel lift as a novel geometric setting for the construction of large classes of integrable Hamiltonian systems. The St\"ackel lift extends the geometric framework underlying both the Riemannian and the Lorentzian-type classical Eisenhart lifts and is intimately related with Haantjes geometry. In particular, we establish that Hamiltonian systems constructed through St\"ackel lifts are naturally endowed with a symplectic-Haantjes structure.
  We also show that explicitly momentum-dependent lifting matrices produce systems interpretable as gravitational waves, or momentum-dependent metrics of Hamilton and Finsler geometries, with potential applications in modified gravity theories.</description>

      <title>Staying on the Manifold: Geometry-Aware Noise Injection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been shown that perturbing the input during training implicitly regularises the gradient of the learnt function, leading to smoother models and enhancing generalisation. However, previous research mostly considered the addition of ambient noise in the input space, without considering the underlying structure of the data. In this work, we propose several methods of adding geometry-aware input noise that accounts for the lower dimensional manifold the input space inhabits. We start by projecting ambient Gaussian noise onto the tangent space of the manifold. In a second step, the noise sample is mapped on the manifold via the associated geodesic curve. We also consider Brownian motion noise, which moves in random steps along the manifold. We show that geometry-aware noise leads to improved generalization and robustness to hyperparameter selection on highly curved manifolds, while performing at least as well as training without noise on simpler manifolds. Our proposed framework extends to learned data manifolds.</description>

      <title>Sasaki structures on general contact manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16697v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the concept of a Sasakian structure on a cooriented contact manifold, given by a compatibility between the contact form $\eta$ and a Riemannian metric $g_M$ on $M$, to the case of a general contact structure understood as a contact distribution. Traditionally, the compatibility can be expressed as the fact that the symplectic form $\omega=\mathrm{d}(s^2\eta)$ and the metric $g(x,s)=\mathrm{d} s\otimes\mathrm{d} s+s^2g_M(x)$ define on the cone $\mathcal{M}=M\times\mathbb{R}_+$ a K\"ahler structure. Since general contact structures can be realized as homogeneous symplectic structures $\omega$ on $\mathrm{GL}(1;\mathbb{R})$-principal bundles $P\to M$, it is natural to understand Sasakian structures in full generality as related to `homogeneous K\"ahler structures' on $P$. The difficulty is that, even locally, contact distributions do not provide any preferred contact form, so the standard approach cannot be directly applied. However, we succeeded in characterizing homogeneous K\"ahler structures on $(P,\omega)$ and discovering a canonical lift of Riemannian metrics from the contact manifold $M$ to $P$, which allowed us to define Sasakian structures for general contact manifolds. This approach is completely conceptual and avoids ad hoc choices. Moreover, it provides a natural concept of Sasakian manifold products which we develop in detail.</description>

      <title>Stability of systolic inequalities for the M\"obius strip and Klein bottle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13715v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The systolic area $\alpha_{sys}$ of a nonsimply connected compact Riemannian surface $(M,g)$ is defined as its area divided by the square of the systole, where the systole is equal to the length of a shortest noncontractible closed curve. The systolic inequality due to Bavard states that on the Klein bottle, the systolic area has the optimal lower bound $\frac{2\sqrt{2}}{\pi}$. Bavard also constructed metrics of minimal systolic area in any given conformal class. We give an alternative proof of these results, which also yields an estimate on the systolic defect $\alpha_{sys}-\frac{2\sqrt{2}}{\pi}$ in terms of the $L^2$-distance of the conformal factor to the metric which minimizes the systolic area. On the M\"obius strip, we also prove similar estimates for metrics in fixed conformal classes.</description>

      <title>BRIDGES Lectures: Flows of geometric structures, especially $\mathrm{G}_2$-structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11604v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The BRIDGES meeting in gauge theory, extremal structures, and stability was held June 2024 at l'Institut d'\'Etudes Scientifiques de Carg\`ese in Corsica, organized by Daniele Faenzi, Eveline Legendre, Eric Loubeau, and Henrique S\'a Earp. The first week was a summer school consisting of four independent but related lecture series by Oscar Garc\'ia Prada, Spiro Karigiannis, Laurent Manivel, and Ruxandra Moraru. The present document consists of notes for the lecture series by Spiro Karigiannis on "Flows of geometric structures, especially $\mathrm{G}_2$-structures". Some assistance in the preparation of these notes by the author was provided by several participants of the summer school. See the Comments field for more information.
  The main theme is short time existence (STE) and uniqueness for geometric flows. We first introduce geometric structures on manifolds and geometric flows of such structures. We discuss some qualitative features of geometric flows, and consider the notions of strong and weak parabolicity. We focus on the Ricci flow, explaining carefully the DeTurck trick to establish short-time existence and uniqueness, an argument which we then extend to a general class of geometric flows of Riemannian metrics, previewing similar ideas for flows of $\mathrm{G}_2$-structures. Finally, we consider geometric flows of $\mathrm{G}_2$-structures. We review the basics of $\mathrm{G}_2$-geometry and survey several different geometric flows of $\mathrm{G}_2$-structures. In particular, we clarify in what sense STE results for the $\mathrm{G}_2$ Laplacian flow differ from STE results for other geometric flows. We conclude with a summary of some recent results by the author with Dwivedi and Gianniotis, including a classification of all possible heat-type flows of $\mathrm{G}_2$-structures, and a sufficient condition for such a flow to admit STE and uniqueness by a modified DeTurck trick.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.11712v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: On symplectic manifolds, we introduce a Morse-type complex with elements generated by pairs of critical points of a Morse function. The differential of the complex consists of gradient flows and an integration of the symplectic structure over spaces of gradient flow lines. Using the Witten deformation method, we prove that the cohomology of this complex is independent of both the Riemannian metric and the Morse function used to define the complex and is in fact isomorphic to the cohomology of differential forms of Tsai, Tseng and Yau (TTY). We also obtain Morse-type inequalities that bound the dimensions of the TTY cohomologies by the number of Morse critical points and the interaction of symplectic structure with the critical points.</description>

      <title>Generic Structural Stability for $2 \times 2$ Systems of Hyperbolic Conservation Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08998v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a proof of generic structural stability for Riemann solutions to $2 \times 2$ system of hyperbolic conservation laws in one spatial variable, without diffusive terms. This means that for almost every left and right state, shocks and rarefaction solutions of the same type are preserved via perturbations of the flux functions, the left state, and the right state. The main assumptions for this proof involve standard assumptions on strict hyperbolicity and genuine non-linearity, a technical assumption on directionality of rarefaction curves, and the regular manifold (submersion) assumption motivated by concepts in differential topology. We show that the structural stability of the Riemann solutions is related to the transversality of the Hugoniot loci and rarefaction curves in the state space. The regular manifold assumption is required to invoke a variant of a theorem from differential topology, Thom's parametric transversality theorem, to show the genericity of transversality of these curves. This in turn implies the genericity of structural stability. We then apply this theorem to two examples: the p-system and a $2 \times 2$ system governing the evolution of gravity-driven monodisperse particle-laden thin films. In particular, we illustrate how one can verify all the above assumptions for the former, and apply the theorem to different numerical and physical aspects of the system governing the latter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12856v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the spectral selectors introduced by the author for closed strongly orderable contact manifolds satisfy algebraic properties analogous to those of the spectral selectors for lens spaces constructed by Allais, Sandon and the author using Givental's nonlinear Maslov index. As applications, first we establish a contact big fiber theorem for closed strongly orderable contact manifolds as well as for lens spaces. Second, when the Reeb flow is periodic, we construct a stably unbounded conjugation invariant norm on the contactomorphism group universal cover. Moreover, when all its orbits have the same period, we show that the Reeb flow is a geodesic for the discriminant and oscillation norms of Colin-Sandon. Finally, we generalize a theorem of Albers-Fuchs-Merry stating that non-orderability implies the Weinstein conjecture.</description>

      <title>Infinite Euclidean Distance Discriminants</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17456v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study infinite Euclidean distance discriminants of algebraic varieties, defined as the loci of data points whose fibers under the second projection from the Euclidean distance correspondence are positive-dimensional. In particular, these discriminants contain all data points with infinitely many critical points for the nearest-point problem. We present computer code that computes the infinite Euclidean distance discriminant, and use it to present numerous varieties with nonempty such discriminants. Moreover, we prove that for any data point, the fiber under the second projection is contained in a finite union of hyperspheres centered at that point. For curves, we include a complete characterization; their infinite Euclidean distance discriminants turn out to be affine linear spaces. Finally, we introduce and characterize skew-tube surfaces in three-dimensional space. By construction, these have a one-dimensional infinite Euclidean distance discriminant. We further demonstrate that many skew-tubes have significantly lower Euclidean distance degrees than generic surfaces of the same degree.</description>
