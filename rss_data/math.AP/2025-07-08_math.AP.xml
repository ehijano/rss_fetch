      <title>Boundary regularity of optimal transport maps on convex domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the regularity of optimal transport maps between convex domains with quadratic cost. For nondegenerate $C^{\alpha}$-densities, we prove $C^{1, 1-\varepsilon}$-regularity of the potentials up to the boundary. If in addition the boundary is $C^{1, \alpha}$, we improve this to $C^{2, \alpha}$-regularity. We also investigate pointwise $C^{1, 1}$-regularity at boundary points. We obtain a complete characterization of pointwise $C^{1, 1}$-regularity for planar polytopes in terms of the geometry of tangent cones. Furthermore, we study the regularity of optimal transport maps with degenerate densities on cones, which arise from recent developments in K\"ahler geometry. The main new technical tool we introduce is a monotonicity formula for optimal transport maps on convex domains which characterizes the homogeneity of blow-ups.</description>

      <title>Blow-up results for Inhomogeneous fourth-order nonlinear Schr\"odinger Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the blow-up phenomenon of the $H^2$ norm of solutions to the inhomogeneous biharmonic Schrodinger equation in two distinct scenarios. First, we consider the case of negative energy, analyzing separately the cases of radial and non-radial solutions. Then, we examine the positive energy case, where the energy is below that of the ground state and the ``kinetic'' energy exceeds the corresponding value for the ground state, again distinguishing between radial and non-radial solutions. Our approach is based on convexity methods, employing virial identities in the analysis.</description>

      <title>Existence and Uniqueness for Double-Phase Poisson Equations with Variable Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a class of nonlinear elliptic problems driven by a double-phase operator with variable exponents, arising in the modeling of heterogeneous materials undergoing phase transitions. The associated Poisson problem features a combination of two distinct growth conditions, modulated by a measurable weight function \( \mu \), leading to spatially varying ellipticity. Working within the framework of modular function spaces, we establish the uniform convexity of the modular associated with the gradient term. This structural property enables a purely variational treatment of the problem. As a consequence, we prove existence and uniqueness of weak solutions under natural and minimal assumptions on the variable exponents and the weight.</description>

      <title>Global weak solutions with higher regularity to the compressible isentropic Navier-Stokes equations in 2D bounded domains involving large initial data and vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is a continuation of our previous work (arXiv:2507.03505), where the global existence of weak solutions with higher regularity to the compressible isentropic Navier-Stokes equations in the half-plane involving large initial data and vacuum was established. We extend such a result to the case of two-dimensional bounded simply connected convex domains under a Navier-slip boundary condition. To overcome difficulties brought by boundary, some new estimates based on the effective viscous flux and a Desjardins-type logarithmic interpolation inequality play crucial roles.</description>

      <title>Lipschitz regularity for anisotropic fully nonlinear equations with nonstandard growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish interior Lipschitz regularity for solutions to anisotropic fully nonlinear equations with nonstandard growth, without imposing any restriction on the gap between the highest and lowest growth exponents. Our proof is based on an anisotropic variant of the seminal Ishii Lions method. Our result furnishes a viscosity analogue of the divergence-form theory in [Bousquet20], adapted to the non-divergence setting.</description>

      <title>The Logarithmic Laplacian on General Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are the first to present a Bochner integral representation of the logarithmic Laplacian on weighted graphs and to derive, under the assumption of stochastic completeness, its explicit pointwise form. For weighted lattice graphs with uniformly positive vertex measures, we establish sharp upper and lower bounds for the associated log kernel, prove that the logarithmic Laplacian fails to be bounded on l2, and offer an alternative derivation of the above formula. Moreover, we compute the Fourier multipliers of both the fractional and logarithmic Laplacians, and derive the exact large time behavior and off diagonal asymptotics of their heat kernels, including all sharp asymptotic constants.</description>

      <title>Traveling waves for highly degenerate and singular reaction-diffusion-advection equations with discontinuous coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sufficient conditions for either existence or non-existence of traveling wave solutions for a general quasi-linear reaction-diffusion-convection equation, possibly highly degenerate or singular, with discontinuous coefficients are furnished. Under an additional hypothesis on the convection term, the set of admissible wave speeds is characterized in terms of the minimum wave speed, which is estimated through a double-sided bound.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a class of {energy integrals}, associated to nonlinear and non-uniformly elliptic equations, with integrands $f(x,u,\xi)$ satisfying anisotropic $p_i,q$-growth conditions of the form $$ \sum_{i=1}^n \lambda_i (x)|\xi_i|^{p_i}\le {f}(x,u,\xi)\le \mu (x)\left\{|\xi|^{q} + |u|^{\gamma}+1\right\} $$ for some exponents $\gamma\ge q\geq p_i&gt;1$, and non-negative functions $\lambda_i,\mu$ subject to suitable summability assumptions. We prove the local boundedness of scalar local quasi-minimizers of such integrals.</description>

      <title>Generic mean curvature flow with obstacles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the obstacle problem associated to mean curvature flow. We add to the geometric vanishing-viscosity approximation of Evans and Spruck a singular perturbation that penalizes the violation of the constraint, and pass to the limit. The resulting level set formulation has unique solutions - up to fattening. Extending the work of Evans and Spruck and a work by Ullrich and one of the authors, we show that generic level sets of this flow are distributional solutions of the obstacle problem.</description>

      <title>Increasing Systemic Resilience to Socioeconomic Challenges: Modeling the Dynamics of Liquidity Flows and Systemic Risks Using Navier-Stokes Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern economic systems face unprecedented socioeconomic challenges, making systemic resilience and effective liquidity flow management essential. Traditional models such as CAPM, VaR, and GARCH often fail to reflect real market fluctuations and extreme events. This study develops and validates an innovative mathematical model based on the Navier-Stokes equations, aimed at the quantitative assessment, forecasting, and simulation of liquidity flows and systemic risks. The model incorporates 13 macroeconomic and financial parameters, including liquidity velocity, market pressure, internal stress, stochastic fluctuations, and risk premiums, all based on real data and formally included in the modified equation. The methodology employs econometric testing, Fourier analysis, stochastic simulation, and AI-based calibration to enable dynamic testing and forecasting. Simulation-based sensitivity analysis evaluates the impact of parameter changes on financial balance. The model is empirically tested using Georgian macroeconomic and financial data from 2010-2024, including GDP, inflation, the Gini index, CDS spreads, and LCR metrics. Results show that the model effectively describes liquidity dynamics, systemic risk, and extreme scenarios, while also offering a robust framework for multifactorial analysis, crisis prediction, and countercyclical policy planning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2112.05044v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a regularity results for weak solutions of Robin problems driven by the well-known Orlicz $g$-Laplacian operator. Precisely, by using a suitable variation of the Moser iteration technique, we prove that every weak solution of our problem is bounded. Moreover, we combine this result with the Lieberman regularity theorem, to show that every $C^1(\overline{\Omega})$-local minimizer is also a $W^{1,G}(\Omega)$-local minimizer for the corresponding energy functional of Robin-Orlicz problem.</description>

      <title>Heat Transfer Shape Optimization: Stability and Non-Optimality of the Ball</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.09303v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates shape optimization problems in the context of heat transfer, with a focus on the stability and non-optimality of round domains under Robin boundary conditions. Using the flow approach and Steklov eigenvalue estimates, we derive the necessary and sufficient stability conditions for a ball to maximize the averaged heat when the heat source is radially decreasing. Our results show that, counterintuitively, a ball may not be optimal for maximizing the averaged heat under heat convection, even with radially decreasing heat sources located on the center of the ball. Moreover, we identify stability-breaking phenomena by giving precise values of thresholds, which depend on the Robin coefficient, dimension, and volume constraints. Additionally, we demonstrate that a ball can maximize the averaged temperature under certain conditions and we also explore optimal shapes in thin insulation problems.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness and ill-posedness for a system of periodic quadratic derivative nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03565v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the Cauchy problem of a system of quadratic derivative nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations which was introduced by M. Colin and T. Colin (2004) as a model of laser-plasma interaction. For the nonperiodic setting, the authors proved some well-posedness results, which contain the scaling critical case for $d\geq 2$. In the present paper, we prove the well-posedness of this system for the periodic setting. In particular, well-posedness is proved at the scaling critical regularity for $d\geq 3$ under some conditions for the coefficients of the Laplacian. We also prove some ill-posedness results. As long as we use an iteration argument, our well-posedness results are optimal except for some critical cases.</description>

      <title>Positive solutions to general semilinear overdetermined boundary problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11902v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish the existence of positive solutions to a general class of overdetermined semilinear elliptic boundary problems on suitable bounded open sets $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^n$. Specifically, for $n\leq 4$ and under mild technical hypotheses on the coefficients and the nonlinearity, we show that there exist open sets $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ with smooth boundary and of any prescribed volume where the overdetermined problem admits a positive solution. The proof builds on ideas of Alt and Caffarelli on variational problems for functions defined on a bounded region. In our case, we need to consider functions defined on the whole $\mathbb{R}^n$, so the key challenge is to obtain uniform bounds for the minimizer and for the diameter of its support. Our methods extend to higher dimensions, although in this case the free boundary $\partial\Omega$ could have a singular set of codimension 5. The results are new even in the case of the Poisson equation $-\Delta v =g(x)$ with constant Neumann data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15220v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The super-critical Brezis-Nirenberg problem in an annulus is considered. The new uniqueness result of positive radial solutions is established for the three-dimensional case. It is also proved that the problem has at least three positive radial solutions when the inner radius of the annulus is sufficiently small and the outer radius of the annulus is in a certain range. Moreover, for each positive integer $k$, the problem has at least $k$ positive radial solutions when the exponent of the equation is greater than the critical Sobolev exponent and is less than the Joseph-Lundgren exponent.</description>

      <title>On Cauchy problem to the modified Camassa-Holm equation: Painlev\'{e} asymptotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09252v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the Painlev\'{e} asymptotics for the Cauchy problem of the modified Camassa-Holm (mCH) equation with decaying initial data \begin{align*}\nonumber &amp;m_t+\left((u^2-u_x^2)m\right)_x+\kappa u_{x}=0, \ (x,t)\in\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R}^+,\\ &amp;u(x,0)=u_0(x), \end{align*} where $u_0(x)\in H^{4,2}(\mathbb{R})$ and $\kappa$ is a constant. Recently, Yang and Fan (Adv. Math. 402 (2022) 108340) reported the long-time asymptotic results for the mCH equation in the different solitonic regions. The main purpose of our work is to study the asymptotic behavior of the mCH equation in the transition regions, which are the critical regions between the different solitonic regions. The key is to establish a connection between the solution for the Cauchy problem of the mCH equation in the transition region and the Painlev\'{e} II equation. With the $\bar{\partial}$-generalization of the Deift-Zhou nonlinear steepest descent method and double scaling limit technique, in two transition regions defined by \begin{align}\nonumber \mathcal{P}_{I}:=\{(x,t):0\leqslant \left|\frac{x}{t}-2\right|t^{2/3}\leqslant C\},~~~~\mathcal{P}_{II}:=\{(x,t):0\leqslant \left|\frac{x}{t}+1/4\right|t^{2/3}\leqslant C\}, \end{align} where $C&gt;0$ is a constant, we obtain that the leading order approximation to the solution of the mCH equation can be expressed in terms of the Painlev\'{e} II equation.</description>

      <title>Isolated singularities of solutions of certain quasi-linear elliptic inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12604v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a complete classification of the asymptotic behavior of isolated singularities for solutions satisfying \[ 0\le-\Delta_{p}u(x)\le \tau u^{\frac{n(p-1)}{n-p}} (x),\,\,u(x)\ge0,\,\,1&lt;p&lt;n,\,\,n\ge2, \]where $u(x)\in C^2(B(0,1)\backslash\{0\})$ and $B(0,1)\subset \mathbb R^n$.</description>

      <title>A priori bounds for stochastic porous media equations via regularity structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03575v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a priori bounds for solutions of singular stochastic porous media equations with multiplicative noise in their natural $L^1$-based regularity class. We consider the first singular regime, i.e.~noise of space-time regularity $\alpha-2$ for $\alpha\in(2/3,1)$, and prove modelledness of the solution in the sense of regularity structures with respect to the solution of the corresponding linear stochastic heat equation. The proof relies on the kinetic formulation of the equation and a novel renormalized energy inequality. A careful analysis allows to balance the degeneracy of the diffusion coefficient against sufficiently strong damping of the multiplicative noise for small values of the solution.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric Self-similar Spiral Solutions of 2-D Incomressible Euler Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05059v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct nonradial, self-similar solutions to the two-dimensional incompressible Euler equations in the absence of rotational symmetry. This generalizes the algebraic spiral solutions of Elling and Shao-Wei-Zhang.</description>

      <title>Holomorphic dependence for the Beltrami equation in Sobolev spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06175v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that, given a path of Beltrami differentials on $\mathbb C$ that live in and vary holomorphically in the Sobolev space $W^{l,\infty}_{loc}(\Omega)$ of an open subset $\Omega\subset \mathbb C$, the canonical solutions to the Beltrami equation vary holomorphically in $W^{l+1,p}_{loc}(\Omega)$ for admissible $p &gt; 2$. This extends a foundational result of Ahlfors and Bers (the case $l = 0$). As an application, we deduce that Bers metrics on surfaces depend holomorphically on their input data.</description>

      <title>Half-space Liouville-type theorems for minimal graphs with capillary boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03417v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove two Liouville-type theorems for capillary minimal graph over $\mathbb{R}^n_+$. First, if $u$ has linear growth, then for $n=2,3$ and for any $\theta\in(0,\pi)$, or $n\geq4$ and $\theta\in(\frac{\pi}6,\frac{5\pi}6)$, $u$ must be flat. Second, if $u$ is one-sided bounded on $\mathbb{R}^n_+$, then for any $n$ and $\theta\in(0,\pi)$, $u$ must be flat. The proofs build upon gradient estimates for the mean curvature equation over $\mathbb{R}^n_+$ with capillary boundary condition, which are based on carefully adapting the maximum principle to the capillary setting.</description>
