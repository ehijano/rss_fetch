      <title>Unsupervised machine learning for detecting mutual independence among eigenstate regimes in interacting quasiperiodic chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many-body eigenstates that are neither thermal nor many-body-localized (MBL) were numerically found in certain interacting chains with moderate quasiperiodic potentials. The energy regime consisting of these non-ergodic but extended (NEE) eigenstates has been extensively studied for being a possible many-body mobility edge between the energy-resolved MBL and thermal phases. Recently, the NEE regime was further proposed to be a prethermal phenomenon that generally occurs when different operators spread at sizably different timescales. Here, we numerically examine the mutual independence among the NEE, MBL, and thermal regimes in the lens of eigenstate entanglement spectra (ES). Given the complexity and rich information embedded in ES, we develop an unsupervised learning approach that is designed to quantify the mutual independence among general phases. Our method is first demonstrated on an illustrative toy example that uses RGB color data to represent phases, then applied to the ES of an interacting generalized Aubry Andre model from weak to strong potential strength. We find that while the MBL and thermal regimes are mutually independent, the NEE regime is dependent on the former two and smoothly appears as the potential strength decreases. We attribute our numerically finding to the fact that the ES data in the NEE regime exhibits both an MBL-like fast decay and a thermal-like long tail.</description>

      <title>About the AT line in Replica Symmetry Breaking assumption for spin glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Replica Symmetry Breaking is a fascinating phenomenon of spin glasses model which could have consequences also in other field of studies. Although there are several studies regarding the stability between the Replica Symmetric and first step of Replica Symmetry Breaking approximations, we do not have results for the following steps (apart from that one by Gardner for P-spin glasses in 1985). This is link to the fact that the classic method, based from the work by De Almeida and Thoules (from which the critical stability line takes its name), is difficult to be generalise for the next assumptions. In this paper we devise a new straightforward method inspired to the work by Toninelli in 2002 to recover the critical line in order to inspect the stability between the second step of Replica Symmetry Breaking and the first one. Moreover, we generalise to Kth step, with K finite.</description>

      <title>Effect of high pressure synthesis conditions on the formation of high entropy oxides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High entropy materials are often entropy stabilized, meaning that the configurational entropy from multiple elements sharing a single lattice site stabilizes the structure. In this work, we study how high-pressure synthesis conditions can stabilize or destabilize a high entropy oxide (HEO). We study the high-pressure and high-temperature phase equilibria of two well-known families of HEOs: the rock-salt structured compound (Mg,Co,Ni,Cu,Zn)O including some cation substitutions and the spinel structured (Cr,Mn,Fe,Co,Ni)$_3$O$_4$. Syntheses were performed at various temperatures, pressures, and oxygen activity levels resulting in dramatically different synthesis outcomes. In particular, in the rock salt HEO we observe the competing tenorite and wurtzite phases and the possible formation of a layered rock salt phase, while the spinel HEO is highly susceptible to decomposition into a mixture of rock-salt and corundum phases. At the highest tested pressures, 15 GPa, we discover the transformation of the spinel HEO into a metastable modified ludwigite-type structure with nominal formula (Cr,Mn,Fe,Co,Ni)$_4$O$_5$. The relationship between the synthesis conditions and the final reaction product is not straightforward. Nonetheless, we conclude that high-pressure conditions provide an important opportunity to synthesize high entropy phases that cannot be formed any other way.</description>

      <title>Disordered Lattice Glass $\phi^{4}$ Quantum Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study numerically the three-dimensional $\phi^{4}$ spin glass, a prototypical disordered and discretized Euclidean field theory that manifests inhomogeneities in space and time but considers a homogeneous squared mass and lambda terms. The $\phi^{4}$ lattice glass field theory is a conceptual generalization of spin glasses to continuous degrees of freedom and we discuss the existence of a limit under which it formally reduces to the Edwards-Anderson model. By defining four variants of an order parameter which are suitable for continuous spin glasses, we verify numerically the emergence of an overlap in absence of the magnetization thus confirming the presence of a spin glass phase transition for a value of a critical squared mass. We conclude by discussing how the $\phi^{4}$ spin glass can be utilized to address assumptions of complete homogeneity in space or time and how, in parallel to statistical physics, provides a suitable framework to investigate the nonperturbative dynamics of machine learning algorithms from the perspective of disordered lattice and constructive field theory.</description>

      <title>Quasiperiodicity protects quantized transport in disordered systems without gaps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The robustness of topological properties, such as adiabatic quantized currents, generally depends on the existence of gaps surrounding the relevant energy levels or symmetry-forbidden transitions. We uncover a new mechanism for topological protection via the observation of quantized currents which survive the addition of bounded local disorder large enough to close the relevant instantaneous energy gaps in a driven Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper chain, a prototypical model of quasiperiodic systems. Using a local picture in configuration-space based on Landau-Zener transitions, we show that in this case the topological protection does not depend on the spectral gaps, but rather on the number of states in an occupied band and the position of the band in configuration space. Moreover, we propose a protocol, realizable in cold atoms or photonic experiments, which leverages this stability to prepare topological many-body states with high Chern number and open new experimental avenues for the study of both the integer and fractional quantum Hall effects.</description>

      <title>Ring Structure in the Complex Plane: A Fingerprint of non-Hermitian Mobility Edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12266v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By Avila's global theory, we analytically reveal that the non-Hermitian mobility edge will take on a ring structure in the complex plane, which we name as "mobility ring". The universality of mobility ring has been checked and supported by the Hermitian limit, $PT$-symmetry protection and without $PT$-symmetry cases. Further, we study the evolution of mobility ring versus quasiperiodic strength, and find that in the non-Hermitian system, there will appear multiple mobility ring structures. With cross-reference to the multiple mobility edges in Hermitian case, we give the expression of the maximum number of mobility rings. Finally, by comparing the results of Avila's global theorem and self-duality method, we show that self-duality relation has its own limitations in calculating the critical point in non-Hermitian systems. As we know, the general non-Hermitian system has a complex spectrum, which determines that the non-Hermitian mobility edge can but exhibit a ring structure in the complex plane.</description>

      <title>Quantum criticality and Kibble-Zurek scaling in the Aubry-Andr\'{e}-Stark model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10199v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore quantum criticality and Kibble-Zurek scaling (KZS) in the Aubry-Andre-Stark (AAS) model, where the Stark field of strength $\varepsilon$ is added onto the one-dimensional quasiperiodic lattice. We perform scaling analysis and numerical calculations of the localization length, inverse participation ratio (IPR), and energy gap between the ground and first excited states to characterize critical properties of the delocalization-localization transition. Remarkably, our scaling analysis shows that, near the critical point, the localization length $\xi$ scales with $\varepsilon$ as $\xi\propto\varepsilon^{-\nu}$ with $\nu\approx0.3$ a new critical exponent for the AAS model, which is different from the counterparts for both the pure Aubry-Andre (AA) model and Stark model. The IPR $\mathcal{I}$ scales as $\mathcal{I}\propto\varepsilon^{s}$ with the critical exponent $s\approx0.098$, which is also different from both two pure models. The energy gap $\Delta E$ scales as $\Delta E\propto \varepsilon^{\nu z}$ with the same critical exponent $z\approx2.374$ as that for the pure AA model. We further reveal hybrid scaling functions in the overlap between the critical regions of the Anderson and Stark localizations. Moreover, we investigate the driven dynamics of the localization transitions in the AAS model. By linearly changing the Stark (quasiperiodic) potential, we calculate the evolution of the localization length and the IPR, and study their dependence on the driving rate. We find that the driven dynamics from the ground state is well described by the KZS with the critical exponents obtained from the static scaling analysis. When both the Stark and quasiperiodic potentials are relevant, the KZS form includes the two scaling variables. This work extends our understanding of critical phenomena on localization transitions and generalizes the application of the KZS to hybrid models.</description>

      <title>Quantum Hamiltonian Algorithms for Maximum Independent Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14546v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compare two quantum Hamiltonian algorithms that address the maximum independent set problem: one based on emergent non-abelian gauge matrix in adiabatic evolution of an energetically isolated manifold of states; and one based on designed application of single-qubit operations. We demonstrate that they are mathematically equivalent, though at first sight they appear quite different. Despite their mathematical equivalence, their most straightforward physical implementations are different. Our numerical simulations show significant differences in performance, and suggest improved experimental protocols.Intriguingly, this equivalence unveils a deeper connection. We also demonstrate that the PXP model, recently prominent in quantum dynamics research, arises as the non-abelian gauge matrix governing quantum diffusion over the median graph of all independent sets.</description>

      <title>Parametric Matrix Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11694v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a general class of machine learning algorithms called parametric matrix models. In contrast with most existing machine learning models that imitate the biology of neurons, parametric matrix models use matrix equations that emulate the physics of quantum systems. Similar to how physics problems are usually solved, parametric matrix models learn the governing equations that lead to the desired outputs. Parametric matrix models can be efficiently trained from empirical data, and the equations may use algebraic, differential, or integral relations. While originally designed for scientific computing, we prove that parametric matrix models are universal function approximators that can be applied to general machine learning problems. After introducing the underlying theory, we apply parametric matrix models to a series of different challenges that show their performance for a wide range of problems. For all the challenges tested here, parametric matrix models produce accurate results within an efficient and interpretable computational framework that allows for input feature extrapolation.</description>
