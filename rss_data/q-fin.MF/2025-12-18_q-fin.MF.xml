      <title>Arbitrage-Free Pricing with Diffusion-Dependent Jumps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Standard jump-diffusion models assume independence between jumps and diffusion components. We develop a multi-type jump-diffusion model where jump occurrence and magnitude depend on contemporaneous diffusion movements. Unlike previous one-sided models that create arbitrage opportunities, our framework includes upward and downward jumps triggered by both large upward and large downward diffusion increments. We derive the explicit no-arbitrage condition linking the physical drift to model parameters and market risk premia by constructing an Equivalent Martingale Measure using Girsanov's theorem and a normalized Esscher transform. This condition provides a rigorous foundation for arbitrage-free pricing in models with diffusion-dependent jumps.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning and Elicitability for McKean-Vlasov FBSDEs With Common Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel numerical method for solving McKean-Vlasov forward-backward stochastic differential equations (MV-FBSDEs) with common noise, combining Picard iterations, elicitability and deep learning. The key innovation involves elicitability to derive a path-wise loss function, enabling efficient training of neural networks to approximate both the backward process and the conditional expectations arising from common noise - without requiring computationally expensive nested Monte Carlo simulations. The mean-field interaction term is parameterized via a recurrent neural network trained to minimize an elicitable score, while the backward process is approximated through a feedforward network representing the decoupling field. We validate the algorithm on a systemic risk inter-bank borrowing and lending model, where analytical solutions exist, demonstrating accurate recovery of the true solution. We further extend the model to quantile-mediated interactions, showcasing the flexibility of the elicitability framework beyond conditional means or moments. Finally, we apply the method to a non-stationary Aiyagari--Bewley--Huggett economic growth model with endogenous interest rates, illustrating its applicability to complex mean-field games without closed-form solutions.</description>

      <title>SigMA: Path Signatures and Multi-head Attention for Learning Parameters in fBm-driven SDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic differential equations (SDEs) driven by fractional Brownian motion (fBm) are increasingly used to model systems with rough dynamics and long-range dependence, such as those arising in quantitative finance and reliability engineering. However, these processes are non-Markovian and lack a semimartingale structure, rendering many classical parameter estimation techniques inapplicable or computationally intractable beyond very specific cases. This work investigates two central questions: (i) whether integrating path signatures into deep learning architectures can improve the trade-off between estimation accuracy and model complexity, and (ii) what constitutes an effective architecture for leveraging signatures as feature maps. We introduce SigMA (Signature Multi-head Attention), a neural architecture that integrates path signatures with multi-head self-attention, supported by a convolutional preprocessing layer and a multilayer perceptron for effective feature encoding. SigMA learns model parameters from synthetically generated paths of fBm-driven SDEs, including fractional Brownian motion, fractional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck, and rough Heston models, with a particular focus on estimating the Hurst parameter and on joint multi-parameter inference, and it generalizes robustly to unseen trajectories. Extensive experiments on synthetic data and two real-world datasets (i.e., equity-index realized volatility and Li-ion battery degradation) show that SigMA consistently outperforms CNN, LSTM, vanilla Transformer, and Deep Signature baselines in accuracy, robustness, and model compactness. These results demonstrate that combining signature transforms with attention-based architectures provides an effective and scalable framework for parameter inference in stochastic systems with rough or persistent temporal structure.</description>

      <title>Fixed-Income Pricing and the Replication of Liabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14662v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper develops a model-free framework for static fixed-income pricing and the replication of liability cash flows. We show that the absence of static arbitrage across a universe of fixed-income instruments is equivalent to the existence of a strictly positive discount curve that reproduces all observed market prices. We then study the replication and super-replication of liabilities and establish conditions ensuring the existence of least-cost super-replicating portfolios, including a rigorous interpretation of swap--repo replication within this static framework. The results provide a unified foundation for discount-curve construction and liability-driven investment, with direct relevance for economic capital assessment and regulatory practice.</description>
