      <title>Data Reduction for Low Energy Nuclear Physics Experiments Using Data Frames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low energy nuclear physics experiments are transitioning towards fully digital data acquisition systems. Realizing the gains in flexibility afforded by these systems relies on equally flexible data reduction techniques. In this paper, methods utilizing data frames and in-memory techniques to work with data, including data from self-triggering, digital data acquisition systems, are discussed within the context of a Python package, \texttt{sauce}. It is shown that data frame operations can encompass common analysis needs and allow interactive data analysis. Two event building techniques, dubbed referenced and referenceless event building, are shown to provide a means to transform raw list mode data into correlated multi-detector events. These techniques are demonstrated in the analysis of two example data sets.</description>

      <title>Improvement of system identification of stochastic systems via Koopman generator and locally weighted expectation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimation of equations from data is of interest in physics. One of the famous methods is the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy), which utilizes sparse estimation techniques to estimate equations from data. Recently, a method based on the Koopman operator has been developed; the generator extended dynamic mode decomposition (gEDMD) estimates a time evolution generator of dynamical and stochastic systems. However, a naive application of the gEDMD algorithm could not work well for stochastic differential equations because of the noise effects in the data. Hence, the estimation based on conditional expectation values is practical, in which we approximate the first and second derivatives on each coordinate. A naive approach is the usage of locally weighted expectations. We show that the naive locally weighted expectation is not enough because of the nonlinear behavior of the underlying system. As for the improvement, we apply the clustering method in two ways; one is to reduce the effective number of data, and the other is to capture local information more accurately. We demonstrate the improvement of the proposed method for the double-well potential system with state-dependent noise.</description>

      <title>Integral Betti signature confirms the hyperbolic geometry of brain, climate, and financial networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper extends the possibility to examine the underlying curvature of data through the lens of topology by using the Betti curves, tools of Persistent Homology, as key topological descriptors, building on the clique topology approach. It was previously shown that Betti curves distinguish random from Euclidean geometric matrices - i.e. distance matrices of points randomly distributed in a cube with Euclidean distance. In line with previous experiments, we consider their low-dimensional approximations named integral Betti values, or signatures that effectively distinguish not only Euclidean, but also spherical and hyperbolic geometric matrices, both from purely random matrices as well as among themselves. To prove this, we analyse the behaviour of Betti curves for various geometric matrices -- i.e. distance matrices of points randomly distributed on manifolds of constant sectional curvature, considering the classical models of curvature 0, 1, -1, given by the Euclidean space, the sphere, and the hyperbolic space. We further investigate the dependence of integral Betti signatures on factors including the sample size and dimension. This is important for assessment of real-world connectivity matrices, as we show that the standard approach to network construction gives rise to (spurious) spherical geometry, with topology dependent on sample dimensions. Finally, we use the manifolds of constant curvature as comparison models to infer curvature underlying real-world datasets coming from neuroscience, finance and climate. Their associated topological features exhibit a hyperbolic character: the integral Betti signatures associated to these datasets sit in between Euclidean and hyperbolic (of small curvature). The potential confounding ``hyperbologenic effect'' of intrinsic low-rank modular structures is also evaluated through simulations.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Models for Accurately Predicting Properties of CsPbCl3 Perovskite Quantum Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Perovskite Quantum Dots (PQDs) have a promising future for several applications due to their unique properties. This study investigates the effectiveness of Machine Learning (ML) in predicting the size, absorbance (1S abs) and photoluminescence (PL) properties of $\mathrm{CsPbCl}_3$ PQDs using synthesizing features as the input dataset. the study employed ML models of Support Vector Regression (SVR), Nearest Neighbour Distance (NND), Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), Decision Tree (DT) and Deep Learning (DL). Although all models performed highly accurate results, SVR and NND demonstrated the best accurate property prediction by achieving excellent performance on the test and training datasets, with high $\mathrm{R}^2$ and low Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and low Mean Absolute Error (MAE) metric values. Given that ML is becoming more superior, its ability to understand the QDs field could prove invaluable to shape the future of nanomaterials designing.</description>

      <title>Entropy-driven decision-making dynamics sheds light on the emergence of the "paradox of choice"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decision making is the cognitive process of selecting a course of action among multiple alternatives. As the decision maker belongs to a complex microenvironment (which contains multiple decision makers), has to make a decision where multiple options are present which often leads to a phenomenon known as the "paradox of choices". The latter refers to the case where too many options can lead to negative outcomes, such as increased uncertainty, decision paralysis, and frustration. Here, we employ an entropy driven mechanism within a statistical physics framework to explain the premises of the paradox. In turn, we focus on the emergence of a collective "paradox of choice", in the case of interacting decision-making agents, quantified as the decision synchronization time. Our findings reveal a trade-off between synchronization time and the sensing radius, indicating the optimal conditions for information transfer among group members, which significantly depends the individual sensitivity parameters. Interestingly, when agents sense their microenvironment in a biased way or their decisions are influenced by their past choices, then the collective "paradox of choice" does not occur. In a nutshell, our theory offers a low-dimensional and unified statistical explanation of the "paradox of choice" at the individual and at the collective level.</description>

      <title>Brownian friction dynamics: fluctuations in sliding distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have studied the fluctuation (noise) in the position of sliding blocks under constant driving forces on different substrate surfaces. The experimental data are complemented by simulations using a simple spring-block model where the asperity contact regions are modeled by miniblocks connected to the big block by viscoelastic springs. The miniblocks experience forces that fluctuate randomly with the lateral position, simulating the interaction between asperities on the block and the substrate. The theoretical model provides displacement power spectra that agree well with the experimental results.</description>

      <title>A Mereological Approach to Higher-Order Structure in Complex Systems: from Macro to Micro with M\"obius</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14423v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Relating microscopic interactions to macroscopic observables is a central challenge in the study of complex systems. Addressing this question requires understanding both pairwise and \textit{higher-order} interactions, but the latter are less well understood. Here, we show that the M\"obius inversion theorem provides a general mathematical formalism for deriving higher-order interactions from macroscopic observables, relative to a chosen decomposition of the system into parts. Applying this framework to a diverse range of systems, we demonstrate that many existing notions of higher-order interactions, from epistasis in genetics and many-body couplings in physics, to synergy in game theory and artificial intelligence, naturally and uniquely arise from an appropriate mereological decomposition. By revealing the common mathematical structure underlying seemingly disparate phenomena, our work highlights the fundamental role of decomposition choice in the definition and estimation of higher-order interactions. We discuss how this unifying perspective can facilitate the transfer of insights between domains, guide the selection of appropriate system decompositions, and motivate the search for novel interaction types through new decomposition strategies. To illustrate how this works in practice, we derive a new decomposition of the KL-divergence, and show that it correctly disentangles divergences at different orders on simulated spin models. Our results suggest that the M\"obius inversion theorem provides a powerful and practical lens for understanding the emergence of complex behaviour from the interplay of microscopic parts, with applications across a wide range of disciplines.</description>

      <title>Local primordial non-Gaussianity from the large-scale clustering of photometric DESI luminous red galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.01753v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use angular clustering of luminous red galaxies from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) imaging surveys to constrain the local primordial non-Gaussianity parameter $\fnl$. Our sample comprises over 12 million targets, covering 14,000 square degrees of the sky, with redshifts in the range $0.2&lt; z &lt; 1.35$. We identify Galactic extinction, survey depth, and astronomical seeing as the primary sources of systematic error, and employ linear regression and artificial neural networks to alleviate non-cosmological excess clustering on large scales. Our methods are tested against simulations with and without $\fnl$ and systematics, showing superior performance of the neural network treatment. The neural network with a set of nine imaging property maps passes our systematic null test criteria, and is chosen as the fiducial treatment. Assuming the universality relation, we find $\fnl = 34^{+24(+50)}_{-44(-73)}$ at 68\%(95\%) confidence. We apply a series of robustness tests (e.g., cuts on imaging, declination, or scales used) that show consistency in the obtained constraints. We study how the regression method biases the measured angular power-spectrum and degrades the $\fnl$ constraining power. The use of the nine maps more than doubles the uncertainty compared to using only the three primary maps in the regression. Our results thus motivate the development of more efficient methods that avoid over-correction, protect large-scale clustering information, and preserve constraining power. Additionally, our results encourage further studies of $\fnl$ with DESI spectroscopic samples, where the inclusion of 3D clustering modes should help separate imaging systematics and lessen the degradation in the $\fnl$ uncertainty.</description>

      <title>First principles construction of symmetry-informed quantum metrologies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16410v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Combining quantum and Bayesian principles leads to optimality in metrology, but the optimisation equations involved are often hard to solve. This work mitigates this problem with a novel class of measurement strategies for quantities isomorphic to location parameters, which are shown to admit a closed-form optimisation. The resulting framework admits any parameter range, prior information, or state, and the associated estimators apply to finite samples. As an example, the metrology of relative weights is formulated from first principles and shown to require hyperbolic errors. The primary advantage of this approach lies in its simplifying power: it reduces the search for good strategies to identifying which symmetry leaves a state of maximum ignorance invariant. This will facilitate the application of quantum metrology to fundamental physics, where symmetries play a key role.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Domain Adaptation to Understand Physico-Chemical Processes from Fluorescence Spectroscopy Small Datasets: Application to Ageing of Olive Oil</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10031v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fluorescence spectroscopy is a fundamental tool in life sciences and chemistry, widely used for applications such as environmental monitoring, food quality control, and biomedical diagnostics. However, analysis of spectroscopic data with deep learning, in particular of fluorescence excitation-emission matrices (EEMs), presents significant challenges due to the typically small and sparse datasets available. Furthermore, the analysis of EEMs is difficult due to their high dimensionality and overlapping spectral features. This study proposes a new approach that exploits domain adaptation with pretrained vision models, alongside a novel interpretability algorithm to address these challenges. Thanks to specialised feature engineering of the neural networks described in this work, we are now able to provide deeper insights into the physico-chemical processes underlying the data. The proposed approach is demonstrated through the analysis of the oxidation process in extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) during ageing, showing its effectiveness in predicting quality indicators and identifying the spectral bands, and thus the molecules involved in the process. This work describes a significantly innovative approach in the use of deep learning for spectroscopy, transforming it from a black box into a tool for understanding complex biological and chemical processes.</description>

      <title>Application of Haldane's statistical correlation theory in classical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14327v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This letter investigates the application of Haldane's statistical correlation theory in classical systems. A modified statistical correlation theory has been proposed by including non-linearity in the form of an exponent into the original theory of Haldane. The dependence of the statistical correlation on indistinguishability is highlighted. Using this modified theory, a quasi-classical derivation of intermediate statistics is shown where indistinguishability can be introduced into distinguishable systems in the form of a statistical correlation. The final result is equivalent to the classical fractional exclusion statistics (CFES), which was derived earlier using a purely classical route. An extended non-linear correlation model based on power series expansion is also proposed, which can produce various intermediate statistical models.</description>
