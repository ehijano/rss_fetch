      <title>The Exploratory Study on the Relationship Between the Failure of Distance Metrics in High-Dimensional Space and Emergent Phenomena</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a unified framework, integrating information theory and statistical mechanics, to connect metric failure in high-dimensional data with emergence in complex systems. We propose the "Information Dilution Theorem," demonstrating that as dimensionality ($d$) increases, the mutual information efficiency between geometric metrics (e.g., Euclidean distance) and system states decays approximately as $O(1/d)$. This decay arises from the mismatch between linearly growing system entropy and sublinearly growing metric entropy, explaining the mechanism behind distance concentration. Building on this, we introduce information structural complexity ($C(S)$) based on the mutual information matrix spectrum and interaction encoding capacity ($C'$) derived from information bottleneck theory. The "Emergence Critical Theorem" states that when $C(S)$ exceeds $C'$, new global features inevitably emerge, satisfying a predefined mutual information threshold. This provides an operational criterion for self-organization and phase transitions. We discuss potential applications in physics, biology, and deep learning, suggesting potential directions like MI-based manifold learning (UMAP+) and offering a quantitative foundation for analyzing emergence across disciplines.</description>

      <title>Universal Rate-Distortion-Classification Representations for Lossy Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In lossy compression, Wang et al. [1] recently introduced the rate-distortion-perception-classification function, which supports multi-task learning by jointly optimizing perceptual quality, classification accuracy, and reconstruction fidelity. Building on the concept of a universal encoder introduced in [2], we investigate the universal representations that enable a broad range of distortion-classification tradeoffs through a single shared encoder coupled with multiple task-specific decoders. We establish, through both theoretical analysis and numerical experiments, that for Gaussian source under mean squared error (MSE) distortion, the entire distortion-classification tradeoff region can be achieved using a single universal encoder. For general sources, we characterize the achievable region and identify conditions under which encoder reuse results in negligible distortion penalty. The experimental result on the MNIST dataset further supports our theoretical findings. We show that universal encoders can obtain distortion performance comparable to task-specific encoders. These results demonstrate the practicality and effectiveness of the proposed universal framework in multi-task compression scenarios.</description>

      <title>A Hierarchical Decomposition of Kullback-Leibler Divergence: Disentangling Marginal Mismatches from Statistical Dependencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence is a foundational measure for comparing probability distributions. Yet in multivariate settings, its structure is often opaque, conflating marginal mismatches and statistical dependencies. We derive an algebraically exact, additive, and hierarchical decomposition of the KL divergence between a joint distribution \( P_k \) and a product reference \( Q^{\otimes k} \). The total divergence splits into the sum of marginal KLs, \( \sum_{i=1}^k \mathrm{KL}(P_i \| Q) \), and the total correlation \( C(P_k) \), which we further decompose as \( C(P_k) = \sum_{r=2}^k I^{(r)}(P_k) \), using Moebius inversion on the subset lattice. Each \( I^{(r)} \) quantifies the distinct contribution of \( r \)-way statistical interactions to the total divergence. This yields the first decomposition of this form that is both algebraically complete and interpretable using only standard Shannon quantities, with no approximations or model assumptions. Numerical validation using hypergeometric sampling confirms exactness to machine precision across diverse system configurations. This framework enables precise diagnosis of divergence origins, marginal versus interaction, across applications in machine learning, econometrics, and complex systems.</description>

      <title>The trace dual of nonlinear skew cyclic codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Codes which have a finite field $\mathbb{F}_{q^m}$ as their alphabet but which are only linear over a subfield $\mathbb{F}_q$ are a topic of much recent interest due to their utility in constructing quantum error correcting codes. In this article, we find generators for trace dual spaces of different families of $\mathbb{F}_q$-linear codes over $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$. In particular, given the field extension $\mathbb{F}_q\leq \mathbb{F}_{q^2}$ with $q$ an odd prime power, we determine the trace Euclidean and trace Hermitian dual codes for the general $\mathbb{F}_q$-linear cyclic $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$-code. In addition, we also determine the trace Euclidean and trace Hermitian duals for general $\mathbb{F}_q$-linear skew cyclic $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$-codes, which are defined to be left $\mathbb{F}_q[X]$-submodules of $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}[X;\sigma]/(X^n-1)$, where $\sigma$ denotes the Frobenius automorphism and $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}[X;\sigma]$ the induced skew polynomial ring.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a polynomial approach to investigate linear complementary dual (LCD) quasi-cyclic codes over finite fields. We establish necessary and sufficient conditions for LCD quasi-cyclic codes of index 2 with respect to the Euclidean, Hermitian, and symplectic inner products. As a consequence of these characterizations, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for LCD one-generator quasi-cyclic codes.</description>

      <title>White-Box AI Model: Next Frontier of Wireless Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: White-box AI (WAI), or explainable AI (XAI) model, a novel tool to achieve the reasoning behind decisions and predictions made by the AI algorithms, makes it more understandable and transparent. It offers a new approach to address key challenges of interpretability and mathematical validation in traditional black-box models. In this paper, WAI-aided wireless communication systems are proposed and investigated thoroughly to utilize the promising capabilities. First, we introduce the fundamental principles of WAI. Then, a detailed comparison between WAI and traditional black-box model is conducted in terms of optimization objectives and architecture design, with a focus on deep neural networks (DNNs) and transformer networks. Furthermore, in contrast to the traditional black-box methods, WAI leverages theory-driven causal modeling and verifiable optimization paths, thereby demonstrating potential advantages in areas such as signal processing and resource allocation. Finally, we outline future research directions for the integration of WAI in wireless communication systems.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-Based AP Selection in User-Centric Cell-free Multiple-Antenna Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: User-centric cell-free (UCCF) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems are considered a viable solution to realize the advantages offered by cell-free (CF) networks, including reduced interference and consistent quality of service while maintaining manageable complexity. In this paper, we propose novel learning-based access point (AP) selection schemes tailored for UCCF massive MIMO systems. The learning model exploits the dataset generated from two distinct AP selection schemes, based on large-scale fading (LSF) coefficients and the sum-rate coefficients, respectively. The proposed learning-based AP selection schemes could be implemented centralized or distributed, with the aim of performing AP selection efficiently. We evaluate our model's performance against CF and two heuristic clustering schemes for UCCF networks. The results demonstrate that the learning-based approach achieves a comparable sum-rate performance to that of competing techniques for UCCF networks, while significantly reducing computational complexity.</description>

      <title>Conformal Calibration: Ensuring the Reliability of Black-Box AI in Wireless Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI is poised to revolutionize telecommunication networks by boosting efficiency, automation, and decision-making. However, the black-box nature of most AI models introduces substantial risk, possibly deterring adoption by network operators. These risks are not addressed by the current prevailing deployment strategy, which typically follows a best-effort train-and-deploy paradigm. This paper reviews conformal calibration, a general framework that moves beyond the state of the art by adopting computationally lightweight, advanced statistical tools that offer formal reliability guarantees without requiring further training or fine-tuning. Conformal calibration encompasses pre-deployment calibration via uncertainty quantification or hyperparameter selection; online monitoring to detect and mitigate failures in real time; and counterfactual post-deployment performance analysis to address "what if" diagnostic questions after deployment. By weaving conformal calibration into the AI model lifecycle, network operators can establish confidence in black-box AI models as a dependable enabling technology for wireless systems.</description>

      <title>The Rate-Immediacy Barrier in Explicit Tree Code Constructions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the introduction of tree codes by Schulman (STOC 1993), explicit construction of such codes has remained a notorious challenge. While the construction of asymptotically-good explicit tree codes continues to be elusive, a work by Cohen, Haeupler and Schulman (STOC 2018), as well as the state-of-the-art construction by Ben Yaacov, Cohen, and Yankovitz (STOC 2022) have achieved codes with rate $\Omega(1/\log\log n)$, exponentially improving upon the original construction of Evans, Klugerman and Schulman from 1994. All of these constructions rely, at least in part, on increasingly sophisticated methods of combining (block) error-correcting codes.
  In this work, we identify a fundamental barrier to constructing tree codes using current techniques. We introduce a key property, which we call immediacy, that, while not required by the original definition of tree codes, is shared by all known constructions and inherently arises from recursive combinations of error-correcting codes. Our main technical contribution is the proof of a rate-immediacy tradeoff, which, in particular, implies that any tree code with constant distance and non-trivial immediacy must necessarily have vanishing rate. By applying our rate-immediacy tradeoff to existing constructions, we establish that their known rate analyses are essentially optimal. More broadly, our work highlights the need for fundamentally new ideas--beyond the recursive use of error-correcting codes--to achieve substantial progress in explicitly constructing asymptotically-good tree codes.</description>

      <title>Bounds and Optimal Constructions of Generalized Merge-Convertible Codes for Code Conversion into LRCs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Error-correcting codes are essential for ensuring fault tolerance in modern distributed data storage systems. However, in practice, factors such as the failure rates of storage devices can vary significantly over time, resulting in changes to the optimal code parameters. To reduce storage costs while maintaining efficiency, Maturana and Rashmi introduced a theoretical framework known as code conversion, which enables dynamic adjustment of code parameters according to device performance. In this paper, we focus exclusively on the bounds and constructions of generalized merge-convertible codes. First, we establish a new lower bound on the access cost when the final code is an $(r,\delta)$-LRC. This bound unifies and generalizes all previously known bounds for merge conversion where the initial and final codes are either an LRC or an MDS code. We then construct a family of access-optimal MDS convertible codes by leveraging subgroups of the automorphism group of a rational function field. It is worth noting that our construction is also per-symbol read access-optimal. Next, we further extend our MDS-based construction to design access-optimal convertible codes for the conversion between $(r,\delta)$-LRCs. Finally, using the parity-check matrix approach, we present a construction of access-optimal convertible codes that enable merge conversion from MDS codes to an $(r,\delta)$-LRC. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first explicit optimal construction of code conversion between MDS codes and LRCs. All of our constructions are over finite fields whose sizes grow linearly with the code length.</description>

      <title>On Stochastic Performance Analysis of Secure Integrated Sensing and Communication Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper analyzes the stochastic security performance of a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system in a downlink scenario. A base station (BS) transmits a multi-functional signal to simultaneously communicate with a user, sense a target angular location, and counteract eavesdropping threats. The system includes a passive single-antenna communication eavesdropper and a multi-antenna sensing eavesdropper attempting to infer the target location. The BS-user and BS-eavesdroppers channels follow Rayleigh fading, while the target azimuth angle is uniformly distributed. To evaluate the performance, we derive exact expressions for the secrecy ergodic rate and the ergodic Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRB) for target localization at both the BS and the sensing eavesdropper. This involves computing the probability density functions (PDFs) of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and CRB, leveraging the central limit theorem for tractability. Numerical results validate our findings.</description>

      <title>SegOTA: Accelerating Over-the-Air Federated Learning with Segmented Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) with over-the-air computation efficiently utilizes the communication resources, but it can still experience significant latency when each device transmits a large number of model parameters to the server. This paper proposes the Segmented Over-The-Air (SegOTA) method for FL, which reduces latency by partitioning devices into groups and letting each group transmit only one segment of the model parameters in each communication round. Considering a multi-antenna server, we model the SegOTA transmission and reception process to establish an upper bound on the expected model learning optimality gap. We minimize this upper bound, by formulating the per-round online optimization of device grouping and joint transmit-receive beamforming, for which we derive efficient closed-form solutions. Simulation results show that our proposed SegOTA substantially outperforms the conventional full-model OTA approach and other common alternatives.</description>

      <title>Passive Channel Charting: Locating Passive Targets using Wi-Fi Channel State Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose passive channel charting, an extension of channel charting to passive target localization. As in conventional channel charting, we follow a dimensionality reduction approach to reconstruct a physically interpretable map of target positions from similarities in high-dimensional channel state information. We show that algorithms and neural network architectures developed in the context of channel charting with active mobile transmitters can be straightforwardly applied to the passive case, where we assume a scenario with static transmitters and receivers and a mobile target. We evaluate our method on a channel state information dataset collected indoors with a distributed setup of ESPARGOS Wi-Fi sensing antenna arrays. This scenario can be interpreted as either a multi-static or passive radar system. We demonstrate that passive channel charting outperforms a baseline based on classical triangulation in terms of localization accuracy. We discuss our results and highlight some unsolved issues related to the proposed concept.</description>

      <title>A Theory of Universal Rate-Distortion-Classification Representations for Lossy Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In lossy compression, Blau and Michaeli [5] introduced the information rate-distortion-perception (RDP) function, extending traditional rate-distortion theory by incorporating perceptual quality. More recently, this framework was expanded by defining the rate-distortion-perception-classification (RDPC) function, integrating multi-task learning that jointly optimizes generative tasks such as perceptual quality and classification accuracy alongside reconstruction tasks [28]. To that end, motivated by the concept of a universal RDP encoder introduced in [34], we investigate universal representations that enable diverse distortion-classification tradeoffs through a single fixed encoder combined with multiple decoders. Specifically, theoretical analysis and numerical experiment demonstrate that for the Gaussian source under mean squared error (MSE) distortion, the entire distortion-classification tradeoff region can be achieved using one universal encoder. In addition, this paper characterizes achievable distortion-classification regions for fixed universal representations in general source distributions, identifying conditions that ensure minimal distortion penalty when reusing encoders across varying tradeoff points. Experimental results using MNIST and SVHN datasets validate our theoretical insights, showing that universal encoders can obtain distortion performance comparable to task-specific encoders, thus supporting the practicality and effectiveness of our proposed universal representations.</description>

Abstract: DNA synthesis is considered as one of the most expensive components in current DNA storage systems. In this paper, focusing on a common synthesis machine, which generates multiple DNA strands in parallel following a fixed supersequence,we propose constrained codes with polynomial-time encoding and decoding algorithms. Compared to the existing works, our codes simultaneously satisfy both l-runlength limited and {\epsilon}-balanced constraints. By enumerating all valid sequences, our codes achieve the maximum rate, matching the capacity. Additionally, we design constrained error-correcting codes capable of correcting one insertion or deletion in the obtained DNA sequence while still adhering to the constraints.</description>

      <title>Secrecy and Privacy in Multi-Access Combinatorial Topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we consider the multi-access combinatorial topology with $C$ caches where each user accesses a unique set of $r$ caches. For this setup, we consider secrecy, where each user should not know anything about the files it did not request, and demand privacy, where each user's demand must be kept private from other non-colluding users. We propose a scheme satisfying both conditions and derive a lower bound based on cut-set arguments. Also, we prove that our scheme is optimal when $r\geq C-1$, and it is order-optimal when the cache memory size $M$ is greater than or equal to a certain threshold for $r&lt;C-1$. When $r=1$, in most of the memory region, our scheme achieves the same rate as the one given by the secretive scheme for the dedicated cache setup by Ravindrakumar et al. ( 'Private Coded Caching,' in \textit{IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security}, 2018), while satisfying both secrecy and demand privacy conditions.</description>

      <title>Code size constraints in b-symbol read channels: A bound analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In classical coding theory, error-correcting codes are designed to protect against errors occurring at individual symbol positions in a codeword. However, in practical storage and communication systems, errors often affect multiple adjacent symbols rather than single symbols independently. To address this, symbol-pair read channels were introduced \cite{Yuval2011}, and later generalized to $b$-symbol read channels \cite{yaakobi2016} to better model such error patterns. $b$-Symbol read channels generalize symbol-pair read channels to account for clustered errors in modern storage and communication systems. By developing bounds and efficient codes, researchers improve data reliability in applications such as storage devices, wireless networks, and DNA-based storage. Given integers $q$, $n$, $d$, and $b \geq 2$, let $A_b(n,d,q)$ denote the largest possible code size for which there exists a $q$-ary code of length $n$ with minimum $b$-symbol distance at least $d$. In \cite{chen2022}, various upper and lower bounds on $A_b(n,d,q)$ are given for $b=2$. In this paper, we generalize some of these bounds to the $b$-symbol read channels for $b&gt;2$ and present several new bounds on $A_b(n,d,q)$. In particular, we establish the linear programming bound, a recurrence relation on $A_b(n,d,q)$, the Johnson bound (even), the restricted Johnson bound, the Gilbert-Varshamov-type bound, and the Elias bound for the metric of symbols $b$, $b\geq 2$. Furthermore, we provide examples demonstrating that the Gilbert-Varshamov bound we establish offers a stronger lower bound than the one presented in \cite{Song2018}. Additionally, we introduce an alternative approach to deriving the Sphere-packing and Plotkin bounds.</description>

      <title>Multi-Target Position Error Bound and Power Allocation Scheme for Cell-Free mMIMO-OTFS ISAC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates multi-target position estimation in cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF mMIMO) architectures, where orthogonal time frequency and space (OTFS) is used as an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) signal. Closed-form expressions for the Cram\'{e}r-Rao lower bound and the positioning error bound (PEB) in multi-target position estimation are derived, providing quantitative evaluations of sensing performance. To enhance the overall performance of the ISAC system, a power allocation algorithm is developed to maximize the minimum user communication signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio while ensuring a specified sensing PEB requirement. The results validate the proposed PEB expression and its approximation, clearly illustrating the coordination gain enabled by ISAC. Further, the superiority of using the multi-static CF mMIMO architecture over traditional cellular ISAC is demonstrated, and the advantages of OTFS signals in high-mobility scenarios are highlighted.</description>

      <title>The topology of synergy: linking topological and information-theoretic approaches to higher-order interactions in complex systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of irreducible higher-order interactions has become a core topic of study in complex systems. Two of the most well-developed frameworks, topological data analysis and multivariate information theory, aim to provide formal tools for identifying higher-order interactions in empirical data. Despite similar aims, however, these two approaches are built on markedly different mathematical foundations and have been developed largely in parallel. In this study, we present a head-to-head comparison of topological data analysis and information-theoretic approaches to describing higher-order interactions in multivariate data; with the aim of assessing the similarities and differences between how the frameworks define ``higher-order structures." We begin with toy examples with known topologies, before turning to naturalistic data: fMRI signals collected from the human brain. We find that intrinsic, higher-order synergistic information is associated with three-dimensional cavities in a point cloud: shapes such as spheres are synergy-dominated. In fMRI data, we find strong correlations between synergistic information and both the number and size of three-dimensional cavities. Furthermore, we find that dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA preferentially represent higher-order redundancies, and largely fail to preserve both higher-order information and topological structure, suggesting that common manifold-based approaches to studying high-dimensional data are systematically failing to identify important features of the data. These results point towards the possibility of developing a rich theory of higher-order interactions that spans topological and information-theoretic approaches while simultaneously highlighting the profound limitations of more conventional methods.</description>

      <title>Simple physical systems as a reference for multivariate information dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding a complex system entails capturing the non-trivial collective phenomena that arise from interactions between its different parts. Information theory is a flexible and robust framework to study such behaviours, with several measures designed to quantify and characterise the interdependencies among the system's components. However, since these estimators rely on the statistical distributions of observed quantities, it is crucial to examine the relationships between information-theoretic measures and the system's underlying mechanistic structure. To this end, here we present an information-theoretic analytical investigation of an elementary system of interactive random walkers subject to Gaussian noise. Focusing on partial information decomposition, causal emergence, and integrated information, our results help us develop some intuitions on their relationship with the physical parameters of the system. For instance, we observe that uncoupled systems can exhibit emergent properties, in a way that we suggest may be better described as ''statistically autonomous''. Overall, we observe that in this simple scenario information measures align more reliably with the system's mechanistic properties when calculated at the level of microscopic components, rather than their coarse-grained counterparts, and over timescales comparable with the system's intrinsic dynamics. Moreover, we show that approaches that separate the contributions of the system's dynamics and steady-state distribution (e.g. via causal perturbations) may help strengthen the interpretation of information-theoretic analyses.</description>

      <title>Unique Decoding of Reed-Solomon and Related Codes for Semi-Adversarial Errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For over a quarter century, the Guruswami-Sudan algorithm has served as the state-of-the-art for list-decoding Reed-Solomon (RS) codes up to the Johnson bound against adversarial errors. However, some recent structural results on the combinatorial list decoding of randomly punctured Reed-Solomon codes suggest that Johnson bound can likely be broken for some subclasses of RS codes. Motivated by these results, we seek to make traction on understanding adversarial decoding by considering a new model: semi-adversarial errors. This error model bridges between fully random errors and fully adversarial errors by allowing some symbols of a message to be corrupted by an adversary while others are replaced with uniformly random symbols.
  As our main quest, we seek to understand optimal efficient unique decoding algorithms in the semi-adversarial model. In particular, we revisit some classical results on decoding interleaved Reed-Solomon codes (aka subfield evaluation RS codes) in the random error model by Bleichenbacher-Kiayias-Yung (BKY) and work to improve and extend their analysis. First, we give an improved implementation and analysis of the BKY algorithm for interleaved Reed-Solomon codes in the semi-adversarial model. In particular, our algorithm runs in near-linear time, and for most mixtures of random and adversarial errors, our analysis matches the information-theoretic optimum.
  Moreover, inspired by the BKY algorithm, we use a novel interpolation to extend our approach to the settings of folded Reed-Solomon codes, resulting in fast algorithms for unique decoding against semi-adversarial errors. A particular advantage of our near-linear time algorithm over state-of-the-art decoding algorithms for adversarial errors is that its running time depends only on a polynomial function of the folding parameter rather than on an exponential function.</description>

      <title>Minimizing Functions of Age of Incorrect Information for Remote Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The age of incorrect information (AoII) process which keeps track of the time since the source and monitor processes are in sync, has been extensively used in remote estimation problems. In this paper, we consider a push-based remote estimation system with a discrete-time Markov chain (DTMC) information source transmitting status update packets towards the monitor once the AoII process exceeds a certain estimation-based threshold. In this paper, the time average of an arbitrary function of AoII is taken as the AoII cost, as opposed to using the average AoII as the mismatch metric, whereas this function is also allowed to depend on the estimation value. In this very general setting, our goal is to minimize a weighted sum of AoII and transmission costs. For this purpose, we formulate a discrete-time semi-Markov decision process (SMDP) regarding the multi-threshold status update policy. We propose a novel tool in discrete-time called 'dual-regime absorbing Markov chain' (DR-AMC) and its corresponding absorption time distribution named as 'dual-regime phase-type' (DR-PH) distribution, to obtain the characterizing parameters of the SMDP, which allows us to obtain the distribution of the AoII process for a given policy, and hence the average of any function of AoII. The proposed method is validated with numerical results by which we compare our proposed method against other policies obtained by exhaustive-search, and also various benchmark policies.</description>

      <title>Understanding LLM Behaviors via Compression: Data Generation, Knowledge Acquisition and Scaling Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across numerous tasks, yet principled explanations for their underlying mechanisms and several phenomena, such as scaling laws, hallucinations, and related behaviors, remain elusive. In this work, we revisit the classical relationship between compression and prediction, grounded in Kolmogorov complexity and Shannon information theory, to provide deeper insights into LLM behaviors. By leveraging the Kolmogorov Structure Function and interpreting LLM compression as a two-part coding process, we offer a detailed view of how LLMs acquire and store information across increasing model and data scales -- from pervasive syntactic patterns to progressively rarer knowledge elements. Motivated by this theoretical perspective and natural assumptions inspired by Heap's and Zipf's laws, we introduce a simplified yet representative hierarchical data-generation framework called the Syntax-Knowledge model. Under the Bayesian setting, we show that prediction and compression within this model naturally lead to diverse learning and scaling behaviors of LLMs. In particular, our theoretical analysis offers intuitive and principled explanations for both data and model scaling laws, the dynamics of knowledge acquisition during training and fine-tuning, factual knowledge hallucinations in LLMs. The experimental results validate our theoretical predictions.</description>

      <title>InfoMAE: Pair-Efficient Cross-Modal Alignment for Multimodal Time-Series Sensing Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Standard multimodal self-supervised learning (SSL) algorithms regard cross-modal synchronization as implicit supervisory labels during pretraining, thus posing high requirements on the scale and quality of multimodal samples. These constraints significantly limit the performance of sensing intelligence in IoT applications, as the heterogeneity and the non-interpretability of time-series signals result in abundant unimodal data but scarce high-quality multimodal pairs. This paper proposes InfoMAE, a cross-modal alignment framework that tackles the challenge of multimodal pair efficiency under the SSL setting by facilitating efficient cross-modal alignment of pretrained unimodal representations. InfoMAE achieves \textit{efficient cross-modal alignment} with \textit{limited data pairs} through a novel information theory-inspired formulation that simultaneously addresses distribution-level and instance-level alignment. Extensive experiments on two real-world IoT applications are performed to evaluate InfoMAE's pairing efficiency to bridge pretrained unimodal models into a cohesive joint multimodal model. InfoMAE enhances downstream multimodal tasks by over 60% with significantly improved multimodal pairing efficiency. It also improves unimodal task accuracy by an average of 22%.</description>

      <title>Finite-Precision Conjugate Gradient Method for Massive MIMO Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The implementation of the conjugate gradient (CG) method for massive MIMO detection is computationally challenging, especially for a large number of users and correlated channels. In this paper, we propose a low computational complexity CG detection from a finite-precision perspective. First, we develop a finite-precision CG (FP-CG) detection to mitigate the computational bottleneck of each CG iteration and provide the attainable accuracy, convergence, and computational complexity analysis to reveal the impact of finite-precision arithmetic. A practical heuristic is presented to select suitable precisions. Then, to further reduce the number of iterations, we propose a joint finite-precision and block-Jacobi preconditioned CG (FP-BJ-CG) detection. The corresponding performance analysis is also provided. Finally, simulation results validate the theoretical insights and demonstrate the superiority of the proposed detection.</description>

      <title>On the $N$th $2$-adic complexity of binary sequences identified with algebraic $2$-adic integers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We identify a binary sequence $\mathcal{S}=(s_n)_{n=0}^\infty$ with the $2$-adic integer $G_\mathcal{S}(2)=\sum\limits_{n=0}^\infty s_n2^n$. In the case that $G_\mathcal{S}(2)$ is algebraic over $\mathbb{Q}$ of degree $d\ge 2$, we prove that the $N$th $2$-adic complexity of $\mathcal{S}$ is at least $\frac{N}{d}+O(1)$, where the implied constant depends only on the minimal polynomial of $G_\mathcal{S}(2)$. This result is an analog of the bound of M\'erai and the second author on the linear complexity of automatic sequences, that is, sequences with algebraic $G_\mathcal{S}(X)$ over the rational function field $\mathbb{F}_2(X)$. We further discuss the most important case $d=2$ in both settings and explain that the intersection of the set of $2$-adic algebraic sequences and the set of automatic sequences is the set of (eventually) periodic sequences. Finally, we provide some experimental results supporting the conjecture that $2$-adic algebraic sequences can have also a desirable $N$th linear complexity and automatic sequences a desirable $N$th $2$-adic complexity, respectively.</description>

      <title>Frequency Hopping Waveform Design for Secure Integrated Sensing and Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a comprehensive approach to enhance the security, privacy, and sensing capabilities of integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) systems by leveraging random frequency agility (RFA) and random pulse repetition interval (PRI) agility (RPA) techniques. The combination of these techniques, which we refer to collectively as random frequency and PRI agility (RFPA), with channel reciprocity-based key generation (CRKG) obfuscates both Doppler frequency and PRIs, significantly hindering the chances that passive adversaries can successfully estimate radar parameters. In addition, a hybrid information embedding method integrating amplitude shift keying (ASK), phase shift keying (PSK), index modulation (IM), and spatial modulation (SM) is incorporated to increase the achievable bit rate of the system significantly. Next, a sparse-matched filter receiver design is proposed to efficiently decode the embedded information with a low bit error rate (BER). Finally, a novel RFPA-based secret generation scheme using CRKG ensures secure code creation without a coordinating authority. The improved range and velocity estimation and reduced clutter effects achieved with the method are demonstrated via the evaluation of the ambiguity function (AF) of the proposed waveforms.</description>

      <title>Capacities of highly Markovian divisible quantum channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze information transmission capacities of quantum channels acting on $d$-dimensional quantum systems that are highly Markovian divisible, i.e., channels of the form \begin{equation*}
  \Phi = \underbrace{\Psi\circ \Psi \circ \ldots \circ \Psi}_{l \,\operatorname{times}} \end{equation*} with $l \geq \gamma d^2 \log d$ for some constant $\gamma=\gamma(\Psi)$ that depends on the spectral gap of the dividing channel $\Psi$. We prove that capacities of such channels are approximately strongly additive and can be efficiently approximated in terms of the structure of their peripheral spaces. Furthermore, the quantum and private classical capacities of such channels approximately coincide and approximately satisfy the strong converse property. We show that these approximate results become exact for the corresponding zero-error capacities when $l \geq d^2$. To prove these results, we show that for any channel $\Psi$, the classical, private classical, and quantum capacities of $\Psi_\infty$, which is its so-called asymptotic part, satisfy the strong converse property and are strongly additive. In the zero-error case, we introduce the notion of the stabilized non-commutative confusability graph of a quantum channel and characterize its structure for any given channel.</description>

      <title>Design of Pulse Shapes Based on Sampling with Gaussian Prefilter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/0907.2412</link>
      <description>arXiv:0907.2412v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two new pulse shapes for communications are presented. The first pulse shape generates a set of pulses without intersymbol interference (ISI) or ISI-free for short. In the neighbourhood of the origin it is similar in shape to the classical cardinal sine function but is of exponential decay at infinity. This pulse shape is identical to the interpolating function of a recent sampling theorem with Gaussian prefilter. The second pulse shape is obtained from the first pulse shape by spectral factorization. Besides being also of exponential decay at infinity, it has a causal appearance since it is of superexponential decay for negative times. It is closely related to the orthonormal generating function considered earlier by Unser in the context of shift-invariant spaces. This pulse shape is not ISI-free but it generates a set of orthonormal pulses. The second pulse shape may also be used to define a receive matched filter so that at the filter output the ISI-free pulses of the first kind are recovered.</description>

      <title>Delay Violation Probability and Effective Rate of Downlink NOMA over $\alpha$-$\mu$ Fading Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.16505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2006.16505v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is a potential candidate to further enhance the spectrum utilization efficiency in beyond fifth-generation (B5G) standards. However, there has been little attention on the quantification of the delay-limited performance of downlink NOMA systems. In this paper, we analyze the performance of a two-user downlink NOMA system over generalized {\alpha}-{\mu} fading in terms of delay violation probability (DVP) and effective rate (ER). In particular, we derive an analytical expression for an upper bound on the DVP and we derive the exact sum ER of the downlink NOMA system. We also derive analytical expressions for high and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) approximations to the sum ER, as well as a fundamental upper bound on the sum ER which represents the ergodic sum-rate for the downlink NOMA system. We also analyze the sum ER of a corresponding time-division-multiplexed orthogonal multiple access (OMA) system. Our results show that while NOMA consistently outperforms OMA over the practical SNR range, the relative gain becomes smaller in more severe fading conditions, and is also smaller in the presence a more strict delay quality-of-service (QoS) constraint.</description>

      <title>On the performance of downlink NOMA in underlay spectrum sharing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.08159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2011.08159v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and spectrum sharing are two potential technologies for providing massive connectivity in beyond fifth-generation (B5G) networks. In this paper, we present the performance analysis of a multi-antenna-assisted two-user downlink NOMA system in an underlay spectrum sharing system. We derive closed-form expressions for the average achievable sum-rate and outage probability of the secondary network under a peak interference constraint and/or peak power constraint, depending on the availability of channel state information (CSI) of the interference link between secondary transmitter (ST) and primary receiver (PR). For the case where the ST has a fixed power budget, we show that performance can be divided into two specific regimes, where either the interference constraint or the power constraint primarily dictates the performance. Our results confirm that the NOMA-based underlay spectrum sharing system significantly outperforms its orthogonal multiple access (OMA) based counterpart, by achieving higher average sum-rate and lower outage probability. We also show the effect of information loss at the ST in terms of CSI of the link between the ST and PR on the system performance. Moreover, we also present closed-form expressions for the optimal power allocation coefficient that minimizes the outage probability of the NOMA system for the special case where the secondary users are each equipped with a single antenna. A close agreement between the simulation and analytical results confirms the correctness of the presented analysis.</description>

      <title>NOMA-Based Cooperative Relaying with Receive Diversity in Nakagami-m Fading Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.11692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2011.11692v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is being widely considered as a potential candidate to enhance the spectrum utilization in beyond fifth-generation (B5G) communications. In this paper, we derive closed-form expressions for the ergodic rate and outage probability of a multiple-antenna-assisted NOMA-based cooperative relaying system (CRS-NOMA). We present the performance analysis of the system for two different receive diversity schemes - selection combining (SC) and maximal-ratio combining (MRC), in Nakagami-m fading. We also evaluate the asymptotic behavior of the CRS-NOMA to determine the slope of the ergodic rate and diversity order. Our results show that in contrast to the existing CRS-NOMA systems, the CRS-NOMA with receive diversity outperforms its orthogonal multiple access (OMA) based counterpart even in the low-SNR regime, by achieving higher ergodic rate. Diversity analysis confirms that the CRS-NOMA achieves full diversity order using both SC and MRC schemes, and this diversity order depends on both the shape parameter m and the number of receive antennas. We also discuss the problem of optimal power allocation for the minimization of the outage probability of the system, and subsequently use this optimal value to obtain the ergodic rate. An excellent match is observed between the numerical and the analytical results, confirming the correctness of the derived analytical expressions.</description>

      <title>Toward 6G Native-AI Network: Foundation Model based Cloud-Edge-End Collaboration Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17471v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Future wireless communication networks are in a position to move beyond data-centric, device-oriented connectivity and offer intelligent, immersive experiences based on multi-agent collaboration, especially in the context of the thriving development of pre-trained foundation models (PFM) and the evolving vision of 6G native artificial intelligence (AI). Therefore, redefining modes of collaboration between devices and agents, and constructing native intelligence libraries become critically important in 6G. In this paper, we analyze the challenges of achieving 6G native AI from the perspectives of data, AI models, and operational paradigm. Then, we propose a 6G native AI framework based on foundation models, provide an integration method for the expert knowledge, present the customization for two kinds of PFM, and outline a novel operational paradigm for the native AI framework. As a practical use case, we apply this framework for orchestration, achieving the maximum sum rate within a cell-free massive MIMO system, and presenting preliminary evaluation results. Finally, we outline research directions for achieving native AI in 6G.</description>

Abstract: For the purposes of abstract theory of signal propagation, a signal is a submanifold of a Riemannian manifold. We obtain energy inequalities, or upper bounds, lower bounds on energy in a number of specific cases, including parameter spaces of Gaussians and spaces of configurations of points. We discuss the role of time as well as graph embeddings.</description>

      <title>Explicit Folded Reed-Solomon and Multiplicity Codes Achieve Relaxed Generalized Singleton Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15925v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove that explicit FRS codes and multiplicity codes achieve relaxed generalized Singleton bounds for list size $L\ge1.$ Specifically, we show the following: (1) FRS code of length $n$ and rate $R$ over the alphabet $\mathbb{F}_q^s$ with distinct evaluation points is $\left(\frac{L}{L+1}\left(1-\frac{sR}{s-L+1}\right),L\right)$ list-decodable (LD) for list size $L\in[s]$. (2) Multiplicity code of length $n$ and rate $R$ over the alphabet $\mathbb{F}_p^s$ with distinct evaluation points is $\left(\frac{L}{L+1}\left(1-\frac{sR}{s-L+1}\right),L\right)$ LD for list size $L\in[s]$.
  Choosing $s=\Theta(1/\epsilon^2)$ and $L=O(1/\epsilon)$, our results imply that both FRS codes and multiplicity codes achieve LD capacity $1-R-\epsilon$ with optimal list size $O(1/\epsilon)$. This exponentially improves the previous state of the art $(1/\epsilon)^{O(1/\epsilon)}$ established by Kopparty et. al. (FOCS 2018) and Tamo (IEEE TIT, 2024). In particular, our results on FRS codes fully resolve a open problem proposed by Guruswami and Rudra (STOC 2006). Furthermore, our results imply the first explicit constructions of $(1-R-\epsilon,O(1/\epsilon))$ LD codes of rate $R$ with poly-sized alphabets.
  Our method can also be extended to analyze the list-recoverability (LR) of FRS codes. We provide a tighter radius upper bound that FRS codes cannot be $(\frac{L+1-\ell}{L+1}(1-\frac{mR}{m-1})+o(1),\ell, L)$ LR where $m=\lceil\log_{\ell}{(L+1)}\rceil$. We conjecture this bound is almost tight when $L+1=\ell^a$ for any $a\in\mathbb{N}^{\ge 2}$. To give some evidences, we show FRS codes are $\left(\frac{1}{2}-\frac{sR}{s-2},2,3\right)$ LR, which proves the tightness in the smallest non-trivial case. Our bound refutes the possibility that FRS codes could achieve LR capacity $(1-R-\epsilon, \ell, O(\frac{\ell}{\epsilon}))$. This implies an intrinsic separation between LD and LR of FRS codes.</description>

      <title>Separate Source Channel Coding Is Still What You Need: An LLM-based Rethinking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04285v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Along with the proliferating research interest in Semantic Communication (SemCom), Joint Source Channel Coding (JSCC) has dominated the attention due to the widely assumed existence in efficiently delivering information semantics. %has emerged as a pivotal area of research, aiming to enhance the efficiency and reliability of information transmission through deep learning-based methods. Nevertheless, this paper challenges the conventional JSCC paradigm, and advocates for adoption of Separate Source Channel Coding (SSCC) to enjoy the underlying more degree of freedom for optimization. We demonstrate that SSCC, after leveraging the strengths of Large Language Model (LLM) for source coding and Error Correction Code Transformer (ECCT) complemented for channel decoding, offers superior performance over JSCC. Our proposed framework also effectively highlights the compatibility challenges between SemCom approaches and digital communication systems, particularly concerning the resource costs associated with the transmission of high precision floating point numbers. Through comprehensive evaluations, we establish that empowered by LLM-based compression and ECCT-enhanced error correction, SSCC remains a viable and effective solution for modern communication systems. In other words, separate source and channel coding is still what we need!</description>

      <title>Integrated Sensing and Communications for Pinching-Antenna Systems (PASS)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07709v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) design for pinching antenna systems (PASS) is proposed, where the pinching antennas are deployed for establishing reliable line-of-sight communication and sensing links. More particularly, a separated ISAC design is proposed for the two-waveguide PASS, where one waveguide is used to emit the joint communication and sensing signals while the other waveguide is used to receive the reflected echo signals. Based on this framework, a penalty-based alternating optimization algorithm is proposed to maximize the illumination power as well as ensure the communication quality-of-service requirement. Numerical results demonstrate that 1) the proposed PASS-ISAC scheme outperforms the other baseline schemes, and 2) the considered equal power allocation model achieves an upper bound performance.</description>

      <title>Comments on the holographic description of Narain theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.15830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2012.15830v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the holographic description of Narain $U(1)^c\times U(1)^c$ conformal field theories, and their potential similarity to conventional weakly coupled gravity in the bulk, in the sense that the effective IR bulk description includes "$U(1)$ gravity" amended with additional light degrees of freedom. Starting from this picture, we formulate the hypothesis that in the large central charge limit the density of states of any Narain theory is bounded by below by the density of states of $U(1)$ gravity. This immediately implies that the maximal value of the spectral gap for primary fields is $\Delta_1=c/(2\pi e)$. To test the self-consistency of this proposal, we study its implications using chiral lattice CFTs and CFTs based on quantum stabilizer codes. First we notice that the conjecture yields a new bound on quantum stabilizer codes, which is compatible with previously known bounds in the literature. We proceed to discuss the variance of the density of states, which for consistency must be vanishingly small in the large-$c$ limit. We consider ensembles of code and chiral theories and show that in both cases the density variance is exponentially small in the central charge.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01383v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A classic problem in data analysis is studying the systems of subsets defined by either a similarity or a dissimilarity function on $X$ which is either observed directly or derived from a data set. For an electrical network there are two functions on the set of the nodes defined by the resistance matrix and the response matrix either of which defines the network completely. We argue that these functions should be viewed as a similarity and a dissimilarity function on the set of the nodes moreover they are related via the covariance mapping also known as the Farris transform or the Gromov product. We will explore the properties of electrical networks from this point of view. It has been known for a while that the resistance matrix defines a metric on the nodes of the electrical networks. Moreover for a circular electrical network this metric obeys the Kalmanson property as it was shown recently. We will call such a metric an electrical Kalmanson metric. The main results of this paper is a complete description of the electrical Kalmanson metrics in the set of all Kalmanson metrics in terms of the geometry of the positive Isotropic Grassmannian whose connection to the theory of electrical networks was discovered earlier. One important area of applications where Kalmanson metrics are actively used is the theory of phylogenetic networks which are a generalization of phylogenetic trees. Our results allow us to use in phylogenetics the powerful methods of reconstruction of the minimal graphs of electrical networks and possibly open the door into data analysis for the methods of the theory of cluster algebras.</description>

      <title>Zero-Shot Statistical Tests for LLM-Generated Text Detection using Finite Sample Concentration Inequalities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02406v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Verifying the provenance of content is crucial to the function of many organizations, e.g., educational institutions, social media platforms, firms, etc. This problem is becoming increasingly challenging as text generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) becomes almost indistinguishable from human-generated content. In addition, many institutions utilize in-house LLMs and want to ensure that external, non-sanctioned LLMs do not produce content within the institution. We answer the following question: Given a piece of text, can we identify whether it was produced by LLM $A$ or $B$ (where $B$ can be a human)? We model LLM-generated text as a sequential stochastic process with complete dependence on history and design zero-shot statistical tests to distinguish between (i) the text generated by two different sets of LLMs $A$ (in-house) and $B$ (non-sanctioned) and also (ii) LLM-generated and human-generated texts. We prove that our tests' type I and type II errors decrease exponentially as text length increases. For designing our tests for a given string, we demonstrate that if the string is generated by the evaluator model $A$, the log-perplexity of the string under $A$ converges to the average entropy of the string under $A$, except with an exponentially small probability in the string length. We also show that if $B$ generates the text, except with an exponentially small probability in string length, the log-perplexity of the string under $A$ converges to the average cross-entropy of $B$ and $A$. For our experiments: First, we present experiments using open-source LLMs to support our theoretical results, and then we provide experiments in a black-box setting with adversarial attacks. Practically, our work enables guaranteed finding of the origin of harmful or false LLM-generated text, which can be useful for combating misinformation and compliance with emerging AI regulations.</description>

      <title>Space-bounded online Kolmogorov complexity is additive</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02777v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The even online Kolmogorov complexity of a string $x = x_1 x_2 \cdots x_{n}$ is the minimal length of a program that for all $i\le n/2$, on input $x_1x_3 \cdots x_{2i-1}$ outputs $x_{2i}$. The odd complexity is defined similarly. The sum of the odd and even complexities is called the dialogue complexity.
  In [Bauwens, 2014] it is proven that for all $n$, there exist $n$-bit $x$ for which the dialogue complexity exceeds the Kolmogorov complexity by $n\log \frac 4 3 + O(\log n)$. Let $\mathrm C^s(x)$ denote the Kolmogorov complexity with space bound~$s$. Here, we prove that the space-bounded dialogue complexity with bound $s + 6n + O(1)$ is at most $\mathrm C^{s}(x) + O(\log (sn))$, where $n=|x|$.</description>
