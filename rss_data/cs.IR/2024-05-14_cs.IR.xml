      <title>How to Surprisingly Consider Recommendations? A Knowledge-Graph-based Approach Relying on Complex Network Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional recommendation proposals, including content-based and collaborative filtering, usually focus on similarity between items or users. Existing approaches lack ways of introducing unexpectedness into recommendations, prioritizing globally popular items over exposing users to unforeseen items. This investigation aims to design and evaluate a novel layer on top of recommender systems suited to incorporate relational information and suggest items with a user-defined degree of surprise. We propose a Knowledge Graph (KG) based recommender system by encoding user interactions on item catalogs. Our study explores whether network-level metrics on KGs can influence the degree of surprise in recommendations. We hypothesize that surprisingness correlates with certain network metrics, treating user profiles as subgraphs within a larger catalog KG. The achieved solution reranks recommendations based on their impact on structural graph metrics. Our research contributes to optimizing recommendations to reflect the metrics. We experimentally evaluate our approach on two datasets of LastFM listening histories and synthetic Netflix viewing profiles. We find that reranking items based on complex network metrics leads to a more unexpected and surprising composition of recommendation lists.</description>

      <title>Treatment Effect Estimation for User Interest Exploration on Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recommender systems learn personalized user preferences from user feedback like clicks. However, user feedback is usually biased towards partially observed interests, leaving many users' hidden interests unexplored. Existing approaches typically mitigate the bias, increase recommendation diversity, or use bandit algorithms to balance exploration-exploitation trade-offs. Nevertheless, they fail to consider the potential rewards of recommending different categories of items and lack the global scheduling of allocating top-N recommendations to categories, leading to suboptimal exploration. In this work, we propose an Uplift model-based Recommender (UpliftRec) framework, which regards top-N recommendation as a treatment optimization problem. UpliftRec estimates the treatment effects, i.e., the click-through rate (CTR) under different category exposure ratios, by using observational user feedback. UpliftRec calculates group-level treatment effects to discover users' hidden interests with high CTR rewards and leverages inverse propensity weighting to alleviate confounder bias. Thereafter, UpliftRec adopts a dynamic programming method to calculate the optimal treatment for overall CTR maximization. We implement UpliftRec on different backend models and conduct extensive experiments on three datasets. The empirical results validate the effectiveness of UpliftRec in discovering users' hidden interests while achieving superior recommendation accuracy.</description>

      <title>From Text to Context: An Entailment Approach for News Stakeholder Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Navigating the complex landscape of news articles involves understanding the various actors or entities involved, referred to as news stakeholders. These stakeholders, ranging from policymakers to opposition figures, citizens, and more, play pivotal roles in shaping news narratives. Recognizing their stakeholder types, reflecting their roles, political alignments, social standing, and more, is paramount for a nuanced comprehension of news content. Despite existing works focusing on salient entity extraction, coverage variations, and political affiliations through social media data, the automated detection of stakeholder roles within news content remains an underexplored domain. In this paper, we bridge this gap by introducing an effective approach to classify stakeholder types in news articles. Our method involves transforming the stakeholder classification problem into a natural language inference task, utilizing contextual information from news articles and external knowledge to enhance the accuracy of stakeholder type detection. Moreover, our proposed model showcases efficacy in zero-shot settings, further extending its applicability to diverse news contexts.</description>

      <title>One Backpropagation in Two Tower Recommendation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18227v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent years have witnessed extensive researches on developing two tower recommendation models for relieving information overload. Four building modules can be identified in such models, namely, user-item encoding, negative sampling, loss computing and back-propagation updating. To the best of our knowledge, existing algorithms have researched only on the first three modules, yet neglecting the backpropagation module. They all adopt a kind of two backpropagation strategy, which are based on an implicit assumption of equally treating users and items in the training phase. In this paper, we challenge such an equal training assumption and propose a novel one backpropagation updating strategy, which keeps the normal gradient backpropagation for the item encoding tower, but cuts off the backpropagation for the user encoding tower. Instead, we propose a moving-aggregation updating strategy to update a user encoding in each training epoch. Except the proposed backpropagation updating module, we implement the other three modules with the most straightforward choices. Experiments on four public datasets validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our model in terms of improved recommendation performance and reduced computation overload over the state-of-the-art competitors.</description>
