      <title>Rapid stellar and binary population synthesis with COMPAS: methods paper II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The COMPAS public rapid binary population synthesis code has undergone a number of key improvements since the original COMPAS methods paper (Team COMPAS: Riley et al., 2022) was published. These include more sophisticated and robust treatments of binary interactions: mass transfer physics, common-envelope events, tides and gravitational-wave radiation reaction; and updated prescriptions for stellar evolution, winds and supernovae. The code structure and outputs have also been updated, with a focus on improving resolution without sacrificing computational speed. This paper describes the substantive changes in the code between the previous methods paper and COMPAS v03.20.02.</description>

      <title>Impact of convective overshooting on the single-degenerate model of Type Ia supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The single-degenerate (SD) model is one of the principal models for the progenitors of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). However, it faces some challenges, the primary being its inability to account for the observed SN Ia birth rate. Many studies have attempted to address this issue by expanding the parameter space, defined by the initial donor star mass and orbital period, that can lead to SNe Ia, as well as by improving binary population synthesis. While these efforts have led to significant progress, many uncertainties in stellar physics persist, which influences the outcomes of such studies. Convective overshooting, which can significantly affect the internal structure of a star and subsequently its evolution within a binary system, is one of the most significant sources of uncertainty in stellar physics. We investigate the effect of convective overshooting on the parameter space and birth rate of SNe Ia within the SD model. We employed the common-envelope wind (CEW) model, a new version of the SD model, as our progenitor model. Using MESA, we obtained the parameter space that leads to SNe Ia for three different convective overshooting parameters and calculated the corresponding SN Ia birth rate. Convective overshooting expands the upper boundaries (corresponding to a larger initial donor mass) and right boundaries (corresponding to a longer initial orbital period) of the parameter space for systems with massive white dwarfs (WDs; &gt;= 0.75Msun). However, the minimum WD mass and the parameter space for low-mass WDs - and, consequently, the calculated SN Ia birth rate - vary non-monotonically with convective overshooting parameters. The CEW model may explain the SNe Ia that interact with the circumstellar medium (CSM), i.e., SNe Ia-CSM. We find that the parameter space for SNe Ia-CSM increases with convective overshooting parameters, as does their birth rate.</description>

      <title>Time path of turbulence and multi-fractality of magnetic field in the evolution of an active region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetograms acquired with the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) were used to calculate and analyze time variations of turbulence and multifractality in the photosphere during the development and flaring of a mature active region NOAA 13354 during its passage across the solar disk. Turbulence was explored with 2D magnetic power spectra from magnetograms, and multifractality was analyzed using the structure functions of magnetograms.
  Time variations of the magnetic power spectrum exponent $\alpha$ and of the multifractalty exponent $\kappa$ demonstrate no pre-flare or post-flare abrupt peculiarities, instead, long periods of stability with smooth transitions into other conditions were observed. A conclusion was inferred that the turbulence and multifractality time path in the photospheric magnetic field does not follow the timing of single flares, however, it tends to correspond to the levels of the magneto-morphological complexity and flaring productivity of an AR. So, in the sense of self-organized criticality (SOC), the photosphere, being in the state of self-organization, evolves independently from the highly intermittent, SOC-state corona.</description>

      <title>Reappraising the Elatina series: Solar dynamo clocking and inference of orbital periods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We reconsider the 680 million year old Elatina series of sedimentary laminae from South Australia that show a remarkably stable periodicity with a main period of around 12 years, which is close to the Schwabe cycle, and a second period of 314 years that has been coined Elatina cycle. By analyzing the residuals of the series' minima from a linear trend, and deriving Dicke's ratio, we first show that the series exhibits a high degree of phase stability, except one single break point which may indicate a 90{\deg} phase jump. We discuss the data in terms of a recently developed synchronization model of the solar dynamo. This model is then employed to infer those orbital periods of Venus, Earth, Jupiter and Saturn that would be required to jointly explain the moderately changed Schwabe cycle, and the Elatina cycle when interpreted as a prolonged Suess-de Vries cycle. Assuming pairwise conservations of the sum of the angular momenta of Jupiter/Saturn and Venus/Earth, respectively, we find solutions of the underlying inverse problem which amount to approximately 1 percent angular momentum increase of Jupiter and a 0.005 per cent angular momentum increase of Earth. The plausibility of such changes over a period of seven hundred million years is discussed in light of solar system dynamics.</description>

      <title>Be star + He star binary as an indicator of binary mass transfer phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid rotation of Be stars is supposed to mainly originate from binary evolution. In recent years, more and more Be stars with helium (He) star companions have been discovered, which provides a significant opportunity to study binary interaction physics. In this work, we perform binary population synthesis with an updated binary mass transfer stability criterion and try to understand the details of mass transfer processes by constructing a series of Be star + He star (BeHe) binary populations. We found that the simulations and the observations can be divided into two groups according to the masses of components, corresponding to the two distinct evolutionary processes during the mass transfer. In particular, we found that the mass ratios of BeHe binaries may be taken as a probe of the initial mass ratios of the primordial binaries. Moreover, the results suggest that a higher mass transfer efficiency ($\gtrsim 0.5$) supports the observations better. The simulations predicted too many Be star binaries experiencing Case B mass transfer, which conflicts with the observations. The reason is due to either observational selection effects or unclear physical factors.</description>

      <title>Homogeneous Stellar Atmospheric Parameters and 22 Elemental Abundances for FGK Stars Derived From LAMOST Low-resolution Spectra with DD-Payne</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A deep understanding of our Galaxy desires detailed decomposition of its stellar populations via their chemical fingerprints. This requires precise stellar abundances of many elements for a large number of stars. Here we present an updated catalog of stellar labels derived from LAMOST low-resolution spectra in a physics-sensible and rigorous manner with DD-Payne, taking labels from high-resolution spectroscopy as training set. The catalog contains atmospheric parameters for 6.4 million stars released in LAMOST DR9, and abundances for 22 elements, namely, C, N, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Sr, Y, Zr, Ba, La, Ce, Nd, Sm, and Eu, for nearly 3.6 million stars with spectral signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) higher than 20. The [Fe/H] is valid down to $\sim$-4.0, while elemental abundance ratios [X/Fe] are mostly valid for stars with [Fe/H] $\gtrsim-2.0$. Measurement errors in these labels are sensitive to and almost inversely proportional with SNR. For stars with S/N&gt;50, we achieved a typical error of 30 K in Teff, 0.07 dex in $\log g$, $\sim0.05$ dex in abundances for most elements with atomic number smaller than Sr, and 0.1--0.2 dex for heavier elements. Homogenization to the label estimates is carried out via dedicated internal and external calibration. In particular, the non-local thermal equilibrium effect is corrected for the [Fe/H] estimates, the Teff is calibrated to the infrared flux method scale, and the $\log~g$ is validated with asteroseismic measurements. The elemental abundances are internally calibrated using wide binaries, eliminating systematic trend with effective temperature. The catalog is publicly available.</description>

      <title>Constraining the physical structure of the circumstellar environment of V838 Monocerotis remnant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: V838 Monocerotis (V838 Mon) erupted in 2002 as a luminous red nova after which it cooled and began to form dust. The remnant is predicted to become a blue straggler. Interferometric observations in the HKLM bands have uncovered a stable bipolar feature in the closest vicinity of the remnant star. We aim to constrain the physical structure and nature of the circumstellar material immediately surrounding V838 Mon. Using the radiative-transfer code RADMC3D we managed to constrain the dust density distribution that best represents recent VLTI and CHARA interferometric imaging experiments. We also present recent SAAO-HIPPO polarimetric measurements which further test dust distribution models. We find that a multi-component model consisting of jets, a torus, and an ellipsoid provides an adequate fit to H band interferometric observables, however, it struggles to reproduce the extremely small closure phase deviations in the K band. The jets in our model are vital to produce nonzero closure phases, as they help to produce a gap in the torus, which is the sole source of asymmetry. The polarimetric measurements show that the intrinsic linear polarization is currently very low, with degree of polarization &lt; 2%, consistent with our model. Although not unique, our dust model suggests a persistent torus-like structure and jet or jets in the remnant, in agreement with several predictions for an intermediate-mass merger product. However, even though these features may be important signposts of the evolution of V838 Mon to the blue straggler phase, the origin of these features, remains largely unclear.</description>

      <title>Optical spectroscopic signatures of the red giant evolutionary state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern spectroscopic surveys output large data volumes. Theoretical models provide a means to transform the information encoded in these data to measurements of physical stellar properties. However, in detail the models are incomplete and simplified, and prohibit interpretation of the fine details in spectra. Instead, the available data provide an opportunity to use data-driven, differential analysis techniques, as a means towards understanding spectral signatures. We deploy such an analysis to examine core helium-fusing red clump (RC) and shell hydrogen-fusing red giant branch (RGB) stars, to uncover signatures of evolutionary state imprinted in optical stellar spectra. We exploit 786 pairs of RC and RGB stars from the GALAH survey, chosen to minimise spectral differences, with evolutionary state classifications from TESS and K2 asteroseismology. We report sub-percent residual, systematic spectral differences between the two classes of stars, and show that these residuals are significant compared to a reference sample of RC$-$RC and RGB$-$RGB pairs selected using the same criteria. First, we report systematic differences in the Swan ($\rm{C}_2$) band and CN bands caused by stellar evolution and a difference in mass, where RGB stars at similar stellar parameters have higher masses than RC stars. Secondly, we observe systematic differences in the line-width of the H$_{\alpha}$ and H$_{\beta}$ lines caused by a difference in microturbulence, as measured by GALAH, where we measure higher microturbulence in RC stars than RGB stars. This work demonstrates the ability of large surveys to uncover the subtle spectroscopic signatures of stellar evolution using model-free, data-driven methods.</description>

      <title>Vintage NPOI: New and Updated Angular Diameters for 145 Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new or updated angular diameters, physical radii, and effective temperatures for 145 stars from the Navy Precision Optical Interferometer data archive. We used data from 1996 to late-2021, and we describe the differences between early and late data, which hinge upon an update of the beam combiner in 2002. We came across several sub-categories of stars of interest: 13 of our stars are promising targets for the Habitable World Observatory and therefore require as much study as possible, and 14 more are asteroseismic targets and have stellar masses after we combined our radii and effective temperatures with frequencies of maximum oscillation power values from the literature. In addition to this, many of the stars here show measurements to the first null in the visibility curve and beyond, which is the gateway to determining second-order effects such as direct measurements of limb-darkening. Finally, we consider the stars in the larger context of previous NPOI measurements and find the majority 75% of the angular diameters in the overall NPOI sample have uncertainties of 2% or less.</description>

Abstract: During the course of publishing angular diameters from the Navy Precision Optical Interferometer data archive, we found we had data on 17 confirmed exoplanet host stars and one exoplanet candidate (HD 20902/alpha Per). Here, we update our previously published stellar radii with more precise Gaia parallaxes when available, and use our radius and effective temperature measurements to fit each star's mass and age using MIST models. The mass changed by more than 10% for 9 of the 18 stars. Combining our updated masses, radii, and temperatures, we present refined planetary masses as well as habitable zone calculations.</description>

      <title>Thin coronal jets and plasmoid-mediated reconnection: Insights from Solar Orbiter observations and Bifrost simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coronal jets are ubiquitous, collimated million-degree ejections that contribute to the energy and mass supply of the upper solar atmosphere and the solar wind. Solar Orbiter provides an unprecedented opportunity to observe fine-scale jets from a unique vantage point close to the Sun. We aim to (1) uncover thin jets originating from Coronal Bright Points (CBPs), revealing previously unresolved contributions to coronal upflows; and (2) improve our understanding of plasmoid-mediated reconnection and its observable signatures. We analyze eleven datasets from the High Resolution Imager 174 \r{A} of the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (HRIEUV) onboard Solar Orbiter, focusing on narrow jets from CBPs and signatures of magnetic reconnection within current sheets and outflow regions. To support the observations, we compare with CBP simulations performed with the Bifrost code. We have identified thin coronal jets originating from CBPs with widths ranging from 253 km to 706 km: scales that could not be resolved with previous EUV imaging instruments. Remarkably, these jets are 30-85% brighter than their surroundings and can extend up to 22 Mm while maintaining their narrow form. In one of the datasets, we directly identify plasmoid-mediated reconnection through the development within the current sheet of a small-scale plasmoid that reaches a size of 332 km and propagates at 40 km/s. In another dataset, we infer plasmoid signatures through the intermittent boomerang-like pattern that appears in the outflow region. Both direct and indirect plasmoid-mediated reconnection signatures are supported by comparisons with the synthetic HRIEUV emission from the simulations.</description>

      <title>SN 2024bfu, SN 2025qe, and the early light curves of type Iax supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Type Iax supernovae (SNe Iax) are perhaps the most numerous class of peculiar thermonuclear supernova and yet their sample size, particularly those observed shortly after explosion, remains relatively small. In this paper we present photometric and spectroscopic observations of two SNe Iax discovered shortly after explosion, SN 2024bfu and SN 2025qe. Both SNe were observed by multiple all-sky surveys, enabling tight constraints on the moment of first light and the shape of the early light curve. Our observations of SN 2025qe begin &lt;2 d after the estimated time of first light and represent some of the earliest observations of any SN Iax. We identify features consistent with carbon absorption throughout the spectroscopic evolution of SN 2025qe, potentially indicating the presence of unburned material throughout the ejecta. Inspired by our early light curve coverage, we gather a sample of SNe Iax observed by ATLAS, GOTO, and ZTF, and measure their rise times and early light curve power-law rise indices. We compare our findings to a sample of normal SNe Ia and find indications that SNe Iax show systematically shorter rise times, but the small sample size and relatively large uncertainties prevent us from identifying statistically significant differences in most bands. We find some indication that SNe Iax show systematically lower rise indices than normal SNe Ia in all bands. The low rise indices observed among SNe Iax is qualitatively consistent with extended $^{56}$Ni distributions and more thoroughly-mixed ejecta compared to normal SNe Ia, similar to predictions from pure deflagration explosions.</description>

      <title>Scintillation Properties of PSR B1133+16 Measured with Very Long Baseline Interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02165</link>

Abstract: The scintillation of pulsars reveals small-scale structure of the interstellar medium.
  A powerful technique for characterizing the scintillating structures (screens) combines analysis of scintillation arcs and very long baseline interferometry (VLBI).
  We present the results of a VLBI analysis of the scintillation arcs of PSR B1133+16 from simultaneous observations with Arecibo, VLA, Jodrell Bank, Effelsberg, and Westerbork.
  Three arcs appear in the data set, all of which appear consistent with being the result of very anisotropic scattering screens.
  We are able to measure their orientations on the sky, down to uncertainties of $3^\circ$ for the two stronger screens, and measure distances, of $140\pm30$, $180\pm20$, and $280\pm50{\rm\,pc}$, consistent with, but substantially more precise than what was inferred previously from annual modulation patterns in the scintillation.
  Comparing with the differential dust extinction with distance in this direction, the two nearer screens appear associated with the wall of the Local Bubble.</description>

      <title>Magnetic field dynamics in presence of Hall conductivity, and thermodiffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This anisotropy of kinetic coefficients in presence of a magnetic field is
  represented by so-called Hall currents, which appear in a collisional medium due to action of the Lorentz force on the charged particles between collisions. In many papers the Hall currents had been considered in different approximate approaches.
  We derive equations, describing dynamics of the magnetic field in presence of Hall currents, using a standard electrodynamic consideration. We consider collisional media, and take into account a temperature gradients, which create thermodiffusional electric current, in presence of the Hall component. The influence of the Hall currents on the magnetic field structure and damping is considered in simple models. In presence of thermodiffusion the condition for creation of the seed magnetic field in the non-magnetized media is found, which is needed for the action of the mechanism, known as "Biermann battery".</description>

      <title>Stability of a cluster-disrupted mean-motion resonance (chain) in HR 8799 and PDS 70</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: HR~8799 is a planetary system with four planets potentially in a mean-motion resonance chain. It is unclear from the observations if they are in mean-motion resonance. Similarly, PDS~70 has two observed planets also potentially in mean-motion resonance. We simulate HR~8799 and PDS~70 under external perturbations to study their responds if in resonance or mean-motion resonance. We integrate the equations of motion for HR~8799 and PDS~70 starting with either in resonance or in mean-motion resonance and study their in isolation and in a star cluster. In the star cluster, we take the effects of passing stars into account. The dynamics of the star cluster is resolved using the Lonely Planets module in AMUSE. HR~8799 and PDS~70 in mean-motion resonance are stable, whereas in non-resonance they dissolve in $0.303\pm0.042$Myr and $1.26\pm0.25$Myr, respectively. In a cluster, the non-resonant HR~8799 is slightly more stable than in isolation, but still dissolves in $0.300\pm0.043$Myr, whereas the resonant planetary system remains stable for at least $0.71$Myr. In contrast, a non-resonant PDS~70 system is approximately equally stable in a cluster compared to isolation, and dissolves in $1.03\pm0.20$Myr, whereas the resonant PDS~70 system remains stable for at least $0.83$Myr. Considering the more stable solutions of mean-motion resonance for HR~8799, we argue that the planetary system was born in mean-motion resonance and that the mean-motion resonance was preserved. If HR~8799 was not born in resonance, the probability that it survived until the present day is negligible. Similarly, we argue that PDS~70 was probably born in mean-motion resonance and that its state was preserved. We also find that it is almost possible for planetary systems with a broken mean-motion resonance chain to survive longer in a perturbing cluster environment compared to isolation.</description>

      <title>A chemical close-up of the main body of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the chemical composition of a sample of 37 red giant branch (RGB) stars belonging to the main body of the remnant of the Sagittarius (Sgr) dwarf spheroidal galaxy. All stars were observed with the FLAMES-UVES high-resolution spectrograph. Twenty-three new targets are selected along the blue side of the RGB of Sgr, but outside the galaxy stellar nucleus, in order to avoid contamination by the stars of the metal-poor globular cluster M54. Additionally, we re-analyzed archival spectra of fourteen targets located on the red RGB. For this sample, we derive the abundances of 21 chemical species (from Oxygen to Europium) representing different nucleosynthetic sites. The sample covers a large range of metallicity, from [Fe/H]~-2 to ~ -0.4 dex and we can identify the transition between the enrichment phases dominated by core-collapse (CC-SNe) and Type Ia (SNe-Ia) supernovae. The observed [{\alpha}/Fe] trend suggests a knee occurring at [Fe/H]~-1.5/-1.3 dex, compatible with the rather low star formation efficiency of Sgr. At lower [Fe/H], Sgr stars exhibit a chemical composition compatible with Milky Way stars of similar [Fe/H]. The only relevant exceptions are [Mn/Fe], [Zn/Fe], and [Eu/Fe]. At [Fe/H] higher than ~ -1.5/-1.3 dex, instead, the chemical pattern of Sgr significantly deviates from that of the Milky Way for almost all the elements analyzed in this study. Some of the abundance patterns reveal a lower contribution by very massive stars exploding as hypernovae (e.g. [Mn/Fe], [Zn/Fe]), a higher contribution by sub-Chandrasekhar progenitors of SNe Ia (e.g. [Ni/Fe]) and a high production efficiency of rapid neutron-capture elements ([Eu/Fe]).</description>

      <title>Clues for Solar System Formation from Meteorites and their Parent Bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the origin of comets requires knowledge of how the Solar System formed from a cloud of dust and gas 4.567 Gyr ago. Here, a review is presented of how the remnants of this formation process, meteorites and to a lesser extent comets, shed light on Solar System evolution. The planets formed by a process of collisional agglomeration during the first hundred million years of Solar System history. The vast majority of the original population of planetary building blocks (~100 km-scale planetesimals) was either incorporated into the planets or removed from the system, via dynamical ejection or through a collision with the Sun. Only a small fraction of the original rocky planetesimals survive to this day in the form of asteroids (which represent a total of ~0.05% of Earth's mass) and comets. Meteorites are fragments of asteroids that have fallen to Earth, thereby providing scientists with samples of Solar System-scale processes for laboratory-based analysis. Meteorite datasets complement cometary datasets, which are predominantly obtained via remote observation as there are few cometary samples currently available for laboratory-based measurements. This chapter discusses how analysis of the mineralogical, elemental, and isotopic characteristics of meteorites provides insight into (i) the origin of matter that formed planets, (ii) the pressure, temperature, and chemical conditions that prevailed during planet formation, and (iii) a precise chronological framework of planetary accretion. Also examined is the use of stable isotope variations and nucleosynthetic isotope anomalies as constraints on the dynamics of the disk and planet formation, and how these data are integrated into new models of Solar System formation. It concludes with a discussion of Earth's accretion and its source of volatile elements, including water and organic species.</description>

      <title>MINDS: The very low-mass star and brown dwarf sample. Detections and trends in the inner disk gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Planet-forming disks around brown dwarfs and very low-mass stars (VLMS) are on average less massive and are expected to undergo faster radial solid transport than their higher mass counterparts. Spitzer had detected C$_2$H$_2$, CO$_2$ and HCN around these objects. With better sensitivity and spectral resolving power, JWST recently revealed incredibly carbon-rich spectra from such disks. A study of a larger sample of objects is necessary to understand how common such carbon-rich inner disk regions are and to put constraints on their evolution. We present and analyze MIRI observations of 10 disks around VLMS from the MIRI GTO program. This sample is diverse, with the central object ranging in mass from 0.02 to 0.14 $M_{\odot}$. They are located in three star-forming regions and a moving group (1-10 Myr). We identify molecular emission in all sources and report detection rates. We compare the molecular flux ratios between different species and to dust emission strengths. We also compare the flux ratios with the stellar and disk properties. The spectra of these VLMS disks are extremely molecular rich, and we detect the 10 $\mu$m silicate dust emission feature in 70% of the sample. We detect C$_2$H$_2$ and HCN in all of the sources and find larger hydrocarbons such as C$_4$H$_2$ and C$_6$H$_6$ in nearly all sources. Among O-bearing molecules, we find firm detections of CO$_2$, H$_2$O, and CO in 90%, 50%, and 20% of the sample, respectively. We find that the detection rates of organic molecules correlate with other organic molecules and anti-correlate with inorganic molecules. Hydrocarbon-rich sources show a weaker 10$\mu$m dust strength as well as lower disk dust mass than the oxygen-rich sources. We find potential evidence for C/O enhancement with disk age. The observed trends are consistent with models that suggest rapid inward solid material transport and grain growth.</description>

      <title>Stellar Magnetic Storm Induced Magnetospheric Polarity Reversals: Distinguishing between Unmagnetised and Magnetised Exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exoplanetary and planetary environments are forced by stellar activity which manifest through variable radiation, particle and magnetic fluxes, stellar winds, flares and magnetic storms known as coronal mass ejections (CMEs). Recent studies have shown that (exo)planets with intrinsic magnetic fields and magnetospheres respond differently to this stellar forcing compared to planets which lack an intrinsic magnetism; this is borne out by observations in solar system planets. However, detailed investigations to uncover the subtle ways in which stellar magnetic storms impact exoplanets are still at a nascent stage. Here we utilize 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations to investigate the impact of stellar CMEs on Earth-like planets with different magnetic fields. Our results show that planetary atmospheric mass loss rates are dependent on the relative orientation of stellar wind and planetary magnetic fields, with significantly higher losses when the CME and planetary magnetic fields are oppositely oriented -- favoring enhanced magnetic reconnections. In contrast, for unmagnetised planets, the mass loss rate do not strongly depend on stellar magnetic field orientation. More significantly, we find that stellar CME induced polarity reversals can distinguish between planets with and without intrinsic magnetism. In unmagnetised or weakly magnetised (exo)planets, the polarity of the externally imposed magnetosphere are prone to global polarity reversals forced by stellar magnetised storms. Our analysis of the magnetotail current density dynamics during polarity reversals aligns with observations of Venus. This distinction in magnetospheric response provides a new paradigm to differentiate between (exo)planets with or without significant (intrinsic) magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>De-Biasing Structure Function Estimates From Sparse Time Series of the Solar Wind: A Data-Driven Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10053v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Structure functions, which represent the moments of the increments of a stochastic process, are essential complementary statistics to power spectra for analysing the self-similar behaviour of a time series. However, many real-world environmental datasets, such as those collected by spacecraft monitoring the solar wind, contain gaps, which inevitably corrupt the statistics. The nature of this corruption for structure functions remains poorly understood - indeed, often overlooked. Here we simulate gaps in a large set of magnetic field intervals from Parker Solar Probe in order to characterize the behaviour of the structure function of a sparse time series of solar wind turbulence. We quantify the resultant error with regards to the overall shape of the structure function, and its slope in the inertial range. Noting the consistent underestimation of the true curve when using linear interpolation, we demonstrate the ability of an empirical correction factor to de-bias these estimates. This correction, "learnt" from the data from a single spacecraft, is shown to generalize well to data from a solar wind regime elsewhere in the heliosphere, producing smaller errors, on average, for missing fractions &gt;25%. Given this success, we apply the correction to gap-affected Voyager intervals from the inner heliosheath and local interstellar medium, obtaining spectral indices similar to those from previous studies. This work provides a tool for future studies of fragmented solar wind time series, such as those from Voyager, MAVEN, and OMNI, as well as sparsely-sampled astrophysical and geophysical processes more generally.</description>

      <title>Detection of "diffuse" coronal He I 1083 during the April 8 2024 Solar Eclipse: evidence for terrestrial atmospheric scattering origin</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01009v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strong He I 1083 nm atomic line signals have been previously measured during total solar eclipses at coronal heights above the lunar limb. This rather unexpected measurement has kindled a discussion about the hypothesized presence of significant amounts of neutral helium at coronal conditions. We performed spectroscopic observations of the He I 1083 nm spectroscopic region with the newly built CHEESE instrument during the April 8th 2024 total solar eclipse to test the presence of He I 1083 in the solar corona. We detected the He I 1083, the forbidden coronal line Fe XIII 1074.7 nm, as well as the chromospheric H I 1093.8 nm Paschen-{\gamma} line in our eclipse observations. The chromospheric He I 1083 and H I 1093.8 nm Paschen-{\gamma} lines are detected in the corona as well as on the lunar disc. Our findings point toward a non-solar origin of the He I 1083 signal during the April 8th 2024 eclipse that challenge the notion of abundant neutral helium in the solar corona inferred from eclipse observations.</description>

      <title>An SS433 flare caught by TESS. Fast rise times and evidence for a 13 hours quasi-period</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02753v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: SS433 is an exotic Galactic microquasar in which there is a supercritical inflow of matter into a compact object of likely black hole nature. Here we report on an SS433 flare that occurred during a TESS observation of Sector 54 in June of 2022. The flare lasted for about 10 days and culminated in a flux increase by a factor of three relative to quiescence. The unprecedented continuous photometric coverage of the flare afforded by TESS shows that the flux can rise and fall by up to a factor of two within 4 to 7 hours. Furthermore, there is evidence that the flare peaks occur with a quasi-period $P_{\mathrm{QPO}} = 13.3$ hours. The flare can be most naturally explained by accretion rate ($\dot{M}$) variations due to oscillations in the donor star mass loss rate. We estimate $\dot{M}$ variations up to a factor of two with an increase in the photospheric radius of the accretion disk by about the same factor, implying that a transient ``common envelope'' enshrouds the binary system during the flares. If the flares are due to radial pulsations in the donor star envelope then their quasi-period $P_{\mathrm{QPO}}$ could imply a mean density $\left &lt; \rho \right &gt; \sim 18 \text{ kg} \text{ m}^{-3}$ for the donor star, compared to $\left &lt; \rho_{\mathrm{RL}} \right &gt; = 0.7-1 \text{ kg} \text{ m}^{-3}$ for a synchronized Roche-lobe filling donor star. Another SS433 lightcurve from a Sector 80 TESS observation in 2024 hints that there may be an outflow from behind the donor star.</description>

      <title>Exploring circumstellar chemistry in X-ray emitting AGB stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19616v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Aims. Our goal is to characterize the chemistry and physical conditions of the circumstellar envelopes (CSEs) of Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) binary candidate stars with UV-excess and X-ray emission, in particular, to identify the effects of the internal X-ray emission in the abundance of certain key molecules. Methods. We observed the 86.0-94.0 and 260.0-272.5 GHz spectral ranges searching for rotational transitions of the X-ray sensitive molecule $HCO^{+}$ in four AGB stars, two of them detected in both UV and X-ray emission and the other two detected only in UV. We derived the CSEs's physical parameters from previous CO observations and determined the molecular abundances of the detected species using radiative transfer models. We developed chemical kinetics models that account for the effects of internal X-ray emission (as well as UV radiation) and compared our predictions with observations. Results. We report the detection of $HCO^{+}$ in the X-ray emitting C-rich AGB T\,Dra, while it remains undetected in the spectra of the other three sources. In T\,Dra we also detect SiO, HCN, HNC, $HC_{3}N$, $SiC_{2}$, $C_{2}H$ and SiS. For the other targets only HCN and SiO are detected. The high fractional abundance of $HCO^{+}$ derived for T\,Dra ($[1.5-3.0]\times 10^{-8}$) is in good agreement with the predictions from our chemical kinetics models including the effects of internal X-ray emission, and one order of magnitude higher than the values expected for C-rich AGB stars. Additionally, we identify abundance enhancements for HNC, and $HC_{3}N$ alongside a depletion of CO in the innermost regions of T\,Dra's envelope. Conclusions. An internal X-ray source can significantly alter molecular abundances in AGB CSEs, enhancing $HCO^{+}$, $N_{2}H^{+}$, HNC, and $HC_{3}N$ while depleting parent species like CO. UV radiation has a weaker effect unless the envelope is optically thin or porous.</description>

Abstract: We describe our approach to solve the problem of ensuring the solenoidality of the magnetic field vector in three-dimensional (3D) inversions, as well as the estimation of the uncertainty in the inferred magnetic field. The solenoidality of the magnetic field vector is often disregarded in the inversion of spectropolarimetric data due to limitations in the traditional one-dimensional inversion techniques. We propose a method to ensure the solenoidal condition in 3D inversions based on our meshfree approach. The increase in dimensionality with respect to the 1D inversion techniques is such that some of the traditional methods to determine the uncertainties become unfeasible. We propose a method based on a Monte Carlo approach to determine the uncertainty of the magnetic field inference. Due to the physics of the problem, we can compute the uncertainty increasing the total required computational time by just a factor of about two. We also propose a metric to quantify the uncertainty to describe the degree of confidence of the magnetic field inference. Finally, we perform a numerical experiment to demonstrate the feasibility of both the method and the metric proposed to quantify the uncertainty.</description>

      <title>HDO ice detected toward an isolated low-mass protostar with JWST</title>

Abstract: Water is detected in environments representing every stage of star and solar system formation, but its chemical evolution throughout these stages remains poorly constrained. Deuterium ratios offer a means of probing chemical links between water in different cosmic regions because of their sensitivity to physicochemical conditions. Here, we present the first detection of the 4.1 $\mu$m HDO ice feature with JWST toward a low-mass protostar, L1527 IRS, which may eventually grow to a sun-like mass. We measure an ice HDO/H$_{2}$O ratio of 4.4$^{+3.7}_{-1.7}$$\times$10$^{-3}$, where the reported error is dominated by uncertainties in continuum definition and ice band strengths. This fraction is similar to the gas HDO/H$_{2}$O ratios measured in the warm ($&gt;$100 K) inner cores of other low-mass protostellar envelopes and protoplanetary disks found in comparably isolated star-forming regions. Such a similarity tentatively supports the assumption that water vapor detected in these regions is not significantly altered by gas-phase reactions following ice sublimation. It also supports the hypothesis that pre- and protostellar water ice is largely inherited in a chemically unaltered state by outer protoplanetary disks. However, the fraction is a factor of $\sim$4-10 times higher than the gas HDO/H$_{2}$O ratios measured toward comets and low-mass protostars in clustered star-forming regions. This difference may be due to either gas-phase water reprocessing in protostellar envelopes and protoplanetary disks, or differences between prestellar conditions of isolated dense cores and the clustered star-forming regions that are more analogous to the environment in which our Sun formed.</description>

      <title>The Samples and Binary Fractions of Red Supergiant in M31 and M33 by the HST Observations</title>

Abstract: The binarity of red supergiants (RSGs) influences their evolution and the fate of supernovae. We investigate the binary fraction of RSGs in the Andromeda Galaxy (M31) and Triangulum Galaxy (M33) using photometry from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), which offers high spatial resolution to resolve more RSGs. A preliminary step involves identifying a reliable and complete RSG sample using the F110W $-$ F160W versus F160W diagram, yielding 2,612 RSGs from the Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury (PHAT) survey of M31 3,294 RSGs from the Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury: Triangulum Extended Region (PHATTER) survey of M33. These samples suggest total RSG populations in M31 and M33 of 6,563 and 7,572, respectively. These estimates significantly exceed previous ones from the ground-based observations, an increase attributed to the superior spatial resolution of the HST. The stellar parameters of these RSGs, including effective temperature ($T_{\mathrm{eff}}$), radius ($R$), and luminosity ($L$), are derived by fitting their spectral energy distribution (SED) across optical and near-infrared bands. Binary candidates are identified by detecting ultraviolet (UV) excesses in their SEDs compared to the single-star RSG model prediction. The binary fraction is determined to be 33.4% $\pm$ 0.9% for M31 and 30.9% $\pm$ 0.8% for M33. For more luminous RSGs with log $L/L_{\odot} &gt; 4.0$, the binary fraction decreases to 31.6% $\pm$ 1.9% in M31 and increases to 34.7% $\pm$ 1.8% in M33, respectively. These results are in good agreement with predictions from the BPASS binary evolution model.</description>

      <title>Bridging the Gap: OPTICAM Reveals the Hidden Spin of the WZ Sge Star GOTO 065054.49+593624.51</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11669v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: WZ Sge stars are highly evolved accreting white dwarf systems (AWDs) exhibiting remarkably large amplitude outbursts (a.k.a. super-outbursts), typically followed by short rebrightenings/echo outbursts. These systems have some of the lowest mass transfer rates among AWDs, making even low magnetic fields dynamically important. Such magnetic fields are often invoked to explain the phenomenology observed in these systems, such as their X-ray luminosity and long periods of quiescence (30+ years). However, the detection of these is very elusive given the quenching of the accretion columns during outburst and the low luminosity of these systems during quiescence. Here we present high-cadence multi-band observations with {\it OPTICAM} of the recent outburst of the recently discovered WZ Sge star GOTO065054.49+593624.51, during the end of the main outburst and the dip in-between rebrightenings, covering 2 orders of magnitude in brightness. Our observations reveal the presence of a statistically significant signal with $P_{\omega}\simeq148$ seconds in the bluer ($g$) band which is detected only during the dip between the main outburst and the rebrigthenings. We interpret this signal as the spin period of the AWD. If confirmed, GOTO 0650 would bridge the gap between intermediate- and fast-rotating intermediate polars (IPs) below the period gap.</description>

      <title>Metallicities of old open clusters: A new Galactic map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18378v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Old open clusters (OCs) can constrain the chemical evolution of the Galactic disc through their metallicity gradients and age-metallicity relation but they are affected by low statistics. This work aims to determine precise and homogeneous metallicities for a number of old clusters ($\geq$ 500 Myr) from all-sky catalogues of stellar parameters leveraging Gaia spectrophotometry. Our purpose was to revisit the metallicity distribution of the oldest OCs as a function of their Galactic position and age with improved statistics. Our sample includes ~600 old OCs with a typical precision of 0.05 dex in metallicity. We identified metal-poor or metal-rich clusters never studied before, as well as moving groups as the remnants of dissolving clusters. Galactic maps show a smooth decrease in metallicity from inside to outside the disc. Metal-rich and metal-poor clusters exist at all ages but dominate respectively in the inner and the outer disc, with different scale heights.The radial metallicity gradient was found to have a knee shape with a steep value of -0.084$\pm$0.004 dex/kpc in the inner side and -0.018$\pm$0.004 dex/kpc outside the knee. The inner radial gradient flattens with age. Vertically, the metallicity gradient is -0.415$\pm$0.030 dex/kpc. The large scatter in the distribution of metallicity versus age is nicely explained by the superposition of OC populations standing at different galactocentric distances, each with its own mean metallicity and small dispersion, less than 0.08 dex in radius bins of 1 kpc.Our results are consistent with a negative radial metallicity gradient of interstellar matter that was present in the disc when the clusters formed. The low metallicity dispersion in each radius bin reflects weak radial mixing.</description>

      <title>Orbital Decay of the Ultra-Hot Jupiter TOI-2109b: Tidal Constraints and Transit-Timing Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18941v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: TOI-2109b is the ultra-hot Jupiter with the shortest orbital period ($\sim16\,$hr) yet discovered. At this close distance, strong tidal interactions can produce a significant exchange of angular momentum with the star. Since the orbital period of this planet is shorter than the stellar rotation period, TOI-2109b may be an optimal candidate for studying orbital decay. This process depends on how efficiently the star and the planet dissipate energy, due mainly to interior mechanisms that are poorly constrained in exoplanet systems. In this work, we study for the first time the tidal evolution of TOI-2109b under a formalism of inertial waves (IWs) in convective envelopes and internal gravity waves (IGWs) in stellar radiative regions. We find that uncertainties in the age of TOI-2109 ($t_\mathrm{\star, age}$) significantly affect the rate of orbital evolution, as IWs and IGWs interact differently depending on $t_\mathrm{\star, age}$. For an 'old' host star, we find that TOI-2109b would undergo fast orbital decay. Conversely, if TOI-2109b orbits a 'young' host star, a rather slow decay rate for $Q_\star'&gt;2.3\times10^7$ would suggest a constant-period orbit. Our calculated mid-transit times and transit-timing variations (TTVs) support a 'young' host star with $Q_\star'&gt;3.7\times10^7$, suggesting a decay rate $\dot{P}\sim4\,$ms yr$^{-1}$ that could lead to mid-transit-time shifts $\lesssim10\,$s over three years. Orbital decay and other TTV-inducing effects will be confirmed or ruled out with future higher-quality timing data. The results presented here aim at constraining the current modeling of tides and TTVs for TOI-2109b, helping us further understand light-curve changes associated to the long-term evolution of ultra-short-period planets.</description>
