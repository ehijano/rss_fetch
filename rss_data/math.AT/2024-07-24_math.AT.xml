      <title>Homotopy Types Of Toric Orbifolds From Weyl Polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a reduced crystallographic root system with a fixed simple system, it is associated to a Weyl group $W$, parabolic subgroups $W_K$'s and a polytope $P$ which is the convex hull of a dominant weight. The quotient $P/W_K$ can be identified with a polytope. Polytopes $P$ and $P/W_K$ are associated to toric varieties $X_P$ and $X_{P/W_K}$ respectively. It turns out the underlying topological spaces $X_P/W_K$ and $X_{P/W_K}$ are homotopy equivalent, when considering the polytopes in the real span of the root lattice or of the weight lattice.</description>

      <title>E2 formality via obstruction theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We attack the question of E_2-formality of differential graded algebras over prime fields via obstruction theory. We are able to prove that E_2-algebras whose cohomology ring is a polynomial algebra on even degree classes are intrinsically formal. As a consequence we prove E_2-formality of the classifying space of some compact Lie group or of Davis-Januszkiewicz spaces.</description>

      <title>The cohomology of $BPU_n$ in dimensions less than $15$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $PU_n$ denote the projective unitary group of rank $n$ and $BPU_n$ be its classifying space, for $n&gt;1$. By using the Serre spectral sequence induced by the fibration $BU_n\to BPU_n\to K(\mathbb{Z},3)$, we compute the integral cohomology of $BPU_n$ in dimensions less than $15$ except for $4\mid n$ in dimension $14$.</description>

      <title>The $\mathbb{Z}/p$-equivariant spectrum $BP\mathbb{R}$ for an odd prime $p$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present paper, we construct a $\mathbb{Z}/p$-equivariant analog of the $\mathbb{Z}/2$-equivariant spectrum $BP\mathbb{R}$ previously constructed by Hu and Kriz. We prove that this spectrum has some of the properties conjectured by Hill, Hopkins, and Ravenel. Our main construction method is an $\mathbb{Z}/p$-equivariant analog of the Brown-Peterson tower of $BP$, based on a previous description of the $\mathbb{Z}/p$-equivariant Steenrod algebra with constant coefficients by the authors. We also describe several variants of our construction and comparisons with other known equivariant spectra.</description>

      <title>Proper topological complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and study the proper topological complexity of a given configuration space, a version of the classical invariant for which we require that the algorithm controlling the motion is able to avoid any possible choice of ``unsafe'' area. To make it a homotopy functorial invariant we characterize it as a particular instance of the exterior sectional category of an exterior map, an invariant of the exterior homotopy category which is also deeply analyzed.</description>

      <title>Hecke operators on topological modular forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.06208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.06208v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The cohomology theory TMF of topological modular forms is a derived algebro-geometric interpretation of the classical ring of complex modular forms from number theory. In this article, we refine the classical Adams operations, Hecke operators, and Atkin--Lehner involutions from endomorphisms of classical modular forms to stable operators on TMF. Our algebro-geometric formulation of these operators leads to simple proofs of their many remarkable properties and computations. From these properties, we use techniques from homotopy theory to make simple number-theoretic deductions, including a rederivation of some classical congruences of Ramanujan and providing new infinite families of classical Hecke operators which satisfy Maeda's conjecture.</description>

      <title>A generalization of operads based on subgraph contractions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.08256v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a generalization of the notion of operad that we call a contractad, whose set of operations is indexed by connected graphs and whose composition rules are numbered by contractions of connected subgraphs. We show that many classical operads, such as the operad of commutative algebras, Lie algebras, associative algebras, pre-Lie algebras, the little disks operad, and the operad of moduli spaces of stable curves $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{0,n+1}$ admit generalizations to contractads. We explain that standard tools like Koszul duality and the machinery of Gr\"obner bases can be easily generalized to contractads. We verify the Koszul property of the commutative, Lie, associative, and Gerstenhaber contractads.</description>

      <title>Koszul Operads Governing Props and Wheeled Props</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.08718v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct groupoid coloured operads governing props and wheeled props, and show they are Koszul. This is accomplished by new biased definitions for (wheeled) props, and an extension of the theory of Groebner bases for operads to apply to groupoid coloured operads. Using the Koszul machine, we define homotopy (wheeled) props, and show they are not formed by polytope based models. Finally, using homotopy transfer theory, we construct Massey products for (wheeled) props, show these products characterise the formality of these structures, and re-obtain a theorem of Mac Lane on the existence of higher homotopies of (co)commutative Hopf algebras.</description>

      <title>Cycles in graphs and in hypergraphs: results and problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05175v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This is an expository paper. A $1$-cycle in a graph is a set $C$ of edges such that every vertex is contained in an even number of edges from $C$. E.g., a cycle in the sense of graph theory is a $1$-cycle, but not vice versa. It is easy to check that the sum (modulo $2$) of $1$-cycles is a $1$-cycle. In this text we study the following problems: to find
  $\bullet$ the number of all 1-cycles in a given graph;
  $\bullet$ a small number of 1-cycles in a given graph such that any 1-cycle is the sum of some of them.
  We also consider generalizations (of these problems) to graphs with symmetry, and to $2$-cycles in $2$-dimensional hypergraphs.</description>

      <title>Hopf algebras in the cohomology of $\mathcal{A}_g$, $\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbb{Z})$, and $\mathrm{SL}_n(\mathbb{Z})$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11528v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe a bigraded cocommutative Hopf algebra structure on the weight zero compactly supported rational cohomology of the moduli space of principally polarized abelian varieties. By relating the primitives for the coproduct to graph cohomology, we deduce that $\dim H^{2g+k}_c(\mathcal{A}_g)$ grows at least exponentially with $g$ for $k = 0$ and for all but finitely many positive integers $k$. Our proof relies on a new result of independent interest; we use a filtered variant of the Waldhausen construction to show that Quillen's spectral sequence abutting to the cohomology of $BK(\mathbb{Z})$ is a spectral sequence of Hopf algebras. From the same construction, we also deduce that $\dim H^{\binom{n}{2} - n - k}(\mathrm{SL}_n(\mathbb{Z}))$ grows at least exponentially with $n$, for $k = -1$ and for all but finitely many non-negative integers $k$.</description>

      <title>Scalar Function Topology Divergence: Comparing Topology of 3D Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08364v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new topological tool for computer vision - Scalar Function Topology Divergence (SFTD), which measures the dissimilarity of multi-scale topology between sublevel sets of two functions having a common domain. Functions can be defined on an undirected graph or Euclidean space of any dimensionality. Most of the existing methods for comparing topology are based on Wasserstein distance between persistence barcodes and they don't take into account the localization of topological features. The minimization of SFTD ensures that the corresponding topological features of scalar functions are located in the same places. The proposed tool provides useful visualizations depicting areas where functions have topological dissimilarities. We provide applications of the proposed method to 3D computer vision. In particular, experiments demonstrate that SFTD as an additional loss improves the reconstruction of cellular 3D shapes from 2D fluorescence microscopy images, and helps to identify topological errors in 3D segmentation. Additionally, we show that SFTD outperforms Betti matching loss in 2D segmentation problems.</description>
