      <title>ASyMOB: Algebraic Symbolic Mathematical Operations Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly approaching the level of proficiency in university-level symbolic mathematics required for applications in advanced science and technology. However, existing benchmarks fall short in assessing the core skills of LLMs in symbolic mathematics-such as integration, differential equations, and algebraic simplification. To address this gap, we introduce ASyMOB, a novel assessment framework focused exclusively on symbolic manipulation, featuring 17,092 unique math challenges, organized by similarity and complexity. ASyMOB enables analysis of LLM generalization capabilities by comparing performance in problems that differ by simple numerical or symbolic `perturbations'. Evaluated LLMs exhibit substantial degradation in performance for all perturbation types (up to -70.3%), suggesting reliance on memorized patterns rather than deeper understanding of symbolic math, even among models achieving high baseline accuracy. Comparing LLM performance to computer algebra systems, we identify examples where they fail while LLMs succeed, as well as problems solved only by combining both approaches. Models capable of integrated code execution yielded higher accuracy compared to their performance without code, particularly stabilizing weaker models (up to +33.1% for certain perturbation types). Notably, the most advanced models (o4-mini, Gemini 2.5 Flash) demonstrate not only high symbolic math proficiency (scoring 96.8% and 97.6% on the unperturbed set), but also remarkable robustness against perturbations, (-21.7% and -21.2% vs. average -50.4% for the other models). This may indicate a recent "phase transition" in the generalization capabilities of frontier LLMs. It remains to be seen whether the path forward lies in deeper integration with sophisticated external tools, or in developing models so capable that symbolic math systems like CAS become unnecessary.</description>

      <title>Directional Non-Commutative Monoidal Structures with Interchange Law via Commutative Generators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel framework consisting of a class of algebraic structures that generalize one-dimensional monoidal systems into higher dimensions by defining per-axis composition operators subject to non-commutativity and a global interchange law. These structures, defined recursively from a base case of vector-matrix pairs, model directional composition in multiple dimensions while preserving structural coherence through commutative linear operators.
  We show that the framework that unifies several well-known linear transforms in signal processing and data analysis. In this framework, data indices are embedded into a composite structure that decomposes into simpler components. We show that classic transforms such as the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), the Walsh transform, and the Hadamard transform are special cases of our algebraic structure. The framework provides a systematic way to derive these transforms by appropriately choosing vector and matrix pairs. By subsuming classical transforms within a common structure, the framework also enables the development of learnable transformations tailored to specific data modalities and tasks.</description>
