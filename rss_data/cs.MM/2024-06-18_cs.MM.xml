      <title>SFedCA: Credit Assignment-Based Active Client Selection Strategy for Spiking Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spiking federated learning is an emerging distributed learning paradigm that allows resource-constrained devices to train collaboratively at low power consumption without exchanging local data. It takes advantage of both the privacy computation property in federated learning (FL) and the energy efficiency in spiking neural networks (SNN). Thus, it is highly promising to revolutionize the efficient processing of multimedia data. However, existing spiking federated learning methods employ a random selection approach for client aggregation, assuming unbiased client participation. This neglect of statistical heterogeneity affects the convergence and accuracy of the global model significantly. In our work, we propose a credit assignment-based active client selection strategy, the SFedCA, to judiciously aggregate clients that contribute to the global sample distribution balance. Specifically, the client credits are assigned by the firing intensity state before and after local model training, which reflects the local data distribution difference from the global model. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on various non-identical and independent distribution (non-IID) scenarios. The experimental results demonstrate that the SFedCA outperforms the existing state-of-the-art spiking federated learning methods, and requires fewer communication rounds.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Visible-Infrared Person Re-identification with Modality- and Instance-aware Visual Prompt Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Visible-Infrared Person Re-identification (VI ReID) aims to match visible and infrared images of the same pedestrians across non-overlapped camera views. These two input modalities contain both invariant information, such as shape, and modality-specific details, such as color. An ideal model should utilize valuable information from both modalities during training for enhanced representational capability. However, the gap caused by modality-specific information poses substantial challenges for the VI ReID model to handle distinct modality inputs simultaneously. To address this, we introduce the Modality-aware and Instance-aware Visual Prompts (MIP) network in our work, designed to effectively utilize both invariant and specific information for identification. Specifically, our MIP model is built on the transformer architecture. In this model, we have designed a series of modality-specific prompts, which could enable our model to adapt to and make use of the specific information inherent in different modality inputs, thereby reducing the interference caused by the modality gap and achieving better identification. Besides, we also employ each pedestrian feature to construct a group of instance-specific prompts. These customized prompts are responsible for guiding our model to adapt to each pedestrian instance dynamically, thereby capturing identity-level discriminative clues for identification. Through extensive experiments on SYSU-MM01 and RegDB datasets, the effectiveness of both our designed modules is evaluated. Additionally, our proposed MIP performs better than most state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Competitive Learning for Achieving Content-specific Filters in Video Coding for Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the efficacy of jointly optimizing content-specific post-processing filters to adapt a human oriented video/image codec into a codec suitable for machine vision tasks. By observing that artifacts produced by video/image codecs are content-dependent, we propose a novel training strategy based on competitive learning principles. This strategy assigns training samples to filters dynamically, in a fuzzy manner, which further optimizes the winning filter on the given sample. Inspired by simulated annealing optimization techniques, we employ a softmax function with a temperature variable as the weight allocation function to mitigate the effects of random initialization. Our evaluation, conducted on a system utilizing multiple post-processing filters within a Versatile Video Coding (VVC) codec framework, demonstrates the superiority of content-specific filters trained with our proposed strategies, specifically, when images are processed in blocks. Using VVC reference software VTM 12.0 as the anchor, experiments on the OpenImages dataset show an improvement in the BD-rate reduction from -41.3% and -44.6% to -42.3% and -44.7% for object detection and instance segmentation tasks, respectively, compared to independently trained filters. The statistics of the filter usage align with our hypothesis and underscore the importance of jointly optimizing filters for both content and reconstruction quality. Our findings pave the way for further improving the performance of video/image codecs.</description>

      <title>VIA: A Spatiotemporal Video Adaptation Framework for Global and Local Video Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Video editing stands as a cornerstone of digital media, from entertainment and education to professional communication. However, previous methods often overlook the necessity of comprehensively understanding both global and local contexts, leading to inaccurate and inconsistency edits in the spatiotemporal dimension, especially for long videos. In this paper, we introduce VIA, a unified spatiotemporal VIdeo Adaptation framework for global and local video editing, pushing the limits of consistently editing minute-long videos. First, to ensure local consistency within individual frames, the foundation of VIA is a novel test-time editing adaptation method, which adapts a pre-trained image editing model for improving consistency between potential editing directions and the text instruction, and adapts masked latent variables for precise local control. Furthermore, to maintain global consistency over the video sequence, we introduce spatiotemporal adaptation that adapts consistent attention variables in key frames and strategically applies them across the whole sequence to realize the editing effects. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, compared to baseline methods, our VIA approach produces edits that are more faithful to the source videos, more coherent in the spatiotemporal context, and more precise in local control. More importantly, we show that VIA can achieve consistent long video editing in minutes, unlocking the potentials for advanced video editing tasks over long video sequences.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Text-to-Visual Generation with Image-to-Text Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01291v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite significant progress in generative AI, comprehensive evaluation remains challenging because of the lack of effective metrics and standardized benchmarks. For instance, the widely-used CLIPScore measures the alignment between a (generated) image and text prompt, but it fails to produce reliable scores for complex prompts involving compositions of objects, attributes, and relations. One reason is that text encoders of CLIP can notoriously act as a "bag of words", conflating prompts such as "the horse is eating the grass" with "the grass is eating the horse". To address this, we introduce the VQAScore, which uses a visual-question-answering (VQA) model to produce an alignment score by computing the probability of a "Yes" answer to a simple "Does this figure show '{text}'?" question. Though simpler than prior art, VQAScore computed with off-the-shelf models produces state-of-the-art results across many (8) image-text alignment benchmarks. We also compute VQAScore with an in-house model that follows best practices in the literature. For example, we use a bidirectional image-question encoder that allows image embeddings to depend on the question being asked (and vice versa). Our in-house model, CLIP-FlanT5, outperforms even the strongest baselines that make use of the proprietary GPT-4V. Interestingly, although we train with only images, VQAScore can also align text with video and 3D models. VQAScore allows researchers to benchmark text-to-visual generation using complex texts that capture the compositional structure of real-world prompts. We introduce GenAI-Bench, a more challenging benchmark with 1,600 compositional text prompts that require parsing scenes, objects, attributes, relationships, and high-order reasoning like comparison and logic. GenAI-Bench also offers over 15,000 human ratings for leading image and video generation models such as Stable Diffusion, DALL-E 3, and Gen2.</description>

      <title>Attack on Scene Flow using Point Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13621v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks have made significant advancements in accurately estimating scene flow using point clouds, which is vital for many applications like video analysis, action recognition, and navigation. The robustness of these techniques, however, remains a concern, particularly in the face of adversarial attacks that have been proven to deceive state-of-the-art deep neural networks in many domains. Surprisingly, the robustness of scene flow networks against such attacks has not been thoroughly investigated. To address this problem, the proposed approach aims to bridge this gap by introducing adversarial white-box attacks specifically tailored for scene flow networks. Experimental results show that the generated adversarial examples obtain up to 33.7 relative degradation in average end-point error on the KITTI and FlyingThings3D datasets. The study also reveals the significant impact that attacks targeting point clouds in only one dimension or color channel have on average end-point error. Analyzing the success and failure of these attacks on the scene flow networks and their 2D optical flow network variants shows a higher vulnerability for the optical flow networks.</description>

      <title>CtrSVDD: A Benchmark Dataset and Baseline Analysis for Controlled Singing Voice Deepfake Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02438v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent singing voice synthesis and conversion advancements necessitate robust singing voice deepfake detection (SVDD) models. Current SVDD datasets face challenges due to limited controllability, diversity in deepfake methods, and licensing restrictions. Addressing these gaps, we introduce CtrSVDD, a large-scale, diverse collection of bonafide and deepfake singing vocals. These vocals are synthesized using state-of-the-art methods from publicly accessible singing voice datasets. CtrSVDD includes 47.64 hours of bonafide and 260.34 hours of deepfake singing vocals, spanning 14 deepfake methods and involving 164 singer identities. We also present a baseline system with flexible front-end features, evaluated against a structured train/dev/eval split. The experiments show the importance of feature selection and highlight a need for generalization towards deepfake methods that deviate further from training distribution. The CtrSVDD dataset and baselines are publicly accessible.</description>
