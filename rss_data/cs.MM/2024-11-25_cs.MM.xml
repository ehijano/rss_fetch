      <title>Optimal Transcoding Preset Selection for Live Video Streaming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In today's digital landscape, video content dominates internet traffic, underscoring the need for efficient video processing to support seamless live streaming experiences on platforms like YouTube Live, Twitch, and Facebook Live. This paper introduces a comprehensive framework designed to optimize video transcoding parameters, with a specific focus on preset and bitrate selection to minimize distortion while respecting constraints on bitrate and transcoding time. The framework comprises three main steps: feature extraction, prediction, and optimization. It leverages extracted features to predict transcoding time and rate-distortion, employing both supervised and unsupervised methods. By utilizing integer linear programming, it identifies the optimal sequence of presets and bitrates for video segments, ensuring real-time application feasibility under set constraints. The results demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in enhancing video quality for live streaming, maintaining high standards of video delivery while managing computational resources efficiently. This optimization approach meets the evolving demands of video delivery by offering a solution for real-time transcoding optimization. Evaluation using the User Generated Content dataset showed an average PSNR improvement of 1.5 dB over the default Twitch configuration, highlighting significant PSNR gains. Additionally, subsequent experiments demonstrated a BD-rate reduction of -49.60%, reinforcing the framework's superior performance over Twitch's default configuration.</description>

      <title>Generative AI for Music and Audio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative AI has been transforming the way we interact with technology and consume content. In the next decade, AI technology will reshape how we create audio content in various media, including music, theater, films, games, podcasts, and short videos. In this dissertation, I introduce the three main directions of my research centered around generative AI for music and audio: 1) multitrack music generation, 2) assistive music creation tools, and 3) multimodal learning for audio and music. Through my research, I aim to answer the following two fundamental questions: 1) How can AI help professionals or amateurs create music and audio content? 2) Can AI learn to create music in a way similar to how humans learn music? My long-term goal is to lower the barrier of entry for music composition and democratize audio content creation</description>

      <title>Health AI Developer Foundations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robust medical Machine Learning (ML) models have the potential to revolutionize healthcare by accelerating clinical research, improving workflows and outcomes, and producing novel insights or capabilities. Developing such ML models from scratch is cost prohibitive and requires substantial compute, data, and time (e.g., expert labeling). To address these challenges, we introduce Health AI Developer Foundations (HAI-DEF), a suite of pre-trained, domain-specific foundation models, tools, and recipes to accelerate building ML for health applications. The models cover various modalities and domains, including radiology (X-rays and computed tomography), histopathology, dermatological imaging, and audio. These models provide domain specific embeddings that facilitate AI development with less labeled data, shorter training times, and reduced computational costs compared to traditional approaches. In addition, we utilize a common interface and style across these models, and prioritize usability to enable developers to integrate HAI-DEF efficiently. We present model evaluations across various tasks and conclude with a discussion of their application and evaluation, covering the importance of ensuring efficacy, fairness, and equity. Finally, while HAI-DEF and specifically the foundation models lower the barrier to entry for ML in healthcare, we emphasize the importance of validation with problem- and population-specific data for each desired usage setting. This technical report will be updated over time as more modalities and features are added.</description>

      <title>Deep ReLU Networks Have Surprisingly Simple Polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.09145v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A ReLU network is a piecewise linear function over polytopes. Figuring out the properties of such polytopes is of fundamental importance for the research and development of neural networks. So far, either theoretical or empirical studies on polytopes only stay at the level of counting their number, which is far from a complete characterization. Here, we propose to study the shapes of polytopes via the number of faces of the polytope. Then, by computing and analyzing the histogram of faces across polytopes, we find that a ReLU network has relatively simple polytopes under both initialization and gradient descent, although these polytopes can be rather diverse and complicated by a specific design. This finding can be appreciated as a kind of generalized implicit bias, subjected to the intrinsic geometric constraint in space partition of a ReLU network. Next, we perform a combinatorial analysis to explain why adding depth does not generate a more complicated polytope by bounding the average number of faces of polytopes with the dimensionality. Our results concretely reveal what kind of simple functions a network learns and what will happen when a network goes deep. Also, by characterizing the shape of polytopes, the number of faces can be a novel leverage for other problems, \textit{e.g.}, serving as a generic tool to explain the power of popular shortcut networks such as ResNet and analyzing the impact of different regularization strategies on a network's space partition.</description>
