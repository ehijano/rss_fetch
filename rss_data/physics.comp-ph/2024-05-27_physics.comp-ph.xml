      <title>Learning phase transitions by siamese neural network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The wide application of machine learning (ML) techniques in statistics physics has presented new avenues for research in this field. In this paper, we introduce a semi-supervised learning method based on Siamese Neural Networks (SNN), trying to explore the potential of neural network (NN) in the study of critical behaviors beyond the approaches of supervised and unsupervised learning. By focusing on the (1+1) dimensional bond directed percolation (DP) model of nonequilibrium phase transition, we use the SNN to predict the critical values and critical exponents of the system. Different from traditional ML methods, the input of SNN is a set of configuration data pairs and the output prediction is similarity, which prompts to find an anchor point of data for pair comparison during the test. In our study, during test we set different bond probability $p$ as anchors, and discuss the impact of the configurations at this anchors on predictions. More, we use an iterative method to find the optimal training interval to make the algorithm more efficient, and the prediction results are comparable to other ML methods.</description>

      <title>Graph Random Walk for Time-of-Flight Charge Mobilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a graph random walk (GRW) method for the study of charge transport properties of complex molecular materials in the time-of-flight regime. The molecules forming the material are represented by the vertices of a directed weighted graph, and the charge carriers are random walkers. The edge weights are rates for elementary jumping processes for a charge carrier to move along the edge and are determined from a combination of the energies of the involved vertices and an interaction strength. Exclusions are built into the random walk to account for the Pauli exclusion principle. In time-of-flight experiments, charge carriers are injected into the material and the time until they reach a collecting electrode is recorded. In this setting, our GRW approach allows direct evaluation of the expected hitting time of the collecting nodes in the graph in terms of a typically sparse, linear system, thereby avoiding numerically cumbersome and potentially fluctuations-prone methods based on explicit time evolution from solutions of a high-dimensional system of coupled ordinary differential equations (the Master Equation) or from kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC). We validate the GRW approach by conducting numerical studies of charge dynamics of single and multiple carriers in diffusive and drift-diffusive regimes using a surrogate lattice model. The surrogate model allows varying types and strengths of energetic disorder from the reference baseline. Comparison with results from the Master Equation confirms the theoretical equivalence of both approaches also in numerical implementations. We further show that KMC results show substantial deviations due to inadequate sampling. All in all, we find that the GRW method provides a powerful alternative to the more commonly used methods without sampling issues and with the benefit of making use of sparse matrix methods.</description>

      <title>The Singlet-Triplet Gap of Cyclobutadiene: The CIPSI-Driven CC($P$;$Q$) Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An accurate determination of singlet-triplet gaps in biradicals, including cyclobutadiene in the automerization barrier region where one has to balance the substantial nondynamical many-electron correlation effects characterizing the singlet ground state with the predominantly dynamical correlations of the lowest-energy triplet, remains a challenge for many quantum chemistry methods. High-level coupled-cluster (CC) approaches, such as the CC method with a full treatment of singly, doubly, and triply excited clusters (CCSDT), are often capable of providing reliable results, but the routine application of such methods is hindered by their high computational costs. We have recently proposed a practical alternative to converging the CCSDT energetics at small fractions of the computational effort, even when electron correlations become stronger and connected triply excited clusters are larger and nonperturbative, by merging the CC($P$;$Q$) moment expansions with the selected configuration interaction methodology abbreviated as CIPSI. We demonstrate that one can accurately approximate the highly accurate CCSDT potential surfaces characterizing the lowest singlet and triplet states of cyclobutadiene along the automerization coordinate and the gap between them using tiny fractions of triply excited cluster amplitudes identified with the help of relatively inexpensive CIPSI Hamiltonian diagonalizations.</description>

      <title>Finite-size effect in Kuramoto phase oscillators with higher-order interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Finite-size systems of Kuramoto model display intricate dynamics, especially in the presence of multi-stability where both coherent and incoherent states coexist. We investigate such scenario in globally coupled populations of Kuramoto phase oscillators with higher-order interactions, and observe that fluctuations inherent to finite-size systems drives the transition to the synchronized state occurring before the critical point in the thermodynamic limit. Using numerical methods, we plot the first exit time distribution of the magnitude of complex order parameter and obtain numerical transition probabilities across various system sizes. Further, we extend this study to a two-population oscillator system, and using velocity field of the associated order parameters, show the emergence of a new fixed point corresponding to a partially synchronized state arising due to the finite-size effect which is absent in the thermodynamics limit.</description>

      <title>Renormalized Internally-Contracted Multireference Coupled Cluster with Perturbative Triples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we combine the many-body formulation of the internally contracted multireference coupled cluster (ic-MRCC) method with Evangelista's multireference formulation of the driven similarity renormalization group (DSRG). The DSRG method can be viewed as a unitary multireference coupled cluster theory, which renormalizes the amplitudes based on a flow equation approach to eliminate numerical instabilities. We extend this approach by demonstrating that the unitary flow equation approach can be adapted for nonunitary transformations, rationalizing the renormalization of ic-MRCC amplitudes. We denote the new approach, the renormalized ic-MRCC (ric-MRCC) method. To achieve high accuracy with a reasonable computational cost, we introduce a new approximation to the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff expansion. We fully consider the linear commutator while approximating the quadratic commutator, for which we neglect specific contractions involving amplitudes with active indices. Moreover, we introduce approximate perturbative triples to obtain the ric-MRCCSD[T] method. We demonstrate the accuracy of our approaches in comparison to advanced multireference methods for the potential energy curves of H8, F2, H2O, N2, and Cr2. Additionally, we show that ric-MRCCSD and ric-MRCSSD[T] match the accuracy of CCSD(T) for evaluating spectroscopic constants and of full configuration interaction energies for a set of small molecules.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural PDE Solvers with Conservation and Similarity-Equivariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Utilizing machine learning to address partial differential equations (PDEs) presents significant challenges due to the diversity of spatial domains and their corresponding state configurations, which complicates the task of encompassing all potential scenarios through data-driven methodologies alone. Moreover, there are legitimate concerns regarding the generalization and reliability of such approaches, as they often overlook inherent physical constraints. In response to these challenges, this study introduces a novel machine-learning architecture that is highly generalizable and adheres to conservation laws and physical symmetries, thereby ensuring greater reliability. The foundation of this architecture is graph neural networks (GNNs), which are adept at accommodating a variety of shapes and forms. Additionally, we explore the parallels between GNNs and traditional numerical solvers, facilitating a seamless integration of conservative principles and symmetries into machine learning models. Our findings from experiments demonstrate that the model's inclusion of physical laws significantly enhances its generalizability, i.e., no significant accuracy degradation for unseen spatial domains while other models degrade.

      <title>Transparent boundary condition and its high frequency approximation for the Schr\"odinger equation on a rectangular computational domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the numerical implementation of the transparent boundary condition (TBC) and its various approximations for the free Schr\"odinger equation on a rectangular computational domain. In particular, we consider the exact TBC and its spatially local approximation under high frequency assumption along with an appropriate corner condition. For the spatial discretization, we use a Legendre-Galerkin spectral method where Lobatto polynomials serve as the basis. Within variational formalism, we first arrive at the time-continuous dynamical system using spatially discrete form of the initial boundary-value problem incorporating the boundary conditions. This dynamical system is then discretized using various time-stepping methods, namely, the backward-differentiation formula of order 1 and 2 (i.e., BDF1 and BDF2, respectively) and the trapezoidal rule (TR) to obtain a fully discrete system. Next, we extend this approach to the novel Pad\'e based implementation of the TBC presented by Yadav and Vaibhav [arXiv:2403.07787(2024)]. Finally, several numerical tests are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the boundary maps (incorporating the corner conditions) where we study the stability and convergence behavior empirically.</description>

      <title>LUCIE: A Lightweight Uncoupled ClImate Emulator with long-term stability and physical consistency for O(1000)-member ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present LUCIE, a $1000$- member ensemble data-driven atmospheric emulator that remains stable during autoregressive inference for thousands of years without a drifting climatology. LUCIE has been trained on $9.5$ years of coarse-resolution ERA5 data with $4$ prognostic variables on a single A100 GPU for $2.4$ h. Owing to the cheap computational cost of inference, $1000$ model ensembles are executed for $5$ years to compute an uncertainty-quantified climatology for the prognostic variables that closely match the climatology obtained from ERA5. Unlike all the other state-of-the-art AI weather models, LUCIE is neither unstable nor does it produce hallucinations that result in unphysical drift of the emulated climate. Furthermore, LUCIE \textbf{does not impose} ``true" sea-surface temperature (SST) from a coupled numerical model to enforce the annual cycle in temperature. We demonstrate the long-term climatology obtained from LUCIE as well as subseasonal-to-seasonal scale prediction skills on the prognostic variables. We also demonstrate a $20$-year emulation with LUCIE here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mRmhx9RRGiF3uGo_mRQK8RpwQatrCiMn/view</description>

      <title>On the Definition of Velocity in Discrete-Time, Stochastic Langevin Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We systematically develop beneficial and practical velocity measures for accurate and efficient statistical simulations of the Langevin equation, with direct applications to computational statistical mechanics and molecular dynamics sampling. Recognizing that the existing velocity measures for the most statistically accurate discrete-time Verlet-type algorithms are inconsistent with the simulated configurational coordinate, we seek to create new velocity companions that both improve existing methods as well as offer practical options for implementation in existing computer codes. The work is based on the set of GJ methods that, of all methods, correctly reproduces the most basic statistical features of a Langevin system; namely correct Boltzmann distribution for harmonic potentials and correct transport in the form of drift and diffusion for linear potentials. Several new accompanying velocities exhibiting correct drift are identified, and we expand on an earlier conclusion that only half-step velocities can exhibit correct, time-step independent Maxwell-Boltzmann distributions. Specific practical and efficient algorithms are given in familiar forms, and these are used to numerically validate the analytically derived expectations.</description>

      <title>SE3Set: Harnessing equivariant hypergraph neural networks for molecular representation learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop SE3Set, an SE(3) equivariant hypergraph neural network architecture tailored for advanced molecular representation learning. Hypergraphs are not merely an extension of traditional graphs; they are pivotal for modeling high-order relationships, a capability that conventional equivariant graph-based methods lack due to their inherent limitations in representing intricate many-body interactions. To achieve this, we first construct hypergraphs via proposing a new fragmentation method that considers both chemical and three-dimensional spatial information of molecular system. We then design SE3Set, which incorporates equivariance into the hypergragh neural network. This ensures that the learned molecular representations are invariant to spatial transformations, thereby providing robustness essential for accurate prediction of molecular properties. SE3Set has shown performance on par with state-of-the-art (SOTA) models for small molecule datasets like QM9 and MD17. It excels on the MD22 dataset, achieving a notable improvement of approximately 20% in accuracy across all molecules, which highlights the prevalence of complex many-body interactions in larger molecules. This exceptional performance of SE3Set across diverse molecular structures underscores its transformative potential in computational chemistry, offering a route to more accurate and physically nuanced modeling.</description>

Abstract: Engineering design and scientific analysis rely upon computer simulations of turbulent fluid flows using turbulence models. These turbulence models are empirical and approximate, leading to large uncertainties in their predictions that hamper scientific and engineering advances. We outline a Physics Constrained Deep Learning framework to estimate turbulence model uncertainties using physics based Eigenspace Perturbations along with Deep Learning based guidance. The Deep Learning based modulation controls the spatial variation in perturbation magnitude to improve the calibration of uncertainty estimates over the state of the art physics based methods.</description>

      <title>Magnetized compressible turbulence with a fluctuation dynamo and Reynolds numbers over a million</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supersonic magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence is a ubiquitous state for many astrophysical plasmas. However, even the basic statistics for this type of turbulence remains uncertain. We present results from supersonic MHD turbulence simulations at unparalleled resolutions, with plasma Reynolds numbers of over a million. In the kinetic energy spectrum we find a break between the scales that are dominated by kinetic energy, with spectral index $-2$, and those that become strongly magnetized, with spectral index $-3/2$. By analyzing the Helmholtz decomposed kinetic energy spectrum, we find that the compressible modes are not passively mixed through the cascade of the incompressible modes. At high magnetic Reynolds number, above $10^5$, we find a power law in the magnetic energy spectrum with spectral index $-9/5$. On the strongly magnetized, subsonic scales the plasma tends to self-organize into locally relaxed regions, where there is strong alignment between the current density, magnetic field, velocity field and vorticity field, depleting both the nonlinearities and magnetic terms in the MHD equations, which we attribute to plasma relaxation on scales where the magnetic fluctuations evolve on shorter timescales than the velocity fluctuations. This process constrains the cascade to inhomogenous, volume-poor, fractal surfaces between relaxed regions, which has significant repercussions for understanding the nature of magnetized turbulence in astrophysical plasmas and the saturation of the fluctuation dynamo.</description>

      <title>A numerical integration scheme for vectorised phase-space of one-dimensional collision-free, electrostatic systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The kinetic analyses of many-particle soft matter often employ many simulation studies of various physical phenomena which supplement the experimental limitations or compliment the theoretical findings of the study. Such simulations are generally conducted by the numerical integration techniques of the governing equations. In the typical case of collisionless electrostatic systems such as electrostatic plasmas, the Vlasov-Poisson (VP) equation system governs the dynamical evolution of the particle phase-space. The one-dimensional position-velocity (1D-1V) particle phase-space, on the other hand, is known to exhibit direct analogy with ordinary two-dimensional fluids, wherein the Vlasov equation resembles the fluid continuity equation of an in-compressible fluid. On the basis of this fluid-analogy, we present, in this work, a new numerical integration scheme which treats the 1D-1V phase-space as a two-dimensional fluid vector space. We then perform and present analyses of numerical accuracy of this scheme and compare its speed and accuracy with the well-known finite splitting scheme, which is a standardised technique for the numerical Vlasov-Poisson integration. Finally, we show some simulation results of the 1D collisionless electrostatic plasma which highlight the higher speed and accuracy of the new scheme. This work presents a fast and sufficiently accurate numerical integration technique of the VP system which can be directly employed in various simulation studies of many particle systems, including plasmas.</description>

      <title>An improved penalty-based excited-state variational Monte Carlo approach with deep-learning ansatzes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce several improvements to the penalty-based variational quantum Monte Carlo (VMC) algorithm for computing electronic excited states, and demonstrate that the accuracy of the updated method is competitive with other available excited-state VMC approaches. A theoretical comparison of the computational aspects of these algorithms is presented, where several benefits of the penalty-based method are identified. Our main contributions include an automatic mechanism for tuning the scale of the penalty terms, an updated form of the overlap penalty with proven convergence properties, and a new term that penalizes the spin of the wave function, enabling the selective computation of states with a given spin. With these improvements, along with the use of the latest self-attention-based ansatz, the penalty-based method achieves a mean absolute error below 1 kcal/mol for the vertical excitation energies of a set of 26 atoms and molecules, without relying on variance matching schemes. Considering excited states along the dissociation of the carbon dimer, the accuracy of the penalty-based method is on par with that of natural-excited-state (NES) VMC, while also providing results for larger sections of the potential energy surface. Additionally, the accuracy of the original penalty-based method is improved for a conical intersection of ethylene, with the predicted angle of the intersection agreeing well with both NES-VMC and multi-reference configuration interaction.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Methods for Colloidal Silver Nanoparticle Concentration and Size Distribution Determination from UV-Vis Extinction Spectra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10891v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electron microscopy, while reliable, is an expensive, slow, and inefficient technique for thorough size distribution characterization of both mono- and polydisperse colloidal nanoparticles. If rapid in-situ characterization of colloid samples is to be achieved, a different approach, based on fast, widely accessible, and inexpensive optical measurements such as UV-Vis spectroscopy in combination with spectra interpretation related to Mie scattering theory, is needed. In this article, we present a tandem deep neural network (DNN) for the size distribution and concentration prediction of close to spherical silver colloidal nanoparticle batches synthesized via the seeded growth method. The first DNN identified the dipole component of the localized surface plasmon resonance and the second one determined the size distribution from the isolated spectral component. The training data was engineered to be bias-free and generated numerically. High prediction accuracy with root mean square percentage error of mean size down to 1.2% was achieved, spanning the entire prediction range from 1 nm up to 150 nm in radius, suggesting the possible extension limits of the effective medium theory used for simulating the spectra. The DNN-predicted nanoparticle concentrations also were very close to the ones expected based on synthesis precursor contents as well as measured by atomic absorption spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>A general pressure equation based method for incompressible two-phase flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.17885v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a fully-explicit, iteration-free, weakly-compressible method to simulate immiscible incompressible two-phase flows. To update pressure, we circumvent the computationally expensive Poisson equation and use the general pressure equation. In addition, the volume-of-fluid approach is used for interface capturing under the operator-split methodology. Our method is fully-explicit and stable with simple local spatial discretization, and hence, it is easy to implement. Several two- and three-dimensional canonical two-phase flows are simulated. The qualitative and quantitative results prove that our method is capable of accurately handling problems involving a range of density and viscosity ratios and surface tension effects.</description>

      <title>A vectorized Navier-Stokes ensemble direct numerical simulation code for plane parallel flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.12739v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a pseudo-spectal Navier-Stokes solver for plane parallel flows (Couette/Poiseuille), that has been developed on the MATLAB programming language. The code performs direct numerical simulations (DNSs) of turbulence in 3 dimensions at low Reynolds numbers ($Re_{\tau} \approx 40-180 $), using a programming structure that mainly employs matrix multiplications to solve the Navier-Stokes equations. The novelty of this DNS code lies on the vectorization of the required operations to simultaneously advance in time an ensemble of flow realizations and the utilization of graphics processing unit (GPU) computational resources, which offers a significant reduction of running time for simulations with adequately resolved viscous scales.</description>

      <title>Quantum Equation of Motion with Orbital Optimization for Computing Molecular Properties in Near-Term Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12386v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Determining the properties of molecules and materials is one of the premier applications of quantum computing. A major question in the field is how to use imperfect near-term quantum computers to solve problems of practical value. Inspired by the recently developed variants of the quantum counterpart of the equation-of-motion (qEOM) approach and the orbital-optimized variational quantum eigensolver (oo-VQE), we present a quantum algorithm (oo-VQE-qEOM) for the calculation of molecular properties by computing expectation values on a quantum computer. We perform noise-free quantum simulations of BeH$_2$ in the series of STO-3G/6-31G/6-31G* basis sets and of H$_4$ and H$_2$O in 6-31G using an active space of four electrons and four spatial orbitals (8 qubits) to evaluate excitation energies, electronic absorption, and, for twisted H$_4$, circular dichroism spectra. We demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can reproduce the results of conventional classical CASSCF calculations for these molecular systems.</description>

      <title>Chemical Transferability and Accuracy of Ionic Liquid Simulations with Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01980v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ionic liquids (ILs) are an exciting class of electrolytes finding applications in many areas from energy storage to solvents, and have been touted as ``designer solvents'', as they can be mixed to precisely tailor the physiochemical properties. As using machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) to simulate ILs is still relatively unexplored, several questions need to be answered to see if MLIPs can be transformative for ILs. Since ILs are often not pure, but are either mixed together or contain additives, we first demonstrate that a MLIP can be trained to be chemically transferable, i.e., can be applied to compositions not directly train on, but with similar chemistries, whilst only being trained on a few compositions. We also investigate the accuracy of MLIPs for a novel IL, which we experimentally synthesis and characterise. Our MLIP trained on $\sim$200 DFT frames is in reasonable agreement with our experiments and good agreement against DFT, demonstrating the data-efficient power of this method.</description>

      <title>Assessing the query complexity limits of quantum phase estimation using symmetry aware spectral bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04737v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The computational cost of quantum algorithms for physics and chemistry is closely linked to the spectrum of the Hamiltonian, a property that manifests in the necessary rescaling of its eigenvalues. The typical approach of using the 1-norm as an upper bound to the spectral norm to rescale the Hamiltonian suits the most general case of bounded Hermitian operators but neglects the influence of symmetries commonly found in chemical systems. In this work, we introduce a hierarchy of symmetry-aware spectral bounds that provide a unified understanding of the performance of quantum phase estimation algorithms using block-encoded electronic structure Hamiltonians. We present a variational and numerically tractable method for computing these bounds, based on orbital optimization, to demonstrate that the computed bounds are smaller than conventional spectral bounds for a variety of molecular benchmark systems. We also highlight the unique analytical and numerical scaling behavior of these bounds in the thermodynamic and complete basis set limits. Our work shows that there is room for improvement in reducing the 1-norm, not yet achieved through methods like double factorization and tensor hypercontraction, but highlights potential challenges in improving the performance of current quantum algorithms beyond small constant factors through 1-norm reduction techniques alone.</description>

      <title>Transparent boundary condition and its effectively local approximation for the Schr\"{o}dinger equation on a rectangular computational domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07787v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The transparent boundary condition for the free Schr\"{o}dinger equation on a rectangular computational domain requires implementation of an operator of the form $\sqrt{\partial_t-i\triangle_{\Gamma}}$ where $\triangle_{\Gamma}$ is the Laplace-Beltrami operator. It is known that this operator is nonlocal in time as well as space which poses a significant challenge in developing an efficient numerical method of solution. The computational complexity of the existing methods scale with the number of time-steps which can be attributed to the nonlocal nature of the boundary operator. In this work, we report an effectively local approximation for the boundary operator such that the resulting complexity remains independent of number of time-steps. At the heart of this algorithm is a Pad\'e approximant based rational approximation of certain fractional operators that handles corners of the domain adequately. For the spatial discretization, we use a Legendre-Galerkin spectral method with a new boundary adapted basis which ensures that the resulting linear system is banded. A compatible boundary-lifting procedure is also presented which accommodates the segments as well as the corners on the boundary. The proposed novel scheme can be implemented within the framework of any one-step time marching schemes. In particular, we demonstrate these ideas for two one-step methods, namely, the backward-differentiation formula of order 1 (BDF1) and the trapezoidal rule (TR). For the sake of comparison, we also present a convolution quadrature based scheme conforming to the one-step methods which is computationally expensive but serves as a golden standard. Finally, several numerical tests are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of our novel method as well as to verify the order of convergence empirically.</description>

      <title>Vector Ising Spin Annealer for Minimizing Ising Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16608v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Vector Ising Spin Annealer (VISA), a framework in gain-based computing that harnesses light-matter interactions to solve complex optimization problems encoded in spin Hamiltonians. Traditional driven-dissipative systems often select excited states due to limitations in spin movement. VISA transcends these constraints by enabling spins to operate in a three-dimensional space, offering a robust solution to minimize Ising Hamiltonians effectively. Our comparative analysis reveals VISA's superior performance over conventional single-dimension spin optimizers, demonstrating its ability to bridge substantial energy barriers in complex landscapes. Through detailed studies on cyclic and random graphs, we show VISA's proficiency in dynamically evolving the energy landscape with time-dependent gain and penalty annealing, illustrating its potential to redefine optimization in physical systems.</description>

      <title>Heavy-element damage seeding in proteins under X-ray free electron laser illumination conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10298v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The emerging technique of serial femtosecond X-ray crystallography (SFX) can be used to study the structure and dynamics of biological macromolecules to high spatial and temporal resolutions. An ongoing challenge for SFX is the damage caused by the ultrabright X-ray free electron laser pulse. Though it is often assumed that sufficiently femtosecond pulses `outrun' radiation damage, in reality electronic damage processes commence during exposure. We model the electronic damage to protein nanocrystals using a plasma model that tracks the continuous changes to the energy distribution of the unbound electrons. Tracking the continuous energy distribution is of particular importance for distinguishing the influence of differing elements on secondary damage processes. Heavy atoms have a ubiquitous but small presence in protein targets - typically as integral components of the macromolecule and as salts in the solvent. We find that these atoms considerably influence the simulated ionization and scattering behavior of realistic targets due to their rapid seeding of secondary ionization processes. In lysozyme, even the presence of native sulfur atoms significantly contributes to theoretical measures of damage-induced noise for &gt;= 6 keV, 15 fs pulses. Contributing to the effect is that heavy atoms seed `intermediate' energy electron cascades that are particularly effective at ionizing the target on the femtosecond timescale. In addition, the disproportionate effect of heavy atoms means the damage to a protein crystal can be sensitive to their presence in the solvent. Outside of reducing the concentration of heavy atoms in the target, these results suggest the dose limits of SFX targets will be higher where the ionization of deep &gt;~ 6 keV absorption edges is minimized, or, to a lesser extent, when such edges are only ionized with X-rays &gt;&gt; 2 keV above their binding energy.</description>

      <title>Kronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature for Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15603v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are infamous for being hard to train. Recently, second-order methods based on natural gradient and Gauss-Newton methods have shown promising performance, improving the accuracy achieved by first-order methods by several orders of magnitude. While promising, the proposed methods only scale to networks with a few thousand parameters due to the high computational cost to evaluate, store, and invert the curvature matrix. We propose Kronecker-factored approximate curvature (KFAC) for PINN losses that greatly reduces the computational cost and allows scaling to much larger networks. Our approach goes beyond the established KFAC for traditional deep learning problems as it captures contributions from a PDE's differential operator that are crucial for optimization. To establish KFAC for such losses, we use Taylor-mode automatic differentiation to describe the differential operator's computation graph as a forward network with shared weights. This allows us to apply KFAC thanks to a recently-developed general formulation for networks with weight sharing. Empirically, we find that our KFAC-based optimizers are competitive with expensive second-order methods on small problems, scale more favorably to higher-dimensional neural networks and PDEs, and consistently outperform first-order methods and LBFGS.</description>
