      <title>JWST lensed quasar dark matter survey IV: Stringent warm dark matter constraints from the joint reconstruction of extended lensed arcs and quasar flux ratios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a measurement of the free-streaming length of dark matter (DM) and subhalo abundance around 28 quadruple image strong lenses using observations from JWST MIRI presented in Paper III of this series. We improve on previous inferences on DM properties from lensed quasars by simultaneously reconstructing extended lensed arcs with image positions and relative magnifications (flux ratios). Our forward modeling framework generates full populations of subhalos, line-of-sight halos, and globular clusters, uses an accurate model for subhalo tidal evolution, and accounts for free-streaming effects on halo abundance and concentration. Modeling lensed arcs leads to more-precise model-predicted flux ratios, breaking covariance between subhalo abundance and the free-streaming scale parameterized by the half-mode mass $m_{\rm{hm}}$. Assuming subhalo abundance predicted by the semi-analytic model {\tt{galacticus}} (N-body simulations), we infer (Bayes factor of 10:1) $m_{\rm{hm}} &lt; 10^{7.4} \mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ ($m_{\rm{hm}} &lt; 10^{7.2} \mathrm{M}_{\odot}$), a 0.4 dex (0.3 dex) improvement relative to omitting lensed arcs. These bounds correspond to lower limits on thermal relic DM particle masses of $7.4$ and $8.4$ keV, respectively. Conversely, assuming DM is cold, we infer a projected mass in subhalos ($10^6 &lt; m/M_{\odot}&lt;10^{10.7}$) of $1.6_{-1.1}^{+2.4} \times 10^7 \ \mathrm{M}_{\odot} \ \rm{kpc^{-2}}$ at $95 \%$ confidence. This is consistent with {\tt{galacticus}} predictions ($0.6 \times 10^7 \mathrm{M}_{\odot} \ \rm{kpc^{-2}}$), but in tension with recent N-body simulations ($0.3 \times 10^7 \mathrm{M}_{\odot} \ \rm{kpc^{-2}}$). Our results are the strongest limits on WDM, and the most precise measurement of subhalo abundance around strong lenses. Further improvements will follow from the large sample of lenses to be discovered by Euclid, Rubin, and Roman.</description>

      <title>The Dark Energy Survey Supernova Program: A Reanalysis Of Cosmology Results And Evidence For Evolving Dark Energy With An Updated Type Ia Supernova Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present improved cosmological constraints from a re-analysis of the Dark Energy Survey (DES) 5-year sample of Type Ia supernovae (DES-SN5YR). This re-analysis includes an improved photometric cross-calibration, recent white dwarf observations to cross-calibrate between DES and low redshift surveys, retraining the SALT3 light curve model and fixing a numerical approximation in the host galaxy colour law. Our fully recalibrated sample, which we call DES-Dovekie, comprises $\sim$1600 likely Type Ia SNe from DES and $\sim$200 low-redshift SNe from other surveys. With DES-Dovekie, we obtain $\Omega_{\rm m} = 0.330 \pm 0.015$ in Flat $\Lambda$CDM which changes $\Omega_{\rm m}$ by $-0.022$ compared to DES-SN5YR. Combining DES-Dovekie with CMB data from Planck, ACT and SPT and the DESI DR2 measurements in a Flat $w_0 w_a$CDM cosmology, we find $w_0 = -0.803 \pm 0.054$, $w_a = -0.72 \pm 0.21$. Our results hold a significance of $3.2\sigma$, reduced from $4.2\sigma$ for DES-SN5YR, to reject the null hypothesis that the data are compatible with the cosmological constant. This significance is equivalent to a Bayesian model preference odds of approximately 5:1 in favour of the Flat $w_0 w_a$CDM model. Using generally accepted thresholds for model preference, our updated data exhibits only a weak preference for evolving dark energy.</description>

      <title>Null Impact of the Null Energy Condition in Current Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We clarify the role of the oft-misunderstood Null Energy Condition (NEC) in the context of the current cosmological data. In particular, the NEC implies the sum of the total energy density and pressure satisfies $\rho_{tot}+P_{tot} \ge 0$; the energy conditions do not apply separately to individual components of the cosmological fluid. Consequently, we show that under the current best-fit cosmological model no violation of the NEC takes place, past or future. Further, growth in the energy density of an individual component cannot be used to signal violation of the NEC. We illustrate these points with a worked example whereby misestimation of the matter density leads to a phase during which $\rho_{de} + P_{de} &lt; 0$ for the effective dark energy, followed by a phantom crossing and subsequent $\rho_{de} + P_{de} &gt; 0$. At no time is the NEC violated. We also introduce ``elephant'' and ``chimera'' classes of physics for crossing $w_{de}=-1$.</description>

      <title>The impact of precession and higher-order multipoles on cosmological inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational-wave astronomy presents an exciting opportunity to provide an independent measurement of the expansion rate of the Universe. By combining inferences for the binary component masses and luminosity distances from individual observations, it is possible to infer $H_0$ without direct electromagnetic counterparts or galaxy catalogs. However, this relies on theoretical gravitational-wave models, which are known to be incomplete descriptions of the full predictions of general relativity. Although the accuracy of our models are improving, they are also becoming increasingly expensive as additional phenomena are incorporated. In this work, we demonstrate that there is no significant advantage in including spin-precession and higher-order multipole moments when inferring $H_0$ via the mass spectrum method for current and near-future gravitational-wave event numbers. Even when simulating a population of highly precessing and preferentially asymmetric-mass-ratio binaries, we show that the inferred $H_0$ posterior changes minimally. Using a simpler, less accurate model, achieves comparable $H_0$ estimates with six times less computational cost (on average). Using computationally cheaper models for single event inference may become crucial as thousands of gravitational-wave observations are expected to be detected in the near future.</description>

      <title>JWST Lensed Quasar Dark Matter Survey III: Dark Matter Sensitive Flux Ratios and Warm Dark Matter Constraint from the Full Sample</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07765v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the full sample of measurements of the warm dust emission of 31 strongly-lensed, multiply imaged quasars, observed with JWST MIRI multiband imaging, which we use to constrain the particle properties of dark matter. The strongly lensed warm dust region of quasars is compact and statistically sensitive to a population of dark matter halos down to masses of $10^6$ M$_\odot$. The high spatial resolution and infrared sensitivity of MIRI make it uniquely suited to measure multiply imaged warm dust emission from quasars and thus to infer the properties of low-mass dark halos. We use the measured flux ratios to test for a warm dark matter turnover in the halo mass function. To infer the dark matter parameters, we use a forward modeling pipeline which explores dark matter parameters while also accounting for tidal stripping effects on subhalos, globular clusters, and complex deflector macromodels with $m=1, m=3, \text{ and } m=4$ elliptical multipole moments. Adopting a comparable prior on the projected density of substructure to our previous analyses, the data presented here provide a factor of 2 improvement in sensitivity to a turnover in the halo mass function. Assuming subhalo abundance predicted by the semi-analytic model galacticus we infer with a Bayes factor of 10:1, a half-mode mass $m_{\rm{hm}} &lt; 10^{7.8} M_{\odot}$ (m&gt;5.6 keV for a thermally produced dark matter particle). If instead we use a prior from N-body simulations, we infer $m_{\rm{hm}} &lt; 10^{7.5} M_{\odot}$ (m&gt;6.9 keV). This is one of the strongest constraints to date on a turnover on the halo mass function, and the flux ratios and inference methodology presented here can be used to test a broad range of dark matter physics.</description>

      <title>Spectral distortions in the decaying QCD dark matter scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the QCD--DM scenario by analyzing the imprint of energy injection from decaying dark-sector particles on the spectral distortions (SDs) of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). We adopt a unified framework capable of describing both relativistic and non-relativistic particles, as well as fast and slow decay regimes. Within this approach, we model exponential, power-law, oscillatory, and two-step decays, computing the resulting $\mu$- and $y$-type distortions across the parameter space spanned by the confinement scale $a_c$, decay rate $\Gamma_\chi$, energy-transfer efficiency $\Sigma_\chi$, and velocity $v_{\chi c}$. We find that power-law, oscillatory, and cascade decays can be effectively mapped onto exponential models with appropriate rescaling. The dominant factors controlling SDs are the decay epoch and lifetime, with $v_{\chi c}$ becoming relevant only in the ultra-relativistic limit. FIRAS observations impose tight constraints on early energy injection, with $\mu$-type distortions placing the strongest bounds on $\Sigma_\chi$. Simultaneous matching of both $\mu_{\rm firas}$ and $y_{\rm firas}$ breaks the degeneracy between $\Gamma_\chi$ and $\Sigma_\chi$, localizing preferred decay rates around $\Gamma_\chi \lesssim (3.3-4.4)\times10^{-3}~{\rm yr}^{-1}$ and $\Sigma_\chi \lesssim 8.5\times10^{-4}$ for relativistic particles, while fast decays with $\Gamma_\chi \gtrsim 6.5~{\rm yr}^{-1}$ become observationally negligible. Our results show that CMB spectral distortions are a powerful probe of dark-sector dynamics. Future missions such as PIXIE or PRISM could extend current limits by several orders of magnitude and test previously inaccessible regions of parameter space.</description>

      <title>CSST Strong Lensing Preparation: Cosmological Constraints Forecast from CSST Galaxy-Scale Strong Lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong gravitational lensing by galaxies is a powerful tool for studying cosmology and galaxy structure. The China Space Station Telescope (CSST) will revolutionize this field by discovering up to $\sim$100,000 galaxy-scale strong lenses, a huge increase over current samples. To harness the statistical power of this vast dataset, we forecast its cosmological constraining power using the gravitational-dynamical mass combination method. We create a realistic simulated lens sample and test how uncertainties in redshift and velocity dispersion measurements affect results under ideal, optimistic, and pessimistic scenarios. We find that increasing the sample size from 100 to 10,000 systems dramatically improves precision: in the $\Lambda$CDM model, the uncertainty on the matter density parameter, $\Omega_m$, drops from 0.2 to 0.01; in the $w$CDM model, the uncertainty on the dark energy equation of state, $w$, decreases from 0.3 to 0.04. With 10,000 lenses, our constraints on dark energy are twice as tight as those from the latest DESI BAO measurements. We also compare two parameter estimation techniques -- MultiNest sampling and Bayesian Hierarchical Modeling (BHM). While both achieve similar precision, BHM provides more robust estimates of intrinsic lens parameters, whereas MultiNest is about twice as fast. This work establishes an efficient and scalable framework for cosmological analysis with next-generation strong lensing surveys.</description>

      <title>Galaxy cluster temperature maps from joint X-ray and SZ maps with The Three Hundred hydrodynamical simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxy clusters can be used as powerful cosmological probes, provided one can obtain accurate mass estimates, which requires a precise knowledge of the underlying astrophysics of galaxy clusters. For these purposes, spatially resolved measurements of the thermodynamic properties of intra-cluster medium (ICM), such as density and temperature, are necessary. In particular, temperature estimates are traditionally obtained through spatially resolved X-ray spectroscopy. Such measurements suffer from their sensitivity to the chosen energy calibration, may exhibit inherent biases, and are especially hard to perform at high redshift as they require deep observations. In recent years however, millimetre wavelength data with high spatial resolution, comparable to the one of current X-ray telescopes, have begun to be available. This has enabled the implementation of new methods to infer and map the cluster temperature in individual clusters, using the combination of density maps from X-ray data and pressure maps from millimetre data. In this paper, we present the first systematic validation of this approach on a large sample of synthetic clusters generated in The Three Hundred hydrodynamical simulations. We show that we are able to recover theoretical estimates of the temperature, namely the mass-weighted and spectroscopic-like temperatures, within biases of the order of $\lesssim 1\%$ in the best cases, up to $\sim 10\%$ in average, with scatters of the order of $10\%$.
  To prepare the application of this approach to observed data, we discuss the modelling of the effective length $l_\mathrm{eff}$, a key quantity necessary for the combination of X-ray and SZ projected data. In particular we provide templates calibrated on simulations for this quantity, and investigate their impact in the recovery of the temperature map, compared to other standard models.</description>

      <title>Euclid preparation. Non-Gaussianity of 2-point statistics likelihood: Precise analysis of the matter power spectrum distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08266v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the non-Gaussian features in the distribution of the matter power spectrum multipoles. Using the COVMOS method, we generate 100\,000 mock realisations of dark matter density fields in both real and redshift space across multiple redshifts and cosmological models. We derive an analytical framework linking the non-Gaussianity of the power spectrum distribution to higher-order statistics of the density field, including the trispectrum and pentaspectrum. We explore the effect of redshift-space distortions, the geometry of the survey, the Fourier binning, the integral constraint, and the shot noise on the skewness of the distribution of the power spectrum measurements. Our results demonstrate that the likelihood of the estimated matter power spectrum deviates significantly from a Gaussian assumption on nonlinear scales, particularly at low redshift. This departure is primarily driven by the pentaspectrum contribution, which dominates over the trispectrum at intermediate scales. We also examine the impact of the finiteness of the survey geometry in the context of the Euclid mission and find that both the shape of the survey and the integral constraint amplify the skewness.</description>

      <title>A Strong Gravitational Lensing Model of PSZ2 G118.46+39.32</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first strong gravitational lensing model for the cluster PSZ2 G118.46+39.32 (z = 0.3967) using new NIRCam imaging from the Strong LensIng and Cluster Evolution (SLICE) JWST program. We leverage the broad coverage of the SLICE ultrawide JWST filters to identify new lensed galaxies, some of which are not visible in HST, to model the cluster's mass distribution. The model was constructed with a total of 11 multiply imaged systems, decomposed into 30 images with 60 clumps used as strong lensing constraints. PSZ2 G118.46+39.32 shows a clear bimodal structure, indicating that it may be undergoing a merger. The predicted mass distribution of the model aligns with the X-ray gas in the cluster, suggesting it is in a pre-merger state.</description>

      <title>Galactification: painting galaxies onto dark matter only simulations using a transformer-based model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Connecting the formation and evolution of galaxies to the large-scale structure is crucial for interpreting cosmological observations. While hydrodynamical simulations accurately model the correlated properties of galaxies, they are computationally prohibitive to run over volumes that match modern surveys. We address this by developing a framework to rapidly generate mock galaxy catalogs conditioned on inexpensive dark-matter-only simulations. We present a multi-modal, transformer-based model that takes 3D dark matter density and velocity fields as input, and outputs a corresponding point cloud of galaxies with their physical properties. We demonstrate that our trained model faithfully reproduces a variety of galaxy summary statistics and correctly captures their variation with changes in the underlying cosmological and astrophysical parameters, making it the first accelerated forward model to capture all the relevant galaxy properties, their full spatial distribution, and their conditional dependencies in hydrosimulations.</description>

      <title>Accelerated inference of microlensed gravitational waves with machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) propagating through the universe can be microlensed by stellar and intermediate-mass objects. Lensing induces frequency-dependent amplification of GWs, which can be computed using \texttt{GLoW}, an accurate code suitable for evaluating this factor for generic lens models and arbitrary impact parameters depending on the lens configuration. For parameter inference, we employ the DINGO algorithm, a machine learning framework based on neural posterior estimation, a simulation-based inference method that uses normalizing flows to efficiently approximate posterior distributions of the physical parameters. As a proof-of-principle, we demonstrate that it enables efficient parameter estimation of diffracted GW signals using an isolated point mass lens model. This method can be useful for rapidly identifying microlensed events within large GW catalogs and for conducting population studies of compact binaries. Compared to traditional parameter estimation techniques, we find that combining DINGO with importance sampling can provide efficient estimation of the background Bayes-factor distribution, which is required in evaluating the significance of candidate lensed events. However, for foreground (lensed) events, care must be taken, as sampling efficiency can decrease when the lensed data lie outside the distribution learned by the unlensed DINGO network. Our framework can be naturally extended to more complex and realistic lens models, allowing detailed analyses of the microlensed GWs.</description>

      <title>Dark winds on the horizon: Prospects for detecting neutrino and hot dark matter wakes in large-scale structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the cosmological signatures of neutrino and Hot Dark Matter (HDM) wakes, which refers to the preferential accumulation of neutrinos (or, more broadly, HDM particles) downstream of moving cold dark matter structures. We improve on existing theoretical models, and provide forecasts for the detectability of the effect in future surveys under more realistic conditions than previously considered in the literature. We show that neutrino and HDM wakes are unlikely to be ever observed with the most natural tracer of a hot subcomponent of the total dark matter on cosmological scales, i.e. 2D weak lensing surveys. However, the effect can be detected at a high significance with idealistic 3D maps of a tracer of HDM, for sufficiently small values of the effective free-streaming length (e.g. present-day values of $k_{\textrm{fs},0} \gtrsim 0.1\textrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ to reach $\textrm{SNR} \gtrsim 1$, for a HDM species accounting for a percent of the total dark matter). HDM wakes are a smoking gun of the effects of free-streaming, which cannot be mimicked by changes to the background expansion history (such as allowing for the dark energy to be dynamical), and hence offer another avenue to search for massive neutrinos, and hot subcomponents of the total dark matter more broadly, in a way that complements traditional observables.</description>

      <title>Early Formation of Supermassive Black Holes via Dark Star Gravitational Instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that dark stars, which are dark-matter-powered stars in the early universe, can grow by accretion to masses in the range $\mathscr{O}\left ({10}^4\right )-\mathscr{O}\left ({10}^7\right)\,{M_\odot}$ before the general-relativistic Feynman-Chandrasekhar instability causes their dynamical collapse to black holes. These accreting dark star configurations avoid standard stellar nuclear- and weak-interaction evolution that would lead to their demise long before they reached this supermassive size. Remarkably, this mechanism for supermassive black hole (SMBH) genesis is relatively robust to initial dark star mass, formation epoch, accretion rate and its history. The SMBHs produced this way can serve as seeds for even larger SMBHs $({\gtrsim}10^9\,M_\odot)$ that have been discovered at high redshift.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Impact of Systematic Bias in Type Ia Supernova Cosmology Across Diverse Dark Energy Parametrizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of instrumental and astrophysical systematics on dark energy constraints derived from Type~Ia supernova (SN-Ia) observations. Using simulated datasets consistent with current SN-Ia measurements, we explore how uncertainties in photometric calibration, intergalactic dust, progenitor evolution in luminosity and light-curve stretch, and intrinsic color scatter affect the inferred dark energy equation of state parameters (w0, wa). We test the Generalised Scale Factor (GEN) evolution and benchmark it against three time-evolving dark energy models; namely Chevallier Polarski Linder (CPL), Jassal Bagla Padmanabhan (JBP) and Logarithmic (LOG) parametrizations; comparing their sensitivity to these systematic effects. Calibration biases and progenitor evolution emerge as the dominant sources of uncertainty, while simpler parametrisations, viz. GEN, which directly describes the expansion rate, remains relatively stable under all systematic injections, unlike CPL, JBP and LOG that rely on the dark energy equation of state. These findings underscore the need for sub-per cent calibration precision and enhanced astrophysical modelling to ensure the robustness of dark energy inferences from current and future SN-Ia cosmology experiments.</description>

      <title>Galactic magnetic fields seeded by ultralight dark photons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.07508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we show that ultralight dark photons, which couple to the Standard Model photon through kinetic mixing, can potentially source galactic scale magnetic fields. Although these magnetic fields would be too weak to detect at present in galaxies due to plasma screening effects, we show that dark photons can provide the seed magnetic field strength ($10^{-20}$ G) required for dynamo amplification in galaxies. Such dynamo-amplified magnetic fields are consistent with observations of $\mu$G strength galactic magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Finding the boundary: Using galaxy membership to inform galaxy cluster extent through machine learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.07516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spatial extent of the environment's impact on galaxies marks a transitional region between cluster and field galaxies. We present a data-driven method to identify this region in galaxy clusters with masses $M_{200\rm ,mean}&gt;10^{13} M_{\odot}$ at $z = 0$. Using resolved galaxy samples from the largest simulation volume of IllustrisTNG (TNG300-1), we examine how galaxy properties vary as a function of distance to the closest cluster. We train neural networks to classify galaxies into cluster and field galaxies based on their intrinsic properties. Using this classifier, we present the first quantitative and probabilistic map of the transition region. It is represented as a broad and intrinsically scattered region near cluster outskirts, rather than a sharp physical boundary. This is the physical detection of a mixed population. In order to determine transition regions of different physical processes by training property-specific models, we categorise galaxy properties based on their underlying physics, i.e. gas, stellar, and dynamical. Changes to the dynamical properties dominate the innermost regions of the clusters of all masses. Stellar properties and gas properties, on the other hand, exhibit transitions at similar locations for low mass clusters, yet gas properties have transitions in the outermost regions for high mass clusters. These results have implications for cluster environmental studies in both simulations and observations, particularly in refining the definition of cluster boundaries while considering environmental preprocessing and how galaxies evolve under the effect of the cluster environment.</description>

      <title>Tests of General Relativity with Einstein Telescope</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.07520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational wave signals from compact binary coalescences offer a powerful and reliable probe of General Relativity. To date, the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration has provided stringent consistency tests of General Relativity predictions. In this work, we present forecasts for the accuracy with which General Relativity can be tested using third-generation ground-based interferometers, focusing on Einstein Telescope (ET) and binary black hole mergers. Given the expected high detection rate, performing full Bayesian analyses for each event becomes computationally challenging. To overcome this, we adopt a Fisher matrix approach, simulating parameter estimation in an idealized observation scenario, which allows us to study large populations of compact binary coalescences with feasible computational efforts. Within this framework, we investigate the constraints that ET, in its different configurations, can impose on inspiral post-Newtonian coefficients, by jointly analyzing events using a Bayesian hierarchical methodology. Our results indicate that ET could in principle achieve an accuracy of $\mathcal{O}(10^{-7})$ on the dipole radiation term and $\mathcal{O}(10^{-3})$ on higher-order post-Newtonian coefficients, for both the triangular and the two L-shaped designs, with $10^4$ catalog events. We also assess the number of detections required to confidently identify deviations from General Relativity at various post-Newtonian orders and for different detector configurations.</description>

      <title>Latest results from CUORE and prospects for CUPID</title>

Abstract: The search for neutrinoless double beta decay (0$\nu\beta\beta$) is fundamental for investigating lepton-number violation, probing new physics beyond the Standard Model, and determining whether neutrinos are Majorana particles. CUORE (Cryogenic Underground Observatory of Rare Events), a cryogenic bolometric experiment at LNGS, studies 0$\nu\beta\beta$ in $^{130}$Te using 988 TeO$_2$ crystals. It is a milestone of cryogenic detector arrays with a tonne-scale detector operated for more than 7~years below 15~mK. Since 2017, CUORE has accumulated over 2.9~tonne-years of exposure, achieving one of the leading 0$\nu\beta\beta$ limits and one of the most precise two-neutrino double beta decay (2$\nu\beta\beta$) half-life measurements thanks to a detailed background reconstruction across a broad energy range. Building on CUORE's success, CUPID (CUORE Upgrade with Particle ID) aims to significantly enhance its 0$\nu\beta\beta$ discovery sensitivity to $10^{27}$ yr in $^{100}$Mo, covering the Inverted Hierarchy of neutrino masses. It will employ 1596 lithium molybdate (Li$_2$MoO$_4$) crystals enriched in $^{100}$Mo, alongside 1710 light detectors with Neganov-Trofimov-Luke amplification, enabling simultaneous heat and light readout for enhanced background rejection, particularly against alpha contamination and 2$\nu\beta\beta$ pileup. CUPID will reuse CUORE's cryostat and infrastructure. Current efforts focus on detector performance validation, sensitivity studies, and finalizing the experimental design to maximize physics reach. This work presents the latest CUORE results and outlines the key milestones toward CUPID's realization.</description>

      <title>Cross Calibration of Galaxy Cluster Temperatures Measured with NuSTAR, XMM-Newton, and Chandra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The use of galaxy clusters to constrain cosmology is limited in part due to uncertainties in derived cluster masses, which often depend on the gas temperature. Unfortunately, there exists a longstanding discrepancy in temperature measurements of the same galaxy clusters made by the two most sensitive X-ray observatories, Chandra and XMM-Newton. The NuSTAR X-ray Observatory's greater sensitivity to the exponential turnover in the bremsstrahlung continuum allows for more precise and potentially more accurate galaxy cluster temperature estimates, especially given its unique ability to independently calibrate its optics in orbit. We present new NuSTAR spectra of 10 relaxed clusters ($5~\mathrm{keV} &lt; kT &lt; 10~\mathrm{keV}$), extracted from identical regions as previous spectra from Chandra and XMM-Newton. The 3--20~keV spectra are well fit by single temperature models, and fits done in narrower bandpasses provide no clear evidence in support of the existence of multi temperature gas. We find NuSTAR temperatures are typically $\sim 15\%$ higher than XMM-Newton temperatures. In contrast, good agreement is found between NuSTAR and Chandra temperatures for clusters with $kT \lesssim 7~\mathrm{keV}$, with Chandra measurements exceeding NuSTAR's in hotter systems. When more clusters are included, the trend is reinforced and can be extended to higher temperatures. A generic increase to Chandra's $E &gt; 2~\mathrm{keV}$ effective area ($\sim 5\%$ at 5~keV) is found to explain the trend reasonably well. These results demonstrate the potential for NuSTAR data to address the two-decade-old temperature discrepancy between Chandra and XMM-Newton.</description>

      <title>Detecting Parity-Violating Gravitational Wave Backgrounds with Pulsar Polarization Arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.07956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pulsar timing arrays probe isotropic stochastic gravitational wave (GW) backgrounds in the nanohertz band but are insensitive to its parity-violating component. Motivated by recent progress in pulsar polarization arrays, we study the response of pulsar polarimetry to GWs and evaluate its potential to detect circular polarization in isotropic stochastic GW backgrounds, which characterizes parity violation. Based on geometric optics, we derive the rotation of the polarization of electromagnetic waves induced by propagation through a GW background. We show that the cross-correlation between pulsar timing and polarimetry signals isolates the circular polarization component from the GW intensity, sharing the same Hellings-Downs angular pattern. With future facilities such as the SKA, timing-polarimetry correlations could reach sensitivities to the circular polarization of GWs comparable to those of the current astrometric methods.</description>

      <title>Gravitational-wave dispersion over inhomogeneous space-times: General relativity, screened theories of gravity and non-minimal dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) are direct probes of cosmological gravity, sensitive to space-time inhomogeneities along their propagation. The presence of massive objects breaks homogeneity and isotropy, allowing for new interactions between different GW polarizations, and opening up the intriguing opportunity to test modified gravity theories. This setup generalizes the notion of gravitational deflection and lensing, revealing novel phenomena in modified theories. Any non-minimal theory introduces effective mass terms for GWs, causing \textit{lens-induced dispersion} (LID), a frequency-dependent phase shift on the waveform. We compute GW dispersion in Einstein's general relativity (GR) for a spherical matter distribution, finding a small but non-zero phasing that is potentially accessible to next-generation detectors. We then extend our analysis to scalar-tensor theories, focusing on symmetron gravity as an example of screened theory, combining cosmological deviations and consistency with local gravity tests. We find enhanced GW dispersion in a large region of the symmetron parameter space, compared to both GR and Brans-Dicke theory. We argue that dispersion, associated to an effective mass for the metric fluctuations, can in some cases prevent the propagation of GWs through some astrophysical bodies, turning them into reflectors. Our analysis shows that the Earth becomes an efficient GW shield for a hitherto unconstrained region of the symmetron parameter space, leading to a $\sim 50\%$ fraction of events becoming unobservable or at least displaying a dramatic modification of the detector antenna response. The richness and universality of dispersive phenomena in non-minimal theories open a new avenue to test theories of dynamical dark-energy, relevant in light of recent observational results challenging the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm.</description>

      <title>Earth-orbit bounds on screened dark energy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.08448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We test dark-energy-motivated screening mechanisms with near-Earth space-based measurements. Within a post-Newtonian treatment, we compute leading corrections to three observables, namely geodetic precession (Gravity Probe B), pericenter advance of LAGEOS-2, and Sagnac time delay in a prospective orbital configuration. We then map these corrections to bounds on chameleon, symmetron, and dilaton models. LAGEOS-2 data yield the strongest Earth-orbit limits for symmetron and dilaton models, while a prospective Sagnac setup provides the tightest constraint for chameleons. These results highlight the relevance of low-density, space-based experiments as sensitive probes of screened dark energy and exclude previously allowed regions of parameter space.</description>

      <title>Supermassive Dark Stars and their remnants as a possible solution to three recent cosmic dawn puzzles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) begun to revolutionize our view of the Cosmos. The discovery of Blue Monsters (i.e. ultracompact yet very bright high-z galaxies) and the Little Red Dots (i.e. very compact dustless strong Balmer break cosmic dawn sources) pose significant challenges to pre-JWST era models of the assembly of first stars and galaxies. In addition, JWST data further strengthen the problem posed by the origin of the supermassive black holes that power the most distant quasars observed. Stars powered by Dark Matter annihilation (i.e. Dark Stars) can form out of primordial gas clouds during the cosmic dawn era and subsequently might grow via accretion and become supermassive. In this paper we argue that Supermassive Dark Stars (SMDSs) offer natural solutions to the three puzzles mentioned above. Moreover, we present the best evidence so far, for the existence of SMDSs: the identification of a He~II$\lambda$2511~{\AA} absorption feature at $S/N\sim4$ in the spectrum of JADES-GS-z13-0.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Gravitational Wave Memory : Universal Low-Frequency Background</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.08514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A universal contribution exists in the infrared (low frequency) regime of all gravitational waves, which results from nonlinear memory. Nonlinear memory is sourced by linear order gravitational waves and exists for any gravitational-wave background. We calculate the stochastic nonlinear memory signal of various stochastic backgrounds of cosmological (scalar induced, reheating, phase transition, topological defect, turbulence) and astrophysical (binary mergers of stellar-mass, intermediate mass, supermassive, and primordial black holes) origins. These results allow us to derive the complete frequency spectrum of cosmological and astrophysical SGWB. We calculate how to probe the thermal state of the universe, i.e. the equation of the state, via the memory spectrum's slope and also discuss the detection prospects at various frequency bands with future experiments.</description>

      <title>Metastable Strings and Gravitational Waves in One-Scale Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.08546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metastable cosmic strings provide a minimal and predictive origin for the stochastic gravitational-wave background reported by Pulsar Timing Array experiments. We analyse this possibility in electroweak-like dark sectors with a single-stage breaking $SU(2)\times U(1)\!\to\!U(1)$ driven by one Higgs field. In the regime with dark sector Higgs mass below the $Z'$ mass, and for sufficiently small $W'$ mass, the resulting $Z$-string is classically stable but undergoes quantum decay via nucleation of monopole-antimonopole pairs along the string. We compute the corresponding semiclassical bounce action in a thin-defect approximation, treating both the string core and the monopole endpoints as localised defects whose sizes are small relative to their separation in the tunnelling configuration. This yields a decay rate per unit length that depends on the gauge couplings and the mass hierarchy. We delineate the parameter space in which single-scale dark-sector models reproduce the PTA signal, and verify that the thin-defect approximation remains valid throughout the phenomenologically favoured region, without invoking extended Higgs sectors or multi-stage symmetry breaking.</description>

      <title>Spectral Imaging with QUBIC: building frequency maps from Time-Ordered-Data using Bolometric Interferometry</title>

Abstract: The search for relics from the inflation era in the form of B-mode polarization of the CMB is a major challenge in cosmology. The main obstacle appears to come from the complexity of Galactic foregrounds that need to be removed. Multi-frequency observations are key to mitigating their contamination and mapping primordial fluctuations. We present spectral-imaging, a method to reconstruct sub-frequency maps of the CMB polarization within the instrument's physical bandwidth, a unique feature of Bolometric Interferometry that could be crucial for foreground mitigation as it provides an increased spectral resolution. Our technique uses the frequency evolution of the shape of the Bolometric Interferometer's synthesized beam to reconstruct frequency information from the time domain data. We reconstruct sub-frequency maps using an inverse problem approach based on detailed modeling of the instrument acquisition. We use external data to regularize the convergence of the estimator and account for bandpass mismatch and varying angular resolution. The reconstructed maps are unbiased and allow exploiting the spectral-imaging capacity of QUBIC. Using end-to-end simulations of the QUBIC instrument, we perform a cross-spectra analysis to extract a forecast on the tensor-to-scalar ratio constraint of $\sigma(r)= 0.0225$ after component separation.</description>

Abstract: We provide an accurate forecast of the expected constraining power from the main void statistics -- the void size function and the void-galaxy cross-correlation function -- to be measured by the Roman reference High Latitude Spectroscopic Survey from the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope. Relying on a realistic galaxy mock lightcone, covering 2000 square degrees, we find more than $8\times 10^4 $ voids and explore their constraining power in the framework of three different cosmological models: $\Lambda$CDM, $w$CDM, and $w_0 w_{\rm a}$CDM. This work confirms the strong complementarity of different void statistics and showcases the constraining power to be expected from Roman voids thanks to the combination of its high tracer density and large observed volume.</description>

      <title>Probing Decaying Dark Matter Using the Post-EoR HI 21-cm signal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10755v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose the HI 21-cm power spectrum from the post-reionization epoch as a probe of a cosmological model with decaying dark matter particles. The unstable particles are assumed to undergo a 2-body decay into a massless and massive daughter. We assume that a fraction $f$ of the total dark matter budget to be unstable and quantify the decay using the life time $\Gamma^{-1}$ and the relative mass splitting $\epsilon$ between the parent and the massive daughter. The redshift space anisotropic power spectrum of the post-reionization 21-cm signal brightness temperature, as a tracer of the dark matter clustering, imprints the decaying dark matter model through its effect on background evolution and the suppression of power on small scales. We find that with an idealized futuristic intensity mapping experiment with a SKA1-Mid like radio-array, $\epsilon$ and $\Gamma$ can be measured at $3.37\%$ and $6.86\%$ around their fiducial values of $\epsilon = 0.012$ and $\Gamma = 0.008 {\rm Gyr}^{-1}$ respectively. When only the foreground-free window is considered in the $k-$ space, these percentage errors in $\epsilon$ and $\Gamma$ degrade to $9.91\%$ and $12.03\%$ respectively.The forecasts under identical assumptions for a second, literature-anchored benchmark ($\epsilon=1.14\times10^{-4}$, $\Gamma=1.04\times10^{-3}\,\mathrm{Gyr}^{-1}$) yields projected uncertainties of $6.16\%$ on $\epsilon$ and $8.29\%$ on $\Gamma$ while, restricting to the foreground-free window increases these to $18.77\%$ and $14.22\%$, respectively.</description>

      <title>21-cm Constraints on Dark Matter Annihilation after an Early Matter-Dominated Era</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08719v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although it is commonly assumed that relativistic particles dominate the energy density of the universe quickly after inflation, a variety of well-motivated scenarios predict an early matter-dominated era (EMDE) before the onset of Big Bang nucleosynthesis. Subhorizon dark matter density perturbations grow faster during an EMDE than during a radiation-dominated era, leading to the formation of "microhalos" far earlier than in standard models of structure formation. This enhancement of small-scale structure boosts the dark-matter annihilation rate, which contributes to the heating of the intergalactic medium (IGM). We compute how the dark matter annihilation rate evolves after an EMDE and forecast how well measurements of the 21-cm background can detect dark matter annihilation in cosmologies with EMDEs. We find that future measurements of the global 21-cm signal at a redshift of $z\sim 17$ are unlikely to improve on bounds derived from observations of the isotropic gamma-ray background, but measurements of the 21-cm power spectrum have the potential to detect dark matter annihilation following an EMDE. Moreover, dark matter annihilation and astrophysical X-rays produce distinct heating signatures in the 21-cm power spectrum at redshifts around 14, potentially allowing differentiation between these two IGM heating mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Tantalizing Evidence of Reionization Relics in the eBOSS DR16 Ly$\boldsymbol{\alpha}$ Forest Correlations: a Preference for Early Reionization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09971v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cosmic reionization of HI leaves enduring relics in the post-reionization intergalactic medium, potentially influencing the Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) forest down to redshifts as low as $z \approx 2$, which is the so-called ''memory of reionization'' effect. Here, we re-analyze the baryonic acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements from Ly$\alpha$ absorption and quasar correlations using data from the extended Baryonic Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) Data Release 16 (DR16), incorporating for the first time the memory of reionization in the Ly$\alpha$ forest. Three distinct scenarios of reionization timeline are considered in our analyses. We find that the recovered BAO parameters ($\alpha_\parallel$, $\alpha_\perp$) remain consistent with the original eBOSS DR16 analysis. However, models incorporating reionization relics provide a better fit to the data, with a tantalizing preference for early reionization, consistent with recent findings from the James Webb Space Telescope. Furthermore, the inclusion of reionization relics significantly impacts the non-BAO parameters. For instance, we report deviations of up to $3\sigma$ in the Ly$\alpha$ redshift-space distortion parameter and $\sim7\sigma$ in the linear Ly$\alpha$ bias for the late reionization scenario. Our findings suggest that the eBOSS Ly$\alpha$ data is more accurately described by models that incorporate a broadband enhancement to the Ly$\alpha$ forest power spectrum, highlighting the importance of accounting for reionization relics in cosmological analyses.</description>

      <title>Weak-lensing tunnel voids in simulated light cones: A new pipeline to investigate modified gravity and massive neutrinos signatures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02041v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cosmic voids offer a unique opportunity to explore modified gravity (MG) models. Their low-density nature and vast extent make them especially sensitive to cosmological scenarios of the class $f(R)$, which incorporate screening mechanisms in dense, compact regions. Weak lensing (WL) by voids, in particular, provides a direct probe for testing MG scenarios. While traditional voids are identified from 3D galaxy positions, 2D voids detected in WL maps trace underdense regions along the line of sight and are sensitive to unbiased matter distribution. To investigate this, we developed an efficient pipeline for identifying and analyzing tunnel voids, i.e., underdensities detected in WL maps, specifically in the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the convergence. In this work, we used this pipeline to generate realistic SNR maps from cosmological simulations featuring different $f(R)$ scenarios and massive neutrinos, comparing their effects against the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. Using the convergence maps and the 2D void catalogs, we analyzed various statistics, including the probability density function, angular power spectrum, and void size function. We then focused on the tangential shear profile around 2D voids, demonstrating how the proposed void-finding algorithm maximizes the signal. We showed that MG leads to deeper void shear profiles due to the enhanced evolution of cosmic structures, while massive neutrinos have the opposite effect. Furthermore, we found that parametric functions typically applied to 3D void density profiles are not suitable for deriving the shear profiles of tunnel voids. We, therefore, proposed a new parametric formula that provides an excellent fit to the void shear profiles across different void sizes and cosmological models. Finally, we tested the sensitivity of the free parameters of this new formula to the cosmological model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05235v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The intrinsic alignments (IA) of galaxies, a key contaminant in weak lensing analyses, arise from correlations in galaxy shapes driven by tidal interactions and galaxy formation processes. Accurate IA modeling is essential for robust cosmological inference, but current approaches rely on perturbative methods that break down on nonlinear scales or on expensive simulations. We introduce IAEmu, a neural network-based emulator that predicts the galaxy position-position ($\xi$), position-orientation ($\omega$), and orientation-orientation ($\eta$) correlation functions and their uncertainties using mock catalogs based on the halo occupation distribution (HOD) framework. Compared to simulations, IAEmu achieves ~3% average error for $\xi$ and ~5% for $\omega$, while capturing the stochasticity of $\eta$ without overfitting. The emulator provides both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties, helping identify regions where predictions may be less reliable. We also demonstrate generalization to non-HOD alignment signals by fitting to IllustrisTNG hydrodynamical simulation data. As a fully differentiable neural network, IAEmu enables $\sim$10,000$\times$ speed-ups in mapping HOD parameters to correlation functions on GPUs, compared to CPU-based simulations. This acceleration facilitates inverse modeling via gradient-based sampling, making IAEmu a powerful surrogate model for galaxy bias and IA studies with direct applications to Stage IV weak lensing surveys.</description>

Abstract: The cosmological redshift drift promises to be the first observable directly measuring the evolution of the cosmic expansion rate and should be detectable with upcoming surveys by the Square Kilometre Array and the Extremely Large Telescope. To prepare for these upcoming measurements we study the redshift drift in detail using the relativistic N-body code $\texttt{gevolution}$, focusing on inhomogeneity-induced fluctuations. Using a ray-tracer, we calculate the redshift drift directly from the light cone at two different time steps. To investigate observer-dependent biases we consider 10 different observers. We find that inhomogeneity-induced fluctuations in the redshift drift can in extreme cases be of the same order as the cosmic signal for $z\lesssim0.15$. By comparing our results to first-order perturbation theory, we find that the extreme outliers are due to peculiar motion in over-densities and can be described by first-order perturbation theory to percent precision. We calculate angular power spectra that fit very well with our predictions based on perturbation theory at linear scales and show a surprisingly large non-linear signal. This shows that redshift drift not only has the power to measure the background expansion, but could also deliver information about the velocity and acceleration fields in clusters.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves of quasi-circular, inspiraling black hole binaries in an ultralight vector dark-matter environment</title>

Abstract: The gravitational waves emitted by massive black hole binaries can be affected by a variety of environmental effects, which, if detected, could inform astrophysics and cosmology. We here study how gravitational waves emitted by black holes in quasi-circular orbits are affected by the presence of an ultra-light, vector-field, dark-matter environment that is minimally coupled to the binary. This dark-matter environment induces oscillatory gravitational potentials that perturb the orbit of the binary, leaving an imprint in the binary's binding energy, and thus, on the gravitational waves emitted. We here compute the effect of this environment on the gravitational-wave phase using the stationary-phase approximation within the post-Newtonian formalism. We then perform a Fisher analysis to estimate the detectability of this environmental effect with a four-year LISA observation, focusing on vector fields with ultra-light masses in the $(10^{-19}, 10^{-16}) \; \rm{eV}$ range. We conclude that the observation of such gravitational waves with space-borne interferometers, like LISA, could yield a measurement or constraint on local, vector dark-matter environments, provided the dark-matter density is larger than roughly $10^{14} \rm{M}_\odot/{\rm{pc}}^3$.</description>

      <title>A theoretical prediction for the dipole in nearby distances using cosmography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01095v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cosmography is a widely applied method to infer kinematics of the Universe at small cosmological scales while remaining agnostic about the theory of gravity at play. Usually cosmologists invoke the Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric in cosmographic analyses, however generalised approaches allow for analyses outside of any assumed geometrical model. These methods have great promise to be able to model-independently map the cosmic neighborhood where the Universe has not yet converged to isotropy. In this regime, anisotropies can bias parameter inferences if they are not accounted for, and thus must be included for precision cosmology analyses, even when the principle aim is to infer the background cosmology. In this paper, we develop a method to predict the dipole in luminosity distances that arises due to nearby inhomogeneities. This is the leading-order correction to the standard isotropic distance-redshift law. Within a very broad class of general-relativistic universe models, we provide an interpretation of the dipole in terms of the gradients in expansion rate and density which is free from any underlying background cosmology. We use numerical relativity simulations, with improved initial data methods, alongside fully relativistic ray tracing to test the power of our prediction. We find our prediction accurately captures the dipole signature in our simulations to within ~10% for redshifts $z\lesssim 0.07$ in reasonably smooth simulations. In the presence of more non-linear density fields, we find this reduces to $z\lesssim 0.02$. This represents up to an order of magnitude improvement with respect to what is achieved by naive, local cosmography-based predictions. Our paper thus addresses important issues regarding convergence properties of anisotropic cosmographic series expansions that would otherwise limit their applicability to very narrow redshift ranges.</description>

      <title>Narrowing the discovery space of the cosmological 21-cm signal using multi-wavelength constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13761v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The cosmic 21-cm signal is a promising probe of the early Universe, owing to its sensitivity to the thermal state of the neutral intergalactic medium (IGM) and properties of the first luminous sources. Here, we constrain the 21-cm signal and infer IGM properties using the Population II galaxy parameters derived in a previous study through multi-wavelength synergies. This includes high-redshift UV luminosity functions (UVLFs) from Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), cosmic X-ray and radio backgrounds (CXB and CRB), the SARAS 3 global 21-cm signal non-detection, and HERA 21-cm power spectrum upper limits. From CXB and HERA data, we infer the IGM kinetic temperature to be $T_\text{K}(z=15)\lesssim 7.7~\text{K}$, $2.5~\text{K} \lesssim T_\text{K}(z=10) \lesssim 66~\text{K}$, and $20~\text{K}\lesssim T_\text{K}(z=6) \lesssim 2078~\text{K}$ at 95% credible interval (C.I.). Similarly, CRB and HERA data limit the radio emission efficiency of galaxies, giving $T_\text{rad}(z=15) \lesssim 47~\text{K}$, $T_\text{rad}(z=10)\lesssim 51~\text{K}$, and $T_\text{rad}(z=6)\lesssim 101~\text{K}$. These constraints, strengthened by UVLFs from HST and JWST, enable the first $\textit{lower bound}$ on the cosmic 21-cm signal. We infer an absorption trough of depth ${-201~\text{mK}\lesssim T_\text{21,min} \lesssim -68~\text{mK}}$ at $z_\text{min}\approx10-16$, and a power spectrum of $8.7~\text{mK}^2 &lt; \Delta_{21}^2(z=15) &lt; 197~\text{mK}^2$ at $k=0.35~h\text{Mpc}^{-1}$. Our results highlight the power of multi-wavelength synergies in constraining the early Universe. While promising for upcoming 21-cm experiments, the results depend on our assumption of a redshift-independent X-ray and radio efficiency of galaxies, and the exclusion of a flexible model for Population III stars.</description>

      <title>Tracing correlations between galaxy properties across the Cosmic Web: An IllustrisTNG-based study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11288v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the impact of cosmic web environments on galaxy properties such as $(u-r)\,$colour, stellar mass, star formation rate, and stellar metallicity, using a stellar mass-matched sample of simulated galaxies from the IllustrisTNG simulation. We use Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) to quantify correlations among galaxy properties and apply Student's t-test to assess the statistical significance of their differences across cosmic web environments. In every case, the null hypothesis is rejected at $&gt; 99.99\%$ confidence, providing strong evidence that correlations among galaxy properties are strongly dependent on cosmic web environments.</description>

      <title>Unified dark fluid with null sound speed as an alternative to phantom dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16155v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent BAO measurements from DESI, when combined with CMB and supernovae data, suggest evolving dark energy and in particular point to a possible phantom regime, with an equation of state parameter $w&lt;-1$.
  We explore an alternative phenomenological way to model dark matter and dark energy based on a unified dark fluid (UDF). By construction, our model reproduces the same background expansion history as DESI's best-fit using the CPL parametrization, but assumes a vanishing rest-frame sound speed and no anisotropic stress. This simple prescription ensures a consistent and physical treatment of perturbations and, in our case, the use of a unified dark sector avoids phantom behaviour. We model CMB, LSS, and redshift-space distortion observables, and find mostly small differences with CPL, suggesting that while stage IV CMB and galaxy surveys will be able to test these models, achieving a decisive distinction between them may prove challenging on linear scales. At the non-linear level, we study spherical collapse in the UDF and show that within this framework, structure formation proceeds very similarly to standard scenarios.
  Using Planck, DESI BAO DR2, and DES Y5 supernovae data, we demonstrate that this simple UDF model fits current observations nearly as well as CPL, while treating perturbations consistently. Because most cosmological observations are not sensitive to how the dark sector is split, the unified framework can also approximate the phenomenology of interacting dark energy-dark matter scenarios or evolving dark matter, making it a general way to model the data, at least as long as the dark components have a vanishing sound speed, which is the most distinctive feature of our analysis. Our results highlight that a unified dark fluid with evolving equation of state and null sound speed is sufficient to pass current constraints without invoking a phantom component.</description>

      <title>Searching for Dark Structures: A Comparison of Weak Lensing Convergence Maps and Lensing-Weighted Galaxy Density Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25836v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the result of a comparison between the dark matter distribution inferred from weak gravitational lensing and the observed galaxy distribution to identify dark structures with a high dark matter-to-galaxy density ratio. To do this, we use weak lensing convergence maps from the Dark Energy Survey Year 3 data, and construct corresponding galaxy convergence maps at $z\lesssim1.0$, representing projected galaxy number density fluctuations weighted by lensing efficiency. The two maps show overall agreement. However, we could identify 22 regions where the dark matter density exhibits an excess compared to the galaxy density. After carefully examining the survey depths and proximity to survey boundaries, we select seven of the most probable candidates for dark structures. This sample provides valuable testbeds for further investigations into dark matter mapping. Moreover, our method will be very useful for future studies of dark structures as large-scale weak-lensing surveys become available, such as the $\textit{Euclid}$ mission, the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), and the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope.</description>

      <title>Direct multi-model dark-matter search with gravitational-wave interferometers using data from the first part of the fourth LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observing run</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27022v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational-wave detectors can probe the existence of dark matter with exquisite sensitivity. Here, we perform a search for three kinds of dark matter -- dilatons (spin-0), dark photons (spin-1) and tensor bosons (spin-2) -- using three independent methods on the first part of the most recent data from the fourth observing run of LIGO--Virgo--KAGRA. Each form of dark matter could have interacted with different standard-model particles in the instruments, causing unique differential strains on the interferometers. While we do not find any evidence for a signal, we place the most stringent upper limits to-date on each of these models. For scalars with masses between $[4\times 10^{-14},1.5\times 10^{-13}]$ eV that couple to photons or electrons, our constraints improve upon those from the third observing run by one order of magnitude, with the tightest limit of $\sim 10^{-20}\,\text{GeV}^{-1}$ at a mass of $\sim2\times 10^{-13}\text{ eV}$. For vectors with masses between $[7\times 10^{-13},8.47\times 10^{-12}]$ eV that couple to baryons, our constraints supersede those from MICROSCOPE and E\"ot-Wash by one to two orders of magnitude, reaching a minimum of $\sim 5\times 10^{-24}$ at a mass of $\sim 10^{-12}$ eV. For tensors with masses of $[4\times 10^{-14},8.47\times 10^{-12}]$ eV (the full mass range analyzed) that couple via a Yukawa interaction, our constraints surpass those from fifth-force experiments by four to five orders of magnitude, achieving a limit as low as $\sim 8\times 10^{-9}$ at $\sim2\times 10^{-13}$ eV. Our results show that gravitational-wave interferometers have become frontiers for new physics and laboratories for direct multi-model dark-matter detection.</description>

      <title>Reliable Parameter Inference for the Epoch of Reionization using Balanced Neural Ratio Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02808v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an application of the Balanced Neural Ratio Estimation (BNRE) algorithm to improve the statistical validity of parameter estimates used to characterize the Epoch of Reionization, where the common assumption of a multivariate Gaussian likelihood leads to overconfident and biased posterior distributions. Using a two-parameter model of the Ly$\alpha$ forest autocorrelation function, we show that BNRE yields posterior distributions that are significantly better calibrated than those obtained under the Gaussian likelihood assumption, as verified through the Test of Accuracy with Random Points (TARP) and Simulation-Based Calibration (SBC) diagnostics. These results demonstrate the potential of Simulation-Based Inference (SBI) methods, and in particular BNRE, to provide statistically robust parameter constraints within existing astrophysical modeling frameworks.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Singularity and Power-Law Solutions in Modified Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09714v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A bouncing Universe avoids the big-bang singularity. Using the time-like and null Raychaudhhuri equations, we explore whether the bounce near the big-bang, within a broad spectrum of modified theories of gravity, allows for cosmologically relevant power-law solutions under reasonable physical conditions. Our study shows that certain modified theories of gravity, such as Stelle gravity, do not demonstrate singularity resolution under any reasonable conditions, while others including $f(R)$ gravity and Brans-Dicke theory can demonstrate singularity resolution under suitable conditions. For these theories, we show that the accelerating solution is slightly favoured over ekypyrosis.</description>

      <title>Backlighting extended gas halos around luminous red galaxies: kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect from DESI Y1 x ACT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19870v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The gas density profile around galaxies, shaped by feedback and affecting the galaxy lensing signal, is imprinted on the cosmic microwave background (CMB) by the kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (kSZ). We precisely measure this effect ($S/N\approx 10$) via velocity stacking with more than 800,000 spectroscopically confirmed luminous red galaxies (LRG) from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Y1 survey, which overlap with the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) Data Release 6 temperature maps over $\geq$ 4,000 deg$^2$. We explore the kSZ dependence with various galaxy parameters and find no significant trend with redshift, but clear trends with stellar mass and absolute magnitude in $g$, $r$, and $z$ bands. Our analysis suggests that the gas extends beyond the dark matter halo (99.5\% confidence, i.e. PTE = 0.005). We find a tentative preference for hydrodynamical simulation models with stronger feedback that drives gas further out (Illustris $z=0.5$, PTE = 0.37) over weaker-feedback cases (IllustrisTNG $z=0.8$, PTE = 0.045), though with limited statistical significance. In all cases, a free multiplicative amplitude was fit to the simulated profiles, and further modeling work is required to firm up these conclusions. We find consistency between kSZ profiles around spectroscopic and photometric LRG, with comparable statistical power, thus increasing our confidence in the photometric analysis. Additionally, we present the first kSZ measurement around DESI Y1 bright galaxy sample (BGS) and emission-line galaxies (ELG), whose features match qualitative expectations. Finally, we forecast $S/N \sim 50$ for future stacked kSZ measurements using data from ACT, DESI Y3, and Rubin Observatory. These measurements will serve as an input for galaxy formation models and baryonic uncertainties in galaxy lensing.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Morphology of Galactic Cirrus in Deep Optical Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05217</link>

Abstract: Imaging of optical Galactic cirrus, the spatially resolved form of diffuse Galactic light, provides important insights into the properties of the diffuse interstellar medium (ISM) in the Milky Way. While previous investigations have focused mainly on the intensity characteristics of optical cirrus, their morphological properties remain largely unexplored. In this study, we employ several complementary statistical approaches -- local intensity statistics, angular power spectrum / $\Delta$-variance analysis, and wavelet scattering transform analysis -- to characterize the morphology of cirrus in deep optical imaging data. We place our investigation of optical cirrus into a multi-wavelength context by comparing the morphology of cirrus seen with the Dragonfly Telephoto Array to that seen with space-based facilities working at longer wavelengths (Herschel 250 $\mu m$, WISE 12 $\mu m$, and Planck radiance), as well as with structures seen in the DHIGLS HI column density map. Our statistical methods quantify the similarities and the differences of cirrus morphology in all these datasets. The morphology of cirrus at visible wavelengths resembles that of far-infrared cirrus more closely than that of mid-infrared cirrus; on small scales, anisotropies in the cosmic infrared background and systematics may lead to differences. Across all dust tracers, cirrus morphology can be well described by a power spectrum with a common power-law index $\gamma\sim-2.9$. We demonstrate quantitatively that optical cirrus exhibits filamentary, coherent structures across a broad range of angular scales. Our results offer promising avenues for linking the analysis of coherent structures in optical cirrus to the underlying physical processes in the ISM that shape them. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these morphological signatures can be leveraged to distinguish and disentangle cirrus from extragalactic light.</description>

      <title>No Hiding in the Dark: Cosmological Bounds on Heavy Neutral Leptons with Dark Decay Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12270v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Heavy neutral leptons (HNLs) are well-motivated new physics candidates. The mixing of sub-GeV HNLs with active neutrinos is severely constrained by cosmology. In particular, the success of Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) requires the HNL lifetime to be shorter than about 0.02 sec if they were in thermal equilibrium, thus excluding a wide range of mixing angles accessible to terrestrial experiments. In order to justify the laboratory searches in this cosmologically-forbidden region, it is often argued that adding new dark sector decay modes of HNLs can evade the stringent BBN constraint. Here we rule out this possibility and show that, contrary to the naive expectation, HNLs with significant dark decay modes actually lead to stronger cosmological bounds. This is mainly because of the increase in the extra radiation energy density in the Universe around the BBN epoch, which causes observable effects in the primordial helium fraction and $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$. Our result has major implications for laboratory searches of HNLs.</description>

      <title>Self-resonant dark matter with $Z_4$ gauged symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06728v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new model for two-component scalar dark matter (DM), consisting of two complex scalar fields. In this model, both the DM components are stable due to the remaining $Z_4$ gauge symmetry, which is the remnant of the $U(1)^\prime$ local symmetry. When the resonance condition for DM masses is fulfilled, we show that the elastic co-scattering processes between two components of dark matter ($u$-channel processes) are enhanced due to the Yukawa potential with a small effective mass for the lighter DM mediator, so we can use such co-scattering processes for dark matter to explain the small-scale problems at galaxies. Moreover, there are also semi-annihilation processes that two components of dark matter annihilate into one dark matter particle and a dark photon/Higgs, which are enhanced by the $u$-channel Sommerfeld factor. Focusing on some benchmark models for two-component dark matter satisfying the observed relic density, we obtain the bounds for the dark photon portal couplings from the direct detection for boosted dark matter, which is produced from the semi-annihilation processes at the galactic center.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Schwarzschild solutions in $f(R)$ gravity and their observable effects on the photon sphere of black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00702v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate asymptotic Schwarzschild exterior solutions in the context of modified gravity theories, specifically within the framework of $f(R)$ gravity, where the asymptotic behavior recovers the standard Schwarzschild solution of General Relativity. Unlike previous studies that rely mainly on analytical approximations, our approach combines asymptotic analysis with numerical integration of the underlying differential equations. Using these solutions, we analyze strong lensing effects to obtain the photon sphere radius and the corresponding capture parameter. Considering rings produced by total reflection, we define the photon sphere width as the difference between the first total reflection and the capture parameter; and study how it is modified in the $f(R)$ scenario. Our results show that the photon sphere width increases in the presence of $f(R)$-type modifications, indicating deviations from GR that could be observable in the strong-field regime.</description>

      <title>Radiative Correction from Secret Neutrino Interactions and Implications for Neutrino-Scattering Experiments</title>

Abstract: New, neutrinophilic mediators are one potential extension beyond the Standard Model of particle physics. Often, studies of neutrinophilic mediator consist of searching for direct evidence of its production and/or its tree-level virtual effect for generating strong neutrino self-interaction. In this work, we focus instead on the fact that such new mediators \textit{also} lead to deviations in neutrino-matter scattering via radiative corrections. With a mediator mass well below the electroweak scale, these effects are potentially observable in a variety of contexts, including coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CEvNS), neutrino deeply-inelastic scattering ($\nu$DIS), and neutrino-electron scattering (e.g., at Borexino). Additionally, such effects lead to new contributions to the $Z$-boson decay width and to non-standard neutrino interactions relevant for long-baseline oscillation experiments. We explore all of these scenarios in some depth, building on the rich phenomenology associated with neutrinophilic mediators.</description>

      <title>Warped Dimensions at the Cosmological Collider</title>

Abstract: Extra dimensions are present in many beyond the Standard Model scenarios, most notably in string theory. However, direct signatures of extra dimensions are difficult to observe in many cases. This is the situation, for example, if the energy scales associated with extra dimensions are close to the string or Grand Unification scale. The energetic early universe provides an exciting opportunity to overcome this challenge, since the heavy states associated with high-scale extra dimensions, such as scalar moduli and Kaluza-Klein (KK) gravitons, could have been produced on-shell at early epochs. In this work, we illustrate this by focusing on how such states can be produced during inflation and leave signatures in primordial non-Gaussianity (NG). Specifically, we consider a 5D spacetime with a warped extra dimension that remains stabilized as inflation proceeds in the four non-compact dimensions. By discussing an explicit stabilization mechanism, we compute the masses and couplings of the radion modulus and the KK graviton modes. Being gravitational degrees of freedom, these unavoidably couple to the field(s) generating curvature perturbation, and can lead to observable NG with a distinctive oscillatory shape and characteristic angular dependence. We give example benchmarks which can already be probed by the Planck data and identify targets for the future. Our study shows that cosmological surveys have the potential to observe on-shell imprints of extra dimensions in the coming years.</description>

      <title>Nearly forgotten results in development of physical cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06018v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It would be reasonable to recall some critical issues in physical cosmology development. GR was created by A. Einstein in 1915. In 1917 Einstein proposed the first (static) cosmological model. Soon after the A. Eddington proved that the model is unstable therefore it can not be realizable in nature. In 1922 and 1924 A. A. Friedmann found non-stationary solutions for cosmological equations written in the framework of GR. In 1927 G. Lemaitre obtained very similar results and, in addition, he derived the Hubble law (E. Hubble obtained this law from observations). Unfortunately, G. Lemaitre published his paper in not very popular Belgium journal. In 1931 Lemaitre proposed the first version of hot Universe model (he called it hypothesis of the primeval atom). In his book Lemaitre predicted even a background radiation as a signature of his model.
  One of the important property of the Lemaitre -- Gamow model was a prediction of CMB radiation with a temperature around a few K. It was recalled that the discovery of CMB radiation was done by T. Shmaonov in 1956 and his paper was published in 1957 (several years before Penzias and Wilson).
  In 1965, 1970 E. B. Gliner proposed vacuum like equation of matter which could correspond to exponential explosion of the Universe which was later called inflation. For decades in USSR, Friedmann's cosmological non-stationary models were treated as purely mathematical results without cosmologocal applications. On September 16, 1925 passed away untimely and it would be reasonable to remind today his great contribution in physical cosmology since the authors of book on Friedmann wrote that "similarly to Copernicus who forced the Earth to move Friedmann forced the Universe to expand".</description>
