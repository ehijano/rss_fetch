      <title>Affiliation-based Local Community Detection across Multiple Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-world networks are often constructed from different sources or domains, including various types of entities and diverse relationships between networks, thus forming multi-domain networks. A single network typically fails to capture the complete graph structure and the diverse relationships among multiple networks. Consequently, leveraging multiple networks is crucial for a comprehensive detection of community structures. Most existing local community detection methods discover community structures by integrating information from different views on multi-view networks. However, methods designed for multi-view networks are not suitable for multi-domain networks. Therefore, to mine communities from multiple networks, we propose a Local Algorithm for Multiple networks with node Affiliation, called LAMA, which is suitable for both multi-view and multi-domain networks. The core idea of LAMA is to optimize node affiliations by maximizing the quality of communities within each network while ensuring consistency in community structures across multiple networks. The algorithm iteratively optimizes node affiliations and expands the community outward based on affiliations to detect the community containing the seed node. Experimental results show that LAMA outperforms comparison algorithms on two synthetic datasets and five real datasets.</description>

      <title>Crowd: A Social Network Simulation Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To observe how individual behavior shapes a larger community's actions, agent-based modeling and simulation (ABMS) has been widely adopted by researchers in social sciences, economics, and epidemiology. While simulations can be run on general-purpose ABMS frameworks, these tools are not specifically designed for social networks and, therefore, provide limited features, increasing the effort required for complex simulations. In this paper, we introduce Crowd, a social network simulator that adopts the agent-based modeling methodology to model real-world phenomena within a network environment. Designed to facilitate easy and quick modeling, Crowd supports simulation setup through YAML configuration and enables further customization with user-defined methods. Other features include no-code simulations for diffusion tasks, interactive visualizations, data aggregation, and chart drawing facilities. Designed in Python, Crowd also supports generative agents and connects easily with Python's libraries for data analysis and machine learning. Finally, we include three case studies to illustrate the use of the framework, including generative agents in epidemics, influence maximization, and networked trust games.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Extreme Opinions on Reddit Amidst the 2023 Israeli-Palestinian Conflict</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the dynamics of extreme opinions on social media during the 2023 Israeli-Palestinian conflict, utilising a comprehensive dataset of over 450,000 posts from four Reddit subreddits (r/Palestine, r/Judaism, r/IsraelPalestine, and r/worldnews). A lexicon-based, unsupervised methodology was developed to measure "extreme opinions" by considering factors such as anger, polarity, and subjectivity. The analysis identifies significant peaks in extremism scores that correspond to pivotal real-life events, such as the IDF's bombings of Al Quds Hospital and the Jabalia Refugee Camp, and the end of a ceasefire following a terrorist attack. Additionally, this study explores the distribution and correlation of these scores across different subreddits and over time, providing insights into the propagation of polarised sentiments in response to conflict events. By examining the quantitative effects of each score on extremism and analysing word cloud similarities through Jaccard indices, the research offers a nuanced understanding of the factors driving extreme online opinions. This approach underscores the potential of social media analytics in capturing the complex interplay between real-world events and online discourse, while also highlighting the limitations and challenges of measuring extremism in social media contexts.</description>

      <title>How to Achieve Justice through Big Data: A Study Based on Credit Card Cases in Beijing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the development of intelligence, the combination of big data and judicial practice has become a hot research topic. There are fewer studies on credit card contract disputes related to big data, which makes it difficult to respond to the trend of Big data era. This paper uses the data source of credit card disputes related to the protection of personal information in Beijing from 2022 to 2024, introduces a social network analysis methodology to analyse validated judgements and creates a database. Through the analysis of the relationship network indicators of applicable laws and regulations, it can clearly show the laws and regulations applicable to this type of dispute in China in terms of substantive and procedural matters. This paper provides a methodology for combining big data with judicial trials and assisting judges in trials. The effective use of social networks will help fill the gap in the application of big data in judicial trials. The result and discussion of the paper is also of practical significance for improving the efficiency of judicial adjudication, constructing a database for searching classified cases, constructing a holistic system for digital courts, and finally promoting justice.</description>

      <title>Means of Hitting Times for Random Walks on Graphs: Connections, Computation, and Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For random walks on graph $\mathcal{G}$ with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges, the mean hitting time $H_j$ from a vertex chosen from the stationary distribution to vertex $j$ measures the importance for $j$, while the Kemeny constant $\mathcal{K}$ is the mean hitting time from one vertex to another selected randomly according to the stationary distribution. In this paper, we first establish a connection between the two quantities, representing $\mathcal{K}$ in terms of $H_j$ for all vertices. We then develop an efficient algorithm estimating $H_j$ for all vertices and \(\mathcal{K}\) in nearly linear time of $m$. Moreover, we extend the centrality $H_j$ of a single vertex to $H(S)$ of a vertex set $S$, and establish a link between $H(S)$ and some other quantities. We further study the NP-hard problem of selecting a group $S$ of $k\ll n$ vertices with minimum $H(S)$, whose objective function is monotonic and supermodular. We finally propose two greedy algorithms approximately solving the problem. The former has an approximation factor $(1-\frac{k}{k-1}\frac{1}{e})$ and $O(kn^3)$ running time, while the latter returns a $(1-\frac{k}{k-1}\frac{1}{e}-\epsilon)$-approximation solution in nearly-linear time of $m$, for any parameter $0&lt;\epsilon &lt;1$. Extensive experiment results validate the performance of our algorithms.</description>

      <title>Q-DISCO: Query-Centric Densest Subgraphs in Networks with Opinion Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a network $G=(V,E)$, where each node $v$ is associated with a vector $\boldsymbol{p}_v \in \mathbb{R}^d$ representing its opinion about $d$ different topics, how can we uncover subsets of nodes that not only exhibit exceptionally high density but also possess positively aligned opinions on multiple topics? In this paper we focus on this novel algorithmic question, that is essential in an era where digital social networks are hotbeds of opinion formation and dissemination. We introduce a novel methodology anchored in the well-established densest subgraph problem. We analyze the computational complexity of our formulation, indicating that our problem is NP-hard and eludes practically acceptable approximation guarantees. To navigate these challenges, we design two heuristic algorithms: the first is predicated on the Lagrangian relaxation of our formulation, while the second adopts a peeling algorithm based on the dual of a Linear Programming relaxation. We elucidate the theoretical underpinnings of their performance and validate their utility through empirical evaluation on real-world datasets. Among others, we delve into Twitter datasets we collected concerning timely issues, such as the Ukraine conflict and the discourse surrounding COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, to gauge the effectiveness of our methodology. Our empirical investigations verify that our algorithms are able to extract valuable insights from networks with opinion information.</description>

      <title>GNN Applied to Ego-nets for Friend Suggestions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A major problem of making friend suggestions in social networks is the large size of social graphs, which can have hundreds of millions of people and tens of billions of connections. Classic methods based on heuristics or factorizations are often used to address the difficulties of scaling more complex models. However, the unsupervised nature of these methods can lead to suboptimal results. In this work, we introduce the Generalized Ego-network Friendship Score framework, which makes it possible to use complex supervised models without sacrificing scalability. The main principle of the framework is to reduce the problem of link prediction on a full graph to a series of low-scale tasks on ego-nets with subsequent aggregation of their results. Here, the underlying model takes an ego-net as input and produces a pairwise relevance matrix for its nodes. In addition, we develop the WalkGNN model which is capable of working effectively in the social network domain, where these graph-level link prediction tasks are heterogeneous, dynamic and featureless. To measure the accuracy of this model, we introduce the Ego-VK dataset that serves as an exact representation of the real-world problem that we are addressing. Offline experiments on the dataset show that our model outperforms all baseline methods, and a live A/B test demonstrates the growth of business metrics as a result of utilizing our approach.</description>

      <title>Higher-Order Temporal Network Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.04376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A social interaction (so-called higher-order event/interaction) can be regarded as the activation of the hyperlink among the corresponding individuals. Social interactions can be, thus, represented as higher-order temporal networks, that record the higher-order events occurring at each time step over time. The prediction of higher-order interactions is usually overlooked in traditional temporal network prediction methods, where a higher-order interaction is regarded as a set of pairwise interactions. We propose a memory-based model that predicts the higher-order temporal network (or events) one step ahead, based on the network observed in the past and a baseline utilizing pair-wise temporal network prediction method. In eight real-world networks, we find that our model consistently outperforms the baseline. Importantly, our model reveals how past interactions of the target hyperlink and different types of hyperlinks that overlap with the target hyperlinks contribute to the prediction of the activation of the target link in the future.</description>

      <title>The relevance of higher-order ties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Higher-order networks effectively represent complex systems with group interactions. Existing methods usually overlook the relative contribution of group interactions (hyperlinks) of different sizes to the overall network structure. Yet, this has many important applications, especially when the network has meaningful node labels. In this work, we propose a comprehensive methodology to precisely measure the contribution of different orders to the overall network structure. First, we propose the order contribution measure, which quantifies the contribution of hyperlinks of different orders to the link weights (local scale), number of triangles (mesoscale) and size of the largest connected component (global scale) of the pairwise weighted network. Second, we propose the measure of order relevance, which gives insights in how hyperlinks of different orders contribute to the considered network property. Most interestingly, it enables an assessment of whether this contribution is synergistic or redundant with respect to that of hyperlinks of other orders. Third, to account for labels, we propose a metric of label group balance to assess how hyperlinks of different orders connect label-induced groups of nodes. We applied these metrics to a large-scale board interlock network and scientific collaboration network, in which node labels correspond to geographical location of the nodes. Experiments including a comparison with randomized null models reveal how from the global level perspective, we observe synergistic contributions of orders in the board interlock network, whereas in the collaboration network there is more redundancy. The findings shed new light on social scientific debates on the role of busy directors in global business networks and the connective effects of large author teams in scientific collaboration networks.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Robustness of LLMs on Crisis-Related Microblogs across Events, Information Types, and Linguistic Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The widespread use of microblogging platforms like X (formerly Twitter) during disasters provides real-time information to governments and response authorities. However, the data from these platforms is often noisy, requiring automated methods to filter relevant information. Traditionally, supervised machine learning models have been used, but they lack generalizability. In contrast, Large Language Models (LLMs) show better capabilities in understanding and processing natural language out of the box. This paper provides a detailed analysis of the performance of six well-known LLMs in processing disaster-related social media data from a large-set of real-world events. Our findings indicate that while LLMs, particularly GPT-4o and GPT-4, offer better generalizability across different disasters and information types, most LLMs face challenges in processing flood-related data, show minimal improvement despite the provision of examples (i.e., shots), and struggle to identify critical information categories like urgent requests and needs. Additionally, we examine how various linguistic features affect model performance and highlight LLMs' vulnerabilities against certain features like typos. Lastly, we provide benchmarking results for all events across both zero- and few-shot settings and observe that proprietary models outperform open-source ones in all tasks.</description>

      <title>Sentiment and Hashtag-aware Attentive Deep Neural Network for Multimodal Post Popularity Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social media users articulate their opinions on a broad spectrum of subjects and share their experiences through posts comprising multiple modes of expression, leading to a notable surge in such multimodal content on social media platforms. Nonetheless, accurately forecasting the popularity of these posts presents a considerable challenge. Prevailing methodologies primarily center on the content itself, thereby overlooking the wealth of information encapsulated within alternative modalities such as visual demographics, sentiments conveyed through hashtags and adequately modeling the intricate relationships among hashtags, texts, and accompanying images. This oversight limits the ability to capture emotional connection and audience relevance, significantly influencing post popularity. To address these limitations, we propose a seNtiment and hAshtag-aware attentive deep neuRal netwoRk for multimodAl posT pOpularity pRediction, herein referred to as NARRATOR that extracts visual demographics from faces appearing in images and discerns sentiment from hashtag usage, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing post popularity Moreover, we introduce a hashtag-guided attention mechanism that leverages hashtags as navigational cues, guiding the models focus toward the most pertinent features of textual and visual modalities, thus aligning with target audience interests and broader social media context. Experimental results demonstrate that NARRATOR outperforms existing methods by a significant margin on two real-world datasets. Furthermore, ablation studies underscore the efficacy of integrating visual demographics, sentiment analysis of hashtags, and hashtag-guided attention mechanisms in enhancing the performance of post popularity prediction, thereby facilitating increased audience relevance, emotional engagement, and aesthetic appeal.</description>

      <title>Supervised cooperation on interdependent public goods games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is a challenging task to reach global cooperation among self-interested agents, which often requires sophisticated design or usage of incentives. For example, we may apply supervisors or referees who are able to detect and punish selfishness. As a response, defectors may offer bribes for corrupt referees to remain hidden, hence generating a new conflict among supervisors. By using the interdependent network approach, we model the key element of the coevolution between strategy and judgment. In a game layer, agents play public goods game by using one of the two major strategies of a social dilemma. In a monitoring layer, supervisors follow the strategy change and may alter the income of competitors. Fair referees punish defectors while corrupt referees remain silent for a bribe. Importantly, there is a learning process not only among players but also among referees. Our results suggest that large fines and bribes boost the emergence of cooperation by significantly reducing the phase transition threshold between the pure defection state and the mixed solution where competing strategies coexist. Interestingly, the presence of bribes could be as harmful for defectors as the usage of harsh fines. The explanation of this system behavior is based on a strong correlation between cooperators and fair referees, which is cemented via overlapping clusters in both layers.</description>

      <title>Catch Me If You Can: Finding the Source of Infections in Temporal Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Source detection (SD) is the task of finding the origin of a spreading process in a network. Algorithms for SD help us combat diseases, misinformation, pollution, and more, and have been studied by physicians, physicists, sociologists, and computer scientists. The field has received considerable attention and been analyzed in many settings (e.g., under different models of spreading processes), yet all previous work shares the same assumption that the network the spreading process takes place in has the same structure at every point in time. For example, if we consider how a disease spreads through a population, it is unrealistic to assume that two people can either never or at every time infect each other, rather such an infection is possible precisely when they meet. Therefore, we propose an extended model of SD based on temporal graphs, where each link between two nodes is only present at some time step. Temporal graphs have become a standard model of time-varying graphs, and, recently, researchers have begun to study infection problems (such as influence maximization) on temporal graphs (arXiv:2303.11703, [Gayraud et al., 2015]). We give the first formalization of SD on temporal graphs. For this, we employ the standard SIR model of spreading processes ([Hethcote, 1989]). We give both lower bounds and algorithms for the SD problem in a number of different settings, such as with consistent or dynamic source behavior and on general graphs as well as on trees.</description>

      <title>GNNs-to-MLPs by Teacher Injection and Dirichlet Energy Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are fundamental to graph-based learning and excel in node classification tasks. However, GNNs suffer from scalability issues due to the need for multi-hop data during inference, limiting their use in latency-sensitive applications. Recent studies attempt to distill GNNs into multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) for faster inference. They typically treat GNN and MLP models as single units for distillation, insufficiently utilizing the fine-grained knowledge within GNN layers. In this paper, we propose TINED, a novel method that distills GNNs to MLPs layer-wise through Teacher Injection with fine-tuning and Dirichlet Energy Distillation techniques. We analyze key operations in GNN layers, feature transformation (FT) and graph propagation (GP), and identify that an FT performs the same computation as a fully-connected (FC) layer in MLPs. Thus, we propose directly injecting valuable teacher parameters of an FT in a GNN into an FC layer of the student MLP, assisted by fine-tuning. In TINED, FC layers in an MLP mirror the order of the corresponding FTs and GPs in GNN. We provide a theoretical bound on the approximation of GPs. Moreover, we observe that in a GNN layer, FT and GP operations often have opposing smoothing effects: GP is aggressive, while FT is conservative, in smoothing. Using Dirichlet energy, we design a DE ratio to quantify these smoothing effects and propose Dirichlet Energy Distillation to distill these characteristics from GNN layers to MLP layers. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TINED achieves superior performance over GNNs and state-of-the-art distillation methods under various settings across seven datasets.

      <title>Interplay of epidemic spreading and vaccine uptake under complex social contagion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modeling human behavior is essential to accurately predict epidemic spread, with behaviors like vaccine hesitancy complicating control efforts. While epidemic spread is often treated as a simple contagion, vaccine uptake may follow complex contagion dynamics, where individuals' decisions depend on multiple social contacts. Recently, the concept of complex contagion has received strong theoretical underpinnings thanks to the generalization of spreading phenomena from pairwise to higher-order interactions. Although several potential applications have been suggested, examples of complex contagions motivated by real data remain scarce. Surveys on COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in the US suggest that vaccination attitudes may indeed depend on the vaccination status of social peers, aligning with complex contagion principles. In this work, we examine the interactions between epidemic spread, vaccination, and vaccine uptake attitudes under complex contagion. Using the SIR model with a dynamic, threshold-based vaccination campaign, we simulate scenarios on an age-structured multilayer network informed by US contact data. Our results offer insights into the role of social dynamics in shaping vaccination behavior and epidemic outcomes.</description>

      <title>Hyperparametric Robust and Dynamic Influence Maximization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of robust influence maximization in dynamic diffusion networks. In line with recent works, we consider the scenario where the network can undergo insertion and removal of nodes and edges, in discrete time steps, and the influence weights are determined by the features of the corresponding nodes and a global hyperparameter. Given this, our goal is to find, at every time step, the seed set maximizing the worst-case influence spread across all possible values of the hyperparameter. We propose an approximate solution using multiplicative weight updates and a greedy algorithm, with provable quality guarantees. Our experiments validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed methods.</description>

      <title>Integration vs segregation: network analysis of interdisciplinarity in funded and unfunded research on infectious diseases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03140v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interdisciplinary research fuels innovation. In this paper, we examine the interdisciplinarity of research output driven by funding. Considering 36 major infectious diseases, we model interdisciplinarity through temporal correlation networks based on funded and unfunded research from 1995-2022. Using hierarchical clustering, we identify coherent periods of time or regimes characterised by important research topics like vaccinations or the Zika outbreak. We establish that funded research is less interdisciplinary than unfunded research, but the effect has decreased markedly over time. In terms of network growth, we find a tendency of funded research to focus on readily established connections leading to compartmentalisation and conservatism. In contrast, unfunded research tends to be exploratory and bridge distant knowledge leading to knowledge integration. Our results show that interdisciplinary research on prominent infectious diseases like HIV and tuberculosis tends to have strong bridging effects facilitating global knowledge integration in the network. At the periphery of the network, we observe the emergence of vaccination-related and Zika-related knowledge clusters, both with limited systemic impact. We further show that despite the surge in publications related to COVID-19, its systematic impact on the disease network remains relatively low. Overall, this research provides a generalisable framework to examine the impact of funding in interdisciplinary knowledge creation. It can assist in priority setting, for example with horizon scanning for new and emerging threats to health, such as pandemic planning. Policymakers, funding agencies, and research institutions should consider revamping evaluation systems to reward interdisciplinary work and implement mechanisms that promote and support intelligent risk-taking.</description>

      <title>Disentangled Dynamic Intrusion Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.11079v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Network-based intrusion detection system (NIDS) monitors network traffic for malicious activities, forming the frontline defense against increasing attacks over information infrastructures. Although promising, our quantitative analysis shows that existing methods perform inconsistently in declaring various attacks, and perform poorly in few-shot intrusion detections. We reveal that the underlying cause is entangled distributions of flow features. This motivates us to propose DIDS-MFL, a disentangled intrusion detection method to handle various intrusion detection scenarios. DIDS-MFL involves two key components, respectively: a double Disentanglementbased Intrusion Detection System (DIDS) and a plug-and-play Multi-scale Few-shot Learning-based (MFL) intrusion detection module. Specifically, the proposed DIDS first disentangles traffic features by a non-parameterized optimization, automatically differentiating tens and hundreds of complex features of various attacks. Such differentiated features will be further disentangled to highlight the attack-specific features. Our DIDS additionally uses a novel graph diffusion method that dynamically fuses the network topology in evolving data streams. Furthermore, the proposed MFL involves an alternating optimization framework to address the entangled representations in few-shot traffic threats with rigorous derivation. MFL first captures multiscale information in latent space to distinguish attack-specific information and then optimizes the disentanglement term to highlight the attack-specific information. Finally, MFL fuses and alternately solves them in an end-to-end way. Experiments show the superiority of our proposed DIDS-MFL.

      <title>Stochastic gradient descent-based inference for dynamic network models with attractors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07124v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In Coevolving Latent Space Networks with Attractors (CLSNA) models, nodes in a latent space represent social actors, and edges indicate their dynamic interactions. Attractors are added at the latent level to capture the notion of attractive and repulsive forces between nodes, borrowing from dynamical systems theory. However, CLSNA reliance on MCMC estimation makes scaling difficult, and the requirement for nodes to be present throughout the study period limit practical applications. We address these issues by (i) introducing a Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) parameter estimation method, (ii) developing a novel approach for uncertainty quantification using SGD, and (iii) extending the model to allow nodes to join and leave over time. Simulation results show that our extensions result in little loss of accuracy compared to MCMC, but can scale to much larger networks. We apply our approach to the longitudinal social networks of members of US Congress on the social media platform X. Accounting for node dynamics overcomes selection bias in the network and uncovers uniquely and increasingly repulsive forces within the Republican Party.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09755v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the problem of estimating the order of arrival of the vertices in a random recursive tree. Specifically, we study two fundamental models: the uniform attachment model and the linear preferential attachment model. We propose an order estimator based on the Jordan centrality measure and define a family of risk measures to quantify the quality of the ordering procedure. Moreover, we establish a minimax lower bound for this problem, and prove that the proposed estimator is nearly optimal. Finally, we numerically demonstrate that the proposed estimator outperforms degree-based and spectral ordering procedures.</description>

      <title>Community-Centric Graph Unlearning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09705v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph unlearning technology has become increasingly important since the advent of the `right to be forgotten' and the growing concerns about the privacy and security of artificial intelligence. Graph unlearning aims to quickly eliminate the effects of specific data on graph neural networks (GNNs). However, most existing deterministic graph unlearning frameworks follow a balanced partition-submodel training-aggregation paradigm, resulting in a lack of structural information between subgraph neighborhoods and redundant unlearning parameter calculations. To address this issue, we propose a novel Graph Structure Mapping Unlearning paradigm (GSMU) and a novel method based on it named Community-centric Graph Eraser (CGE). CGE maps community subgraphs to nodes, thereby enabling the reconstruction of a node-level unlearning operation within a reduced mapped graph. CGE makes the exponential reduction of both the amount of training data and the number of unlearning parameters. Extensive experiments conducted on five real-world datasets and three widely used GNN backbones have verified the high performance and efficiency of our CGE method, highlighting its potential in the field of graph unlearning.</description>

      <title>Suicide Risk Assessment on Social Media with Semi-Supervised Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12767v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With social media communities increasingly becoming places where suicidal individuals post and congregate, natural language processing presents an exciting avenue for the development of automated suicide risk assessment systems. However, past efforts suffer from a lack of labeled data and class imbalances within the available labeled data. To accommodate this task's imperfect data landscape, we propose a semi-supervised framework that leverages labeled (n=500) and unlabeled (n=1,500) data and expands upon the self-training algorithm with a novel pseudo-label acquisition process designed to handle imbalanced datasets. To further ensure pseudo-label quality, we manually verify a subset of the pseudo-labeled data that was not predicted unanimously across multiple trials of pseudo-label generation. We test various models to serve as the backbone for this framework, ultimately deciding that RoBERTa performs the best. Ultimately, by leveraging partially validated pseudo-labeled data in addition to ground-truth labeled data, we substantially improve our model's ability to assess suicide risk from social media posts.</description>

      <title>Can Graph Neural Networks Learn Language with Extremely Weak Text Supervision?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08174v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While great success has been achieved in building vision models with Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) over Internet-scale image-text pairs, building transferable Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with CLIP pipeline is challenging because of three fundamental issues: the scarcity of labeled data and text supervision, different levels of downstream tasks, and the conceptual gaps between domains. In this work, to address these issues, we leverage multi-modal prompt learning to effectively adapt pre-trained GNN to downstream tasks and data, given only a few semantically labeled samples, each with extremely weak text supervision. Our new paradigm embeds the graphs directly in the same space as the Large Language Models (LLMs) by learning both graph prompts and text prompts simultaneously. To accomplish this, we improve state-of-the-art graph prompt method, and then propose the first graph-language multi-modal prompt learning approach for exploiting the knowledge in pre-trained models. Notably, due to the insufficient supervision for fine-tuning, in our paradigm, the pre-trained GNN and the LLM are kept frozen, so the learnable parameters are much fewer than fine-tuning any pre-trained model. Through extensive experiments on real-world datasets, we demonstrate the superior performance of our paradigm in few-shot, multi-task-level, and cross-domain settings. Moreover, we build the first CLIP-style zero-shot classification prototype that can generalize GNNs to unseen classes with extremely weak text supervision.</description>
