      <title>A Localized Burst of Relativistic Electrons in Earth's Plasma Sheet: Low- and High-Altitude Signatures During a Substorm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Earth's magnetotail, and the plasma sheet embedded in it, is a highly dynamic region that is coupled to both the solar wind and to the inner magnetosphere. As a consequence of this coupling, the plasma sheet undergoes explosive energy releases in the form of substorms. A substorm is initiated when reconnection is triggered within a thin current sheet, initiating a complex chain of phenomena. One consequence of these phenomena is heating of thermal electrons and acceleration of energetic (non-thermal) electrons. The upper-energy limit as well as the spatial scale size of the electron acceleration regions are ongoing mysteries in magnetotail physics because current missions can only offer us a glimpse into the numerous magnetotail phenomena ranging from electron- to global-scales occurring in this extensive system. Observational difficulties aside, these energetic electrons also provide a significant source of seed electrons for the Van Allen Radiation belts. Here we demonstrate a unique approach to study plasma sheet electron acceleration. We combine Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) Mission high-altitude observations with Electron Losses and Fields Investigation (ELFIN) low-altitude observations, to quantify the upper-energy extent and radial scale of a burst of plasma sheet electrons that mapped to 30 Earth radii. We find that the plasma sheet locally accelerated electrons to 2-3 MeV energies -- far higher than previously anticipated -- and scattered them into the atmospheric loss cone. Interestingly, high-altitude observations of the plasma sheet at 17 Earth radii showed only the usual substorm signatures: bursty bulk flows and dipolarizing flux bundles -- demonstrating that this burst was 1) intense, 2) localized to the far magnetotail, and 3) likely accelerated by a very efficient mechanism.</description>

      <title>Magnetic reconnection-driven energization of protons up to 400 keV at the near-Sun heliospheric current sheet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report observations of direct evidence of energetic protons being accelerated above ~400 keV within the reconnection exhaust of a heliospheric current sheet (HCS) crossing by NASA's Parker Solar Probe (PSP) at a distance of ~16.25 solar radii (Rs) from the Sun. Inside the extended exhaust, both the reconnection-generated plasma jets and the accelerated protons propagated toward the Sun, unambiguously establishing their origin from HCS reconnection sites located beyond PSP. Within the core of the exhaust, PSP detected stably trapped energetic protons up to ~400 keV, which is approximately 1000 times greater than the available magnetic energy per particle. The differential energy spectrum of the accelerated protons behaved as a pure power-law with spectral index of about -5. Supporting simulations using the kglobal model suggest that the trapping and acceleration of protons up to ~400 keV in the reconnection exhaust is likely facilitated by merging magnetic islands with a guide field between ~0.2-0.3 of the reconnecting magnetic field, consistent with the observations. These new results, enabled by PSP's proximity to the Sun, demonstrate that magnetic reconnection in the HCS is a significant new source of energetic particles in the near-Sun solar wind. The discovery of in-situ particle acceleration via magnetic reconnection at the HCS provides valuable insights into this fundamental process which frequently converts the large magnetic field energy density in the near-Sun plasma environment and may be responsible for heating the sun's atmosphere, accelerating the solar wind, and energizing charged particles to extremely high energies in solar flares.</description>

      <title>Three-Dimensional Particle-In-Cell Simulations of Two-Dimensional Bernstein-Greene-Kruskal Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present three-dimensional (3D) Particle-In-Cell (PIC) simulations to study the stability of 2D Bernstein-Greene-Kruskal (BGK) modes in a magnetized plasma with a finite background magnetic field. The simulations were performed using the Plasma Simulation Code (PSC) [Germaschewski et al., J. of Comp. Phys. 318, 305 (2016)], as in our recent study using 2D PIC simulations [McClung et al., Phys. Plasmas 31, 042302 (2024)], in order to see if and how the previous results would change with 3D effects. We found that solutions that are stable (unstable) in 2D simulations are still stable (unstable) in the new 3D simulations. However, the instability develops slower in 3D than in 2D and forms an unstable spiral wave structure that is in-phase along the axial direction. We have also simulated cases with an electron density bump (EDB) at the center, in addition to cases with an electron density hole (EDH) considered in our previous study, and found differences in the unstable spiral wave structures between the two cases. Additionally, we have generalized our simulations to have an increased electron thermal velocity, as well as using initial conditions solved from the complete Vlasov-Maxwell system of equations. We found that these generalizations did not change the overall behavior of the simulations and the instability that evolves.</description>

      <title>Direct Measurements of Synchrotron-Emitting Electrons at Near-Sun Shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15933v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we present the first-ever direct measurements of synchrotron-emitting heliospheric traveling shocks, intercepted by the Parker Solar Probe (PSP) during its close encounters. Given that much of our understanding of powerful astrophysical shocks is derived from synchrotron radiation, these observations by PSP provide an unprecedented opportunity to explore how shocks accelerate relativistic electrons and the conditions under which they emit radiation. The probe's unparalleled capabilities to measure both electromagnetic fields and energetic particles with high precision in the near-Sun environment has allowed us to directly correlate the distribution of relativistic electrons with the resulting photon emissions. Our findings reveal that strong quasi-parallel shocks emit radiation at significantly higher intensities than quasi-perpendicular shocks due to the efficient acceleration of ultra-relativistic electrons. These experimental results are consistent with theory and recent observations of supernova remnant shocks and advance our understanding of shock physics across diverse space environments.</description>
