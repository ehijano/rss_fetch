      <title>Stochastic Modeling of Filtration with Sieving in Graded Pore Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We model filtration of a feed solution, containing both small and large foulant particles, by a membrane filter. The membrane interior is modeled as a network of pores, allowing for the simultaneous adsorption of small particles and sieving of large particles, two fouling mechanisms typically observed during the early stages of commercial filtration applications. In our model, first-principles continuum partial differential equations model transport of the small particles and adsorptive fouling in each pore, while sieving particles are assumed to follow a discrete Poisson arrival process with a biased random walk through the pore network. Our goals are to understand the relative influences of each fouling mode and highlight the effect of their coupling on the performance of filters with a pore-size gradient (specifically, we consider a banded filter with different pore sizes in each band). Our results suggest that, due to the discrete nature of pore blockage, sieving alters qualitatively the rate of the flux decline. Moreover, the difference between sieving particle sizes and the initial pore size (radius) in each band plays a crucial role in indicating the onset and disappearance of sieving-adsorption competition. Lastly, we demonstrate a phase transition in the filter lifetime as the arrival frequency of sieving particles increases.</description>

      <title>Large Wing Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing a generalized aerodynamics prediction machine learning model for finite wings with different airfoil sections is challenging due to the vast parameter space and a relative scarcity of available data. This paper presents the Large Wing Model (LWM), a probabilistic machine learning model designed to predict pressure coefficient ($C_p$) distributions using a small, strictly experimental data set. From its uncertainty-aware $C_p$ predictions, the sectional and total wing lift coefficients ($c_l$, $C_L$) and their confidence intervals are calculated. The LWM features a modified deep kernel learning architecture, building a Gaussian Process model in a 15-dimensional space formed by 14 latent variables and the wing spanwise dimension. It is trained on an open-source database of wind tunnel measurements developed for this work. The Bayesian approach ingests uncertainties associated with experimental measurements and data digitization into the model. The model demonstrates satisfactory extrapolation abilities, enabling predictions on wings with new airfoil sections via the physics-driven prior formed from two-dimensional $C_p$ predicted by the Large Airfoil Model. The model accuracy is assessed for three test cases, rectangular wings with varying airfoil sections and operating conditions. For all test cases, the model performed well; the error in $C_L$ did not exceed 1.7\%. The model effectively captures three-dimensional effects such as those induced by wing tip vortices. Furthermore, constraining the posterior predictive space based on known probabilistic descriptions of lift improves the accuracy of the $C_p$ predictions. As a computationally efficient wing $C_p$ prediction model, the LWM facilitates the rapid exploration of the wing design space.</description>

      <title>Axially strained flow in a porous duct of circular-sector cross-section</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A canonical problem of axially strained flow in a duct of circular-sector cross-section, with fluid injection through the circular arc, is examined for a range of Reynolds numbers and sector angles. At small Reynolds numbers, the flow remains symmetric about the mid-plane; however, symmetry is rapidly lost as the Reynolds number exceeds order one, giving rise to asymmetric structures. These flows are characterised by dominant vortices on one side of the duct and secondary vortices on the other when the Reynolds number is sufficiently large. The interaction between interior vortex structures and boundary layers on porous and impermeable walls governs the separation and attachment of the latter. The axial pressure-gradient coefficient, which also determines the axial strain rate, approaches a constant value at large Reynolds numbers; yet, in contrast to the classical Taylor-Culick result, its value depends sensitively upon duct geometry and flow symmetry. The results underscore the significance of considering partial-wall injection and asymmetric solutions in practical applications.</description>

      <title>Estimation of kinetic dissipation in thermal convection systems based on mechanical energy conservation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the theoretical analysis of convective heat transfer processes, the global kinetic dissipation plays an important role. In this study, we introduce a framework to derive the scaling laws for global kinetic dissipation by establishing its linkage with potential energy conversion. This potential energy-based dissipation relationship provides a rigorous theoretical foundation for characterizing universal global kinetic dissipation scaling. The proposed universal scaling laws successfully reconcile previously divergent results of classical Rayleigh-B\'enard and horizontal convection. Leveraging this framework, we can extend the Grossmann-Lohse (GL) theory to a unified description of thermal convective transport processes. Our study enables unified scaling laws for heat transfer and flow intensity in general confined thermal convection systems including horizontal, vertical, and Rayleigh-B\'enard convection, while accounting for the non-Oberbeck-Boussinesq effect. Remarkably, in horizontal convection with non-monotonic temperature dependence of density, our analysis reveals that a transition in the scaling laws occurs when thermal plumes reach a characteristic height scaling as $\sim H$. Through direct numerical simulations, we quantitatively verify these findings. Our study enhances the theoretical understanding of scaling laws and provides predictive capabilities for buoyancy-driven flows in various boundary conditions, with implications for geophysical and engineering applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study provides exact analytical solutions for both steady-state and pulsatile annular flows in coaxial cylindrical systems. It also examines the effects of a synchronized inner tube high velocity jet and its potential impact on annular blood flow. The presence of such fluid jet significantly enhances the velocity profile and flow rate across the annular section. These models offer valuable insights into optimizing flow performance in potential cardiovascular applications.</description>

      <title>SQG Point Vortex Dynamics with Order Rossby Corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasi-geostrophic flow is an asymptotic theory for flows in rotating systems that are in geostrophic balance to leading order. It is characterized by the conservation of (quasi-geostrophic) potential vorticity and weak vertical flows. Surface quasigeostrophy (SQG) is the special case when the flow is driven by temperature anomalies at a horizontal boundary. The next-order correction to QG, QG+, takes into account ageostrophic effects. We investigate point vortx dynamics in SQG+, building on the work of Weiss. The conservation laws for SQG point vortices that parallel the 2D Euler case no longer exist when ageostrophic effects are included. The trajectories of point vortices are obtained explicitly for the general two-vortex case in SQG and SQG+. For the three-vortex case, exact solutions are found for rigidly rotating and stationary equilibria consisting of regular polygons and collinear configurations. As in the 2D case, only certain collinear vortex configurations are rigid equilibria. Trajectories of passive tracers advected by point vortex systems are studied numerically, in particular their vertical excursions, which are non-zero because of ageostrophic effects. Surface trajectories can manifest local divergence even though the underlying fluid equations are incompressible.</description>

      <title>Improved Analytical Solution for Turbulent Flow in Channel or Pipe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The approximate analytical solution for turbulent flow in a channel was proposed in Fedoseyev (2023). It described the mean turbulent flow velocity as a superposition of parabolic (laminar) and superexponential (turbulent) solutions. The Alexeev Hydrodynamic Equations (AHE), proposed by \cite{Alexeev_1994}, were used as the governing equations to describe turbulent flow. Compared to the Navier-Stokes equations, the AHE include additional terms representing temporal and spatial fluctuations. These additional terms include a timescale multiplier $\tau$, and the AHE reduce to the Navier-Stokes equations in the limit as $\tau \to 0$
  In this study, we propose an improved analytical solution formula that provides better agreement with experimental data at high Reynolds numbers. The maximum discrepancy between the analytical solution and experimental data has been reduced from 5% to 2% for Reynolds numbers of order 100,000, and from 10% to 4% for Reynolds numbers up to 35,000,000, based on comparisons with experimental results ranging from the legacy work of Nikuradse (Prandtl group, 1932) to studies by Wei (1989), Zagarola (1996), van Doorne (2007), and the recent work of Pasch (2023).</description>

      <title>TURB-Scalar. A large database of passive scalar fields advected by 2D Navier-Stokes in the turbulent inverse cascade regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce TURB-Scalar, an open-access database comprising approximately $400$ uncorrelated snapshots of two-dimensional turbulent velocity and passive scalar fields, obtained from the turbulent inverse cascade regime. These data are generated through Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) of the advection-diffusion equation for a passive scalar, $\theta$, with resolution $N=4096$. The database serves as a versatile benchmark for the development and testing of both physics-based and data-driven modeling approaches. The scalar field exhibits intermittent statistics with universal anomalous scaling, making TURB-Scalar a valuable resource for studying turbulent transport phenomena. The database is available at http://smart-turb.roma2.infn.it.</description>

      <title>A Comparison of Instabilities and Dynamic States in Active Filament Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active filaments, such as microtubules with attached cargo-carrying motor proteins, are important dynamic structures for fluid transport in and around living cells. The mathematical models of active filaments appearing in the literature typically involve combinations of follower-forces, compressive tangential forces, along the filament, and an opposite force on the fluid that generates an effective surface flow. In this paper, we present a comparative dynamical systems study of active filament models examining the differences in dynamic states that occur when actuation is through follower forces alone, or the effect of surface flows is also included. We consider cases where actuation is applied only at the filament tip, or distributed uniformly along the filament length. By varying actuation strength, we show that the first bifurcations that provide the transition between the upright, whirling and beating states appear in all models. At higher values of actuation, when beating becomes unstable, however, qualitative differences between the models emerge. Those with distributed actuation produce a single, time-dependent state, which for the surface flow model is reminiscent of a rotating helix that periodically changes handedness and rotation direction. Tip actuation, however, yields complex transitions that ultimately produce a chaotic state. We link the differences in dynamics between tip and distributed actuation to differences in their respective internal stress distributions, differences which appear as early as the first bifurcation where they affect the shapes of the unstable modes.</description>

      <title>Influence of Aspect Ratio and Flow Compressibility on Flow Dynamics in a Confined Cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cavities possess self-sustaining oscillations driven by the interaction of hydrodynamic and acoustic characteristics. These oscillations have applications in fuel-air mixing, heat exchangers, and landing gears, but resonance can damage the structures that house the cavities. Consequently, understanding cavity oscillations under varying geometries and flow conditions is essential for optimizing their benefits while minimizing the adverse effects. The present study investigates flow variations in a supersonic cavity confined by a top wall with a fixed deflection angle of $2.29^\circ$. We examine two aspect ratios of the cavity across freestream Mach numbers from 1.71 to 3 using Large-Eddy Simulations (LES) in OpenFOAM. Numerical Schlieren reveals the key flow structures, while spectral analysis and reduced-order modeling help identify dominant frequency modes and the corresponding flow structures. The results show that the shock from the deflection corner induces high gradients in the flow properties as it impinges on the shear layer. This amplifies the Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instability, which enhances mixing and mitigates the expected increase in oscillation frequency with Mach number. The KH instability develops spatially. Hence, the location of the shock impingement on the shear layer and the distance that the disturbances in the shear layer convect before reaching the cavity wall significantly influence the prominence of the instability, thereby influencing the frequency of cavity oscillations.</description>

      <title>On the Rheology of Two-Dimensional Dilute Emulsions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The single droplet under shear is a foundational problem in fluid mechanics. In computational fluid dynamics, the two-dimensional (2D) formulation offers advantages in both computational efficiency and relevance, yet its theoretical treatment remains relatively underdeveloped. In this brief note, we present an analytical treatment of this problem, beginning with a derivation of the Lamb solution for 2D Stokes flows, which in turn is used to obtain the flow fields around a droplet in a purely extensional flow. Using these flow fields, expressions are obtained for the apparent viscosity, $\mu^*$, of a dilute emulsion as well as a small deformation theory. We show that $\mu^* = \mu( 1 + f(\lambda) \phi) + \mathcal{O}(\phi^2)$ with $f(\lambda) = (2\lambda + 1)/(\lambda + 1)$ where $\lambda$ is the ratio of the droplet viscosity to the matrix viscosity and $\phi$ is the area fraction covered by the suspended phase. Also the steady state value of the Taylor deformation parameter $D_T^\infty$, in the capillarity-dominated regime, obeys $D_T^\infty = g(\lambda)\,\text{Ca}$, where Ca is the capillary number and $g(\lambda) = 1$. This contrasts with the 3D case, where $g(\lambda)$ depends on $\lambda$. These results are then validated through direct numerical simulations across a wide range of viscosity ratios ($0.01 &lt; \lambda &lt; 100$). Our results provide a basic theoretical framework for interpreting 2D droplet simulations and provide clear benchmarks for computational fluid dynamics.</description>

      <title>Modeling wind farm noise emission and propagation: effects of flow layout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study demonstrates how wind farm flow physics influence noise generation and downstream propagation through numerical simulations. The flow field is modeled using large-eddy simulations (LES), and the time-averaged output serves as input to acoustic models that predict wind turbine noise. In the first turbine row, turbulence-induced noise (TIN) and trailing edge noise (TEN) contribute equally, with TIN dominating at low frequencies and TEN at higher frequencies. Downstream, TEN decreases due to lower wind speeds, while TIN mostly persists due to increased turbulence dissipation. These effects are more pronounced in aligned wind farms, where stronger wake interactions occur, than in staggered layouts. However, staggered farms produce more noise overall because turbines operate at higher wind speeds.Additionally, wind farm flow significantly affects sound propagation downwind. The wake superposition modifies sound focusing leading to different amplification area than for an isolated turbine. For a staggered layout it particularly shows enhanced sound focusing downwind due to the position of the turbine wakes. This leads to higher sound levels and higher amplitude modulation downwind for the wind farm compared to an aligned layout. These phenomena are not captured by models based on isolated turbines. These findings underscore the importance of integrating flow and acoustic models to more accurately assess the environmental impact of wind farms.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Forcing Behind Rapid Intensification of Hurricane Lidia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study examines Hurricane Lidia rapid intensification (RI) in the understudied northeastern Pacific, focusing on its interaction with an upper-level trough. Using IFS-ECMWF ensemble forecasts and ERA5 reanalysis, we analyze the large-scale dynamical mechanisms driving Lidias intensification. Results show that the trough played a crucial role in promoting RI by enhancing synoptic-scale ascent, upper-level divergence, and eddy flux convergence. In the higher-intensification ensemble group, stronger Trenberth forcing emerged prior to RI onset, suggesting a causative role in preconditioning the storm environment. This dynamical forcing likely triggered latent heat release, which in turn modified the upper-level potential vorticity structure and contributed to a subsequent reduction in vertical wind shear. In contrast, the lower-intensification group exhibited weaker forcing, higher shear, and a lack of sustained ventilation. These findings highlight the importance of diagnosing early dynamical triggers for RI, particularly in regions where operational access to high-resolution models is limited. This approach provides a cost-effective framework for anticipating RI using ensemble-based diagnostics and could serve as a valuable forecasting tool in data-sparse areas such as the Pacific coast of Mexico. Future studies should combine this large-scale methodology with high-resolution simulations to better capture storm-scale processes and validate multi-scale interactions in RI events.</description>

      <title>Reciprocal theorem for calculating the flow rate of oscillatory channel flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10183v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate the use of the Lorentz reciprocal theorem in obtaining corrections to the steady flow rate due to flow oscillations in straight and nonuniform rigid channels. Starting from the unsteady Stokes equations, we derive the suitable reciprocity relation, assuming all quantities can be expressed as time-harmonic phasors. The auxiliary problem is the steady Hagen--Poiseuille flow solution, from which the reciprocal theorem allows us to calculate the first-order correction in the Womersley number to the steady flow rate. We also consider channels with nonuniform height in the flow-wise direction, in which case the flow-rate correction provides the leading-order effect of the interplay between the oscillations of the fluid flow and the given shape of the channel.</description>

      <title>Insights into the mechanics of pure and bacteria-laden sessile whole blood droplet evaporation</title>

Abstract: We study the mechanics of evaporation and precipitate formation in pure and bacteria-laden sessile whole blood droplets in the context of disease diagnostics. Using experimental and theoretical analysis, we show evaporation process has three stages based on evaporation rate. In the first stage, edge evaporation results in a gelated contact line along the periphery through sol-gel phase transition. The intermediate stage consists of gelated front propagating radially inwards due to capillary flow and droplet height regression in pinned mode, forming a wet-gel phase. We unearthed that the gelation of the entire droplet occurs in the second stage, and the wet-gel formed contains trace amount of water. In the final slowest stage, wet-gel transforms into dry-gel, leading to desiccation-induced stress forming diverse crack patterns in the precipitate. Slow evaporation in the final stage is quantitatively measured using evaporation of trace water and associated transient delamination of the precipitate. Using axisymmetric lubrication approximation, we compute the transient droplet height profile and the erythrocytes concentration for the first two stages of evaporation. We show that the precipitate thickness profile computed from the theoretical analysis conforms to the optical profilometry measurements. We show that the drop evaporation rate and final dried residue pattern do not change appreciably within the parameter variation of the bacterial concentration typically found in bacterial infection of living organisms. However, at exceedingly high bacterial concentrations, the cracks formed in the coronal region deviate from the typical radial cracks found in lower concentrations.</description>

      <title>AeroDiT: Diffusion Transformers for Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes Simulations of Airfoil Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17394v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Real-time and accurate prediction of aerodynamic flow fields around airfoils is crucial for flow control and aerodynamic optimization. However, achieving this remains challenging due to the high computational costs and the non-linear nature of flow physics. Traditional Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) methods face limitations in balancing computational efficiency and accuracy, hindering their application in real-time scenarios. To address these challenges, this study presents AeroDiT, a novel surrogate model that integrates scalable diffusion models with transformer architectures to address these challenges. Trained on Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulation data for high Reynolds-number airfoil flows, AeroDiT accurately captures complex flow patterns while enabling real-time predictions. The model demonstrates impressive performance, with mean relative $L_2$ errors of 0.1, 0.025, and 0.050 for pressure $p$ and velocity components $u_x, u_y$, confirming its reliability. To further enhance physical consistency, we incorporate explicit physics-informed losses based on RANS residuals, including mass and momentum conservation constraints. The transformer-based structure allows for real-time predictions within seconds, enabling efficient aerodynamic simulations. This work underscores the potential of generative machine learning techniques to advance computational fluid dynamics, offering potential solutions to challenges in simulating high-fidelity aerodynamic flows.</description>

      <title>Drop rebound at low Weber number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00902v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the rebound of drops impacting non-wetting substrates at low Weber number $We$ through experiment, direct numerical simulation, and reduced-order modeling. Submillimeter-sized drops are normally impacted onto glass slides coated with a thin viscous film that allows them to rebound without contact line formation. Experiments are performed with various drop viscosities, sizes, and impact velocities, and we directly measure metrics pertinent to spreading, retraction, and rebound using high-speed imaging. We complement experiments with direct numerical simulation and a fully predictive reduced-order model that applies natural geometric and kinematic constraints to simulate the drop shape and dynamics using a spectral method. At low $We$, drop rebound is characterized by a weaker dependence of the coefficient of restitution on $We$ than in the more commonly studied high-$We$ regime, with nearly $We$-independent rebound in the inertio-capillary limit, and an increasing contact time as $We$ decreases. Drops with higher viscosity or size interact with the substrate longer, have a lower coefficient of restitution, and stop bouncing sooner, in good quantitative agreement with our reduced-order model. In the inertio-capillary limit, low $We$ rebound has nearly symmetric spreading and retraction phases and a coefficient of restitution near unity. Increasing $We$ or viscosity breaks this symmetry, coinciding with a drop in the coefficient of restitution and an increased dependence on $We$. Lastly, the maximum drop deformation and spreading are related through energy arguments, providing a comprehensive framework for drop impact and rebound at low $We$.</description>

      <title>Compressibility correction to the k-$\omega$ turbulence model that considers the wall-cooling effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10009v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In supersonic and hypersonic flows, the near-wall density variation due to wall cooling poses a challenge for accurately predicting the near-wall velocity and temperature profiles using classical eddy viscosity turbulence models. Compressible turbulent boundary layers are known to follow the universal wall law via semi-local transformation. However, developing a turbulence model that predicts a velocity profile, which, via semi-local transformation, follows the universal wall law, remains challenging. The current paper builds upon Danis-Durbin's practice of modifying the $\omega$ equation and proposes a simple modification to the $k-\omega$ two-equation model. The formulation of the proposed modification involves dimensional analysis and the proper selection of the local length scale. The newly introduced modification is used to modify the slope of the velocity profile starting from the viscous layer to above. It recovers a semi-local scaling of turbulent kinetic energy, viscosity, and eddy frequency, then achieves a very decent correction of the velocity profile in compressible turbulent channel flows, satisfying the universal wall law after applying Trettel \&amp; Larsson's transformation. The proposed new $k-\omega$ model can also improve the velocity and temperature predictions in strongly wall-cooled zero-pressure-gradient hypersonic turbulent boundary layers, compared to the original $k-\omega$ model. Validation using the favorable and adverse pressure gradient boundary layers suggests that the model does not impose a negative effect on the original $k-\omega$ model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10454v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Starting from the Navier-Stokes equation in the $f$-plane approximation, we provide an exact and explicit solution of the governing equations at leading order for fluid flows in the upper layer of the ocean at mid-latitudes, driven by a wind stress. Such a solution highlights the presence of a mean Ekman current superimposed to trochoidal oscillations and a background geostrophic current.</description>

      <title>Experimental investigation of the flow rate--pressure drop relation of a viscoelastic Boger fluid in a deformable channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10926v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the steady flow-induced deformation between an incompressible non-Newtonian fluid and a three-dimensional (3D) deformable channel. Specifically, we provide a comprehensive experimental--theoretical framework for such flows of constant-viscosity viscoelastic (i.e., Boger) fluids, which allows us to quantify the influence of the fluid's viscoelasticity on the flow rate--pressure drop ($q-\Delta p$) relation. For a flow-rate-controlled regime and weakly viscoelastic flow, we find excellent agreement between the theoretical prediction and experimental results, specifically providing an experimental demonstration of how both wall compliance and fluid viscoelasticity decrease the pressure drop. To definitively demonstrate the coupled effect of wall compliance and fluid viscoelasticity (change of cross-sectional area and curving of streamlines), we perform experiments in an equivalent rigid channel, showing that both the Boger fluid and a viscosity-matched Newtonian fluid have the same pressure drop. Thus, the experimentally verified theory for the $q-\Delta p$ relation of weakly viscoelastic flows of Boger fluids in compliant channels can now be used for the design of microfluidics and soft hydraulic systems operating with complex fluids.</description>
