      <title>On the lower central series of a large family of non-periodic GGS-groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For an odd prime $p$, we determine the lower central series of a large family of non-periodic GGS-groups, which has a density of roughly $(\frac{p-1}{p})^2$ within all GGS-groups. This means a significant extension of the knowledge regarding the lower central series of distinguished classes of branch groups, which to date was basically restricted to the Grigorchuk group. As part of our results, we obtain the indices between consecutive terms of the lower central series, and we show that these groups, as well as their profinite completions, have lower central width equal to $2$. In particular, this confirms a conjecture of Bartholdi, Eick, and Hartung about the generalised Fabrykowski-Gupta groups.</description>

      <title>On Ulam widths of finitely presented infinite simple groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fundamental notion in group theory, which originates in an article of Ulam and von Neumann from $1947$ is uniform simplicity. A group $G$ is said to be $n$-uniformly simple for $n \in \mathbf{N}$ if for every $f,g\in G\setminus \{id\}$, there is a product of no more than $n$ conjugates of $g$ and $g^{-1}$ that equals $f$. Then $G$ is uniformly simple if it is $n$-uniformly simple for some $n \in \mathbf{N}$, and we refer to the smallest such $n$ as the Ulam width, denoted as $\mathcal{R}(G)$. If $G$ is simple but not uniformly simple, one declares $\mathcal{R}(G)=\infty$. In this article, we construct for each $n\in \mathbf{N}$, a finitely presented infinite simple group $G$ such that $n&lt;\mathcal{R}(G)&lt;\infty$. To our knowledge, these are the first such examples among the class of finitely presented infinite simple groups. Moreover, our examples are also of type $F_{\infty}$, which means that they are fundamental groups of aspherical CW complexes with finitely many cells in each dimension. Uniformly simple groups are in particular uniformly perfect: there is an $n\in \mathbf{N}$ such that every element of the group can be expressed as a product of at most $n$ commutators of elements in the group. We also show that the analogous notion of width for uniform perfection is also unbounded for our family of finitely presented infinite simple groups. Finally, since these notions of width are invariants of elementary equivalence, our construction also provides a natural infinite family of pairwise non-elementarily equivalent finitely presented infinite simple groups.</description>

      <title>On The Largest Character Degree And Solvable Subgroups Of Finite Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite group, and $\pi$ be a set of primes. The $\pi$-core $\OO_\pi(G)$ is the unique maximal normal $\pi$-subgroup of $G$, and $b(G)$ is the largest irreducible character degree of $G$. In 2017, Qian and Yang proved that if $H$ is a solvable $\pi$-subgroup of $G$, then $|H\OO_\pi(G)/\OO_\pi(G)|\le b(G)^3$. In this paper, we improve the exponent of $3$ to $3\log_{504}(168)&lt;2.471$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we first give a necessary and sufficient condition for a group $G$ generated by $n$ elements to be a square commutative group and prove $G$ is a square commutative group if and only if $\widehat{G}$ is an abelian group, then we give conditions for a group generated by two elements, with additional conditions, to be a square commutative group.</description>

      <title>Parallel geodesics and minimal stable length of random groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that for any pair of long enough parallel geodesics in a random group $G_\ell(m,d)$ with $m$ generators at density $d&lt;1/6$, there is a van Kampen diagram having only one layer of faces. Using this result, we give an upper bound, depending only on $d$, of the number of pairwise parallel geodesics in $G_\ell(m,d)$ when $d&lt;1/6$. As an application, we show that the minimal stable length of $G_\ell(m,d)$ at $d&lt;1/6$ is exactly $1$.</description>

      <title>Dimension drop in residual chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a description of the Linnell division ring of a countable residually (poly-$\mathbb Z$ virtually nilpotent) (RPVN) group in terms of a generalised Novikov ring, and show that vanishing top-degree cohomology of a finite type group $G$ with coefficients in this Novikov ring implies the existence of a normal subgroup $N \leqslant G$ such that $\mathrm{cd}_{\mathbb Q}(N) &lt; \mathrm{cd}_{\mathbb Q}(G)$ and $G/N$ is poly-$\mathbb Z$ virtually nilpotent.
  As a consequence, we show that if $G$ is an RPVN group of finite type, then its top-degree $\ell^2$-Betti number vanishes if and only if there is a poly-$\mathbb Z$ virtually nilpotent quotient $G/N$ such that $\mathrm{cd}_{\mathbb Q}(N) &lt; \mathrm{cd}_{\mathbb Q}(G)$. In particular, finitely generated RPVN groups of cohomological dimension $2$ are virtually free-by-nilpotent if and only if their second $\ell^2$-Betti number vanishes, and therefore $2$-dimensional RPVN groups with vanishing second $\ell^2$-Betti number are coherent. As another application, we show that if $G$ is a finitely generated parafree group with $\mathrm{cd}(G) = 2$, then $G$ satisfies the Parafree Conjecture if and only if the terms of its lower central series are eventually free. Note that the class of RPVN groups contains all finitely generated RFRS groups and all finitely generated residually torsion-free nilpotent groups.</description>

      <title>Sharpness of proper and cocompact actions on reductive homogeneous spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that if $G$ is a noncompact connected real reductive linear Lie group, then any discrete subgroup of $G$ acting properly discontinuously and cocompactly on some homogeneous space $G/H$ of $G$ is quasi-isometrically embedded and sharp for $G/H$, i.e. satisfies a strong, quantitative form of proper discontinuity. For noncompact reductive $H$, this was known as the Sharpness Conjecture, with applications to spectral analysis on pseudo-Riemannian locally symmetric spaces developed in arXiv:1209.4075. For $G/H$ rational of real corank one, we use sharpness to fully characterize properly discontinuous and cocompact actions on $G/H$ in terms of Anosov representations. This enables us to show that in real corank one, acting properly discontinuously and cocompactly on $G/H$ is an open property, and also to prove that a number of homogeneous spaces do not admit compact quotients, such as $\mathrm{SL}(n+1,\mathbb{K})/\mathrm{SL}(n,\mathbb{K})$ for $n&gt;1$ and $\mathbb{K}=\mathbb{R}$, $\mathbb{C}$, or the quaternions.</description>

      <title>Metric Lie Groups. Carnot-Carath\'eodory spaces from the homogeneous viewpoint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This book explores geometries defined by left-invariant distance functions on Lie groups, with a particular focus on nilpotent groups and Carnot groups equipped with geodesic distances. Geodesic left-invariant metrics are either sub-Riemannian or their generalizations, known as sub-Finsler geometries or Carnot-Carath\'eodory metrics. The primary objective is to illustrate how these non-smooth geometries, together with a Lie group structure, manifest in various mathematical fields, including metric geometry and geometric group theory.
  Additionally, the book demonstrates the role of metric Lie groups, particularly Carnot groups, in the following contexts:
  (a) as asymptotic cones of nilpotent groups;
  (b) as parabolic boundaries of rank-one symmetric spaces and, more broadly, of homogeneous negatively curved Riemannian manifolds;
  (c) as limits of Riemannian manifolds and tangents of sub-Riemannian manifolds.</description>

      <title>Classification of weak Bruhat interval modules of $0$-Hecke algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Weak Bruhat interval modules of the $0$-Hecke algebra in type $A$ provide a uniform approach to studying modules associated with noteworthy families of quasisymmetric functions. Recently this kind of modules were generalized from type $A$ to all Coxeter types. In this paper, we give an equivalent description, in a type-independent manner, when two left weak Bruhat intervals in a Coxeter group are descent-preserving isomorphic. As an application, we classify all left weak Bruhat interval modules of $0$-Hecke algebras up to isomorphism, and thereby answer an open question and resolve in the affirmative a conjecture of Jung, Kim, Lee, and Oh. Additionally, for finite Coxeter groups we show that the set of minimum (or maximum) elements of all left weak Bruhat intervals in each descent-preserving isomorphism class forms an interval under the right weak Bruhat order.</description>

      <title>Hall-Littlewood polynomials, affine Schubert series, and lattice enumeration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce multivariate rational generating series called Hall-Littlewood-Schubert ($\mathsf{HLS}_n$) series. They are defined in terms of polynomials related to Hall-Littlewood polynomials and semistandard Young tableaux. We show that $\mathsf{HLS}_n$ series provide solutions to a range of enumeration problems upon judicious substitutions of their variables. These include the problem to enumerate sublattices of a $p$-adic lattice according to the elementary divisor types of their intersections with the members of a complete flag of reference in the ambient lattice. This is an affine analog of the stratification of Grassmannians by Schubert varieties. Other substitutions of $\mathsf{HLS}_n$ series yield new formulae for Hecke series and $p$-adic integrals associated with symplectic $p$-adic groups, and combinatorially defined quiver representation zeta functions. $\mathsf{HLS}_n$ series are $q$-analogs of Hilbert series of Stanley-Reisner rings associated with posets arising from parabolic quotients of Coxeter groups of type $\mathsf{B}$ with the Bruhat order. Special values of coarsened $\mathsf{HLS}_n$ series yield analogs of the classical Littlewood identity for the generating functions of Schur polynomials.</description>

      <title>Elliptic domains in Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An element $g$ of a Lie group is called stably elliptic if it is contained in the interior of the set $G^e$ of elliptic elements, characterized by the property that $\mathrm{Ad}(g)$ generates a relatively compact subgroup. Stably elliptic elements appear naturally in the geometry of causal symmetric spaces and in representation theory. We characterize stably elliptic elements in terms of the fixed point algebra of $\mathrm{Ad}(g)$ and show that the connected components of the set $G^{se}$ of stably elliptic elements can be described in terms of the Weyl group action on a compactly embedded Cartan subalgebra. In the case of simple hermitian Lie groups we relate stably elliptic elements to maximal invariant cones and the associated subsemigroups. In particular we show that the basic connected component $G^{se}(0)$ can be characterized in terms of the compactness of order intervals and that $G^{se}(0)$ is globally hyperbolic with respect to the induced biinvariant causal structure.</description>

      <title>Relative Cubulation of Small Cancellation Free Products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.03008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.03008v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We expand the class of groups with relatively geometric actions on CAT(0) cube complexes by proving that it is closed under $C'(\frac16)$--small cancellation free products. We build upon a result of Martin and Steenbock who prove an analogous result in the more specialized setting of groups acting properly and cocompactly on CAT(0) cube complexes. Our methods make use of the same blown-up complex of groups to construct a candidate collection of walls. However, rather than arguing geometrically, we show relative cubulation by appealing to a boundary separation criterion and proving that wall stabilizers form a sufficiently rich family of full relatively quasiconvex codimension-one subgroups. The additional flexibility of relatively geometric actions has surprising new applications. In particular, we prove that $C'(\frac16)$--small cancellation free products of residually finite groups are residually finite.</description>

Abstract: We strengthen the results of Boltje and Yilmaz regarding the Galois descent of equivalences of blocks of $p$-nilpotent groups and a result of Kessar and Linckelmann regarding Galois descent of splendid Rickard equivalences for blocks with compatible Galois stabilizers. A more general descent criteria for chain complexes is proven along the way, which requires the adaptation of a theorem of Reiner for chain complexes. This verifies Kessar and Linckelmann's refinement of Brou\'{e}'s abelian defect group conjecture for blocks of $p$-nilpotent groups with abelian Sylow $p$-subgroup.</description>

Abstract: We prove that every topological action of a countable group on a metrizable space can be realized as a bi-Lipschitz action with respect to some compatible metric. This extends a result due to U. Hamenst\"{a}dt regarding finitely generated groups, and our proof is based upon her idea. This also gives a simple proof of a theorem due to Deroin, Kleptsyn and Navas regarding one-manifolds. We also establish an analogous result for closed subgroups of locally compact groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.00921v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop the Wells derivation for extensions realizing affine datum in arbitrary varieties; in particular, we show there is an exact sequence connecting the group of compatible automorphisms determined by the datum and the subgroup of automorphisms of an extension which preserves the extension's kernel. This implies a homomorphism between $2^{\mathrm{nd}}$-cohomology groups which realizes a group of kernel-preserving automorphisms of an extension as itself an extension of a subgroup of compatible automorphisms by the group of derivations of the datum. A refinement of this general Wells's-type theorem is given for a restricted class of varieties with a difference term which include any variety of groups with multiple operators in the sense of Higgins.

Abstract: High-dimensional expanders are a generalization of the notion of expander graphs to simplicial complexes and give rise to a variety of applications in computer science and other fields. We provide a general tool to construct families of bounded degree high-dimensional spectral expanders. Inspired by the work of Kaufman and Oppenheim, we use coset complexes over quotients of Kac-Moody-Steinberg groups of rank $d+1$, $d$-spherical and purely $d$-spherical. We prove that infinite families of such quotients exist provided that the underlying field is of size at least 4 and the Kac-Moody-Steinberg group is 2-spherical, giving rise to new families of bounded degree high-dimensional expanders. In the case the generalized Cartan matrix we consider is affine, we recover the construction of O'Donnell and Pratt from 2022, (and thus also the one of Kaufman and Oppenheim) by considering Chevalley groups as quotients of affine Kac-Moody-Steinberg groups. Moreover, our construction applies to the case where the root system is of type $\tilde{G}_2$, a case that was not covered in earlier works.</description>
