      <title>Non-Asymptotic Analysis of Classical Spectrum Estimators for $L$-mixing Time-series Data with Unknown Means</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spectral estimation is an important tool in time series analysis, with applications including economics, astronomy, and climatology. The asymptotic theory for non-parametric estimation is well-known but the development of non-asymptotic theory is still ongoing. Our recent work obtained the first non-asymptotic error bounds on the Bartlett and Welch methods for $L$-mixing stochastic processes. The class of $L$-mixing processes contains common models in time series analysis, including autoregressive processes and measurements of geometrically ergodic Markov chains. Our prior analysis assumes that the process has zero mean. While zero-mean assumptions are common, real-world time-series data often has unknown, non-zero mean. In this work, we derive non-asymptotic error bounds for both Bartlett and Welch estimators for $L$-mixing time-series data with unknown means. The obtained error bounds are of $O(\frac{1}{\sqrt{k}})$, where $k$ is the number of data segments used in the algorithm, which are tighter than our previous results under the zero-mean assumption.</description>

      <title>Non-parametric cure models through extreme-value tail estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In survival analysis, the estimation of the proportion of subjects who will never experience the event of interest, termed the cure rate, has received considerable attention recently. Its estimation can be a particularly difficult task when follow-up is not sufficient, that is when the censoring mechanism has a smaller support than the distribution of the target data. In the latter case, non-parametric estimators were recently proposed using extreme value methodology, assuming that the distribution of the susceptible population is in the Fr\'echet or Gumbel max-domains of attraction. In this paper, we take the extreme value techniques one step further, to jointly estimate the cure rate and the extreme value index, using probability plotting methodology, and in particular using the full information contained in the top order statistics. In other words, under sufficient or insufficient follow-up, we reconstruct the immune proportion. To this end, a Peaks-over-Threshold approach is proposed under the Gumbel max-domain assumption. Next, the approach is also transferred to more specific models such as Pareto, log-normal and Weibull tail models, allowing to recognize the most important tail characteristics of the susceptible population. We establish the asymptotic behavior of our estimators under regularization. Though simulation studies, our estimators are show to rival and often outperform established models, even when purely considering cure rate estimation. Finally, we provide an application of our method to Norwegian birth registry data.</description>

      <title>Power comparison of sequential testing by betting procedures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive power guarantees of some sequential tests for bounded mean under general alternatives. We focus on testing procedures using nonnegative supermartingales which are anytime valid and consider alternatives which coincide asymptotically with the null (e.g. vanishing mean) while still allowing to reject in finite time. Introducing variance constraints, we show that the alternative can be broaden while keeping power guarantees for certain second-order testing procedures. We also compare different test procedures in multidimensional setting using characteristics of the rejection times. Finally, we extend our analysis to other functionals as well as testing and comparing forecasters. Our results are illustrated with numerical simulations including bounded mean testing and comparison of forecasters.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric spectral density estimation using interactive mechanisms under local differential privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the problem of nonparametric estimation of the spectral density for a centered stationary Gaussian time series under local differential privacy constraints. Specifically, we propose new interactive privacy mechanisms for three tasks: estimating a single covariance coefficient, estimating the spectral density at a fixed frequency, and estimating the entire spectral density function. Our approach achieves faster rates through a two-stage process: we apply first the Laplace mechanism to the truncated value and then use the former privatized sample to gain knowledge on the dependence mechanism in the time series. For spectral densities belonging to H\"older and Sobolev smoothness classes, we demonstrate that our estimators improve upon the non-interactive mechanism of Kroll (2024) for small privacy parameter $\alpha$, since the pointwise rates depend on $n\alpha^2$ instead of $n\alpha^4$. Moreover, we show that the rate $(n\alpha^4)^{-1}$ is optimal for estimating a covariance coefficient with non-interactive mechanisms. However, the $L_2$ rate of our interactive estimator is slower than the pointwise rate. We show how to use these estimators to provide a bona-fide locally differentially private covariance matrix estimator.</description>

      <title>Graphical Models and Efficient Inference Methods for Multivariate Phase Probability Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multivariate phase relationships are important to characterize and understand numerous physical, biological, and chemical systems, from electromagnetic waves to neural oscillations. These systems exhibit complex spatiotemporal dynamics and intricate interdependencies among their constituent elements. While classical models of multivariate phase relationships, such as the wave equation and Kuramoto model, give theoretical models to describe phenomena, the development of statistical tools for hypothesis testing and inference for multivariate phase relationships in complex systems remains limited. This paper introduces a novel probabilistic modeling framework to characterize multivariate phase relationships, with wave-like phenomena serving as a key example. This approach describes spatial patterns and interactions between oscillators through a pairwise exponential family distribution. Building upon the literature of graphical model inference, including methods like Ising models, graphical lasso, and interaction screening, this work bridges the gap between classical wave dynamics and modern statistical approaches. Efficient inference methods are introduced, leveraging the Chow-Liu algorithm for directed tree approximations and interaction screening for general graphical models. Simulated experiments demonstrate the utility of these methods for uncovering wave properties and sparse interaction structures, highlighting their applicability to diverse scientific domains. This framework establishes a new paradigm for statistical modeling of multivariate phase relationships, providing a powerful toolset for exploring the complexity of these systems.</description>

      <title>Causal Models for Growing Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-world networks grow over time; statistical models based on node exchangeability are not appropriate. Instead of constraining the structure of the \textit{distribution} of edges, we propose that the relevant symmetries refer to the \textit{causal structure} between them. We first enumerate the 96 causal directed acyclic graph (DAG) models over pairs of nodes (dyad variables) in a growing network with finite ancestral sets that are invariant to node deletion. We then partition them into 21 classes with ancestral sets that are closed under node marginalization. Several of these classes are remarkably amenable to distributed and asynchronous evaluation. As an example, we highlight a simple model that exhibits flexible power-law degree distributions and emergent phase transitions in sparsity, which we characterize analytically. With few parameters and much conditional independence, our proposed framework provides natural baseline models for causal inference in relational data.</description>

      <title>Marginal Independence and Partial Set Partitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16292v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a bijection between marginal independence models on $n$ random variables and split closed order ideals in the poset of partial set partitions. We also establish that every discrete marginal independence model is toric in cdf coordinates. This generalizes results of Boege, Petrovic, and Sturmfels and Drton and Richardson, and provides a unified framework for discussing marginal independence models. Additionally, we provide an axiomatic characterization of marginal independence and we show that our set of axioms are sound and complete in the set of probability distributions. This follows the work of Geiger, Paz and Pearl who provided an analogous characterization of independence for statements involving 2 sets of random variables.</description>

      <title>Estimating invertible processes in Hilbert spaces, with applications to functional ARMA processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12221v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Invertible processes are central to functional time series analysis, making the estimation of their defining operators a key problem. While asymptotic error bounds have been established for specific ARMA models on $L^2[0,1]$, a general theoretical framework has not yet been considered. This paper fills in this gap by deriving consistent estimators for the operators characterizing the invertible representation of a functional time series with white noise innovations in a general separable Hilbert space. Under mild conditions covering a broad class of functional time series, we establish explicit asymptotic error bounds, with rates determined by operator smoothness and eigenvalue decay. These results further provide consistency-rate estimates for operators in Hilbert space-valued causal linear processes, including functional MA, AR, and ARMA models of arbitrary order.</description>

      <title>ARMAr-LASSO: Mitigating the Impact of Predictor Serial Correlation on the LASSO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09288v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore estimation and forecast accuracy for sparse linear models, focusing on scenarios where both predictors and errors carry serial correlations. We establish a clear link between predictor serial correlation and the performance of the LASSO, showing that even orthogonal or weakly correlated stationary AR processes can lead to significant spurious correlations due to their serial correlations. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach named ARMAr-LASSO ({\em ARMA residuals LASSO}), which applies the LASSO to predictors that have been pre-whitened with ARMA filters and lags of dependent variable. We derive both asymptotic results and oracle inequalities for the ARMAr-LASSO, demonstrating that it effectively reduces estimation errors while also providing an effective forecasting and feature selection strategy. Our findings are supported by extensive simulations and an application to real-world macroeconomic data, which highlight the superior performance of the ARMAr-LASSO for handling sparse linear models in the context of time series.</description>

      <title>Universal Bootstrap for Spectral Statistics: Beyond Gaussian Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20019v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spectral analysis plays a crucial role in high-dimensional statistics, where determining the asymptotic distribution of various spectral statistics remains a challenging task. Due to the difficulties of deriving the analytic form, recent advances have explored data-driven bootstrap methods for this purpose. However, widely used Gaussian approximation-based bootstrap methods, such as the empirical bootstrap and multiplier bootstrap, have been shown to be inconsistent in approximating the distributions of spectral statistics in high-dimensional settings. To address this issue, we propose a universal bootstrap procedure based on the concept of universality from random matrix theory. Our method consistently approximates a broad class of spectral statistics across both high- and ultra-high-dimensional regimes, accommodating scenarios where the dimension-to-sample-size ratio $p/n$ converges to a nonzero constant or diverges to infinity without requiring structural assumptions on the population covariance matrix, such as eigenvalue decay or low effective rank. We showcase this universal bootstrap method for high-dimensional covariance inference. Extensive simulations and a real-world data study support our findings, highlighting the favorable finite sample performance of the proposed universal bootstrap procedure.</description>

      <title>Safety of particle filters: Some results on the time evolution of particle filter estimates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21334v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Particle filters (PFs) is a class of Monte Carlo algorithms that propagate over time a set of $N\in\mathbb{N}$ particles which can be used to estimate, in an online fashion, the sequence of filtering distributions $(\hat{\eta}_t)_{t\geq 1}$ defined by a state-space model. Despite the popularity of PFs, the study of the time evolution of their estimates has only received very little attention in the literature. Denoting by $(\hat{\eta}_t^N)_{t\geq 1}$ the PF estimate of $(\hat{\eta}_t)_{t\geq 1}$ and letting $\kappa\in (0,1)$, in this work we first show that for any number of particles $N$ it holds that, with probability one, we have $\|\hat{\eta}_t^N- \hat{\eta}_t\|\geq \kappa$ for infinitely many $t\geq 1$, with $\|\cdot\|$ a measure of distance between probability distributions. Considering a simple filtering problem we then provide reassuring results concerning the ability of PFs to estimate jointly a finite set $\{\hat{\eta}_t\}_{t=1}^T$ of filtering distributions by studying $\P(\sup_{t\in\{1,\dots,T\}}\|\hat{\eta}_t^{N}-\hat{\eta}_t\|\geq \kappa)$. Finally, on the same toy filtering problem, we prove that sequential quasi-Monte Carlo, a randomized quasi-Monte Carlo version of PF algorithms, offers greater safety guarantees than PFs in the sense that, for this algorithm, it holds that $\lim_{N\rightarrow\infty}\sup_{t\geq 1}\|\hat{\eta}_t^N-\hat{\eta}_t\|=0$ with probability one.</description>

      <title>Optimal E-Values for Exponential Families: the Simple Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19465v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a general condition under which e-variables in the form of a simple-vs.-simple likelihood ratio exist when the null hypothesis is a composite, multivariate exponential family. Such `simple' e-variables are easy to compute and expected-log-optimal with respect to any stopping time. Simple e-variables were previously only known to exist in quite specific settings, but we offer a unifying theorem on their existence for testing exponential families. We start with a simple alternative $Q$ and a regular exponential family null. Together these induce a second exponential family ${\cal Q}$ containing $Q$, with the same sufficient statistic as the null. Our theorem shows that simple e-variables exist whenever the covariance matrices of ${\cal Q}$ and the null are in a certain relation. A prime example in which this relation holds is testing whether a parameter in a linear regression is 0. Other examples include some $k$-sample tests, Gaussian location- and scale tests, and tests for more general classes of natural exponential families. While in all these examples, the implicit composite alternative is also an exponential family, in general this is not required.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19803v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recurrent event time data arise in many studies, including biomedicine, public health, marketing, and social media analysis. High-dimensional recurrent event data involving many event types and observations have become prevalent with advances in information technology. This paper proposes a semiparametric dynamic factor model for the dimension reduction of high-dimensional recurrent event data. The proposed model imposes a low-dimensional structure on the mean intensity functions of the event types while allowing for dependencies. A nearly rate-optimal smoothing-based estimator is proposed. An information criterion that consistently selects the number of factors is also developed. Simulation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of these inference tools. The proposed method is applied to grocery shopping data, for which an interpretable factor structure is obtained.</description>

      <title>Low-Rank Thinning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12063v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The goal in thinning is to summarize a dataset using a small set of representative points. Remarkably, sub-Gaussian thinning algorithms like Kernel Halving and Compress can match the quality of uniform subsampling while substantially reducing the number of summary points. However, existing guarantees cover only a restricted range of distributions and kernel-based quality measures and suffer from pessimistic dimension dependence. To address these deficiencies, we introduce a new low-rank analysis of sub-Gaussian thinning that applies to any distribution and any kernel, guaranteeing high-quality compression whenever the kernel or data matrix is approximately low-rank. To demonstrate the broad applicability of the techniques, we design practical sub-Gaussian thinning approaches that improve upon the best known guarantees for approximating attention in transformers, accelerating stochastic gradient training through reordering, and distinguishing distributions in near-linear time.</description>

Abstract: Unbiased data synthesis is crucial for evaluating causal discovery algorithms in the presence of unobserved confounding, given the scarcity of real-world datasets. A common approach, implicit parameterization, encodes unobserved confounding by modifying the off-diagonal entries of the idiosyncratic covariance matrix while preserving positive definiteness. Within this approach, we identify that state-of-the-art protocols have two distinct issues that hinder unbiased sampling from the complete space of causal models: first, we give a detailed analysis of use of diagonally dominant constructions restricts the spectrum of partial correlation matrices; and second, the restriction of possible graphical structures when sampling bidirected edges, unnecessarily ruling out valid causal models. To address these limitations, we propose an improved explicit modeling approach for unobserved confounding, leveraging block-hierarchical ancestral generation of ground truth causal graphs. Algorithms for converting the ground truth DAG into ancestral graph is provided so that the output of causal discovery algorithms could be compared with. We draw connections between implicit and explicit parameterization, prove that our approach fully covers the space of causal models, including those generated by the implicit parameterization, thus enabling more robust evaluation of methods for causal discovery and inference.</description>

      <title>Lean Formalization of Generalization Error Bound by Rademacher Complexity</title>

Abstract: We formalize the generalization error bound using Rademacher complexity in the Lean 4 theorem prover. Generalization error quantifies the gap between a learning machine's performance on given training data versus unseen test data, and Rademacher complexity serves as an estimate of this error based on the complexity of learning machines, or hypothesis class. Unlike traditional methods such as PAC learning and VC dimension, Rademacher complexity is applicable across diverse machine learning scenarios including deep learning and kernel methods. We formalize key concepts and theorems, including the empirical and population Rademacher complexities, and establish generalization error bounds through formal proofs of McDiarmid's inequality, Hoeffding's lemma, and symmetrization arguments.</description>
