      <title>Quantum geometry and dipolar dynamics in the orbital magneto-electric effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the orbital magneto-electric effect (OME) -- the generation of a steady-state orbital angular momentum density -- is partly the result of a nonequilibrium dipole moment generated via Zitterbewegung and proportional to the quantum metric. For tilted massive Dirac fermions this dipole gives the only contribution to the OME in the insulating case, while the intrinsic and extrinsic OMEs occur for different electric field orientations, yielding an experimental detection method. Our results suggest quantum metric engineering as a route towards maximizing orbital torques.</description>

      <title>Multi-channel second-order topological states in 3D Dirac semimetal Bi$_{0.97}$Sb$_{0.03}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Second-order topological insulating (SOTI) states in three-dimensional materials are helical dissipation-less one-dimensional (1D) hinges, which are of great interest for fundamental physics and potential topological quantum computing. Here, we report the discovery of SOTI states in Bi$_{0.97}$Sb$_{0.03}$ nano-flakes by tuning junction length, flake thickness, and temperature. We identify signatures of higher-order topology from a strong correlation between the fractional Shapiro step, a signature of 4$\pi$-periodic supercurrent, and the presence of the hinge states. Tight-binding simulations confirm the presence of multiple hinge modes, supporting our interpretation of Bi$_{0.97}$Sb$_{0.03}$ as a prototypical SOTI platform with tunable superconducting properties.</description>

      <title>Interplay of quantum and real-space geometry in the anomalous Landau levels of singular flat bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum geometry of electronic state in momentum space, distinct from real-space structural geometry, has attracted increasing interest to shed light on understanding quantum phenomena. An interesting recent study [Nature 584, 59-63 (2020)] has numerically solved a 2-band effective Hamiltonian to show the anomalous Landau level (ALL) spreading $\mathit{\Delta}$ of a singular flat band (SFB), such as hosted in a kagome lattice, in relation to the maximal quantum distance $d$ of the SFB, $\mathit{\Delta}(d)$, which enables a direct measure of quantum geometry. Here, we investigate the ALLs of SFB by studying both the 2-band Hamiltonian and a diatomic kagome lattice hosting two SFBs mirrored by particle-hole symmetry. We derive an exact analytical solution of the 2-band Hamiltonian to show there are two branches of $\mathit{\Delta}(d)$. Strikingly, for the diatomic kagome lattice, $\mathit{\Delta}$ depends on not only $d$ but also $r$, the real-space diatomic distance. As $r$ increases, $\mathit{\Delta}$ shrinks toward zero while $d$ remains intact, which can be intuitively understood from the magnetic-field-induced disruption of destructive interference of the SFB compact localized states. Based on semiclassical theory, we derive rigorously the dependence of $\mathit{\Delta}$ on $r$ that originates from the tuning of the non-Abelian orbital moment of the two SFBs by real-space geometry.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Contrast and Resolution for Electron-beam Lithography on Insulating Substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the effect of ambient gas on the contrast and the resolution of electron beam lithography (EBL) in gaseous environments on insulating substrates. Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) films were exposed in an environmental scanning electron microscope using a 30 keV electron-beam under 1 mbar pressure of helium, water, nitrogen and argon. We found that the choice of ambient gas results in significant variations in contrast, and the clearing dose increases with the gases molecular weight and proton number, consistent with the increase in scattering cross-section. Significantly higher contrast values are obtained for exposure under helium and are accompanied by improved sensitivity. Despite higher sensitivity, helium exhibited the best resolution with 20-nm half-pitch dense lines and spaces. However, water vapor offered a larger process window, particularly on fused silica substrates. We also demonstrate that higher sensitivity results from effective charge dissipation. Thus, for EBL on insulating substrates, helium and water vapor may be desirable choices for charge dissipation depending on the substrate and process conditions.</description>

      <title>The unidirectional Seebeck detection of the N\'{e}el vector in the two-dimensional tetragonal $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric antiferromagnetic materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The efficient detection of the reversal (180$^{\circ}$ rotation) of the N\'{e}el vector is one of the crucial tasks in antiferromagnetic spintronics. Here, we propose a thermal approach to detect the reversal of the N\'{e}el vector in the tetragonal $\mathcal{PT}$ antiferromagnetic materials through the unidirectional Seebeck effect (USE). Being different from the previous works in which USE stems from the global Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) or asymmetric magnon scattering, we find that the USE originates from the coupling of the hidden Rashba SOC and the N\'{e}el vector in the tetragonal $\mathcal{PT}$ antiferromagnetic materials in the absence of the global Rashba SOC. Using a generic minimal model, we analyse the behaviors of the USE for the two-dimensional tetragonal lattice $\mathcal{PT}$ antiferromagnet. Importantly, It's found that when the N\'{e}el vector is reversed, the sign of the USE changes, which can be utilized to detect the reversal of the N\'{e}el vector.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Patterned Fluorescence from Polystyrene through Focused Electron Beam Irradiation under Various Gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on a novel method for tuning and enhancing fluorescence from irradiated polystyrene through electron-beam exposure in gaseous environments. We describe the effect of electron dose and ambient gas on the photoluminescence spectra and yield of irradiated PS films on insulating and conductive substrates. PS films were exposed in an environmental scanning electron microscope using a 20 keV electron beam, ambient gas pressures from high vacuum to 3 mbar, and electron doses from 1.8 to 45 mC cm-2. Irradiated PS films were characterized using confocal microscopy, TEM, EDS and FTIR spectroscopy. From emission spectra collected using confocal microscopy we found that the emission wavelength and photon yield of the irradiated film can be tuned by both dose and gas pressure. The emission wavelength blue-shifts with increasing pressure and red-shifts with increasing dose enabling an overall tuning range of 451 - 544 nm. Significant enhancement in the PL intensity, up to 18 times on sapphire substrates under helium when compared to high vacuum, are observed. Overall, the highest PL yield is observed on soda lime glass substrates under argon. Also, the photon-yield on conductive substrates is significantly smaller than that yield from insulating substrates. TEM images revealed e-beam irradiated PS is amorphous in nature and elemental mapping EDS revealed no signs of film oxidation. FTIR spectroscopy revealed that under gaseous environments the decay of aromatic and aliphatic C-H stretches is reduced compared to the high vacuum exposure; in all cases, features associated with the phenyl rings are preserved. Localized e-beam synthesis of fluorophores in PS can be controlled by both dose and by ambient gas pressure. This technique could enable new approaches to photonics where fluorophores with tunable emission properties can be locally introduced by e-beam patterning.</description>

      <title>Photocurrent generation from spin dynamics in antiferromagnetic Dirac semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using real-time simulations, we explore the photocurrent induced by localized spin dynamics in antiferromagnetic Dirac semimetals. These materials exhibit strong spin-charge coupling because the energy scales of the electronic and spin systems are of the same order. The photocurrent response exhibits a pronounced peak reflecting the presence of the Dirac point at the resonance frequency of the localized spin system. This contribution plays a crucial role in the photocurrent generation when the electronic filling is set around the Dirac nodes in the Dirac semimetal. We also reveal that the photocurrent response exhibits a low-frequency divergence due to the modulation of the resonance frequency of the localized spin system. Our findings clarify that the photocurrent response arising from the spin dynamics reflects the band topology of the Dirac semimetals, and the localized spin dynamics plays an important role in the photocurrent generation.</description>

      <title>Quasi-bound layer breathing phonons inside perfect dislocations of lattice-relaxed twisted bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using multiscale modelling we investigate layer breathing phonons in MX$_2$ bilayers (M=Mo,W; X=S,Se) containing dislocations specific for lattice-relaxed moir\'e superlattices. Spatial modulation of interlayer distance, caused by the dislocations, generates effective potentials that promote emergence of one-dimensional quasi-bound bands of layer breathing modes inside perfect dislocations forming in the bilayers with parallel and antiparallel alignment of layers. We show that for parallel MX$_2$ bilayers perfect dislocations host several quasi-bound bands, with frequencies above layer breathing mode in rhombohedral-stacked domains, whereas for antiparallel bilayers only a single quasi-bound band arises near the edge dislocation type, having frequencies above the layer breathing mode in 2H-stacked domains.</description>

      <title>Synthesis and characterization of a $\pi$-extended Clar's goblet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Concealed non-Kekul\'e polybenzenoid hydrocarbons have no sublattice imbalance yet cannot be assigned a classical Kekul\'e structure, leading to an open-shell ground state with potential application in organic spintronics. They constitute an exceedingly small fraction of the total number of polybenzenoid hydrocarbons that can be constructed for a given number of benzenoid rings, and their synthesis remains challenging. The archetype of such a system is Clar's goblet (C$_{38}$H$_{18}$), a diradical proposed by Erich Clar in 1972 and recently synthesized on a Au(111) surface. Here, we report the synthesis of a pi-extended Clar's goblet (C$_{76}$H$_{26}$), a tetraradical concealed non-Kekul\'e polybenzenoid hydrocarbon, by a combined in-solution and on-surface synthetic approach. By means of low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and atomic force microscopy, we characterized individual molecules adsorbed on a Cu(111) surface. We provide insights into the electronic properties of this elusive molecule, including the many-body nature of its ground and excited states, by mean-field and multiconfigurational quantum chemistry calculations.</description>

      <title>Defect-Bound Excitons in Topological Materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Excitons, bound states of electrons and holes, are affected by the properties of the underlying band structure of a material. Defects in lattice systems may trap electronic defect states, to which an electron can be excited to form defect-bound excitons. Here, we examine the effect of band topology on excitons in systems with a single-site defect. We show that in the topological phase, when robust, in-gap, ring-shaped electronic states appear around defects, excitons inherit the properties of these ring states: The excitons' binding energies are lowered as a result of the wide spatial profile of the defect state, and their wave functions have complex shapes and order due to the mixed orbital character of the topological bands. Our study advances the understanding of the role of topology in modifying and controlling defect-bound excitons in quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Density of States Proportion on Charge Transfer Kinetics in Breathing Fermionic Systems of Molecules and Materials: A Perspective of Entropy-Ruled Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conceptualization, theory, method developments and implementations are always of great importance and an interesting task to explore a new dimension in science and technology, which is highly solicited for various functional-driven potential applications (e.g., electronic devices, charge storage devices). Numerous experimental and theoretical studies urge the necessity of a new theory or method to quantify the exact value of charge transport (CT) calculations (e.g., mobility and conductivity) through the appropriate process and methods. With this motivation, the entropy-ruled charge dynamics method has been recently proposed, which unifies band and hopping transport mechanism via quantum-classical transition analogy. Here, the energy (in terms of chemical potential) scaled entropy has a direct proportion with the density of states (DOS); and hence it is termed as DOS proportion. This proportion principally acts as a key descriptor for charge transport calculations in both molecular and materials systems, which is directly connected with all CT quantities like mobility, conductivity, current density etc. This perspective explains a unique nature of entropy-ruled method for the entire transport range from delocalized band to localization (or hopping) transport. The validity and limitations of Einstein relation and Boltzmann approach are discussed with different limits and physical conditions for disordered molecules and periodic systems. Finally, the futuristic scope and expected progress is addressed for correlated electron dynamical systems and devices. It is well-noted that the new DOS proportion and related entropy-ruled transport formalism are fundamentally more important for nurturing semiconducting science and technology towards a new era.</description>

      <title>Robust quantum anomalous Hall effect with spatially uncorrelated disorder</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In magnetic topological insulators, a phase transition between quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) and Anderson localization insulating phases can be triggered by the rotation of an applied magnetic field. Without the scattering paths along magnetic domains, this phase transition is governed by scattering induced by nonmagnetic disorder. We show that the QAH phase is strikingly robust in the presence of spatially uncorrelated disorder. The robustness is attributed to a resilience of the topological band gap against disorder, induced by quantum confinement. The critical behavior near the phase transition suggests that the scattering is distinct from quantum percolation. This provides new insights on the robustness of the QAH effect in magnetic topological insulators with atomic defects, impurities, and dopants.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Waveguide quantum electrodynamics (QED) studies the interaction between quantum emitters and guided photons in one-dimension. When the waveguide hosts interacting photons, it becomes a platform to explore many-body quantum optics. However, the influence of photonic correlations on emitter dynamics remains poorly understood. In this work, we study the collective decay and coherent interactions of quantum emitters coupled to a one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard waveguide, an array of coupled photonic modes with repulsive on-site interactions that supports superfluid and Mott insulating phases. We show that photon-photon interactions alone can trigger a superradiant burst, independent of emitter spacing and transition frequency. In the off-resonant regime, emitters exhibit two distinct types of mediated interactions: delocalized superfluid excitations yield distance-independent couplings, while Mott-insulator quasiparticles generate short-range interactions mediated by doublons and holons. Our work bridges many-body physics and waveguide QED, revealing how photonic many-body states shape emitter dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chiral graviton modes are elusive excitations arising from the hidden quantum geometry of fractional quantum Hall states. It remains unclear, however, whether this picture extends to lattice models, where continuum translations are broken and additional quasiparticle decay channels arise. We present a framework in which we explicitly derive a field theory incorporating lattice chiral graviton operators within the paradigmatic bosonic Harper-Hofstadter model. Extensive numerical evidence suggests that chiral graviton modes persist away from the continuum, and are well captured by the proposed lattice operators. We identify geometric quenches as a viable experimental probe, paving the way for the exploration of chiral gravitons in near-term quantum simulation experiments.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast dynamics of atomic correlated disordering in photoinduced VO$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent experiments suggest that atomic disordering dynamics are more universal than conventional coherent processes in photoinduced phase transitions (PIPTs), yet its mechanism remains unclear. Using real-time time-dependent density functional theory (rt-TDDFT), we find that, at lower photoexcitation, higher lattice temperature accelerates atomic disordering, which thereby lowers the threshold for phase transition, by thermally exciting more phonons to randomize the lattice vibrations in VO$_2$. Above this threshold, however, we observe that the transition timescale and atomic disordering become temperature-independent since thermally excited lattice vibrations induce a similar evolution of photoexcited holes. Additionally, we show that photoexcitation initially elongates the V-V dimers followed by a rotation with tangential displacements (along the z-axis) mediated by O atoms, resulting in strongly correlated motion along the z-axis. Consequently, atomic disordering is more dominant along the x direction, attributed to the relatively unrestricted motion of V-V dimers along this direction. The motion of V atoms along the z-axis is more constrained, leading to less disorder along the z-axis, which results in a "correlated disorder" phenomenon. This anisotropic disordering in VO$_2$ offers new insights into PIPTs mechanisms, guiding future studies on photoinduced disordered transitions.</description>

      <title>Scaling of Quantum Geometry Near the Non-Hermitian Topological Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The geometry of quantum states can be an indicator of criticality, yet it remains less explored under non-Hermitian topological conditions. In this work, we unveil diverse scalings of the quantum geometry over the ground state manifold close to different topological phase transitions in a non-Hermitian long-range extension of the Kitaev chain. The derivative of the geometric phase, as well as its scaling behavior, shows that systems with different long-range couplings can belong to distinct universality classes. Near certain criticalities, we further find that the Wannier state correlation function associated with extended Berry connection of the ground state exhibits spatially anomalous behaviors. Finally, we analyze the scaling of the quantum geometric tensor near phase transitions across exceptional points, shedding light on the emergence of novel universality classes.</description>

      <title>Proximity Induced Non-collinear Magnetic States in Planar Superconductor/Ferromagnet Hybrids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The proximity induced superconducting (S) correlations in ferromagnetic (F) layers of planar S/F hybrids are shown to be responsible for the appearance of a nonlinear interaction between the magnetic moments of the F layers. This interaction originates from the combined influence of the orbital and exchange phenomena and can result in the spontaneous formation of non-collinear magnetic states in these systems. The proposed nonlinear coupling mechanism and resulting changes of magnetic textures are crucial for the design of the superconducting spintronics devices exploiting the long-range spin triplet proximity effect.</description>

      <title>Effective Field Theory of Superconductivity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03370v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A field theory of a Schr\"{o}dinger type complex scalar field of Cooper pair, a U(1) gauge field of electromagnetism, and a neutral scalar field of gapless acoustic phonon is proposed for superconductivity of s-waves. Presence of the gapless neutral scalar field is justified as low energy residual acoustic phonon degrees in the context of effective field theory. The critical coupling of quartic self-interaction of complex scalar field is computed from a 1-loop level interaction balance between the repulsion mediated by massive degree of the U(1) gauge field and the attraction mediated by massive Higgs degree, in the static limit. The obtained net attraction or repulsion in perturbative regime matches the type I or II superconductivity, respectively. We find the new critical coupling of cubic Yukawa type interaction between the neutral and complex scalar fields from another tree level interaction balance between the Coulomb repulsion mediated by massless degree of the U(1) gauge field and the attraction mediated by the gapless neutral scalar field, in the static limit. Superconducting phase is realized at or in the vicinity of this critical coupling. A huge discrepancy between the propagation speeds of photon and phonon gives a plausible explanation on low critical temperatures in conventional superconductors.</description>

      <title>Generalized Epsilon-Near-Zero Polaritons on Uniaxial Metasurfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) thin films facilitate strong light-matter interactions with a widespread impact in nonlinear, quantum and thermal photonics. Here, we extend the scope of thin film ENZ modes by elucidating the generalized polaritonic modes emerging from anisotropy and near-zero permittivity. Through a theoretical investigation of generalized ENZ polaritons on silicon carbide (SiC) metasurfaces, we reveal a complex polaritonic landscape, consisting of a seven-region phase diagram. We show that the complex interplay between material properties and geometry changes the nature of the modes, and we clarify when ENZ modes with closed and open isofrequency curves (IFCs) can be observed, and how they coexist with surface phonon-polaritons and hyperbolic modes. The associated photonic topological transitions are accompanied by phase velocity sign reversals and induce dramatic modifications of near-field profiles and Purcell enhancement factors. Our work merges insights from anisotropic and ENZ effects, enabling enhanced control over polariton behavior with broad implications for subwavelength optics, material design, nonlinear effects, thermal emission, and quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Direct integration of atomic precision advanced manufacturing into middle-of-line silicon fabrication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atomic precision advanced manufacturing (APAM) dopes silicon with enough carriers to change its electronic structure, and can be used to create novel devices by defining metallic regions whose boundaries have single-atom abruptness. Incompatibility with the thermal and lithography process requirements for gated silicon transistor manufacturing have inhibited exploration of both how APAM can enhance CMOS performance, and how transistor manufacturing steps can accelerate the discovery of new APAM device concepts. In this work, we introduce an APAM process that enables direct integration into the middle of a transistor manufacturing workflow. We show that a process that combines sputtering and annealing with a hardmask preserves a defining characteristic of APAM, a doping density far in excess of the solid solubility limit, while trading another, the atomic precision, for compatibility with manufacturing. The electrical characteristics of a chip combining a transistor with an APAM resistor show the APAM module has only affected the transistor through the addition of a resistance, and not by altering the transistor. This proof-of-concept demonstration also outlines the requirements and limitations of a unified APAM tool which could be introduced into manufacturing environments, greatly expanding access to this technology, and inspiring a new generation of devices with it.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Non-Hermitian Skin Effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological phases of matter commonly feature protected states at their boundaries. Transferring this protection to time-metamaterials is extremely challenging, as it requires the generation of an abrupt interface between two topologically distinct bulks. Here, we realize and measure an ultrafast topological non-Hermitian skin mode bound to an interface circulating within the cavity of a fast-gain semiconductor laser. The nonlinear stationary state generated in such devices features a jump in the instantaneous frequency. We show that this discontinuity gives rise to a topological interface for the field fluctuations in the system. Using direct intensity sampling, we experimentally measure the skin modes and their positioning at the frequency jump of the stationary state. Analysis of these isolated modes reveals an ultrashort full-width at half-maximum of 583 $\pm$ 16 fs. Furthermore, we show that we can tune the shape and relative timing shift of the skin modes via external bias modulation. Finally, both numerical and experimental analysis of the noise in the system reveal that field fluctuations are funneled into the topological interface. Our findings reveal a new way to generate topologically protected states of light in time, which paves the way for novel time-varying physics as well as metrological applications.</description>

      <title>Anomalous proximity effect under Andreev and Majorana bound states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically study the anomalous proximity effect in a ballistic normal metal/diffusive normal metal/superconductor junction based on Rashba semiconductor nanowire model. The system hosts two distinct phases: a trivial helical phase with zero-energy Andreev Bound States and a topological phase with Majorana Bound States. We analyze the local density of states and induced pair correlations at the edge of the normal metal region. We investigate their behavior under scalar onsite disorder and changing the Superconductor and diffusive regions lengths in the trivial helical and topological phases. We find that both phases exhibit a zero-energy peak in the local density of states and spin-triplet pair correlations in the clean limit, which we attribute primarily to odd-frequency spin-triplet pairs. Disorder rapidly splits the zero-energy peak in the trivial helical phase regardless of the lengths of the superconductor and diffusive normal regions. The zero-energy peak in the topological phase show similar fragility when the superconductor region is short. However, for long superconductor regions, the zero-energy peak in the topological phase remain robust against disorder. In contrast, spin-singlet correlations are suppressed near zero energy in both phases. Our results highlight that the robustness of the zero-energy peak against scalar disorder, contingent on the Superconductor region length, serves as a key indicator distinguishing trivial Andreev bound states from topological Majorana bound states.</description>

Abstract: Two-dimensional materials offering ultrafast photoresponse suffer from low intrinsic absorbance, especially in the mid-infrared wavelength range. Challenges in 2d material doping further complicate the creation of light-sensitive $p-n$ junctions. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a graphene-based infrared detector with simultaneously enhanced absorption and strong structural asymmetry enabling zero-bias photocurrent. A key element for those properties is an asymmetric singular metasurface (ASMS) atop graphene with keen metal wedges providing singular enhancement of local absorbance. The ASMS geometry predefines extra device functionalities. The structures with connected metallic wedges demonstrate polarization ratios up to 200 in a broad range of carrier densities at a wavelength of 8.6 $\mu$m. The structures with isolated wedges display gate-controlled switching between polarization-discerning and polarization-stable photoresponse, a highly desirable yet scarce property for polarized imaging.</description>

      <title>Modular Autonomous Virtualization System for Two-Dimensional Semiconductor Quantum Dot Arrays</title>

Abstract: Arrays of gate-defined semiconductor quantum dots are among the leading candidates for building scalable quantum processors. High-fidelity initialization, control, and readout of spin qubit registers require exquisite and targeted control over key Hamiltonian parameters that define the electrostatic environment. However, due to the tight gate pitch, capacitive crosstalk between gates hinders independent tuning of chemical potentials and interdot couplings. While virtual gates offer a practical solution, determining all the required cross-capacitance matrices accurately and efficiently in large quantum dot registers is an open challenge. Here, we establish a modular automated virtualization system (MAViS) -- a general and modular framework for autonomously constructing a complete stack of multilayer virtual gates in real time. Our method employs machine learning techniques to rapidly extract features from two-dimensional charge stability diagrams. We then utilize computer vision and regression models to self-consistently determine all relative capacitive couplings necessary for virtualizing plunger and barrier gates in both low- and high-tunnel-coupling regimes. Using MAViS, we successfully demonstrate accurate virtualization of a dense two-dimensional array comprising ten quantum dots defined in a high-quality Ge/SiGe heterostructure. Our work offers an elegant and practical solution for the efficient control of large-scale semiconductor quantum dot systems.</description>

Abstract: Bands with non-trivial topological indices have a topological obstruction preventing them from being represented by exponentially localized Wannier states. Here, we propose a procedure to construct exponentially localized Wannier functions that span a subspace of topologically obstructed bands through the use of the projection method. These Wannier functions form what we refer to as a "reduced Wannier representation," indicating that the Wannier functions necessarily do not span the full topological manifold. By constructing supercells, we obtain reduced Wannier functions that break the primitive translational symmetry while capturing a substantial portion of the topologically obstructed manifold. This approach effectively decomposes the topological manifold into two subspaces: an itinerant subspace inheriting the topology and a localized trivial subspace represented by reduced Wannier functions. We consider the Haldane and Kane-Mele tight-binding models as the platforms for our investigation.</description>

Abstract: The functionalization of atomically-thin transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) with organic molecules is a promising approach for realizing nanoscale optoelectronic devices with tailored functionalities, such as quantum light generation or p-n junctions. However, achieving precise control over the molecules' positioning on the 2D material remains a significant challenge. Here, we overcome the limitations of solution- and vapor-deposition methods and use a DNA origami placement technique to spatially arrange thiol molecules on a chip surface at the single-molecule level with high assembly yields. We successfully integrated MoS$_2$ monolayers with micron-scale thiol-origami patterns, achieving single-photon emission from thiol-induced localized excitons in MoS$_2$. Our work lays a foundation for the chemical control of quantum emitters in atomically-thin semiconductors and enables the design and production of ultracompact 2D devices for quantum technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02271v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Physical reservoir computing has emerged as a powerful framework for exploiting the inherent nonlinear dynamics of physical systems to perform computational tasks. Recently, we presented the magnon-scattering reservoir, whose internal nodes are given by the fundamental wave-like excitations of ferromagnets called magnons. These excitations can be geometrically-quantized and, in response to an external stimulus, show transient nonlinear scattering dynamics that can be harnessed to perform memory and nonlinear transformation tasks. Here, we test a magnon-scattering reservoir in a single magnetic disk in the vortex state towards two key performance indicators for physical reservoir computing, the short-term memory and parity-check tasks. Using time-resolved Brillouin light scattering microscopy, we measure the evolution of the reservoir's spectral response to an input sequence consisting of random binary inputs encoded in microwave pulses with two distinct frequencies. Two different output spaces of the reservoir are defined, one based on the time-averaged frequency spectra and another based on temporal multiplexing. Our results demonstrate that the memory and nonlinear transformation capability do not depend on the chosen read-out scheme as long as the dimension of the output space is large enough to capture all nonlinear features provided by the magnon-magnon interactions. This further shows that solely the nonlinear magnons in the physical system, not the read-out, determine the reservoir's capacity.</description>

      <title>Antiferromagnetic diamond network as an efficient spin filter: Proposition of a spin-specific semi-conducting behavior</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10700v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose, for the first time, that an array of diamond plaquettes, each possessing vanishing net magnetization, can achieve complete spin polarization over a broad bias window. Furthermore, this system can be utilized to realize spin-specific semiconducting behavior. We describe the antiferromagnetic diamond network within a tight-binding framework, where spin-dependent scattering arises due to the interaction between itinerant electrons and local magnetic moments at different lattice sites. The mechanism underlying spin filtration relies on the specific arrangement of magnetic moments within individual plaquettes. We systematically investigate the spin polarization phenomenon under various input conditions, examining its dependence on network size, system temperature, and the magnetic flux threading each plaquette. Due to the network's geometry, we identify a sharply localized, highly degenerate energy level coexisting with conducting states. By tuning physical parameters, a small energy gap can be established between these degenerate localized states and the conducting energy band, enabling spin-specific $p$-type and $n$-type semiconducting behavior. Our findings offer a novel approach for designing future spintronic devices based on similar antiferromagnetic networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07721v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent studies propose Majorana polarization (MP) as a tool for identifying topological Majorana bound states (MBS). We analyze MP in two systems: a one-dimensional (1d) semiconducting nanowire and a quasi-1d system, both with Rashba spin-orbit coupling, proximity-induced superconductivity, and disorder. While MP reflects topological features, it does not always distinguish true MBS from partially separated Andreev bound states (psABS) or quasi-Majorana modes. True MBS are expected to satisfy $\mathcal{P}^*_\mathrm{left} \cdot \mathcal{P}_\mathrm{right} \sim -1$, but two additional criteria - a topological bandgap and edge-localized wavefunctions - are also necessary for their identification and use in topological quantum computation (TQC). We highlight cases where the polarization product condition holds without meeting these extra requirements. Our conclusions remain robust irrespective of the chosen definition of Majorana polarization, whether based on chiral or the particle-hole framework.

      <title>Damped photonic modes in helical graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20832v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the behavior of spin-1 vector bosons in helical spacetime, focusing on photonic modes in helical graphene structures. We model the helical graphene surface as a smooth, continuous, and distortion-free manifold, effectively adopting the continuum approximation. By solving the fully covariant vector boson equation, we derive exact solutions that describe the quantum states of photons in a curved helical background, revealing their energy spectra, mode profiles, and decay dynamics. We find that the decay times of damped photonic modes range from \(10^{-16}\) to \(10^{-13}\) seconds as the helical pitch (\(a\)) varies from \(10^3\) nanometers to \(1\) nanometer, indicating that the structure efficiently absorbs all photonic modes. Additionally, the probability density functions exhibit time dependence, complementing their spatial variation. These findings provide a foundation for the design of ultrafast graphene photodetectors, graphene photodevices for high-speed optical communications, advanced photonic devices, and quantum materials based on helical graphene for various nanophotonic applications.</description>

      <title>Twist-Induced Effects on Weyl Pairs in Magnetized Graphene Nanoribbons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08789v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents an analytical investigation into the dynamics of Weyl pairs within magnetized helicoidal graphene nanoribbons. By embedding a curved surface into flat Minkowski space-time, we derive a fully covariant two-body Dirac equation specific to this system. We begin by formulating a non-perturbative wave equation that governs the relative motion of the Weyl pairs and obtain exact solutions. Our results demonstrate the influence of the uniform magnetic field and the number of twists on the dynamics of Weyl pairs in graphene nanoribbons, providing precise energy values that lay a robust foundation for future research. Furthermore, we examine the material's response to perturbation fields by calculating the polarization function and investigating how twisting and magnetic fields affect this response. Our findings indicate that, in principle, the material's properties, which are crucial for practical applications, can be effectively controlled by precisely tuning the magnetic field and the number of twists in graphene nanoribbons.</description>

      <title>Effect of interatomic repulsion on a Kitaev-transmon qubit based on double quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01610v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of interatomic Coulomb repulsion $V$ on the Kitaev-transmon system proposed by Pino \textit{et al.} \cite{pino} which consists of a Josephson junction between two double quantum dots (DQDs) modeled by the spinless Kitaev Hamiltonian. For an isolated DQD, we demonstrate that a "sweet spot" hosting "poor man's Majorana" states can still be achieved in the presence of $V$ by appropriately tuning the system parameters. This adjustment allows the extension of previous results to the case of finite Coulomb repulsion $V \neq 0$. However, we observe modifications in the microwave spectrum, due to the presence of previously overlooked states. Additionally, we find that at the sweet spot of both DQDs, all eigenstates of the transmon system exhibit exact double degeneracy.</description>

      <title>Electrons as intermediate charge carriers in ion transport through nanoscale channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02478v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ionic conductivity of a nanofluidic channel is one of its most basic properties, which is systematically characterized in experiments. While most studies to date have focused on the DC conductivity, there has recently been a surge of interest in the behavior of nanochannels under AC voltages. Here, we show that in nanochannels with electrically conducting walls, electrons can contribute to transporting ionic current through the channel. We identify a critical frequency and lengthscale above which electrons in the channel walls become the main charge carriers, resulting in a strongly increased conductivity. Our findings open the way to the engineering of nanofluidic functionalities based on ion-electron coupling.</description>

      <title>Altermagnetism from coincident Van Hove singularities: application to $\kappa$-Cl</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05180v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Realizing two-dimensional (2D) altermagnets is important for spintronics applications. Here we propose a microscopic template for stabilizing 2D altermagnetism through Van Hove singularities that are coincident in both energy and momentum. These coincident Van Hove singularities are a generic consequence of non-symmorphic symmetries in nine 2D space groups. Due to nontrivial symmetry properties of the Hamiltonian, these coincident Van Hove singularities allow new hopping interactions between the Van Hove singularities that do not appear in analogous Van Hove singularity based patch models for cuprates and graphene. We show these new interactions can give rise to various weak coupling, and BCS-based instabilities, including altermagnetism, nematicity, inter-band d-wave superconductivity, and orbital altermagnetic order. We apply our results to quasi-2D organic $\kappa$-Cl in which altermagnetism is known to appear.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Laser Cooling of a Mechanical Resonator via Zero-Photon Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01734v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Throughout quantum science and technology, measurement is used as a powerful resource for nonlinear operations and quantum state engineering. In particular, single-photon detection is commonly employed for quantum-information applications and tests of fundamental physics. By contrast, and perhaps counter-intuitively, measurement of the absence of photons also provides useful information, and offers significant potential for a wide range of new experimental directions. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate cooling of a mechanical resonator below its laser-cooled mechanical occupation via zero-photon detection on the anti-Stokes scattered optical field and verify this cooling through heterodyne measurements. Our measurements are well captured by a stochastic master equation and the techniques introduced here open new avenues for cooling, quantum thermodynamics, quantum state engineering, and quantum measurement and control.</description>

      <title>Theoretical framework for enhancing or enabling cooling of a mechanical resonator via the anti-Stokes or Stokes interaction and zero-photon detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01735v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a theoretical framework to describe how zero-photon detection may be utilized to enhance laser cooling via the anti-Stokes interaction and, somewhat surprisingly, enable cooling via the Stokes interaction commonly associated with heating. Our description includes both pulsed and continuous measurements as well as optical detection efficiency and open-system dynamics. For both cases, we discuss how the cooling depends on the system parameters such as detection efficiency and optomechanical cooperativity, and we study the continuous-measurement-induced dynamics, contrasting to single-photon detection events. For the Stokes case, we explore the interplay between cooling and heating via optomechanical parametric amplification, and we find the efficiency required to cool a mechanical oscillator via zero-photon detection. This work serves as a companion article to the recent experiment [E. A. Cryer-Jenkins, K. D. Major, et al., arXiv:2408.01734 (2024)], which demonstrated enhanced laser cooling of a mechanical oscillator via zero-photon detection on the anti-Stokes signal. The framework developed here provides new approaches for cooling mechanical resonators that can be applied to a wide range of areas including nonclassical state preparation, quantum thermodynamics, and avoiding the often unwanted heating effects of parametric amplification.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous symmetry breaking in the Heisenberg antiferromagnet on a triangular lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12411v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a detailed investigation of an overlooked symmetry structure in non-collinear antiferromagnets that gives rise to an emergent quantum number for magnons. Focusing on the triangular-lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnet, we show that its spin order parameter transforms under an enlarged symmetry group, $\mathrm{SO(3)_L \times SO(2)_R}$, rather than the conventional spin-rotation group $\mathrm{SO(3)}$. Although this larger symmetry is spontaneously broken by the ground state, a residual subgroup survives, leading to conserved Noether charges that, upon quantization, endow magnons with an additional quantum number -- \emph{isospin} -- beyond their energy and momentum. Our results provide a comprehensive framework for understanding symmetry, degeneracy, and quantum numbers in non-collinear magnetic systems, and bridge an unexpected connection between the paradigms of symmetry breaking in non-collinear antiferromagnets and chiral symmetry breaking in particle physics.</description>
