      <title>Two-Crested Stokes Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study two-crested traveling Stokes waves on the surface of an ideal fluid with infinite depth. Following Chen and Saffman (1980), we refer to these waves as class $\mathrm{II}$ Stokes waves. The class $\mathrm{II}$ waves are found from bifurcations from the primary branch of Stokes waves away from the flat surface. These waves are strongly nonlinear, and are disconnected from small-amplitude solutions. Distinct class $\mathrm{II}$ bifurcations are found to occur in the first two oscillations of the velocity versus steepness diagram. The bifurcations in distinct oscillations are not connected via a continuous family of class $\mathrm{II}$ waves. We follow the first two families of class $\mathrm{II}$ waves, which we refer to as the secondary branch (that is primary class $\mathrm{II}$ branch), and the tertiary branch (that is secondary class $\mathrm{II}$ branch). Similar to Stokes waves, the class $\mathrm{II}$ waves follow through a sequence of oscillations in velocity as their steepness rises, and indicate the existence of limiting class $\mathrm{II}$ Stokes waves characterized by a $120$ degree angle at every other wave crest.</description>

      <title>Generic equations for long gravity waves in incompressible fluid with finite amplitude</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the derivation of generic equations describing the long gravity waves in incompressible fluid with decaying effect. We show that in this theory the only restriction to the surface deviation is connected with the stability condition for the waves. Derivation of these generic equations is based on Euler equations for inviscid incompressible fluid and definition of dynamic pressure which leads to correct dispersion equation for gravity waves. These derived generic equations for velocity of fluid and the surface deviation describe the propagation of long gravity waves in incompressible fluid with finite amplitude. We also have found the necessary and sufficient conditions for generic equations with dissipation of energy or decaying effect. The developed approach can significantly improve the accuracy of theory for long gravity waves in incompressible fluid. We also have found the quasi-periodic and solitary wave solutions for generic equations with decaying effect.</description>

      <title>Quantum droplets and Schr\"{o}dinger's cat states in atomic-molecular Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Explicit realization of quantum droplets, even and odd Schr\"{o}dinger cat states is demonstrated in an atom-molecular Bose-Einstein condensate in the presence of interconversion and Kerr non-linear interactions. The crucial roles of both the $\chi^2$-type nonlinearity and chemical potential in the formation of these macroscopic quantum states are shown, where the atomic condensate is in the cat state, with the corresponding molecular wave packet being a quantum droplet. The physical mechanism for their creation and common origin is established to be the non-linearity-induced self-trapping potentials, governed by photoassociation or Feshbach resonance, with the Kerr-type nonlinearities playing subdominant roles. The coexisting and controllable atom and molecular droplets are shown to realize the atom-molecular squeezed state with profiles ranging from Gaussian to flat-top super-Gaussian form. The Wigner functions are exhibited revealing the cat states' phase space interference and squeezing of droplets.</description>

      <title>A Swarm Coherence Mechanism for Jellyfish</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04044v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a theory of jellyfish swarm formation and exemplify it with simulations of active Brownian particles. The motivation for our analysis is the phenomenon of jellyfish blooms in the ocean and clustering of jellyfish in tank experiments. We argue that such clusters emerge due to an externally induced phase transition of jellyfish density, such as convergent flows, which is then maintained and amplified by self-induced stimuli. Our study introduces three mechanisms relevant for a better understanding of jellyfish blooming that have not been taken into account before which are a signaling tracer, jellyfish-wall interaction and ignorance of external stimuli. Our results agree with the biological fact that jellyfish exhibit an extreme sensitivity to stimuli in order to achieve favorable aggregations. Based on our theoretical framework, we are able to provide a clear terminology for future experimental analysis of jellyfish swarming and we pinpoint potential limitations of tank experiments.</description>

      <title>Extending 1089 attractor to any number of digits and any number of steps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11784v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The well-known 1089 trick reflects an amazing trait of digital reversal process and reminisces of a limiting attractor in dynamical systems even though it takes only two steps. It is natural to consider the situations when the number of digits is beyond three as in the original 1089 trick, as well as situations when the number of steps is beyond two. The first part has been mostly done by Webster which we will reproduce. After two steps, the resulting integers are called Papadakis-Webster integers (PWI), which is always divisible by 99, and the resulting quotients consist of only 0's and 1's, which we name Papadakis-Webster binary strings (PWBS). Not all binary strings could be PWBS, and we define the hairpin pairing rule to determine if a binary string is a PWBS. For the second part, we propose a two-option iteration system named iterative digital reversal (IDR) suitably interweaving additions and subtractions. The simplest limiting behavior of IDR is 2-cycles. The elements in an IDR 2-cycle are all composed of repetitions of the 10(9)$_L$89 (L&gt;=0) motif, and are all PWIs. The lower 2-cycle elements after division of 99 belong to the subset of PWBS that are palindromic and consist of 0- and 1-blocks with a minimal length of two. IDR also has higher p-cycles (p=10,12,71) whose elements seem to contain at least one PWI. Another interesting finding about IDR is that it contains non-periodic and diverging trajectories, as the integer values grow to infinity. In these diverging trajectories, while the number of flanking digits around the middle point increases by the iteration, the middle part has an 8-cycle rhythm or signature which has been found in all diverging trajectories. Overall, the generalization of the original 1089 trick in both space and time leads to new patterns in integers and new phenomenology in dynamics.</description>
