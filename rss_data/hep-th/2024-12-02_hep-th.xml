      <title>Scattering waveforms for Kerr black holes from the soft expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this thesis, I will study the classical scattering problem of two Kerr black holes in general relativity with novel quantum field theory techniques in the Post-Minkowskian (PM) expansion, generalizing the subleading soft theorem to the case of spinning particles. The leading order term in the soft expansion is uniquely determined by the universal Weinberg pole, but the subleading one depends on the angular momentum of the external particles and receives a new spin corrections for classically spinning black holes. Using this approach, I will compute the gravitational Compton amplitude, both in the quantum and classical theory. I will then compute the tree-level five-point amplitude of two spinning point particles emitting a graviton, using the spinor-helicity formalism combined with the soft expansion. Finally, I will use the KMOC formalism to derive the analytic time-domain waveform for the scattering of two Kerr black holes at leading order in the PM expansion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using supersymmetric localization, we compute the partition function and some protected correlators of the polarized IKKT matrix model. Surprisingly, we find that the original IKKT model is different from polarized IKKT in the limit of vanishing mass deformation. We study different regimes of the localization results and recover the electrostatic problem which defines the gravity dual.</description>

      <title>Wheeler-De Witt equation and the Canonical Construction of the Glauber-Sudarshan States in Quantum Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum gravity is fundamentally different from the non-gravitational quantum field theories in the sense that most of the techniques derived for the latter cannot be easily extended to the former. For example, correlation functions in quantum gravity become hard to define properly if the bulk Hamiltonian - as a consequence of the Wheeler-De Witt equation - itself annihilates the states thus rendering the evolution operators to identities. An even harder problem is the back reactions of the fluctuations on the background itself. We argue that the construction of the Glauber-Sudarshan states takes care of these two issues in rather interesting ways. For the former, the displacement operators are defined at every instant of time, without directly invoking the Hamiltonian, so that they naturally extend to the path-integral description as sum over histories. For the latter, the back reactions of the fluctuations are carefully accounted for by the Schwinger-Dyson equations. In fact these back reactions are in part responsible for converting the ambient supersymmetric Minkowski background to a transient de Sitter phase. Expectedly, this transient de Sitter phase is defined well within the validity regime of the trans-Planckian bound.</description>

      <title>Size and Shape of Rotating Strings and the Correspondence to Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In light of the correspondence between black holes and fundamental strings with non-zero spin, we compute the sizes of rotating strings for small, moderate, and large values of the angular momentum and compare them to the sizes of rotating black holes. We argue that the ratio of the size perpendicular to the rotation plane to the size along the rotation plane is an approximate adiabatic invariant and can therefore be meaningfully compared for objects on different sides of the correspondence point. We show that the spin-dependence of this ratio for small angular momenta agrees for black holes and strings. When the spin is large, the ratios for these objects exhibit different behavior, but this is expected since for large angular momenta there is no direct correspondence between black holes and single-string states. We also develop a random-walk model that describes highly excited strings and accurately reproduces the sizes of rotating strings for all values of angular momentum.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic operators in $c=0$ bulk CFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Kac operators (e.g. energy operator) in percolation and self-avoiding walk bulk CFTs with central charge $c=0$. The proper normalizations of these operators can be deduced at generic $c$ by requiring the finiteness and reality of the three-point constants in cluster and loop model CFTs. At $c=0$, Kac operators become zero-norm states and the bottom fields of logarithmic multiplets, and comparison with $c&lt;1$ Liouville CFT suggests the potential existence of arbitrarily high rank Jordan blocks. We give a generic construction of logarithmic operators based on Kac operators and focus on the rank-2 pair of the energy operator mixing with the hull operator. By taking the $c\to 0$ limit, we compute some of their conformal data and use this to investigate the operator algebra at $c=0$. Based on cluster decomposition, we find that, contrary to previous belief, the four-point correlation function of the bulk energy operator does not vanish at $c=0$, and a crucial role is played by its coupling to the rank-3 Jordan block associated with the second energy operator. This reveals the intriguing way zero-norm operators build long-range higher-point correlations through the intricate logarithmic structures in $c=0$ bulk CFTs.</description>

      <title>Charged Rotating Hairy Black Holes in AdS$_5 \times S^5$: Unveiling their Secrets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using a mix of analytical and numerical methods, we construct new rotating, charged "hairy" black hole solutions of $D=5$, ${\cal N}=8$ gauged supergravity that are dual, via the AdS/CFT correspondence, to thermal states in $D=4$, ${\cal N}=4$ SYM at finite chemical and angular potential, thereby complementing and extending the results of [arXiv:1005.1287, arXiv:1806.01849, arXiv:1809.04084]. These solutions uplift to asymptotically AdS$_5 \times S^5$ solutions of Type IIB supergravity with equal angular momenta along AdS$_5$ ($J=J_1=J_2$) and $S^5$ ($Q=Q_1=Q_2=Q_3$). As we lower the mass $E$ at fixed $Q$ and $J$, the known Cveti\v{c}-L\"u-Pope (CLP) black holes are unstable to scalar condensation and the hairy black holes constructed here emerge as novel solutions associated to the instability. In the region of phase space where the CLP and hairy black holes coexist, the hairy black holes dominate the microcanonical ensemble and, therefore, describe a new thermodynamic phase of SYM. The hairy black holes extend beyond the CLP extremality surface all the way to the BPS surface, defined by $E = 3 Q + 2 J / L$. Through a combination of analytical and numerical techniques, we argue that the BPS limit of the hairy black holes is a singular, horizonless solution, and $not$ a new two-parameter family of BPS black holes that extend the known one-parameter Gutowski-Reall (GR) black hole solution, in contradiction with the conjectures of [arXiv:1005.1287, arXiv:1806.01849]. To further support our conclusions, we perform a near-horizon analysis of the BPS equations and argue that they do not admit any regular solutions with an horizon.</description>

      <title>Monopoles, Dirac Strings and Generalised Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dirac's formulation of magnetic monopoles is shown to be equivalent to Maxwell theory coupled to 2-form gauge fields so that it has a local 1-form symmetry, with the 2-form gauge fields given in terms of the 2-form current densities associated with the Dirac strings. The field equations of Dirac's theory do not depend on the positions of the Dirac strings provided that they do not intersect the worldlines of any electrically charged particles; this constraint is called the Dirac veto. It is shown that Dirac's action is independent of the positions of the Dirac strings and that this corresponds a local 1-form symmetry. The electric and magnetic 1-form symmetries have a mixed anomaly, and the Dirac veto is shown to correspond to a restriction to gauge transformations for which the anomaly vanishes. The extension to $p$-form gauge fields in d-dimensions coupled to charged branes is discussed, together with the possibility of cancelling the anomaly by embedding in a higher-dimensional theory and so avoiding the veto.</description>

      <title>A string-like realization of hyperbolic Kac-Moody algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new approach to studying hyperbolic Kac-Moody algebras, focussing on the rank-3 algebra $\mathfrak{F}$ first investigated by Feingold and Frenkel. Our approach is based on the concrete realization of this Lie algebra in terms of a Hilbert space of transverse and longitudinal physical string states, which are expressed in a basis using DDF operators. When decomposed under its affine subalgebra $A_1^{(1)}$, the algebra $\mathfrak{F}$ decomposes into an infinite sum of affine representation spaces of $A_1^{(1)}$ for all levels $\ell\in\mathbb{Z}$. For $|\ell| &gt;1$ there appear in addition coset Virasoro representations for all minimal models of central charge $c&lt;1$, but the different level-$\ell$ sectors of $\mathfrak{F}$ do not form proper representations of these because they are incompletely realized in $\mathfrak{F}$. To get around this problem we propose to nevertheless exploit the coset Virasoro algebra for each level by identifying for each level a (for $|\ell|\geq 3$ infinite) set of `Virasoro ground states' that are not necessarily elements of $\mathfrak{F}$ (in which case we refer to them as `virtual'), but from which the level-$\ell$ sectors of $\mathfrak{F}$ can be fully generated by the joint action of affine and coset Virasoro raising operators. We conjecture (and present partial evidence) that the Virasoro ground states for $|\ell|\geq 3$ in turn can be generated from a finite set of `maximal ground states' by the additional action of the `spectator' coset Virasoro raising operators present for all levels $|\ell| &gt; 2$. Our results hint at an intriguing but so far elusive secret behind Einstein's theory of gravity, with possibly important implications for quantum cosmology.</description>

      <title>Covariant quantization of the superstring in $\rm AdS_3 \times S^3 \times T^4$ with mixed flux</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A quantizable and manifestly $\text{PSU}(1,1|2) \times \text{PSU}(1,1|2)$-invariant action for the superstring in $\rm AdS_3 \times S^3 \times T^4$ with mixed NS-NS and R-R self-dual three-form flux is constructed, which is the analogue of the $\rm AdS_5 \times S^ 5$ pure spinor action for $\rm AdS_3 \times S^3$. The model is then quantized and proven to be conformal invariant at the one-loop level. We conclude by showing how one can relate the supersymmetric description with the Berkovits-Vafa-Witten $\rm AdS_3 \times S^3$ worldsheet action with mixed flux.</description>

      <title>On the photon self-energy to three loops in QED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the photon self-energy to three loops in Quantum Electrodynamics. The method of differential equations for Feynman integrals and a complete $\epsilon$-factorization of the former allow us to obtain fully analytical results in terms of iterated integrals involving integration kernels related to a K3 geometry. We argue that our basis has the right properties to be a natural generalization of a canonical basis beyond the polylogarithmic case and we show that many of the kernels appearing in the differential equations, cancel out in the final result to finite order in $\epsilon$. We further provide generalized series expansions that cover the whole kinematic space so that our results for the self-energy may be easily evaluated numerically for all values of the momentum squared. From the local solution at $p^2=0$, we extract the photon wave function renormalization constant in the on-shell scheme to three loops and confirm its agreement with previously obtained results.</description>

      <title>Nonuniqueness of capped black holes: large and small bubbles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new non-BPS solution describing an asymptotically flat, stationary, bi-axisymmetric capped black hole in the bosonic sector of five-dimensional minimal supergravity. This solution describes a spherical black hole, while the exterior region of the horizon exhibits a non-trivial topology of $[{\mathbb R}^4 \# {\mathbb C}{\mathbb P}^2] \setminus {\mathbb B}^4$ on a timeslice. This solution extends our previously constructed three-parameter solution to a more general four-parameter solution. To derive this solution, we utilize a combination of the Ehlers and Harrison transformations and then impose appropriate boundary conditions on the solution's parameters. It can be shown that the resultant solution is free from curvature, conical, Dirac-Misner string and orbifold singularities, as well as closed timelike curves on and outside the horizon. Characterized by four independent conserved charges -- mass, two angular momenta, and electric charge -- this solution reveals two distinct branches: a small bubble branch and a large bubble branch, distinguished by non-conserved local quantities such as magnetic flux or magnetic potential. This shows the non-uniqueness for spherical black holes, even among capped black holes. For equivalent sets of conserved charges, we find that the large/small bubble branch can have larger/smaller entropy than the Cveti\v{c}-Youm black hole.</description>

      <title>Finite Landscape of 6d N=(1,0) Supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a bottom-up argument showing that the number of massless fields in six-dimensional quantum gravitational theories with eight supercharges is uniformly bounded. Specifically, we show that the number of tensor multiplets is bounded by $T\leq 193$, and the rank of the gauge group is restricted to $r(V)\leq 480$. Given that F-theory compactifications on elliptic CY 3-folds are a subset, this provides a bound on the Hodge numbers of elliptic CY 3-folds: $h^{1,1}({\rm CY_3})\leq 491$, $h^{1,1}({\rm Base})\leq 194$ which are saturated by special elliptic CY 3-folds. This establishes that our bounds are sharp and also provides further evidence for the string lamppost principle. These results are derived by a comprehensive examination of the boundaries of the tensor moduli branch, showing that any consistent supergravity theory with $T\neq0$ must include a BPS string in its spectrum corresponding to a ``little string theory" (LST) or a critical heterotic string. From this tensor branch analysis, we establish a containment relationship between SCFTs and LSTs embedded within a gravitational theory. Combined with the classification of 6d SCFTs and LSTs, this then leads to the above bounds. Together with previous works, this establishes the finiteness of the supergravity landscape for $d\geq 6$.</description>

      <title>Revisit the relationship between spread complexity rate and radial momentum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article discusses the relationship between the boundary spread complexity rate and the radial momentum in the bulk within the framework of AdS/CFT. We demonstrate that the radial momentum of a freely falling particle, as measured by a stationary observer in the bulk, is equal to the spread complexity rate of the boundary conformal field theory. For a massive particle (no matter what the specific mass is), the particle is located at the asymptotic boundary with zero velocity at $t=0$. Additionally, we provide a simple method for obtaining spread complexity from radial momentum using optical geometry.</description>

      <title>More on the upper bound of holographic n-partite information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that there exists a huge amount of multipartite entanglement in holography by studying the upper bound for holographic $n$-partite information $I_n$ that $n-1$ fixed boundary subregions participate. We develop methods to find the $n$-th region $E$ that makes $I_n$ reach the upper bound. Through the explicit evaluation, it is shown that $I_n$, an IR term without UV divergence, could diverge when the number of intervals or strips in region $E$ approaches infinity. At this upper bound configuration, we could argue that $I_n$ fully comes from the $n$-partite global quantum entanglement. Our results indicate: fewer-partite entanglement in holography emerges from more-partite entanglement; $n-1$ distant local subregions are highly $n$-partite entangling. Moreover, the relationship between the convexity of a boundary subregion and the multipartite entanglement it participates, and the difference between multipartite entanglement structure in different dimensions are revealed as well.</description>

      <title>Towards a String Realization of the Dark Dimension via T-folds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the feasibility of realizing the Dark Dimension Scenario through T-fold compactifications on $T^5 \times S^1$, where the base of the internal space $S^1$ naturally acts as the requisite mesoscopic extra dimension. Utilizing Scherk--Schwarz reduction from 5D to 4D, and applying duality twists from both elliptic and parabolic conjugacy classes of subgroups of the T-duality group associated with $T^5$, we stabilize the volume of $T^5$ and several other moduli. This approach generates a potential characterized by two runaway directions, one aligned with the Scherk--Schwarz radion. Further stabilization efforts yield a decreasing potential trajectory demanded by the Dark Dimension Scenario.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Symmetries of Galilean Electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we revisit the symmetries of Galilean Electrodynamics (GED) in a spacetime of generic dimension $d+1$. We show that these symmetries are infinitely many, and in $d=3$ they correspond to the conformal Milne algebra extended by $U(1)$. We discuss their application in the context of non-relativistic AdS$_5$/CFT$_4$ correspondence.</description>

      <title>Celestial decomposition of Wigner's particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a detailed decomposition of Wigner's particles, defined as unitary irreducible representations of the Poincar\'e group, in terms of unitary representations of its Lorentz subgroup. As pointed out before us, this decomposition only involves Lorentz representations belonging to the principal continuous series, and further underpins the connection between scattering amplitudes and conformal correlation functions discussed in the context of celestial holography. We provide very explicit formulae for the decomposition of particles of arbitrary mass and (half-)integer spin and for any spacetime dimension. We emphasise that this decomposition is unique and comes with a specific inner product on the corresponding Hilbert space. We also confirm that unitary translations mix Lorentz representations within the principal continuous series only, as required. Implications to the celestial holography program are indicated.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Topological Defects from Holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates cosmic topological defects in gauge theories, focusing on models with an $SU(N)$ gauge group coupled with a single flavor, explored through a holographic framework. At low energies, the effective theory is described by an axion-like particle resulting from the spontaneous breaking of the axial $U(1)_A$ flavor symmetry. As the Universe cools below a critical temperature, the chiral symmetry is broken, and non-trivial vacuum configurations form, resulting in the creation of cosmic strings and domain walls. We provide a UV description of these defects in a particular holographic theory, the Witten-Sakai-Sugimoto model, as probe D6-branes. We show the presence of a first-order phase transition separating string loop from domain wall solutions. String loops charged under the baryon symmetry and with angular momentum - vortons - can be understood as excitations of a topological phase of matter given by a Chern-Simons theory living on the D6-brane world volume. Finally, we provide an effective description of string loops and vortons in terms of degrees of freedom living on the flavor brane, i.e. mesonic modes.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the possibility that quadratic gravity, as a renormalizable theory, describes the interior of quantum black holes. We find new exact power-law solutions to pure quadratic gravity under spherical symmetry, which are complex valued. The resulting solutions, dubbed powerballs, are horizonless compact objects that become Schwarzschild-like a small distance (of the order of the Planck length) outside the would-be Schwarzschild horizon. We present a description of the global eternal geometry, whose right and left exteriors are Lorentzian and Euclidean Schwarzschild-like regions, respectively, while the complex interior is a form of spiraling spacetime. We compute the total on-shell action integral as a saddle point to a gravitational path integral and discuss the Lorentzian and Euclidean interpretations thereof.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A method is presented for computing the R\'enyi entropy of a perturbed massless vacuum on the ball via a comparison with lattice field theory. If the perturbed state is Gaussian with smoothly varying correlation functions and the perturbation parameter has units of energy, I show the coefficients for R\'enyi entropy are analytically computable for all R\'enyi parameter $\alpha$ in odd dimensions and for integer $\alpha$ in even dimensions. I apply this procedure to compute coefficients for the large distant expansion for the R\'enyi mutual information of distant balls and the low temperature expansion for the entropy of a thermal field.</description>

      <title>Genus 2 Superstring Chiral Measure From The 3-Dimensional Gelca-Hamilton TQFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the path integral formulation of the superstring, the chiral measure acquires a phase under the modular transformation of a Riemann surface. This motivated the use of anomaly inflow to define the superstring chiral measure by a path integral formalism of a modular invariant $3$-dimensional theory. A Gelca-Hamilton topological field theory (TQFT) is one of the Atiyah's TQFT on a $3$-dimensional extended manifold with the boundary Jacobi variety of a Riemann surface, whose Hilbert space is spanned by the theta series. We show that genus $g\leq 2$ superstring chiral measure in the path integral can be obtained by the path integral of the Gelca-Hamilton TQFT on some $3$-dimensional bulk extended manifolds. The modular transformation of the superstring chiral measure can be understood as the action of the extended mapping class group on the bulk $3$-dimensional extended manifolds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate how the marginal beta deformation of the ${N}=4$ super-Yang-Mills theory manifests within the context of the topological B-model in the twistor space $\mathbb{CP}^{3|4}$. We begin by identifying the beta deformation as states living in a specific irreducible representation of the superconformal algebra. Then, we compute the ghost number two elements of the BRST cohomology of the topological model. A gauge-fixing procedure is applied to these states, allowing us to identify the elements living in the irreducible representation that characterizes the beta deformation. Based on this identification, we proceed to write the deformed topological action, and the corresponding deformed BRST operator.</description>

      <title>Global symmetry violation from non-isometric codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the no global symmetry conjecture in quantum gravity by modeling black holes as non-isometric codes, encoding the interior states with global charges into the fundamental states. The fluctuation of the inner products of the charged states can be larger compared to the case without charges. The non-isometric map causes states with different charges to have non-zero overlaps, signaling symmetry violation. The Renyi entropies of the radiation with global charges are found to be consistent with the quantum extremal surface formula. We compute the Renyi version of relative entropy, a quantity used to measure the degree of global symmetry violation in the Hawking radiation, and demonstrate that global symmetries are indeed violated.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extending a recent development in the bosonic string field theory, we construct a map from the Witten-type gauge-invariant superstring field theory based on an $A_{\infty}$ structure to a light-cone-gauge superstring field theory via two intermediate theories, which we call the Kaku-type and Kugo-Zwiebach-type superstring field theories. We find that a naive extension only gives us an inconsistent light-cone-gauge theory that suffers from the well-known problem caused by divergence due to collisions of local operators. However, we also find that this difficulty may be resolved by considering the stubbed theory and propose it as a consistent light-cone-gauge superstring field theory. The result possibly gives a proof of the unitarity of the Witten-type superstring field theory.</description>

      <title>Supersymmetric Klein-Gordon and Dirac oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have recently shown that the space of initial data (covariant phase space) of the relativistic oscillator in Minkowski space $\mathbb{R}^{3,1}$ is a homogeneous K\"ahler-Einstein manifold $Z_6$=AdS$_7$/U(1)=U(3,1)/U(3)$\times$U(1). It was also shown that the energy eigenstates of the quantum relativistic oscillator form a direct sum of two weighted Bergman spaces of holomorphic (particles) and antiholomorphic (antiparticles) square-integrable functions on the covariant phase space $Z_6$ of the classical oscillator. Here we show that the covariant phase space of the supersymmetric version of the relativistic oscillator (oscillating spinning particle) is the odd tangent bundle of the space $Z_6$. Quantizing this model yields a Dirac oscillator equation on the phase space whose solution space is a direct sum of two spinor spaces parametrized by holomorphic and antiholomorphic functions on the odd tangent bundle of $Z_6$. After expanding the general solution in Grassmann variables, we obtain components of the spinor field that are holomorphic and antiholomorphic functions from Bergman spaces on $Z_6$ with different weight functions. Thus, the supersymmetric model under consideration is exactly solvable, Lorentz covariant and unitary.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider N Dirac fermions on a 4-dimensional Euclidean space with a quadratic interaction given by arbitrary external Clifford-valued fields. The divergence of the axial current satisfies on the classical level a relation that is violated after quantization. Using the Pauli-Villars method to regularize the fields, we find the conditions that guarantee the finiteness of the anomaly. We also find this anomaly. Our result generalizes the well-known computation of axial anomaly of Dirac fermions interacting with an external Yang-Mills field.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of a Higgs phase transition in the Klebanov-Witten theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of a first-order phase transition in a strongly coupled gauge theory at non-zero temperature and chemical potential, computing nucleation rates and wall speeds from first principles. The gauge theory is the four-dimensional superconformal SU(N)xSU(N) Klebanov-Witten theory, which at low temperatures displays an instability to forming scalar condensates that higgses the theory. The computation is made possible by utilizing the gravity dual, type IIB string theory on asymptotically AdS_5xT^{1,1} spacetimes. The instability is detected through the nucleation and subsequent localization of D-branes in the bulk, which in the probe limit is amenable to calculations. The nucleation rates suggest a preference for greater asymmetry between the two gauge groups as the temperature is lowered beyond its critical value. The wall speed stays below the speed of sound of the conformal plasma across all parameter values and exhibits nonlinear dependence on the energy difference between the two phases.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore $(-1)$-form symmetries within the framework of geometric engineering in M-theory. By constructing the Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT) for selected 5d $\mathcal{N}=1$, 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ and 4d $\mathcal{N}=1$ theories, we formalize the geometric origin of these symmetries and compute the mixed anomaly polynomials involving $(-1)$-form and higher-form symmetries. Our findings consistently reveal both discrete and continuous $(-1)$-form symmetries, aligning with established field theory results, while also uncovering new $(-1)$-form symmetry factors and structural insights. In particular, we study the SymTFT of 4d $\mathcal{N}=1$ theories from M-theory on a class of spaces with $G_2$ holonomy, and obtain properties such as modified instanton sums and 4-group structures observed in other 4d gauge theories. Additionally, we systematically construct symmetry operators for continuous abelian symmetries, refining existing proposals, and providing an M-theory origin for them.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new manifestly spacetime-supersymmetric prescription for superstring amplitude computations is given using the pure spinor formalism which does not contain subtleties from poles in the pure spinor ghosts. This super-Poincare covariant prescription is related by a U(5)-covariant field redefinition to the Ramond-Neveu-Schwarz amplitude prescription where the pure spinor parameterizes the choice of SO(10)/U(5). For F-term scattering amplitudes which preserve a subset of the spacetime supersymmetries, the new pure spinor amplitude prescription reduces to the previous pure spinor prescription.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The backreaction of quantum degrees of freedom on classical backgrounds is a poorly understood topic in theoretical physics. Most often it is treated within the semiclassical approximation with the help of various ad hoc prescriptions accounting for the effect of quantum excitations on the dynamics of the background. We focus on two popular ones: (i) the mean-field approximation whereby quantum degrees of freedom couple to the classical background via their quantum expectation values; (ii) the (stochastic) Truncated Wigner method whereby the fully coupled system is evolved using classical equations of motion for various randomly sampled initial conditions of the quantum degree of freedom, and a statistical average is performed a posteriori. We evaluate the performance of each method in a simple toy model against a fully quantum mechanical treatment, and identify its regime of validity. We interpret the results in terms of quantum entanglement and loss of classicality of the background.</description>

      <title>New bulk cone singularities in Vaidya-like spacetimes from large $c$ conformal blocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bulk cone singularities are singularities in boundary two-point functions at points separated by a null geodesic in the bulk, but not in the boundary. In this work, we describe a new type of bulk cone singularities in a family of Vaidya-like spacetimes that are labeled by the radius $r_+$ of the resulting black hole. We find a sharp transition in the causal structure within this family of spacetimes at $r_+=l$, the AdS length. In particular, there are bulk cone singularities that do not exist in the $r_+&gt;l$ case, but appear for $r_+&lt;l$. In the case of $r_+&lt;l$ where such singularities exist, we are able to reproduce the singularities in a CFT$_2$ calculation using large $c$ conformal blocks.</description>

Abstract: Modular crossed product algebras have recently assumed an important role in perturbative quantum gravity as they lead to an intrinsic regularization of entanglement entropies by introducing quantum reference frames (QRFs) in place of explicit regulators. This is achieved by imposing certain boost constraints on gravitons, QRFs and other fields. Here, we revisit the question of how these constraints should be understood through the lens of perturbation theory and particularly the study of linearization (in)stabilities, exploring when linearized solutions can be integrated to exact ones. Our aim is to provide some clarity about the status of justification, under various conditions, for imposing such constraints on the linearized theory in the $G_N\to0$ limit as they turn out to be of second-order. While for spatially compact spacetimes there is an essentially unambiguous justification, in the presence of boundaries or the absence of isometries this depends on whether one is also interested in second-order observables. Linearization (in)stabilities occur in any gauge-covariant field theory with non-linear equations and to address this in a unified framework, we translate the subject from the usual canonical formulation into a systematic covariant phase space language. This overcomes theory-specific arguments, exhibiting the universal structure behind (in)stabilities, and permits us to cover arbitrary generally covariant theories. We comment on the relation to modular flow and illustrate our findings in several gravity and gauge theory examples.</description>

      <title>All 4 x 4 solutions of the quantum Yang-Baxter equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we complete the classification of 4 x 4 solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation. Regular solutions were recently classified and in this paper we find the remaining non-regular solutions. We present several new solutions, then consider regular and non-regular Lax operators and study their relation to the quantum Yang-Baxter equation. We show that for regular solutions there is a correspondence, which is lost in the non-regular case. In particular, we find non-regular Lax operators whose R-matrix from the fundamental commutation relations is regular but does not satisfy the Yang-Baxter equation. These R-matrices satisfy a modified Yang-Baxter equation instead.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We evaluate the three-loop five-point pentagon-box-box massless integral family in the dimensional regularization scheme, via canonical differential equation. We use tools from computational algebraic geometry to enable the necessary integral reductions. The boundary values of the differential equation are determined analytically in the Euclidean region. To express the final result, we introduce a new representation of weight six functions in terms of one-fold integrals over the product of weight-three functions with weight-two kernels that are derived from the differential equation. Our work paves the way to the analytic computation of three-loop multi-leg Feynman integrals.</description>

      <title>A string loop origin for dark radiation and superheavy dark matter in type IIB compactifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article we study the significance of string loop corrections, in a perturbative moduli stabilization scenario, on unraveling the origin of dark radiation in the late cosmological times and its correlation to dark matter. More specifically, a scrutinized analysis is provided where the mass hierarchy of the normalized fields in the K{\"a}hler moduli sector is determined by the integer fluxes and the scale of the quantum correction's parameter $\eta$. Furthermore, the previously underestimated contributions to the decay rates of moduli to axions, which behave as dark radiation, are computed highlighting their connection to the aforementioned higher order corrections. Two contrasting reheating scenarios (low scale and high scale) are provided, depending on the decay rate of the longest lived particle to Standard model degrees of freedom through a Giudice-Masiero mechanism, while the effective number of neutrino species $\Delta N_{eff}$ lays below the respected bounds. Finally, a non-thermal dark matter scenario is proposed based on the decays of the heavy scalar fields, where the main production mechanisms are investigated, leading to dark matter candidate's mass laying from a few $GeV$ up to $10^{11}\; GeV$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18869v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We implement a variational quantum algorithm to investigate the chiral condensate in a 1+1 dimensional SU(2) non-Abelian gauge theory. The algorithm is evaluated using a proposed Monte Carlo sampling method, which allows the extension to large qubit systems. The obtained results through quantum simulations on classical and actual quantum hardware are in good agreement with exact diagonalization of the lattice Hamiltonian, revealing the phenomena of chiral symmetry breaking and restoration as functions of both temperature and chemical potential. Our findings underscore the potential of near-term quantum computing for exploring QCD systems at finite temperature and density in non-Abelian gauge theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The prediction of a minimal length scale by various quantum gravity candidates (such as string/M theory, Doubly Special Relativity, Loop Quantum Gravity and others) have suggested modification of Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle (HUP), resulting in the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP).
  In this short review, we investigate the origins of the GUP and examine higher-order models, focusing on the linear plus quadratic form of the GUP. We extend the concept of minimal length to minimal angular resolution, which plays a crucial role in modifying angular momentum and its associated algebra. A comparison is made between the standard angular momentum commutator algebra and that modified by the GUP. Finally, we review its application in the hydrogen atom spectra and and discuss future endeavors.</description>

      <title>Noninvertible Symmetry-Enriched Quantum Critical Point</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Noninvertible symmetry generalizes traditional group symmetries, advancing our understanding of quantum matter, especially one-dimensional gapped quantum systems. In critical lattice models, it is usually realized as emergent symmetries in the corresponding low-energy conformal field theories. In this work, we study critical lattice models with the noninvertible Rep($D_8$) symmetry in one dimension. This leads us to a new class of quantum critical points (QCP), noninvertible symmetry-enriched QCPs, as a generalization of known group symmetry-enriched QCPs. They are realized as phase transitions between one noninvertible symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phase and another different one or spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) phase. We identify their low-energy properties and topological features through the Kennedy-Tasaki (KT) duality transformation. We argue that distinct noninvertible symmetry-enriched QCPs can not be smoothly connected without a phase transition or a multi-critical point.</description>

Abstract: We consider an extension of the Standard Model with one or more scalar multiplets beyond the Higgs doublet $\Phi$. The additional scalar multiplets are supposed to carry arbitrary hypercharges. We prove that, in such a model, if the field configuration where only $\Phi$ has a nonzero vacuum expectation value (VEV) is a local minimum of the potential, then it has a lower value of the potential than any field configuration where both $\Phi$ and other scalar multiplets have nonzero VEVs. We also consider the field configurations where only one multiplet $\Xi$ (different from $\Phi$) with isospin $J \le 7/2$ has nonzero VEV; we compute the values of the potential at those possible vacua.</description>

Abstract: We study neutrino oscillations in background matter within the quantum field theory formalism where neutrino mass eigenstates are virtual particles. In this case, neutrino mass eigenstates are mixed owing to the interaction with matter. Assuming that neutrinos are Majorana particles, we find the exact propagators for massive neutrinos accounting for the interaction with matter by solving the analog of the Dyson equation. These propagators are used to calculate the transition probability which coincides with the prediction of the Mikheyev--Smirnov--Wolfenstein effect. Finally, we analyze the approximations made in our analysis.</description>

      <title>Friedmann cosmology with hyperfluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In metric-affine gravity, both the gravitational and matter actions depend not just on the metric, but also on the independent affine connection. Thus matter can be modeled as a hyperfluid, characterized by both the energy-momentum and hypermomentum tensors. The latter is defined as the variation of the matter action with respect to the connection and it encodes extra (micro)properties of particles. For a homogeneous and isotropic universe, it was recently shown that the generic cosmological hypermomentum possesses five degrees of freedom: one in dilation, two in shear, and two in spin part. The aim of the current work is to present the first systematic study of the implications of this perfect hyperfluid on the universe with Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker metric. We adopt a simple model with non-Riemannian Einstein-Hilbert gravitational action plus arbitrary hyperfluid matter, and solve analytically the cosmological equations for single and multiple component hypermomentum contributions using different assumptions about the equation of state. It is remarkable, that in a number of cases the forms of the time evolution of the Hubble function and energy density still coincide with their general relativity counterparts, only the respective indexes $\mathrm{w}_{\mathrm{eff}}$ and $\mathrm{w}_\rho$ start to differ due to the hypermomentum corrections. The results and insights we obtained are very general and can assist in constructing interesting models to resolve the issues in standard cosmology.</description>

      <title>Looking into the quantum entanglement in $H\to ZZ^\star$ at LHC within SMEFT framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study $H\to ZZ^\star$ production process in final four lepton states at $13$ TeV LHC within SMEFT framework. The anomalous $HZZ$ couplings are parameterized with dimension-6 $SU(2)_L\times U(1)_Y$ gauge invariant operators. We compute the eight polarizations of each $Z$ boson and $64$ spin-correlations as asymmetries in angular functions of final decayed leptons in the rest frame of the $Z$ boson. We perform the sensitivity analysis of these asymmetries to anomalous couplings and one parameter limits on these couplings at $95\%$ confidence level are obtained. These asymmetries are further used to construct the joint density matrix (DM) for $ZZ^\star$ system. However, such DM suffers from negative probability and eigenvalues. To alleviate the negativity issues, we reconstruct the DM using asymmetries of symmetrized angular functions owing to the indistinguishability of two $Z$ bosons. The symmetrized DM is further employed to compute lower bound for concurrence as a witness of entanglement measurable at the collider experiments. The $ZZ^\star$ system is found to be in an entangled state for all values of the anomalous couplings. Notably, while the lower bound exhibits poorer sensitivity to anomalous couplings compared to asymmetries, it demonstrates distinct behavior for CP-even and odd couplings.</description>

      <title>Crystalline-equivalent topological phases of many-body fermionic systems in one dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore one-dimensional fermionic symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases related by the crystalline equivalence principle. In particular, we study charge-conserving many-body topological phases of fermions protected respectively by chiral and reflection symmetries. While the classifications of the two crystalline-equivalent SPT phases are identical, their topological properties and phase structures can be very different, depending on the microscopic details. Specifically, we consider certain extensions of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, with and without interactions, that preserve both chiral and reflection symmetries, and explicitly compute the many-body topological invariants based on the systems' ground states. The phase structures determined by these topological invariants align perfectly with the many-body spectra of deformations among the models. As expected, gapped deformations exist only when all the topological invariants remain unchanged. Moreover, we show that decomposable systems -- those that can be decomposed into local and decoupled subsystems -- can be topologically characterized by real-space quantum numbers directly associated with the symmetries. For reflection-symmetric systems, these quantum numbers are related to the many-body topological invariants via a bulk-center correspondence, which can be justified using the Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence in generalized homology theory. Finally, we discuss the role of transition symmetry in the many-body topologies of these SPT phases.</description>

      <title>Quantum Cellular Automata on Symmetric Subalgebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate quantum cellular automata (QCA) on one-dimensional spin systems defined over a subalgebra of the full local operator algebra - the symmetric subalgebra under a finite Abelian group symmetry $G$. For systems where each site carries a regular representation of $G$, we establish a complete classification of such subalgebra QCAs based on two topological invariants: (1) a surjective homomorphism from the group of subalgebra QCAs to the group of anyon permutation symmetries in a $(2+1)d$ $G$ gauge theory; and (2) a generalization of the Gross-Nesme-Vogts-Werner (GNVW) index that characterizes the flow of the symmetric subalgebra. Specifically, two subalgebra QCAs correspond to the same anyon permutation and share the same index if and only if they differ by a finite-depth unitary circuit composed of $G$-symmetric local gates. We also identify a set of operations that generate all subalgebra QCAs through finite compositions. As an example, we examine the Kramers-Wannier duality on a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetric subalgebra, demonstrating that it maps to the $e$-$m$ permutation in the two-dimensional toric code and has an irrational index of $\sqrt{2}$. Therefore, it cannot be extended to a QCA over the full local operator algebra and mixes nontrivially with lattice translations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a framework for investigating the effects of interactions on crystalline symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases. Within this framework, one can establish a direct connection between the equivalence classes of free-fermion systems and their corresponding interacting classes. A central component of this framework is the Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence, which provides a systematic way to represent crystalline SPT phases as SPT phases with internal symmetries on subspaces. We demonstrate the application of this approach through examples in various dimensions: 1d systems with U(1) and reflection symmetry, 2d systems with U(1) and C_{n} rotation symmetry, and 3d systems with U(1) and inversion symmetry.</description>

      <title>Quadrupole gauge theory: anti-Higgs mechanism and elastic dual</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the duality between elasticity and fracton gauge theory, we study an extension of the gauge group that includes the quadrupole moment. Remarkably, we find that spontaneous breaking of the quadrupole symmetry increases the number of massless excitations. This result appears to challenge the well-established paradigm, according to which gauge fields acquire mass through the Higgs mechanism, and the would-be Goldstone bosons are rendered massive. We refer to this phenomenon as the anti-Higgs mechanism. Furthermore, in the standard treatment of the fracton-elasticity duality, the conservation of quadrupole moment is incorporated ad hoc in order to restrict the motion of dislocations to glide along their Burgers vectors. Our study clarifies the origin of the quadrupole symmetry in the dual theory of elasticity, demonstrating that quadrupole gauge theory is not a priori dual to elastic solids but rather to a distinct class of systems, which we dub incompressible crystals. We argue, however, that the phenomenology of ordinary elasticity is recovered after the quadrupole symmetry is Higgsed and an incompressible crystal undergoes a phase transition to a compressible solid state.</description>

Abstract: Loop Quantum Gravity faces challenges in constructing a well-defined Hamiltonian constraint and understanding the quantum notion of time. In this paper these issues are studied by quantizing the $U(1)^3$ model, a simplified system exhibiting features similar to general relativity. By isolating a holonomy component within the Hamiltonian constraint, a discrete relative time evolution equation for quantum states is obtained. Then a Shr\"{o}dinger-like equation is derived in continuous limit. Thus the physical states solving this Shr\"{o}dinger-like equation can be written out. The emergence of the time parameter and its corresponding quantum operator are analyzed. It indicates the notion of a geometrical quantum time for quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Indirect detection of the QCD axion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The QCD axion, originally proposed to solve the strong CP problem in QCD, is a prominent candidate for dark matter (DM). In the presence of strong magnetic fields, such as those around neutron stars, axions can theoretically convert into photons, producing detectable electromagnetic signals. This axion-photon coupling provides a unique experimental pathway to probe axions within a specific mass range. We investigate a novel observational approach using the Green Bank Telescope (GBT) to search for radio transients that could arise from interactions between neutron stars and dense DM clumps known as axion miniclusters. By observing the core of Andromeda with the VErsatile GBT Astronomical Spectrometer (VEGAS) and the X-band receiver (8 to 10 GHz), we achieve sensitivity to axions with masses in the range of (33 - 42)$\,\mu$eV, with a mass resolution of $3.8 \times 10^{-4}\,\mu$eV. We detail our observational and analytical strategies developed to capture transient signals from axion-photon conversion, achieving an instrumental sensitivity of $2\,$mJy per spectral channel. Despite our sensitivity threshold, no candidate signals exceeding the 5$\sigma$ level were identified. Future implementations will extend this search across additional spectral bands and refine the modeling used for the processes involved, strengthening the constraints on axion DM models.</description>

      <title>Centre vortex evidence for a second finite-temperature QCD transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evidence for the existence of a second finite-temperature transition in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is obtained through the study of centre vortex geometry and its evolution with temperature. The dynamical anisotropic ensembles of the FASTSUM collaboration are utilised to conduct a comprehensive analysis at eight temperatures beyond the established chiral transition. Visualisations of the centre vortex structure in temporal and spatial slices of the lattice reveal that vortex percolation persists through the chiral transition and ceases at a temperature that is approximately twice the chiral transition temperature $T_c$. This implies that confinement is retained through temperatures up to $T \approx 2\,T_c$, pointing towards a second transition corresponding to deconfinement. The loss of percolation is quantified by the vortex cluster extent, providing a clear signal for the deconfinement transition. Additional vortex statistics, including temporal correlations, vortex and branching point densities, the number of secondary clusters and vortex chain lengths between branching points, are scrutinised as a function of temperature. All ten measures investigated herein show the characteristics of two transitions in QCD, encompassing the chiral transition at $T_c$ and the deconfinement transition at $T \approx 2\,T_c$. Performing an inflection point analysis on the vortex and branching point densities produces an estimate of $T_c$ that agrees with the known FASTSUM value. By the same procedure, a precise estimate of the deconfinement point is extracted as $T_d = 321(6)\,$MeV.</description>

      <title>The First Law and Weak Cosmic Censorship for de Sitter Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply Iyer-Wald's covariant phase space formalism to asymptotically de Sitter spacetimes and establish the thermodynamic first law, expressed in terms of the Abbott-Deser mass. Similar to Iyer-Wald's first law for asymptotically flat black holes, our first law applies to general asymptotically de Sitter perturbations around a Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m-de Sitter black hole, without imposing any symmetry for the perturbations. We explicitly derive the first law up to the second order in perturbation. Additionally, we apply this first law to a thought experiment involving the overcharging of a Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m-de Sitter black hole by injecting energy and charge sources. We find that asymptotically de Sitter black holes cannot be overcharged, provided that the null energy condition holds, thereby reinforcing the weak cosmic censorship conjecture.</description>

Abstract: Spectral decomposition with respect to the wave functions of Ruijsenaars hyperbolic system defines an integral transform, which generalizes classical Fourier integral. For a certain class of analytical symmetric functions we prove inversion formula and orthogonality relations, valid for complex valued parameters of the system. Besides, we study four regimes of unitarity, when this transform defines isomorphisms of the corresponding $L_2$ spaces.</description>

Abstract: The Euler discriminant of a family of very affine varieties is defined as the locus where the Euler characteristic drops. In this work, we study the Euler discriminant of families of complements of hyperplanes. We prove that the Euler discriminant is a hypersurface in the space of coefficients, and provide its defining equation in two cases: (1) when the coefficients are generic, and (2) when they are constrained to a proper subspace. In the generic case, we show that the multiplicities of the components can be recovered combinatorially. This analysis also recovers the singularities of an Euler integral. In the appendix, we discuss a relation to cosmological correlators.</description>

      <title>Kinetic Gauge Friction in Natural Inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study an extension of the natural inflation model comprising a non-Abelian gauge sector coupled to the axion-inflaton kinetic term. We show how such non-minimal coupling serves as a source of friction for the rolling inflaton granting sixty or more $e$-folds of accelerated expansion for sub-Planckian values of the axion decay constant. The analysis of perturbations reveals a negative sound speed, thus signaling an instability. Implementing a Chern-Simons-type coupling between the inflaton and gauge sectors cures the instability by delivering a positive speed. We perform a numerical study of scalar and tensor perturbations for a fiducial set of parameters finding that the corresponding observables are compatible with current CMB bounds.</description>

Abstract: We study exceptional algebroids in the context of warped compactifications of type IIA string theory down to $n$ dimensions, with $n\le 6$. In contrast to the M-theory and type IIB case, the relevant algebroids are no longer exact, and their locali moduli space is no longer trivial, but has $5$ distinct points. This relates to two possible scalar deformations of the IIA theory. The proof of the local classification shows that, in addition to these scalar deformations, one can twist the bracket using a pair of $1$-forms, a $2$-form, a $3$-form, and a $4$-form. Furthermore, we use the analysis to translate the classification of Leibniz parallelisable spaces (corresponding to maximally supersymmetric consistent truncations) into a tractable algebraic problem. We finish with a discussion of the Poisson-Lie U-duality and examples given by tori and spheres in $2$, $3$, and $4$ dimensions.</description>

      <title>New phases of $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM at finite chemical potential</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.07134v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We do a systematic search of supergravity solutions that, via the AdS$_5$/CFT$_4$ correspondence, are dual to thermal states in $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM at finite chemical potential. These solutions dominate the microcanonical ensemble and are required to ultimately reproduce the microscopic entropy of AdS black holes. Using a mix of analytical and numerical methods, we construct and study static charged hairy solitonic and black hole solutions with global AdS$_5$ asymptotics. They are constructed in two distinct consistent truncations of five dimensional gauged supergravity (and can thus be uplifted to asymptotically AdS$_5\times$S$^5$ solutions of type IIB supergravity). In the "single charge" truncation which consists of one charged scalar field, hairy black holes exist above a critical charge and merge with the known Behrndt-Cveti\v{c}-Sabra (BCS) black holes along a curve determined by the onset of superradiance in the latter family. The lowest mass hairy black hole is a singular zero entropy soliton. In the "two charge" truncation which consists of a two equal charged scalar fields, hairy black holes exist for all charges and merge with the known BCS black holes along their superradiant onset curve. The lowest mass hairy black hole is a smooth supersymmetric zero entropy soliton. Together with the known phases of the truncation with three equal charges, our findings permit a good understanding of the full phase space of SYM thermal states with three arbitrary chemical potentials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.01130v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define the notion of Y-algebroids, generalising the Lie, Courant, and exceptional algebroids that have been used to capture the local symmetry structure of type II string theory and M-theory compactifications to $D \geq 5$ dimensions. Instead of an invariant inner product, or its generalisation arising in exceptional algebroids, Y-algebroids are built around a specific type of tensor, denoted $Y$, that provides exactly the necessary properties to also describe compactifications to $D=4$ dimensions. We classify "M-exact" $E_7$-algebroids and show that this precisely matches the form of the generalised tangent space of $E_{7(7)} \times \mathbb{R}^+$-generalised geometry, with possible twists due to 1-, 4- and 7-form fluxes, corresponding physically to the derivative of the warp factor and the M-theory fluxes. We translate the notion of generalised Leibniz parallelisable spaces, relevant to consistent truncations, into this language, where they are mapped to so-called exceptional Manin pairs. We also show how to understand Poisson-Lie U-duality and exceptional complex structures using Y-algebroids.</description>

Abstract: Loop Vertex Expansion (LVE) was developed to construct QFT models with local and non-local interactions. Using LVE, one can prove the analyticity in the finite cardioid-like domain in the complex plain of the coupling constant of the free energies and cumulants of various vector, matrix, or tensor-type models. Here, applying the idea of choosing the initial approximation depending on the coupling constant, we construct the analytic continuation of the free energy of the quartic matrix model beyond the standard LVE cardioid over the branch cut and for arbitrary large couplings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03243v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on the thermal phase structure of pure SU(2) quantum Yang-Mills theory, we describe the electron at rest as an extended particle, a droplet of radius $r_0\sim a_0$, where $a_0$ is the Bohr radius. This droplet is of vanishing pressure and traps a monopole within its bulk at a temperature of $T_c=7.95$ keV. The monopole is the Bogomolny-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) limit. It is interpreted in an electric-magnetically dual way. Utilizing a spherical mirror-charge construction, we approximate the droplet's charge at a value of the electromagnetic fine-structure constant $\alpha$ of $\alpha^{-1}\sim 134$ for soft external probes. It is shown that the droplet does not exhibit an electric dipole or quadrupole moment due to averages of its far-field electric potential over monopole positions. We also calculate the mixing angle $\theta_{\rm W}\sim 30^{\circ}$ which belongs to deconfining phases of two SU(2) gauge theories of very distinct Yang-Mills scales ($\Lambda_{\rm e}=3.6\,$keV and $\Lambda_{\rm CMB}\sim 10^{-4}\,$eV). Here, the condition that the droplet's bulk thermodynamics is stable determines the value of $\theta_W$. The core radius of the monopole, whose inverse equals the droplet's mass in natural units, is about 1% of $r_0$.</description>

      <title>Global shift symmetry on an ADM hypersurface: Toward emergent gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01996v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generalized symmetries and their spontaneous breakdown serve as the fundamental concept to constrain the many-body entanglement structure, which allows us to characterize quantum phases of matter and emergent collective excitations. For example, emergent photons may be understood by spontaneous 1-form symmetry breaking, which results from a long-ranged entanglement structure between UV microscopic degrees of freedom. In this study, we show that emergent ``gravity" may also arise in a similar fashion, where quotes have been used to emphasize that the symmetry-constrained gravitons show unconventional properties compared to usual gravitons. As the electric 1-form symmetry in Maxwell theory is realized as a global shift symmetry of the spatial component of the U(1) gauge field, generated by the electric field, we demonstrate that a constant shift of the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner (ADM) metric on the spatial hypersurface can be viewed as a global symmetry, generated by the ADM canonical momentum. Deriving a vector-type conserved charge from the variation of action, we construct a shift symmetry operator. Considering a Wick rotation, we demonstrate that a gravitational Wilson loop is charged under the action of this shift symmetry operator, which thus confirms the existence of a generalized global symmetry on the ADM hypersurface. Based on the Ward identity, we show that the spontaneous breaking of this global shift symmetry may give rise to a nonpropagating massless symmetric gauge field at the boundary of the hypersurface.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08541v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Asymptotic safety is a powerful mechanism for obtaining a consistent and predictive quantum field theory beyond the realm of perturbation theory. It hinges on an interacting fixed point of the Wilsonian renormalization group flow which controls the microscopic dynamics. Connecting the fixed point to observations requires constructing the set of effective actions compatible with this microscopic dynamics. Technically, this information is stored in the UV-critical surface of the fixed point. In this work, we describe a novel approach for extracting this information based on analytical and pseudo-spectral methods. Our construction is illustrated at the level of the two-dimensional Ising model and easily generalizes to any asymptotically safe quantum field theory. It also constitutes an important step towards setting up a well-founded swampland program within the gravitational asymptotic safety program.</description>

      <title>Critical spin chains and loop models with $PSU(n)$ symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01935v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Starting with the Ising model, statistical models with global symmetries provide fruitful approaches to interesting physical systems, for example percolation or polymers. These include the $O(n)$ model (symmetry group $O(n)$) and the Potts model (symmetry group $S_Q$). Both models make sense for $n,Q\in \mathbb{C}$ and not just $n,Q\in \mathbb{N}$, and both give rise to a conformal field theory in the critical limit.
  Here, we study similar models based on the group $PSU(n)$. We focus on the two-dimensional case, where the models can be described either as gases of non-intersecting orientable loops, or as alternating spin chains. This allows us to determine their spectra either by computing a twisted torus partition function, or by studying representations of the walled Brauer algebra.
  In the critical limit, our models give rise to a CFT that exists for any $n\in\mathbb{C}$ and has a global $PSU(n)$ symmetry. Its spectrum is similar to those of the $O(n)$ and Potts CFTs, but a bit simpler. We conjecture that the $O(n)$ CFT is a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ orbifold of the $PSU(n)$ CFT, where $\mathbb{Z}_2$ acts as complex conjugation.</description>

      <title>Relational Lorentzian Asymptotically Safe Quantum Gravity: Showcase model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18224v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a recent contribution we identified possible points of contact between the asymptotically safe and canonical approach to quantum gravity. The idea is to start from the reduced phase space (often called relational) formulation of canonical quantum gravity which provides a reduced (or physical) Hamiltonian for the true (observable) degrees of freedom. The resulting reduced phase space is then canonically quantised and one can construct the generating functional of time ordered Wightman (i.e. Feynman) or Schwinger distributions respectively from the corresponding time translation unitary group or contraction semigroup respectively as a path integral. For the unitary choice that path integral can be rewritten in terms of the Lorentzian Einstein Hilbert action plus observable matter action and a ghost action. The ghost action depends on the Hilbert space representation chosen for the canonical quantisation and a reduction term that encodes the reduction of the full phase space to the phase space of observavbles. This path integral can then be treated with the methods of asymptically safe quantum gravity in its {\it Lorentzian} version.
  We also exemplified the procedure using a concrete, minimalistic example namely Einstein-Klein-Gordon theory with as many neutral and massless scalar fields as there are spacetime dimensions. However, no explicit calculations were performed. In this paper we fill in the missing steps. Particular care is needed due to the necessary switch to Lorentzian signature which has strong impact on the convergence of ``heat'' kernel time integrals in the heat kernel expansion of the trace involved in the Wetterich equation and which requires different cut-off functions than in the Euclidian version. As usual we truncate at relatively low order and derive and solve the resulting flow equations in that approximation.</description>

Abstract: The duality of Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity and a double scaled matrix integral has led to studies of the canonical spectral form factor (SFF) in the so called $\tau-$scaled limit of large times, $t \to \infty$, and fixed temperature in order to demonstrate agreement with universal random matrix theory (RMT). Though this has been established for the unitary case, extensions to other symmetry classes requires the inclusion of unorientable manifolds in the sum over geometries, necessary to address time reversal invariance, and regularization of the corresponding prime geometrical objects, the Weil-Petersson (WP) volumes. We report here how universal signatures of quantum chaos, witnessed by the fidelity to the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble, emerge for the low-energy limit of unorientable JT gravity, i.e. the Airy model/topological gravity. To this end, we implement the loop equations for the corresponding dual (double-scaled) matrix model and find the generic form of the Airy WP volumes, supported by calculations using unorientable Kontsevich graphs. In an apparent violation of the gravity/chaos duality, the $\tau-$scaled SFF on the gravity side acquires both logarithmic and power law contributions in $t$, not manifestly present on the RMT side. We show the expressions can be made to agree by means of bootstrapping-like relations hidden in the asymptotic expansions of generalized hypergeometric functions. Thus, we are able to establish strong evidence of the quantum chaotic nature of unorientable topological gravity.</description>

Abstract: Soft hairs are an intrinsic infrared feature of a black hole, which may also affect near-horizon physics. In this work, we study some of the subtleties surrounding one of the primary observables with which we can study their effects in the context of Einstein's gravity: the black hole shadow. First, we clarify the singular pathology associated with black holes with soft hairs and demonstrate that the metrics of linearly superrotated black holes are free of near-zone pathologies due to appropriate asymptotic falloff conditions being imposed on the event horizon. We then analytically construct the photon orbits around such black holes, derive the shadow equation for near-zone observers, and find that the linear superrotation hairs deform the circular shadow of a bald Schwarzchild black hole into an ellipse. This is in sharp contrast to their supertranslated counterparts, which only shift the position of the center of the circular shadow but do not change its shape. Our results suggest a richness to the observable effects due to the infrared structures of Einstein's gravity.</description>

      <title>Non-Invertible Surface Defects in 2+1d QFTs from Half Spacetime Gauging</title>

Abstract: We study duality defects in 2+1d theories with $\bZ^{(0)}_N\times\bZ^{(1)}_N$ global symmetry and trivial mixed 't Hooft anomaly. By gauging these symmetries simultaneously in half of the spacetime, we define duality defects for theories that are self-dual under gauging. We calculate the fusion rules involving duality defects and show that they obey a fusion 2-category. We also construct the corresponding symmetry topological field theory, a four-dimensional BF theory on a slab which realizes the duality defects on the boundary upon shrinking the interval. Furthermore, we provide explicit examples of such duality defects in $U(1)\times U(1)$ gauge theories and in more general product theories. Finally, we find duality defects in non-Lagrangian theories obtained by compactification of 6d $\cN=(2,0)$ SCFTs of type $A_{N-1}$ on various three-manifolds.</description>

      <title>WZW terms without anomalies: generalised symmetries in chiral Lagrangians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20340v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a 4d non-linear sigma model on the coset $(\mathrm{SU}(N)_L \times \mathrm{SU}(N)_R \times \mathrm{SU}(2))/(\mathrm{SU}(N)_{L+R}\times \mathrm{U}(1))\cong \mathrm{SU}(N) \times S^2$, that features a topological Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) term whose curvature is $\frac{n}{24\pi^2}\mathrm{Tr}(g^{-1}dg)^3 \wedge \mathrm{Vol}_{S^2}$ where $g$ is the $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ pion field. This WZW term, unlike its familiar cousin in QCD, does not match any chiral anomaly, so its microscopic origin is not obviously QCD-like. We find that generalised symmetries provide a key to unlocking a UV completion. The $S^2$ winding number bestows the theory with a 1-form symmetry, and the WZW term intertwines this with the $\mathrm{SU}(N)^2$ flavour symmetry into a 2-group global symmetry. Like a 't Hooft anomaly, the 2-group symmetry should match between UV and IR, precluding QCD-like completions that otherwise give the right pion manifold. We instead construct a weakly-coupled UV completion that matches the 2-group symmetry, in which an abelian gauge field connects the QCD baryon number current to the winding number current of a $\mathbb{C}P^1$ model, and explicitly show how the mixed WZW term arises upon flowing to the IR. The coefficient is fixed to be the number of QCD colours and, strikingly, this matching must be 'tree-level exact' to satisfy a quantization condition. We discuss generalisations, and elucidate the more intricate generalised symmetry structure that arises upon gauging an anomaly-free subgroup of $\mathrm{SU}(N)_{L+R}$. This WZW term may even play a phenomenological role as a portal to a dark sector, that determines the relic abundance of dark matter.</description>

      <title>Thermal and Quantum Phase Transitions of the $\phi^4$ Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20704v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The critical behaviour of the classical (thermal) phase transition (CPT) of the Ising model is in the same universality class of the quantum phase transition (QPT) of the $\phi^4$ Quantum Field Theory (QFT). Our goal in this work is to map out the QPT-CPT diagram of the $\phi^4$ QFT, and to revisit its relation to the well-known QPT-CPT phase diagram of the Ising model. To this aim, we propose a modification of the usual finite-temperature Renormalization Group (RG) approach by relating the temperature parameter to the running RG scale, $T \equiv k_T = \tau k$ where $k_T$ is the running cutoff for thermal, and $k$ is for the quantum fluctuations. Once introduced this dimesionless temperature $\tau$, we investigate the consequences on the thermal RG approach for the $\phi^4$ model and construct its QPT-CPT phase diagram. Finally, we formulate requirements for the QPT-CPT phase diagram of the $\phi^4$ theory based on known properties of the QPT-CPT phase diagram of the Ising model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02281v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct the ($\beta$-deformed) higher order total derivative operators and analyze their remarkable properties. In terms of these operators, we derive the higher order constraints for the ($\beta$-deformed) Hermitian matrix models. We prove that these ($\beta$-deformed) higher order constraints are reducible to the Virasoro constraints. Meanwhile, the Itoyama-Matsuo conjecture for the constraints of the Hermitian matrix model is proved. We also find that through rescaling variable transformations, two sets of the constraint operators become the $W$-operators of $W$-representations for the ($\beta$-deformed) partition function hierarchies in the literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04577v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study Polchinski's "fermion-rotor system" as an accurate description of charged Weyl fermions scattering on a magnetic monopole core in the limit of zero gauge coupling. Traditionally it was thought such scattering could lead to fractional particle numbers ("semitons"). By direct calculations we show those semitonic processes are in fact free propagation, facilitated by composite fermion-rotor operators interpolating the "forbidden" states, effectively "recovering" both ingoing and outgoing states in every lowest partial wave. Non-semitonic Callan-Rubakov processes are unchanged.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave forms for extreme mass ratio collisions from supersymmetric gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07329v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the wave form emitted by a particle moving along an arbitrary (in general open) geodesic of the Schwarzschild geometry. The mathematical problem can be phrased in terms of quantities in ${\cal N}=2$ supersymmetric gauge theories that can be calculated by using localization and the AGT correspondence. In particular through this mapping, the post-Newtonian expansion of the wave form is expressed as a double instanton sum with rational coefficients that resums all tail contributions into Gamma functions and exponentials. The formulae we obtain are valid for generic values of the orbital quantum numbers $\ell$ and $m$. For $\ell=2,3$ we check explicitly that our results agree with the small mass ratio limit of the wave forms derived in the Multipole Post-Minkowskian and the amplitudes approaches. We show how the so-called tail and tail of tail contributions to the wave form arise in our approach. Finally, we derive a universal formula for the soft limit of the wave form that resums all logarithmic divergent terms of the form $\omega^{n-1} (\log \omega)^n$.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative Resolution of Strong Coupling Singularities in 4d N=1 Heterotic/M-theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12458v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the interior of the moduli space of four-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=1$ theories of gravity arising from compactifications of the $E_8\times E_8$ heterotic string on Calabi-Yau threefolds. By studying the threshold corrections to the coupling of the heterotic gauge groups, we infer the existence of a strong coupling singularity for one of the perturbative heterotic gauge groups, which effectively yields an additional finite distance boundary of the classical scalar field space. In heterotic M-theory, this boundary maps to a domain wall solution for which the gauge coupling and the warp factor on one of the Horava-Witten 9-branes diverge, thus highlighting the gravitational origin of the classical strong coupling singularity. The divergence of the warp factor is, however, regulated once non-perturbative effects are taken into account, as we demonstrate by studying the instanton corrections to the 5d BPS domain wall equations. This regularization implies that the classical strong coupling boundary of the scalar field 4d $\mathcal{N}=1$ heterotic/M-theory is resolved, indicating that, at the quantum level, the field space can be extended beyond this classical boundary.</description>

Abstract: We construct the boundary algebraic Bethe Ansatz for the AdS3 X S3 X T4 integrable reflection problem restricted to the massless sector. We derive the double-row monodromy and find the appropriate formulation of the dual equation of Sklyanin's. We perform the algebraic Bethe ansatz and obtain the RTT (more properly the RTRT) relations, from which the spectrum is obtained by repeated action of the B operator on the pseudovacuum. We obtain the Bethe equations by cancelling the unwanted terms, and prove the exact formulae for any number of quantum particles and magnonic excitations.</description>

Abstract: We propose a holographic duality for the boundary Lifshitz field theory (BLFT). Similar to holographic BCFT, holographic BLFT can be consistently defined by imposing either a Neumann boundary condition (NBC) or a conformal boundary condition (CBC) on the end of the world (EOW) brane. We propose $g$-functions and derive $g$-theorem for these two types of holographic BLFT. On the field theory side, we consider BLFT whose path integral is prescribed to include also paths bouncing off the boundary. The entanglement entropy for an interval for the Lifshitz invariant ground state is computed in the saddle point approximation, and is found to agree precisely with the holographic result in both limits when the interval is very close or very far away from the boundary.</description>

      <title>Nonresonant renormalization scheme for twist-$2$ operators in SU($N$) Yang-Mills theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15366v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, the short-distance asymptotics of the generating functional of $n$-point correlators of twist-$2$ operators in SU($N$) Yang-Mills (YM) theory has been worked out in [1]. The above computation relies on a basis change of renormalized twist-$2$ operators, where $-\gamma(g)/ \beta(g)$ reduces to $\gamma_0/ (\beta_0\,g)$ to all orders of perturbation theory, with $\gamma_0$ diagonal, $\gamma(g) = \gamma_0 g^2+\ldots$ the anomalous-dimension matrix and $\beta(g) = -\beta_0 g^3+\ldots$ the beta function. The construction is based on a novel geometric interpretation of operator mixing [2], under the assumption that the eigenvalues of the matrix $\gamma_0/ \beta_0$ satisfy the nonresonant condition $\lambda_i-\lambda_j\neq 2k$, with $\lambda_i$ in nonincreasing order and $k\in \mathbb{N}^+$. The nonresonant condition has been numerically verified up to $i,j=10^4$ in [1]. In the present paper we provide a number theoretic proof of the nonresonant condition for twist-$2$ operators essentially based on the classic result that Harmonic numbers are not integers. Our proof in YM theory can be extended with minor modifications to twist-$2$ operators in $\mathcal{N}=1$ SUSY YM theory, large-$N$ QCD with massless quarks and massless QCD-like theories.</description>

They are Euclidean type IIB supergravity solutions given in terms of an electrostatic potential, having $SO(7)\times SO(3)$ isometry and 16 supersymmetries. Quantizing the fluxes, we find that the supergravity solutions are in one-to-one correspondence with fuzzy sphere vacua of the matrix model.</description>

Abstract: The overlaps between integrable matrix product states (MPS) and Bethe states are important in both the non-equilibrium statistical physics and the AdS/CFT duality. We present the general MPS overlap formula. The result is a product of a ratio of Gaudin determinants and a prefactor. The Gaudin determinants depend on the spin chain but not on the MPS. The MPS dependent prefactor is given for all integrable MPS of the $\mathfrak{gl}_{N}$, $\mathfrak{o}_{N}$ and $\mathfrak{sp}_{N}$ symmetric spin chains with arbitrary representations.</description>

      <title>Holographic correlation functions from wedge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12420v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel holographic method for computing correlation functions of operators in conformal field theories. This method refines previous approaches and is specifically aimed at being applied to heavy operators. For operators that correspond to particles in the bulk, we show that the correlation functions can be derived from the on-shell actions of excised geometries for heavy operators, using numerical and perturbative calculations. These excised geometries are constructed from various background solutions such as \Poincare AdS$_3$, global AdS$_3$, and BTZ by cutting out a wedge bounded by two intersecting End-of-the-world branes and the AdS boundary. The wedge itself can be interpreted as a dual to a BCFT with cusps in the AdS/BCFT framework. Additionally, we calculate the correlation functions for heavy operators directly by constructing backreacted bulk geometries for particle excitations through coordinate transformations from a conical solution. We find that the on-shell actions of these backreacted solutions accurately reproduce correlation functions, although they differ from those computed in Fefferman-Graham(FG) gauge. This discrepancy, previously noted and explained in our earlier work, is reinforced by additional examples presented here.</description>

      <title>Leading Higher Derivative Corrections to Multipole Moments of Kerr-Newman Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13639v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the (leading) 4-derivative corrections, including both parity even and odd terms, to electrically-charged Kerr-Newman black holes. The linear perturbative equations are then solved order by order in terms of two dimensionless rotating and charge parameters. The solution allows us to extract the multipole moments of mass and current from the metric as well as the electric and magnetic multipole moments from the Maxwell field. We find that all the multipole moments are invariant under the field redefinition, indicating they are well-defined physical observables in this effective theory approach to quantum gravity. We also find that parity-odd corrections can turn on the multipole moments that vanish in Einstein theory, which may have significant observational implications.</description>

      <title>Preheating Axions in String Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18496v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Certain inflationary models can feature periods of preheating - an era preceding reheating during which parametric resonance triggers an exponential production of bosons. This non-perturbative process can have significant impact on the history of our universe, with consequences ranging from altered reheating channels to overproduction of dark radiation to overclosure. In this work, we study parametric resonance production of axions in string models of inflation. We find that the kinetic couplings and moduli-dependent axion masses give rise to generalizations of the Mathieu equation. We study these generalizations and determine the strength of parametric resonance created by such couplings. We then apply this technology to fibre inflation models in Type IIB orientifold compactifications. We find that heavy axions can be copiously produced and avoidance of overclosure results in constraints on the typical fibre inflation parameter space.</description>

      <title>Can multipartite entanglement be characterized by two-point connected correlation functions ?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.03605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.03605v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss under which conditions multipartite entanglement in mixed quantum states can be characterized only in terms of two-point connected correlation functions, as it is the case for pure states. In turn, the latter correlations are defined via a suitable combination of (disconnected) one- and two-point correlation functions. In contrast to the case of pure states, conditions to be satisfied turn out to be rather severe. However, we were able to identify some interesting cases, as when the point-independence is valid of the one-point correlations in each possible decomposition of the density matrix, or when the operators that enter in the correlations are (semi-)positive/negative defined.</description>

      <title>Laws of thermodynamic equilibrium within first order relativistic hydrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.11843v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using recently developed consistent and robust first order relativistic hydrodynamics of a dissipative fluid we propose a generalization but weak version of Tolman-Ehrenfest relation and Klein's law on a general background spacetime. These relations are appeared to be a consequence of thermal equilibrium state of the fluid, defined by the absence of heat flux. We interpret them as the defining relations for the local temperature and chemical potential of the fluid. The validity of usual Tolman-Ehrenfest relation and Klein's law deeply depends on the existence of a global timelike Killing vector. However imposition of more stronger equilibrium condition -- local conservation of entropy current -- yields the constancy of the equilibrium thermodynamic parameters along the flow lines.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.15147v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a new approach to T-duality based on Courant algebroid relations which subsumes the usual T-duality as well as its various generalisations. Starting from a relational description for the reduction of exact Courant algebroids over foliated manifolds, we introduce a weakened notion of generalised isometries that captures the generalised geometry counterpart of Riemannian submersions when applied to transverse generalised metrics. This is used to construct T-dual backgrounds as generalised metrics on reduced Courant algebroids which are related by a generalised isometry. We prove an existence and uniqueness result for generalised isometric exact Courant algebroids coming from reductions. We demonstrate that our construction reproduces standard T-duality relations based on correspondence spaces. We also describe how it applies to generalised T-duality transformations of almost para-Hermitian manifolds.</description>

      <title>Mixed-state quantum anomaly and multipartite entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17357v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement measures of many-body states have been increasingly useful to characterize phases of matter. Here we explore a surprising connection between mixed state entanglement and 't Hooft anomaly. More specifically, we consider lattice systems in $d$ space dimensions with anomalous symmetry $G$ where the anomaly is characterized by an invariant in the group cohomology $H^{d+2}(G,U(1))$. We show that any mixed state $\rho$ that is strongly symmetric under $G$, in the sense that $G\rho\propto\rho$, is necessarily $(d+2)$-nonseparable, i.e. is not the mixture of tensor products of $d+2$ states in the Hilbert space. Furthermore, such states cannot be prepared from any $(d+2)$-separable states using finite-depth local quantum channels, so the nonseparability is long-ranged in nature. We provide proof of these results in $d\leq1$, and plausibility arguments in $d&gt;1$. The anomaly-nonseparability connection thus allows us to generate simple examples of mixed states with nontrivial long-ranged multipartite entanglement. In particular, in $d=1$ we found an example of intrinsically mixed quantum phase, in the sense that states in this phase cannot be two-way connected to any pure state through finite-depth local quantum channels. We also analyze mixed anomaly involving both strong and weak symmetries, including systems constrained by the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis type of anomaly. We find that, while strong-weak mixed anomaly in general does not constrain quantum entanglement, it does constrain long-range correlations of mixed states in nontrivial ways. Namely, such states are not symmetrically invertible and not gapped Markovian, generalizing familiar properties of anomalous pure states.</description>

      <title>Using non-DESI data to confirm and strengthen the DESI 2024 spatially-flat $w_0w_a$CDM cosmological parameterization result</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00502v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use a combination of Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy data and non-CMB data that include Pantheon+ type Ia supernovae (SNIa), Hubble parameter [$H(z)$], growth factor ($f\sigma_8$) measurements, and a collection of baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data, but not recent DESI 2024 BAO measurements, to confirm the DESI 2024 (DESI+CMB+PantheonPlus) data compilation support for dynamical dark energy with an evolving equation of state parameter $w(z) = w_0 + w_a z/(1+z)$. From our joint compilation of CMB and non-CMB data, in a spatially-flat cosmological model, we obtain $w_0 = -0.850 \pm 0.059$ and $w_a = -0.59^{+0.26}_{-0.22}$ and find that this dynamical dark energy is favored over a cosmological constant by $\sim 2\sigma$. Our data constraints on the flat $w_0w_a$CDM parameterization are slightly more restrictive than the DESI 2024 constraints, with the DESI 2024 and our values of $w_0$ and $w_a$ differing by $-0.27\sigma$ and $0.44\sigma$, respectively. Our data compilation slightly more strongly favors the flat $w_0w_a$CDM model over the flat $\Lambda$CDM model than does the DESI 2024 data compilation. We note that our CMB and non-CMB data $w_0w_a$CDM parameterization cosmological constraints are discrepant at 2.7$\sigma$, a little larger than the 1.9$\sigma$ discrepancy between DESI DR1 BAO and CMB data flat $\Lambda$CDM model cosmological constraints. We also show that if we remove the Pantheon+ SNIa contribution from the non-CMB data, for the $w_0w_a$CDM parameterization we still find tension between P18 and non-CMB data (2.5$\sigma$) and P18+lensing and non-CMB data (2.4$\sigma$). Even after the exclusion of Pantheon+ SNIa data the $\Lambda$CDM model is still disfavoured at $\sim 2\sigma$ c.l.</description>

      <title>Relic gravitons and non-stationary processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02193v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stationary processes do not accurately describe the diffuse backgrounds of relic gravitons whose correlations are homogeneous in space (i.e. only dependent upon the distance between the two spatial locations) but not in time. The symmetries of the autocorrelations ultimately reflect the quantum mechanical origin of the diffuse backgrounds and lead to non-stationary observables at late time. In particular, large oscillations are believed to arise in the spectral energy density that is customarily (but approximately) related to the tensor power spectrum. When the full expression of the spectral energy density is employed the amplitudes of oscillation are instead suppressed in the large-scale limit and the non-stationary features of the late-time signal practically disappear. For similar reasons the relations between the spectral energy density and the spectral amplitude are ambiguous in the presence of non-stationary features. While it is debatable if the non-stationary features are (or will be) directly detectable, we argue that the spectral amplitude following from the Wiener-Khintchine theorem is generally inappropriate for a consistent description of the relic signal. Nevertheless the strong oscillatory behaviour of the late-time observables is naturally smeared out provided the spectral energy density is selected as pivotal variable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18828v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate D-term inflation within the framework of supergravity, employing the minimal K\"{a}hler potential. Following previous studies that revealed that this model can overcome the $\eta$-problem found in F-term models, we explore reheating dynamics and gravitino production, emphasizing the interplay between reheating temperature, spectral index, and gravitino abundance. Our analysis indicates that gravitino production is sensitive to the equation of state during reheating, affecting the reheating temperature and subsequent dark matter relic density. Furthermore, we analyze gravitational waves generated by cosmic strings, providing critical constraints on early Universe dynamics and cosmic string properties, the energy scales of both inflation and string formation influence the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) generated by these cosmic strings.</description>

      <title>Localization in two-dimensional fermions with arbitrary pseudospin</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01689v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In condensed matter, limited symmetry constraints allow free fermionic excitations to exist beyond the conventional Weyl and Dirac electrons of high-energy physics. These excitations carry a higher pseudospin, naturally generalizing the Weyl fermion. How do electrons beyond the conventional Dirac and Weyl fermions localize under disorder? In this Letter, we solve the problem of localization of two-dimensional free fermionic excitations carrying an arbitrary pseudospin-$s$. We derive exact analytical expressions for fermionic wavefunctions and exploit their curious mathematical connection to Pascal's triangle to evaluate relevant quantities such as scattering time, renormalized velocity, Cooperon, and magnetoconductivity. We discover that the gapless Cooperon mode solely depends on the pseudospin even when the Fermi surface is composed of multiple pockets, leading to weak localization (antilocalization) behavior for integer (half-integer) $s$, irrespective of the band index. Remarkably, the localization corrections increase with $s$, but the relative localization corrections are found to decrease with $s$, i.e., faster-moving relativistic electrons are less susceptible to disorder effects. Coupled with our elementary analysis on electron-electron interactions, this sheds insights on Anderson and many-body localization in these materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14428v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the effects of integrability breaking on the relaxation dynamics of the (double) sine-Gordon model. Compared to previous studies, we apply an alternative viewpoint motivated by open-system physics by separating the phase field into homogeneous and inhomogeneous parts, describing a quantum pendulum (subsystem) and an interacting phononic bath (environment). To study the relaxation dynamics in the model, we perform quantum quenches using the mini-superspace-based truncated Hamiltonian approach developed recently and simulate the real-time evolution of various entanglement measures and the energy transfer between the subsystem and its environment. Our findings demonstrate that in the presence of integrability-breaking perturbations, the relaxation dynamics is substantially faster, signalled by the increase of entanglement and energy transfer between the quantum pendulum and the phonon bath.</description>

Abstract: General theory of relativity is non--linear in nature and therefore can result in hysteresis-like effects and cause systems to remember the footprint of the gravitational field. Here we have investigated this effect using the Kinetic theory in curved spacetime. It is shown that the entropy rate experiences this hysteresis behavior. The effect is then considered for some special spacetimes, including Schwarzschild black hole, Friedmann--Lema\^itre--Robertson--Walker cosmological solution, and the flat Minkowski spacetime perturbed by a gravitational wave pulse. It is shown that there is some hysteresis effect for the entropy rate.</description>

Abstract: We discuss the problem of canonical quantization of electromagnetic field in the Schwarzschild spacetime. It is shown that a consistent procedure of canonical quantization of the field can be carried out without taking into account the internal region of the black hole. We prove that there exists a unitary gauge, which can be viewed as a combination of the Coulomb and Poincare gauges and is compatible with the field equations. The solutions corresponding to the stationary one-particle states of the electromagnetic field are studied, the canonical commutation relations and the Hamiltonian of the quantized electromagnetic field are obtained. It is shown that the number of quantum states in the resulting theory is twice as large as the number of quantum states of the electromagnetic field in Minkowski spacetime.</description>

Abstract: In this talk we will report on a study of the $\theta$-dependence of the string tension and of the mass gap of four-dimensional SU($N$) Yang--Mills theories. The spectrum at $N=3$ and $N=6$ was obtained on the lattice at various imaginary values of the $\theta$-parameter, using Parallel Tempering on Boundary Conditions to avoid topological freezing at fine lattice spacings. The coefficient of the $\mathcal{O}(\theta^2)$ term in the Taylor expansion of the spectrum around $\theta=0$ could be obtained in the continuum limit for $N=3$, and on two fairly fine lattices for $N=6$.</description>

      <title>From classical probability densities to quantum states: quantization of Gaussians for arbitrary orderings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14043v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The primary focus of this work is to investigate how the most emblematic classical probability density, namely a Gaussian, can be mapped to a valid quantum states. To explore this issue, we consider a Gaussian whose squared variance depends on a parameter $\lambda$. Specifically, depending on the value of $\lambda$, we study what happens in the classical-quantum correspondence as we change the indeterminacy of the classical particle. Furthermore, finding a correspondence between a classical state and a quantum state is not a trivial task. Quantum observables, described by Hermitian operators, do not generally commute, so a precise ordering must be introduced to resolve this ambiguity. In this work, we study two different arbitrary orderings: the first is an arbitrary ordering of the position and momentum observables; the second, which is the main focus of the present work, is an arbitrary ordering of the annihilation and creation operators. In this latter case, we find the interesting result that even a $\delta$-function, which in general has no quantum correspondence, can be mapped into a valid quantum state for a particular ordering, specifically the antinormal one (all creation operators are to the right of all annihilation operators in the product). This means that the Gaussian probability density corresponds to a valid quantum state, regardless of how localized classical particles are in phase space.</description>

      <title>Cosmological scalar and tensor perturbations with a scalar field: quadratic-order effective energy-momentum tensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16243v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the scalar and tensor modes of the gravitational perturbation in the presence of a scalar field which describes inflation. We investigate the back-reaction of the perturbations to the background by studying the effective energy-momentum tensor (2EMT) which is the second order constructed by the quadratic terms of the linear perturbations. 2EMT is gauge dependent due to the scalar mode. We obtain 2EMT in the slow-roll stage of inflation, and get its cosmological expressions in three (longitudinal, spatially flat, and comoving) gauge conditions. We find that the pure scalar-mode part in 2EMT is stronger in the short-wavelength limit, while the parts involved with the tensor mode (the pure tensor-mode part and the scalar-tensor coupled part) are stronger in the long-wavelength limit.</description>

      <title>Analogue Gravity</title>

Abstract: Analogue gravity is a research programme that explores analogues of general relativistic gravitational fields within other physical systems, particularly but not exclusively in condensed matter systems, with the aim of gaining new insights into related problems. Analogue models of gravity boast a long and distinguished history, dating back to the early years of general relativity. This review article delves into the history, aims, results, and future prospects of various analogue models. We begin by presenting a particularly simple example of an analogue model, then traverse the rich history and complex array of models discussed in the literature. The last decade has witnessed significant and sustained advances in analogue gravity, resulting in hundreds of published articles, workshops, and books. The future of the analogue gravity programme looks promising, with rapid technological advances on the experimental front and the potential for analogue models to inspire innovative approaches to the problem of quantum gravity on the theoretical front. Most of all, these recent years have seen the rise of an unprecedented collaboration and interplay between different communities that we believe will set a new standard for interdisciplinary research in the years to come.</description>
