      <title>There and back again -- Closed timelike curves as EFT selection principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modified gravity is often approached in the context of effective-field theory (EFT), with the view that the EFT corrections permit a more desirable theory. In this paper, we posit that this should extend to the causal structure of curved spacetime in addition to the standard demands such that of flat spacetime positivity and unitarity. We propose a new guiding principle for modified-gravity theories, namely that closed timelike curves should always be {\it harder} to obtain than in General Relativity. By demanding this, one can place powerful constraints on modified gravity. To elucidate this claim, we investigate modified-gravity EFTs on rotating black-hole backgrounds, focusing on the appearance/disappearance of closed timelike curves, and provide parameter bounds which only partly overlap with other approaches based on time delay. We construct perturbative rotating black-hole solutions in modified-gravity EFTs based on the Horndeski class and provide parameter bounds necessary to preserve causality and stability. Finally, we present a novel probe for the existence of closed timelike curves through quasinormal modes and black-hole echoes. This can be used to diagnose spacetime causality once next-generation gravitational-wave data becomes available.</description>

      <title>Scaling Laws for Template-Free Detection of Environmental Phase Modulation in Gravitational-Wave Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Environmental effects such as hierarchical triple motion can introduce cumulative phase modulation in gravitational-wave signals through time-dependent line-of-sight acceleration. Whether such smooth time-warp distortions are observable depends jointly on deformation strength and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), yet this relationship has not been quantified in a template-free framework. We study the detectability of these distortions using time-frequency representations derived from the continuous wavelet transform. Instead of reconstruction error alone, we examine trajectory-based statistics, in particular the evolution of the power-weighted frequency centroid. We find that environmental modulation can be detected using a single-sample statistic referenced to an isolated-binary distribution, without requiring matched templates. Across a grid of cumulative phase distortions and SNR, detection performance collapses onto a single scaling parameter defined as the product of phase distortion and SNR. The ROC-AUC follows a sigmoid transition in this parameter. Moderate distortions are detectable at low SNR, whereas smaller distortions require higher SNR. These results indicate that smooth environmental phase modulation is not generically absorbed by intrinsic waveform variability; instead, detectability is governed by a simple scaling between cumulative phase distortion and signal strength.</description>

      <title>Stability of neutral and charged Dyson shells around Reissner-Nordstrom compact objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this Letter, we show that, in contrast to Dyson shells surrounding uncharged compact objects, which are generally unstable, a neutral Dyson shell enclosing a charged compact object described by the Reissner-Nordstrom spacetime can attain a stable equilibrium configuration. We analytically derive the conditions for stability, determine the equilibrium radius and the corresponding minimum asymptotic energy, and show that small perturbations about this equilibrium lead to a stable oscillatory motion of the shell. The oscillation frequency is obtained explicitly and shown to increase with the shell mass and decrease with the charge of the central object. When the shell itself carries charge, its stability depends on the sign of this charge. Shells with the same sign as the central charge become progressively less stable, while oppositely charged shells exhibit enhanced stability due to the electrostatic attraction. These findings highlight the stabilizing role of electromagnetic interactions in Dyson-type thin-shell configurations within general relativity.</description>

      <title>Improved constraints on modified Newtonian gravity from Cassini radio tracking data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report an updated constraint on the Solar System quadrupole parameter $Q_2$, which encodes the external field effect predicted by modified gravity versions of the MOND paradigm. Using the dataset employed to compute the DE440 planetary ephemerides, and estimating it simultaneously with other parameters included in the planetary ephemerides, we find $Q_2 = (1.6 \pm 1.8) \times 10^{-27}\,\mathrm{s}^{-2}$ (1-$\sigma$), representing an improvement of 40% over previous estimates. We also show explicitly that the contribution to the MOND prediction of $Q_2$ from the Solar System's largest planet, Jupiter, is at the 0.05% level, validating the approximation of retaining only the Sun in theoretical calculations. With this new constraint on $Q_2$, we update previously acknowledged tensions with external galaxy rotation curves, now leading to discrepancies at the $3$-$15\sigma$ level depending on the detailed mass modeling or the subset of galaxies considered. Within the Milky Way itself, the $Q_2$ constraint imposes an upper bound of only 2% (at 95% confidence) on the MOND boost to the galactic radial acceleration (i.e., the ratio of the observed over baryonic Newtonian acceleration) at the position of the Sun, in strong tension with current observational limits. The updated $Q_2$ posterior finally confirms that Solar System measurements provide stronger constraints than current wide-binary data on classical modified gravity versions of MOND.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary Behavior of Fractional Holographic Dark Energy within $f(T)$ Teleparallel Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the cosmological dynamics of FHDE within $f(T)$ gravity by employing the dynamical system approach in a spatially flat FRW background. By introducing appropriate dimensionless variables, the field equations are reformulated as a closed system, which allows a systematic phase-space analysis. The resulting system admits four critical points, including two saddle points corresponding to radiation and matter-dominated epochs, and two stable points associated with a DE-dominated phase and a de Sitter solution. The radiation- and matter-dominated critical points are found to possess a saddle character in phase space, ensuring their transient nature and enabling the cosmological evolution to naturally progress toward a stable late-time accelerated attractor. The stable critical points describe accelerated expansion with effective equations of state compatible with DE and de Sitter regimes. Overall, the analysis indicates that $f(T)$ gravity is capable of reproducing the standard cosmological sequence within a consistent dynamical framework.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Acceleration from a Simultaneous Variation of Fundamental Constants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the possibility of a simultaneous cosmic variation of two fundamental entities: the Newtonian gravitational coupling $G$ and the electron mass $m_e$. We show that this variation can account for the late-time cosmic acceleration without invoking a cosmological constant or an explicit dark-energy fluid. We compare the derived $m_e$ variation with laboratory bounds found from Quasar absorption Spectra. Our results indicate that late-time cosmic acceleration could be a manifestation of evolving fundamental couplings, establishing a direct bridge between precision tests of gravity, particle physics and the origin of cosmic acceleration.</description>

      <title>Observer-robust energy condition verification for warp drive spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present \textbf{warpax}, an open-source, GPU-accelerated Python toolkit for observer-robust energy condition analysis of warp drive spacetimes. Existing tools evaluate energy conditions for a finite sample of observer directions; \textbf{warpax} replaces discrete sampling with continuous, gradient-based optimization over the timelike observer manifold (rapidity and boost direction), backed by Hawking--Ellis algebraic classification. At Type~I stress-energy points, which comprise ${&gt;}\,96$\% of all grid points across the tested metrics, an algebraic eigenvalue check determines energy-condition satisfaction \emph{exactly}, independent of any observer search or rapidity cap. At non-Type~I points the optimizer provides rapidity-capped diagnostics. Stress-energy tensors are computed from the ADM metric via forward-mode automatic differentiation, eliminating finite-difference truncation error. Geodesic integration with tidal-force and blueshift analysis is also included.
  We analyze five warp drive metrics (Alcubierre, Lentz, Van~Den~Broeck, Nat\'ario, Rodal) and one warp shell metric (used primarily as a numerical stress test). For the Rodal metric, the standard Eulerian-frame analysis misses violations at over $28\%$ of grid points (dominant energy condition) and over $15\%$ (weak energy condition). Even where the Eulerian frame identifies the correct violation set, observer optimization reveals that violation severity can be orders of magnitude larger (e.g.\ Alcubierre weak energy condition: ${\sim}\,90{,}000\times$ at rapidity cap $\zeta_{\max} = 5$, scaling as $e^{2\zeta_{\max}}$). These results demonstrate that single-frame evaluation can systematically underestimate both the spatial extent and the magnitude of energy condition violations in warp drive spacetimes. \textbf{warpax} is freely available at https://github.com/anindex/warpax.</description>

      <title>Decay of a multi-axionic SU(N) symmetric color aether in the early Universe as an origin of emergence of a many-component dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a new SU(N) symmetric model of interaction between the fields of four types: the multiplet of vector fields, which describes the so-called color aether, the multiplet of pseudoscalar fields, which is associated with the multi-component cosmic dark matter, the gauge and gravitational fields. The extended Lagrangian of the model contains a new constructive element, which is based on the covariant SU(N) symmetric divergence of the multiplet of vector fields; this new element, being the multiplet of scalars from the point of view of spacetime transformations and the color vector from the point of view of the SU(N) group space, gives us the possibility to formulate properly the multi-axionic extension of the Peccei-Quinn theory. The hypothesis of a spontaneous polarization of the multi-axionic color aether in the early Universe is presented. The set of self-consistent master equations of the model is derived. An application to cosmology is considered: the obtained master equations are solved for the truncated test model based on the Bianchi-I spacetime platform.</description>

      <title>On type II(D) Einstein spacetimes in six dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: After a concise overview of Einstein spacetimes of type II (or more special) in four and five dimensions, we summarize recent results in the six-dimensional case. We assume the optical matrix to be non-degenerate and ``generic'', and the Weyl tensor to fall off sufficiently rapidly at infinity. As it turns out, the most general metric is characterized by one discrete (normalized) and three continuous parameters, is of type D and belongs to the Kerr-Schild class. Its relation to the previously known Kerr-(A)dS and Kerr-NUT-(A)dS metrics is clarified.</description>

      <title>The Emergence of Measured Geometry in Self-Gravitating Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates the geometrical properties of self-gravitating $N$-body systems from the perspective established by Henri Poincar\'e and Albert Einstein concerning the operational nature of measured geometry. Utilizing recent numerical analyses of central configurations--special equilibrium solutions to the Newtonian $N$-body problem--we uncover systematic spatial variations in nearest-neighbor particle separations correlated with the radial distance from the system's center of mass. We argue that these variations reflect a context-dependent, emergent effective geometry shaped by gravitational interactions, in accordance with Poincar\'e's assertion that measured geometry depends on the forces influencing measuring devices, and Einstein's view that rods and clocks define physical geometry through their local dynamics. By revisiting these foundational insights within a modern computational framework, we provide evidence that geometry in self-gravitating Newtonian systems is not a fixed background, but an emergent construct arising from internal physical interactions.</description>

      <title>Dynamical wormholes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.18231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We numerically investigate the dynamical evolution of spherically symmetric charge free wormholes. We concentrate on two specific examples, both of which exhibit wormhole expansion and wormhole collapse: the Ellis-Bronnikov wormhole, which is sourced by a real massless ghost scalar field, and the quantum corrected Schwarzschild black hole in semiclassical gravity (which has a wormhole structure and is not a true black hole), which is sourced by a renormalized energy-momentum tensor. Despite their very different sources, we demonstrate that the dynamics of these two wormholes are remarkably similar. Our analysis focuses on diagrams for the areal radius and components of the energy-momentum tensor. This work also serves as a review, offering a detailed description of how to perform a spherically symmetric dynamical evolution using double null coordinates as well as a review of the static solutions for our two examples.</description>

      <title>GR-Athena++: Binary Neutron Star Merger Simulations with Neutrino Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present general-relativistic radiation magnetohydrodynamics simulations of binary neutron star mergers performed with GR-Athena++. Neutrino transport is treated using a moment-based, energy-integrated scheme (M1), augmented by neutrino number density evolution (N0). Our implementation is validated through an extensive suite of standard tests and demonstrated to perform robustly under adaptive mesh refinement. As a first application, we simulate the gravitational collapse of a uniformly rotating, magnetized neutron star, demonstrating stable radiation evolution through apparent-horizon formation using a novel excision technique based on the tapering of state vector evolution inside the horizon. To further test robustness in highly dynamic environments, we apply our code to two demanding binary neutron star merger scenarios. We investigate a long-lived remnant with the DD2 equation of state, evolved with full general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics and M1 neutrino transport. Following this, a gravitational collapse scenario with the SFHo equation of state is explored. We showcase long-term stable evolution on neutrino cooling time-scales, demonstrating robust handling of excision and stable evolution of the post-collapse accretion phase in three-dimensional mergers with magnetic fields and neutrino radiation.</description>

      <title>Detection prospects of solar $g$-modes with LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The possibility of detecting solar oscillation modes using space-based gravitational-wave detectors has been investigated in the context of gravitational-wave interferometry, with Polnarev \cite{Polnarev:2009xf} demonstrating that low-frequency solar modes could, in principle, produce detectable signals in a LISA-type interferometer. Motivated by this work, I revisit the problem using current solar models, updated detector sensitivities, and improved theoretical and observational constraints on mode amplitudes. In this study, I compute the gravitational response of solar oscillation modes using standard solar models generated with \texttt{MESA}, and mode eigenfrequencies and eigenfunctions calculated with \texttt{GYRE}. I focus primarily on solar $g$ modes, evaluating their responses for degree $l=2$ and azimuthal orders $m=0$ and $m=2$. The analysis incorporates both the earlier proposed and the current updated LISA sensitivity curves, and I perform a comparative assessment with the TianQin mission in the relevant low-frequency band. To assess the robustness of the predicted signals, I estimate the gravitational responses using two different standard solar models based on the GS98 and AGSS09 abundance compilations. I find that the resulting signal responses are nearly identical for the two models, indicating that uncertainties in solar metallicity have a negligible impact on the detectability of solar $g$ modes by space-based interferometers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.16575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmological vector fields are central to many early-Universe phenomena, including inflationary dynamics, primordial magnetogenesis, and dark-matter scenarios. However, constructing models able to generate cosmological magnetic fields while avoiding strong coupling, backreaction, and cosmic microwave background constraints remains challenging. We study a novel mechanism in which brief non--slow-roll phases during inflation amplify primordial magnetic fields at small scales, while maintaining theoretical consistency and observational viability. We incorporate parity-violating interactions in the vector sector and demonstrate, for the first time in a non--slow-roll framework, that chirality can significantly boost magnetic-field amplitudes and imprint distinctive polarization-dependent spectral features. We complement detailed numerical computations with an analytical treatment yielding compact expressions for chiral vector mode functions that reproduce the main spectral properties. We then develop a systematic formalism to evaluate the stochastic gravitational-wave background naturally induced at second order by these amplified fields, identifying both an intensity component and a circularly polarized contribution with characteristic frequency profiles. We discuss detection prospects with future multiband gravitational-wave observatories, showing that chiral signatures could provide a distinctive observational probe. Our results introduce new avenues for enhancing primordial magnetic fields and their associated gravitational-wave signals, opening promising possibilities for their future detection and interpretation, both with cosmological and gravitational wave probes.</description>

Abstract: The static tidal Love numbers of four-dimensional black holes vanish identically, unlike their nontrivial dynamical response at finite frequency. Recent work has provided three complementary descriptions of this phenomenon: an emergent $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$ organization of static near-zone perturbations, a graded logarithmic and multi-zeta structure in Shell Effective Field Theory (Shell EFT), and an on-shell matching framework based on gravitational Raman scattering with renormalization group (RG) running. We show that these features arise from a common near-zone truncation mechanism. For a massless scalar field, horizon regularity selects a unique static solution forming a highest-weight-type representation, truncating the hypergeometric solution to a finite polynomial and eliminating the independent decaying branch at large radius. This excludes a static Wilson coefficient in the effective theory. We demonstrate that the same truncation operates in the static Regge-Wheeler and Zerilli equations for four-dimensional Schwarzschild black holes. Analytic continuation of the horizon-regular solution to small frequency via the Coulomb-hypergeometric or Mano-Suzuki-Takasugi formalisms preserves this truncation as an anchoring condition for the renormalized angular momentum parameter. The resulting low-frequency expansion is controlled by Gamma and hypergeometric functions, generating a graded algebra of logarithms and odd Riemann zeta values. Within this structure no invariant of negative weight exists in the static sector, so the vanishing of the static Love number follows as a structural consequence. This explains the ``zero-sum'' rule of Shell EFT and why the self-induced RG flow in gravitational Raman scattering cannot generate a static invariant.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Bounce Relics: Black Holes, Gravitational Waves, and Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new mechanism for generating cosmological relics -- black holes, gravitational waves (GWs), and possibly dark matter (DM) -- in a bouncing Universe. Relics arise through two channels: (i) compact objects and GWs produced during pre-bounce collapse that remain super-horizon and re-enter after the bounce, and (ii) dark-matter halos formed during collapse that exit the horizon and collapse into black holes upon re-entry. Unlike inflationary primordial black holes, these relic black holes originate from nonlinear structure formation during collapse. We derive the particle horizon and horizon-crossing conditions in bouncing cosmology and show that perturbations or compact objects larger than 90 m survive the bounce. The resulting population of relic black holes and GWs spans a wide mass range, offering a unified origin for dark matter, gravitational-wave backgrounds, and the early growth of supermassive black holes and galaxies.</description>

      <title>Pushing spectral siren cosmology into the third-generation era: a blinded mock data challenge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational wave (GW) spectral sirens offer a promising method for measuring cosmological parameters using GW data only - without relying on external redshift information such as electromagnetic counterparts or galaxy catalogs - by exploiting distributional features in the population of GW sources. The advent of third-generation detectors like the Einstein Telescope (ET) will provide catalogs three orders of magnitudes larger than current ones, raising questions about the scalability and robustness of existing inference pipelines. We present a blinded mock data challenge that tests three public pipelines with distinct numerical implementations, namely, $\texttt{ICAROGW}$, $\texttt{CHIMERA}$, and $\texttt{pymcpop-gw}$, on simulated ET observations containing the best $\mathcal{O}(10^4)$ binary black hole mergers that can be observed in 1 year. We assess their computational performance, validate their agreement in a blinded setting, and forecast cosmological constraints. We find that, thanks to GPU acceleration, these pipelines can process the events expected from ET within a manageable timeframe. All pipelines recover consistent cosmological and population parameters. Assuming a flat $\Lambda$CDM model, we measure $H(z)$ at $z\sim1.5$ with 2.4% precision, and achieve a mean precision on $H(z)$ of 2.8% across $0.7&lt;z&lt;1.8$ with a catalog of $\sim 12,000$ high-S/N events. This corresponds to joint constraints of $\sim 10%$ on $H_0$ and $\sim 26%$ on $\Omega_{\rm m,0}$. We also identify the events that contribute mostly to constraining cosmological parameters, showing that low-distance sources near population features drive the constraining power on all cosmological parameters, while higher-distance events primarily constrain $\Omega_{\rm m,0}$. Our results establish a validated, performance-tested framework for spectral siren cosmology in the era of third-generation GW observatories.</description>

      <title>Simulating Quantum Field Theories with Boundaries in Curved Spacetimes Using Open Spin Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a framework to simulate quantum field theories (QFTs) with boundaries in $(1+1)$-dimenmsional curved spacetimes by employing open spin systems. Building upon our previous work that established a mapping from spin systems to QFTs in periodic geometries, we extend the correspondence to systems with boundaries, where boundary conditions play a crucial role in shaping the dynamics. Focusing on Majorana fermions, we derive the allowed boundary conditions from the requirement of inner product conservation and formulate their realization in spin systems. The corresponding spin model is shown to reproduce boundary conditions of QFT accurately when a free function in the spin model is appropriately chosen. As an explicit demonstration, we analyze a flat spacetime example, comparing spectra, mode functions, and linear responses between the continuum and lattice descriptions. Our findings confirm that open spin systems can successfully replicate QFT dynamics with boundaries.</description>

      <title>CMB anisotropies from cosmic (super)strings in light of ACT DR6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present updated constraints on cosmic string and superstring parameters derived from Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropies. The constraints are obtained via Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analyses of the full \textit{Planck} temperature and polarization data combined with the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) Data Release 6 (DR6). For ordinary cosmic strings, we constrain the string tension $G\mu$, the string wiggliness parameter $\alpha$, and the self-chopping efficiency $\tilde{c}$. For cosmic superstrings, we constrain the fundamental string tension $G\mu_F$, the string coupling $g_s$, and a parameter $w$ describing the volume of the compact extra dimensions. In both cases, we find significantly tighter bounds on the string tension compared to previous analyses, obtaining $2\sigma$ upper limits of $G\mu &lt; 3.66\times10^{-8}$ and $G\mu_F &lt; 1.38\times10^{-8}$. We also discuss the significant prior-dependence of these results. The computational pipeline used in this work, including a modified version of \texttt{CAMB} capable of computing CMB anisotropies sourced by any active network described via unequal-time correlators, is released publicly as \texttt{CAMBactive} \cite{Raidal_CAMBactive_CAMB_extension_2026}.</description>

      <title>Ultrarelativistic boost of a black hole in the magnetic universe of Levi-Civita--Bertotti--Robinson</title>

      <description>arXiv:1805.05382v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider an exact Einstein-Maxwell solution constructed by Alekseev and Garcia which describes a Schwarzschild black hole immersed in the magnetic universe of Levi-Civita, Bertotti and Robinson (LCBR). After reviewing the basic properties of this spacetime, we study the ultrarelativistic limit in which the black hole is boosted to the speed of light, while sending its mass to zero. This results in a non-expanding impulsive wave traveling in the LCBR universe. The wave front is a 2-sphere carrying two null point particles at its poles -- a remnant of the structure of the original static spacetime. It is also shown that the obtained line-element belongs to the Kundt class of spacetimes, and the relation with a known family of exact gravitational waves of finite duration propagating in the LCBR background is clarified. In the limit of a vanishing electromagnetic field, one point particle is pushed away to infinity and the single-particle Aichelburg-Sexl pp-wave propagating in Minkowski space is recovered.</description>

Abstract: The Newman-Unti-Tamburino (NUT) solution is characterized as the unique Petrov Type $D$ vacuum metric such that the two double principal null directions form an integrable distribution. The uniqueness of the NUT is established by evaluating the integrability conditions of the Newman-Penrose equations up to $SL(2,\mathbb{C})$ transformations, resulting in a coordinate-free characterization of the solution.</description>

      <title>Gravitational-wave signatures of nonviolent nonlocality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13714v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Measurement of gravitational waves can provide precision tests of the nature of black holes and compact objects. In this work, we test Giddings' nonviolent nonlocality proposal, which posits that quantum information is transferred via a nonlocal interaction that generates metric perturbations around black holes. In contrast to firewalls, these quantum fluctuations would be spread out over a larger distance range -- up to a Schwarzschild radius away. In this letter, we model the modification to the gravitational waveform from nonviolent nonlocality. We modify the nonspinning EOBNRv2 effective one body waveform to include metric perturbations that are due to a random Gaussian process. We find that the waveform exhibits random deviations which are particularly important in the late inspiral-plunge phase. We find an optimal dephasing parameter for detecting this effect with a principal component analysis. This is particularly intriguing because it predicts random phase deviations across different gravitational wave events, providing theoretical support for hierarchical tests of general relativity. We estimate the constraint on the perturbations in nonviolent nonlocality with events for the LIGO-Virgo network and for a third-generation network.</description>

      <title>Primordial black hole ringdown: The irreducible stochastic gravitational wave background</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04083v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Independently from the formation mechanism of primordial black holes in the early Universe, their generation is accompanied by a ringdown phase during which they relax to a stationary configuration and gravitational waves under the form of quasinormal modes are emitted. Such gravitational waves generate an irreducible and unavoidable stochastic background which is testable by current and future experiments. In particular, for primordial black holes with masses exceeding $10^{14}\,M_{\odot}$, the associated stochastic background lies within the frequency range accessible to current and upcoming cosmic microwave background experiments, thereby providing a direct observational way to probe the existence of such extremely massive objects.</description>

      <title>Wigner's friend's black hole adventure: an argument for complementarity?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05369v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: At the heart of both black hole physics and Wigner's friend scenarios lies the question of unitarity. In Wigner's friend setups, sealed-lab measurements are modeled unitarily, probing the measurement problem. In black hole physics, the unitarity problem concerns information preservation in evaporation. We extend a recent analogy between these two puzzles exposed by Hausmann and Renner [arXiv:2504.03835v1] by constructing new paradoxes that merge black hole physics with extensions of the Wigner's friend scenario into a unified argument. This unified construction allows us to sharpen the cloning and firewall paradoxes, which leave room for a post-quantum theory to consistently describe the physics of black holes. We close this loophole, showing that no such theory exists if no observer can experimentally falsify quantum theory's predictions. We conclude by briefly highlighting subtleties in assumptions commonly used in black hole puzzles.</description>

      <title>The Construction and Application of Penrose Diagrams, with a Focus on the Maximally Analytically Extended Schwarzschild Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23514v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a detailed, mathematically rigorous description of the construction procedure of Penrose diagrams for the example of the maximal analytic extension of the exterior Schwarzschild spacetime. To this end, we first outline the central idea underlying Penrose diagrams, state the general requirements on the spacetimes to be visualized, and give a definition of Penrose diagrams. We then construct the Penrose diagram of the maximally analytically extended Schwarzschild spacetime and discuss its components and characteristics. As an application, we work out the differences between the Eddington-Finkelstein and Penrose coordinate representations of the Schwarzschild spacetime by visually analyzing-and comparing-the Penrose diagram of the maximally analytically extended Schwarzschild spacetime equipped with, on the one hand, a foliation by the level sets of the Eddington-Finkelstein time coordinate and, on the other hand, a foliation by the level sets of the Penrose null coordinate. Through the whole of the paper, we provide explanatory accounts of the relevant parts of the seminal research papers on the exterior Schwarzschild solution pertaining to coordinatizations and possible extensions by Schwarzschild himself, Kruskal, Eddington, Finkelstein, and Penrose. This paper is primarily of pedagogical nature aimed at graduate students in physics and applied mathematics, serving mainly as an introduction to Penrose diagrams along with descriptions and analyses of coordinate representations and extensions of the exterior Schwarzschild spacetime.</description>

      <title>Kerr-Schild transformation of the Benenti-Francaviglia metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06561v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Benenti-Francaviglia (BF) family of metrics provides the most general form of a spacetime metric that admits two mutually commuting Killing vectors and an irreducible Killing tensor. The geodesic equations for the BF family are thus completely integrable by separation of variables. Within this broad class, we explore the Kerr-Schild transformation of a degenerate subclass distinguished by the existence of a shear-free null geodesic congruence. By requiring the deformed metric to preserve the Killing symmetry and circularity, we demonstrate that the deformed metric again falls into the degenerate BF family, modulo the replacement of a single structure function. We apply the present algorithm to ${\cal N}=2$ gauged supergravity and obtain a dyonic generalization of the Chong-Cveti\v{c}-L\"u-Pope rotating black hole solution, by taking the background metric to be a solution of the Einstein-scalar gravity. The present prescription extends to five dimensions, provided that the constant of geodesic motion associated with the extra Killing direction vanishes. The same reasoning applies to the case where the background degenerate BF metric is distorted in a (non)conformal manner. Our formalism offers a unified perspective on the relation between seed and deformed metrics in the Kerr-Schild construction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13135v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: These proceedings summarise some recent efforts in understanding a class of vector-tensor theories known as {\it bumblebee} models, which spontaneously break local Lorentz and diffeomorphism invariance. Using cosmological perturbation theory on an FLRW background, we find that for non-minimal coupling to gravity, the theory contains a ghost mode unless degeneracy conditions are imposed, after which the model becomes a subset of generalised Proca theory, and the potential is then completely fixed by the background equations. We find a constraint on the bumblebee field from the speed of tensor modes on the order of $10^{-15}$. We go further to show that scalar perturbations do not propagate at the linear level, indicating that the theory is pathological around dynamical cosmological backgrounds, a result which is independent of the form of the potential.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17623v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we discuss the Unruh state for a free scalar quantum field on Kerr-de Sitter under the assumption of mode stability. We summarise the proof of its Hadamard property that was previously given in [C.Klein, Annales Henri Poincar\'e 24 (2023) 7, 2401-2442] for sufficiently small black-hole rotation and cosmological constant, and show how it can be generalised to any subextreme black-hole angular momentum in the same range of the cosmological constant. This is done by extending a geometric analysis of the trapped set of the Kerr spacetime [D. H\"afner, C. Klein, Lett.Math.Phys. 114 (2024) 5, 119] to Kerr-de Sitter. Moreover, we discuss the application of this state in the numerical study of quantum effects at the inner horizon [C. Klein, M. Soltani, M. Casals, S. Hollands, Phys.Rev.Lett. 132 (2024) 12, 121501], and describe a universality result for these effects [P. Hintz, C. Klein, Class.Quant.Grav. 41 (2024) 7, 075006].</description>

      <title>Ringdown in Vaidya spacetimes: time-dependent frequencies, Penrose limit and time-domain analyses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25062v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the possible characterization of ringdown waves in a dynamical Vaidya spacetime using the Penrose limit geometry around the dynamical photon sphere. In the case of a static spherically symmetric black hole spacetime, it is known that the quasinormal frequency in the eikonal limit can be characterized by the angular velocity and the Lyapunov exponent for the null geodesic congruence on the orbit of the unstable circular null geodesic. This correspondence can be further backed up by the analysis of the Penrose limit geometry around the unstable circular null geodesic orbit. We try to extend this analysis to a Vaidya spacetime, focusing on the dynamical photon sphere in it. Then we discuss to what extent the Penrose limit geometry can be relevant to the ringdown waves in the Vaidya spacetime, comparing the results with the numerically calculated waveform in the Vaidya spacetime.</description>

      <title>Threshold Resolvent Singularities and the Infrared Structure of Linearized Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.05345v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We identify a sharp geometric threshold governing the infrared spectral behavior of the spatial Lichnerowicz operator on asymptotically flat three-dimensional manifolds. Let $(M,g)$ be asymptotically flat and let $L=\Delta_L$ denote the spatial Lichnerowicz operator acting on symmetric $2$-tensors. Assume \[ |{\rm Riem}(x)| \lesssim r(x)^{-p} \quad \text{as } r(x)\to\infty. \]
  If $p&gt;3$, curvature is spectrally short-range: $L$ exhibits regular low-energy scattering and zero energy is not singular. At the critical decay \[ |{\rm Riem}(x)| \sim r^{-3}, \] dispersion and curvature balance. Zero enters the essential spectrum, and the weighted resolvent develops a threshold singularity. For $s\in(1/2,1)$, \[ \|\langle r\rangle^{-s}(L-i\varepsilon)^{-1}\langle r\rangle^{-s}\| \gtrsim \varepsilon^{-(1-s)} \quad \text{as } \varepsilon \downarrow 0 . \] Thus, the limiting absorption principle fails at zero energy.
  This singularity provides a spatial spectral mechanism for the infrared sector of linearized gravity. The same inverse-cube scaling governs long-range correlations, irregular low-frequency scattering, and soft gravitational modes. Numerical simulations of a radial model and the full tensor operator confirm that $p=3$ marks a sharp transition between negligible and marginal curvature.
  The associated branch point at zero energy determines late-time relaxation, yielding the universal tail exponent \[ t^{-(2\ell+3)}, \] a spectral consequence of nonzero ADM mass. More generally, in $d$ spatial dimensions, the critical decay \[ |{\rm Riem}(x)| \sim r^{-d} \] forms a universal boundary for curvature-coupled Laplace-type operators, encoding the infrared structure of gravity in the spectral geometry of a Cauchy slice.</description>

      <title>Towards an anomaly detection pipeline for gravitational waves at the Einstein Telescope</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.13154v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the implementation of an anomaly-detection algorithm based on a deep convolutional autoencoder for the search for gravitational waves (GWs) in time-frequency spectrograms. Our method targets short-duration ($\lesssim 2\,\text{s}$) GW signals, exemplified by mergers of compact objects forming or involving an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH). Such short signals are difficult to distinguish from background noise; yet their brevity makes them well-suited to machine-learning analyses with modest computational requirements. Using the data from the Einstein Telescope Mock Data Challenge as a benchmark, we demonstrate that the approach can successfully flag GW-like transients as anomalies in interferometer data of a single detector, achieving an initial detection efficiency of 23% for injected signals corresponding to IMBH-forming mergers. After introducing weak supervision, the model exhibits excellent generalisation and recovers all injected IMBH-forming mergers, independent of their total mass or signal-to-noise ratio, with a false-alarm rate due to statistical noise fluctuations of approximately 4.5 events per year for a single interferometer operating with a 100% duty cycle. The method also successfully identifies lower-mass mergers leading to the formation of black holes with mass larger than $\simeq 20\,M_\odot$. Our pipeline does not yet classify anomalies, distinguishing between actual GW signals and noise artefacts; however, it highlights any deviation from the learned background noise distribution for further scrutiny. These results demonstrate that anomaly detection offers a powerful, model-independent framework for future GW searches, paving the way toward fully automated and adaptive analysis pipelines.</description>

      <title>De Sitter quantum gravity and the emergence of local algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00111v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum theories of gravity are generally expected to have some degree of non-locality, with familiar local physics emerging only in a particular limit. Perturbative quantum gravity around backgrounds with isometries and compact Cauchy slices provides an interesting laboratory in which this emergence can be explored. In this context, the remaining isometries are gauge symmetries and, as a result, gauge-invariant observables cannot be localized. Instead, local physics can arise only through certain relational constructions.
  We explore such issues below for perturbative quantum gravity around de Sitter space. In particular, we describe a class of gauge-invariant observables which, under appropriate conditions, provide good approximations to certain algebras of local fields. Our results suggest that, near any minimal $S^d$ in dS$_{d+1}$, this approximation can be accurate only over regions in which the corresponding global time coordinate $t$ spans an interval $\Delta t \lesssim O(\ln G^{-1})$. In contrast, however, we find that the approximation can be accurate over arbitrarily large regions of global dS$_{d+1}$ so long as those regions are located far to the future or past of such a minimal $S^d$. This in particular includes arbitrarily large parts of any static patch.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Corrected Hawking Radiation from Near-Extremal Kerr-Newman Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08252v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Near-extremal black holes have a long AdS$_2$ throat in their near-horizon region. Quantum fluctuations in the throat region are effectively governed by a quantum version of Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity with matter and are strongly coupled at low temperatures. We investigate how these quantum fluctuations affect the spectrum of emission of particles during Hawking radiation. We systematically consider the cases of Kerr and Kerr-Newman black holes for emission of scalar particles and discuss photon and graviton emission from the Kerr background. We find that at very low temperatures the quantum fluctuations radically change the nature of particle emission. Unlike the generic suppression of particle emission in the spherically symmetric Reissner-Nordstr\"om case, we uncover that for particles with non-vanishing angular momentum, the quantum-corrected emission can be substantially enhanced with respect to the standard semiclassical result.</description>

      <title>Decoherence from quantum spacetime noise: An open-systems framework with application to neutrino oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13061v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a general open-quantum-systems framework to model decoherence induced by stochastic Planck-scale fluctuations of spacetime, focusing on the kappa-Minkowski noncommutative geometry as a representative quantum-gravity scenario. Treating the deformation parameter as Gaussian white noise, we derive a Lindblad-type master equation applicable to arbitrary quantum systems and obtain a distinctive inverse-energy scaling of the decoherence rate, Gamma proportional to E^{-4}. As an illustrative example, we analyze a three-level system motivated by neutrino flavor oscillations and derive closed-form expressions for survival and transition probabilities with spacetime-induced damping. The E^{-4} scaling contrasts sharply with the positive power laws often invoked in quantum-gravity phenomenology and predicts negligible decoherence for high-energy neutrinos consistent with IceCube observations, while implying that the strongest effects arise in the extreme low-energy regime. In this context, the sub-eV-scale energies characteristic of the cosmic neutrino background provide a natural infrared benchmark for illustrating the enhanced sensitivity to quantum-spacetime fluctuations. Our results establish a unified formalism connecting quantum-information methods, open-system dynamics, and quantum-spacetime phenomenology, thereby offering a framework for exploring potential signatures of Planck-scale physics in future low-energy neutrino studies.</description>

      <title>Quantum estimation of cosmological parameters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12228v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding how well future cosmological experiments can reconstruct the mechanism that generated primordial inhomogeneities is key to assessing the extent to which cosmology can inform fundamental physics. In this work, we apply a quantum metrology tool - the quantum Fisher information - to the squeezed quantum state describing cosmological perturbations at the end of inflation. This quantifies the ultimate precision achievable in parameter estimation, assuming ideal access to early-universe information. By comparing the quantum Fisher information to its classical counterpart - derived from measurements of the curvature perturbation power spectrum alone (homodyne measurement) - we evaluate how close current observations come to this quantum limit. Focusing on the tensor-to-scalar ratio as a case study, we find that the gap between classical and quantum Fisher information grows exponentially with the number of e-folds a mode spends outside the horizon. This suggests the existence of a highly efficient (but presently inaccessible) optimal measurement. Conversely, we show that accessing the decaying mode of inflationary perturbations is a necessary (but not sufficient) condition for exponentially improving the inference of the tensor-to-scalar ratio.</description>

      <title>A spherical hydrodynamical model of cosmic voids in {\Lambda}CDM and beyond</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14120v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cosmic voids have emerged as powerful probes for cosmology, providing complementary information on the large-scale structure of the universe. We present the first application of a hydrodynamical framework to model the evolution of cosmic voids. This approach offers a physically intuitive characterization of void dynamics and can naturally be applied to non-standard cosmologies. We derive the cosmology-dependent mapping that relates the linear (Lagrangian) and fully non-linear (Eulerian) evolution of the matter density contrast, a central component for accurate theoretical modeling of void statistics. Furthermore, we present a new method for determining the shell-crossing epoch across arbitrary cosmological backgrounds, thereby extending previous treatments restricted to the Einstein-de Sitter universe.
  Motivated by recent DESI results hinting at dynamical dark energy, we investigate void evolution in $ w_0w_a$CDM cosmologies by varying $ w_0$ and $w_a$. We also consider the impact of varying the matter density parameter, $ \Omega_{\mathrm{m},0}$. We find that the evolution of isolated, spherically symmetric cosmic voids is most sensitive to $ \Omega_{\mathrm{m},0} $ and $ w_0 $, which can alter the non-linear density contrast by up to 20-30%. Variations in $w_a$ have a smaller impact, but may still lead to measurable effects. We also show that the cosmology-dependent mapping between linear and non-linear density contrasts may provide a sensitive probe of dynamical dark energy in precision void analyses.</description>

Abstract: We revisit higher order corrections to the Starobinsky inflationary model using the most recent P-ACT-LB-BK18 data, which exhibits a mild but definite tension with the predictions of the original model. Our results demonstrate how even small {higher order} deformations of the Ricci scalar (e.g. $R^3, R^4,\cdots$) can bring the model into better agreement with current data and impose nontrivial constraints on the post-inflationary dynamics.</description>

      <title>Comparing measures of the Hubble and BAO tensions in $\Lambda$CDM and possible solutions in $f(Q)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20964v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We test whether $f(Q)$ symmetric teleparallel gravity theories can solve the Hubble tension consistently with DESI~DR2 BAO. We consider three $f(Q)$ functional forms: logarithmic, exponential, and hyperbolic tangent. We extend these models by allowing a cosmological constant, and compare to phenomenological models with a flexible exponential, hyperbolic secant, and polynomial decay addition to the standard $\Lambda$CDM $H(z)$. We test these models against DESI~DR2 BAO, CMB (\emph{Planck}~2018 + SPT-3G + ACT~DR6), local $H_0$, and Cosmic Chronometer data. The logarithmic and hyperbolic tangent $f(Q)$ models do not provide an adequate solution, but the exponential model does. Furthermore, it slightly reduces the $(\Omega_m, H_0 r_d)$ parameter space tension between CMB and BAO datasets to $2.56\sigma$, down from $2.65\sigma$ for $\Lambda$CDM. Although $\Lambda$CDM faces only $1.66\sigma$ tension in DESI data space, the $1\sigma$ higher tension in parameter space suggests a real anomaly. The models assisted by the cosmological constant perform slightly better still, at the cost of undermined theoretical motivation. They also perform poorly once local $H_0$ measurements are included. The phenomenological models fit all data reasonably well, yet the best-fitting models predict isotropically averaged BAO distances exceeding the DESI~DR2 measurements at all redshifts. This highlights the difficulties of finding a theoretically motivated solution to the Hubble tension while remaining consistent with BAO data.</description>

Abstract: We clarify the status of gauge-invariant entire-function regulators in NonLocal Quantum Field Theory. The regulator is implemented as an entire function of the covariant Laplace--Beltrami operator. Working in the background-field formalism and expanding around flat, trivial backgrounds, we show that plane waves diagonalize the d'Alembertian, so that the entire function reduces to a multiplicative form factor in Minkowski momentum space. After Wick rotation, to the Euclidean axis, producing exponential ultraviolet damping in loop integrals without introducing additional poles or branch cuts. Our analysis provides a concise, gauge-covariant justification for the use of entire-function regulators in nonlocal quantum field theory.</description>

Our results establish a minimal geometric route to unification that does not rely on extra dimensions or symmetry breaking by hand. Unlike previous gauge-gravity constructions, the relative normalizations and ghost freedom emerge from a single Clifford-algebraic invariant, without explicit symmetry breaking.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.04055v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The background evolution in two-field inflation can feature two distinct stages, corresponding to the evolution along two successive field directions. When the second stage occurs at a significantly lower energy scale, the inflationary trajectory includes a sharp transition, accompanied by a series of rapid turns in field space. Fluctuations crossing the Hubble horizon during this turning phase can experience amplification by several orders of magnitude. This mechanism is very intuitive and can be implemented even in simple two-field models. It produces a peak in the scalar power spectrum that can lead to significant abundances of primordial black holes and secondary gravitational waves.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.06125v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop the computational framework for gravitational wave - black hole scattering in worldline quantum field theory (WQFT) without spin. Crucially, we prove on general grounds that, in the absence of dissipation, the exponential representation of the $S$-matrix maps -- through a partial-wave transformation -- directly onto the scattering phase shift from black hole perturbation theory (BHPT), indicating an exponentiation of the WQFT amplitude itself in partial-wave space. Computing explicitly, we reproduce the BHPT phase shift without spin up to $O(G^{3})$ from WQFT. While this result is expected, it lays the groundwork for higher-precision analyses involving non-minimal effects. Along the way, we outline our efficient diagram generation technique and include a pedagogical discussion on the computation of the required two-loop integrals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.15929v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Supermassive black hole growth plausibly occurs via runaway astrophysical black hole mergers in nuclear star clusters that form intermediate mass black hole seeds at high redshifts. Such a model of Little Red Dots yields an order-of-magnitude higher rate of tidal disruption events than that of black hole captures. Our prediction, normalised to our proposed resolution of SMBH seeding, yields detectable TDE rates at high redshift. The resulting dense gas cocoons generate the nuclei of LRDs, each incorporating a central massive black-hole-star, with comparable masses in gas, stars, and massive black hole within a scale of around a parsec as inferred from the various spectral signatures.</description>
