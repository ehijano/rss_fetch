      <title>Inferring dark matter subhalo properties from simulated subhalo-stream encounters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the cold dark matter paradigm, our Galaxy is predicted to contain &gt;10000 dark matter subhaloes in the $10^5-10^8M_\odot$ range which should be completely devoid of stars. Stellar streams are sensitive to the presence of these subhaloes, which can create small-scale features in streams if they pass closely enough. Modelling these encounters can therefore, potentially recover the subhalo's properties. In this work, we demonstrate this for streams generated in numerical simulations, modelled on eccentric orbits in a realistic Milky Way potential, which includes the Large Magellanic Cloud and the subhalo itself. We focus on a mock model of the ATLAS-Aliqa Uma stream and inject a $10^7 M_\odot$ subhalo, creating a similar discontinuous morphology to current observations. We then explore how well subhalo properties are recovered using mock stream observations, consisting of no observational errors, as well as assuming realistic observational setups. These setups include present day style observations, and what will be possible with 4MOST and Gaia DR5 in the future. We show that we can recover all parameters describing the impact even with uncertainties matching existing data, including subhalo positions, velocities, mass and scale radius. Modelling the subhalo on an orbit instead of assuming an impulse approximation, we greatly reduce the degeneracy between subhalo mass and velocity seen in previous works. However, we find a slight bias in the subhalo mass (~0.1 dex). This demonstrates that we should be able to reliably extract the properties of subhaloes with stellar streams in the near future.</description>

      <title>Probing star formation rates and histories in AGN and non-AGN galaxies across diverse cosmic environments and extensive X-ray luminosity ranges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we compare the SFRs and SFHs of AGN and non-AGN galaxies. We explore these aspects across different density fields and over three orders of magnitude in L$_X$. For that purpose, we employ X-ray AGN detected in the XMM-XXL field and construct a galaxy control sample, using sources from the VIPERS catalogue. Our final samples consist of 149 X-ray AGN with $\rm 42&lt;log,[L_{X,2-10keV}(ergs^{-1})]&lt;45$ and 3\,488 non-AGN systems. The sources span a redshift range of $\rm 0.5&lt;z&lt;1.0$ and $10.5&lt;\rm log\,[M_*(M_\odot)]&lt;11.5$. For these systems, there are available measurements for their local densities and their spectral lines from the VIPERS catalogue. To compare the SFR of these two populations, we calculate the SFR$_{norm}$ parameter. The latter is defined as the ratio of the SFR of AGN to the SFR of non-AGN galaxies with similar M$_*$ and redshift. Our findings reveal that low and moderate L$_X$ AGN that live in low density fields have a nearly flat SFR$_{norm}-$L$_X$ relation. In contrast, AGN of similar L$_X$ that live in high density environments present an increase of SFR$_{norm}$ with L$_X$. Notably, our results suggest that the most luminous of the AGN exhibit increased SFR relative to non-AGN galaxies, and this trend appears to be independent of the density of the environment. Furthermore, for AGN with similar L$_X$, those in high-density regions tend to have higher SFR$_{norm}$ values compared to their counterparts in low-density areas. Comparison of the D$_n$4000 spectral index, which serves as a proxy for the age of the stellar population, reveals that low-to-moderate L$_X$ AGN live in galaxies with comparable stellar populations with non-AGN systems, regardless of the density field they live in. However, the most luminous X-ray sources tend to live in galaxies that have younger stellar populations than non-AGN galaxies, regardless of the galaxy's environment.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Mpc Environment of the Quasar ULAS J1342+0928 at z = 7.54</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Theoretical models predict that z~6 quasars are hosted in the most massive halos of the underlying dark matter distribution and thus would be immersed in protoclusters of galaxies. However, observations report inconclusive results. We investigate the 1.1 pMpc2 environment of the z = 7.54 luminous quasar ULAS J1342+0928. We search for Lyman-break galaxy candidates (LBG) using deep imaging from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) in the ACS/F814W, WFC3/F105W/F125W bands, and Spitzer/IRAC at 3.6 $\mu$m and 4.5 $\mu$m. We report a zphot = $7.69^{+0.33}_{-0.23}$ LBG with magF125W = 26.41 at 223 projected-pkpc from the quasar. We find no HST counterpart to one [CII]-emitter previously found with ALMA at 27 projected-pkpc and $z[CII]=7.5341\pm0.0009$ (Venemans et al. 2020). We estimate the completeness of our LBG candidates using results from CANDELS/GOODS deep blank field searches sharing a similar filter setup. We find that &gt;50% of the z~7.5 LBGs with magF125W &gt;25.5 are missed due to the absence of a filter redward of the Lyman-break in F105W, hindering the UV color accuracy of the candidates. We conduct a QSO-LBG clustering analysis revealing a low LBG excess of $0.46^{+1.52}_{-0.08}$ in this quasar field, consistent with an average or low-density field. Consequently, this result does not present strong evidence of an LBG overdensity around ULAS J1342+0928. Furthermore, we identify two LBG candidates with a zphot matching a confirmed z=6.84 absorber along the line-of-sight to the quasar. All these galaxy candidates are excellent targets for follow-up observations with JWST and/or ALMA to confirm their redshift and physical properties.</description>

      <title>How complex are galaxies? A non-parametric estimation of the intrinsic dimensionality of wide-band photometric data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxies are complex objects, yet the number of independent parameters to describe them remains unknown. We present here a non-parametric method to estimate the intrinsic dimensionality of large datasets. We apply it to wide-band photometric data drawn from the COSMOS2020 catalogue and a comparable mock catalogue from the Horizon-AGN simulation. Our galaxy catalogues are limited in signal-to-noise ratio in all optical and NIR bands. Our results reveal that most of the variance in the wide-band photometry of this galaxy sample can be described with at most $4.3\pm0.5$ independent parameters for star-forming galaxies and $2.9\pm0.2$ for passive ones, both in the observed and simulated catalogues. We identify one of these parameters to be noise-driven, and recover that stellar mass and redshift are two key independent parameters driving the magnitudes. Our findings support the idea that wide-band photometry does not provide more than one additional independent parameter for star-forming galaxies. Although our sample is not mass-limited and may miss some passive galaxies due to our cut in SNR, our work suggests that dimensionality reduction techniques may be effectively used to explore and analyse wide-band photometric data, provided the used latent space is at least four-dimensional.</description>

      <title>Emission Line Predictions for Mock Galaxy Catalogues: a New Differentiable and Empirical Mapping from DESI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a simple, differentiable method for predicting emission line strengths from rest-frame optical continua using an empirically-determined mapping. Extensive work has been done to develop mock galaxy catalogues that include robust predictions for galaxy photometry, but reliably predicting the strengths of emission lines has remained challenging. Our new mapping is a simple neural network implemented using the JAX Python automatic differentiation library. It is trained on Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Early Release data to predict the equivalent widths (EWs) of the eight brightest optical emission lines (including H$\alpha$, H$\beta$, [O II], and [O III]) from a galaxy's rest-frame optical continuum. The predicted EW distributions are consistent with the observed ones when noise is accounted for, and we find Spearman's rank correlation coefficient $\rho_s &gt; 0.87$ between predictions and observations for most lines. Using a non-linear dimensionality reduction technique (UMAP), we show that this is true for galaxies across the full range of observed spectral energy distributions. In addition, we find that adding measurement uncertainties to the predicted line strengths is essential for reproducing the distribution of observed line-ratios in the BPT diagram. Our trained network can easily be incorporated into a differentiable stellar population synthesis pipeline without hindering differentiability or scalability with GPUs. A synthetic catalogue generated with such a pipeline can be used to characterise and account for biases in the spectroscopic training sets used for training and calibration of photo-$z$'s, improving the modelling of systematic incompleteness for the Rubin Observatory LSST and other surveys.</description>

      <title>PDRs4All VIII: Mid-IR emission line inventory of the Orion Bar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mid-infrared emission features probe the properties of ionized gas, and hot or warm molecular gas. The Orion Bar is a frequently studied photodissociation region (PDR) containing large amounts of gas under these conditions, and was observed with the MIRI IFU aboard JWST as part of the "PDRs4All" program. The resulting IR spectroscopic images of high angular resolution (0.2") reveal a rich observational inventory of mid-IR emission lines, and spatially resolve the substructure of the PDR, with a mosaic cutting perpendicularly across the ionization front and three dissociation fronts. We extracted five spectra that represent the ionized, atomic, and molecular gas layers, and measured the most prominent gas emission lines. An initial analysis summarizes the physical conditions of the gas and the potential of these data. We identified around 100 lines, report an additional 18 lines that remain unidentified, and measured the line intensities and central wavelengths. The H I recombination lines originating from the ionized gas layer bordering the PDR, have intensity ratios that are well matched by emissivity coefficients from H recombination theory, but deviate up to 10% due contamination by He I lines. We report the observed emission lines of various ionization stages of Ne, P, S, Cl, Ar, Fe, and Ni, and show how certain line ratios vary between the five regions. We observe the pure-rotational H$_2$ lines in the vibrational ground state from 0-0 S(1) to 0-0 S(8), and in the first vibrationally excited state from 1-1 S(5) to 1-1 S(9). We derive H$_2$ excitation diagrams, and approximate the excitation with one thermal (~700 K) component representative of an average gas temperature, and one non-thermal component (~2700 K) probing the effect of UV pumping. We compare these results to an existing model for the Orion Bar PDR and highlight the differences with the observations.</description>

Abstract: Thanks to the precise astrometric measurements of proper motions by the Gaia mission, a new tidal stellar stream has been discovered in the northern hemisphere. The distribution of star count shows that the stream is approximately $80$ degrees long and $1.70$ degrees wide. Observations of $21$ member stars, including 14 RR Lyrae stars, indicate that the stream has an eccentric and retrograde orbit with $e=0.58$. The low metallicity, high total energy, and large angular momentum suggest that it is associated with the merging event Sequoia. This discovery suggests the possibility of finding more substructures with high eccentricity orbits, even in the inner halo.</description>

      <title>A complex node of the cosmic web associated with the massive galaxy cluster MACS J0600.1-2008</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: MACS J0600.1-2008 (MACS0600) is an X-ray luminous, massive galaxy cluster at $z_{\mathrm{d}}=0.43$, studied previously as part of the REionization LensIng Cluster Survey (RELICS) and ALMA Lensing Cluster Survey (ALCS) projects which revealed a complex, bimodal mass distribution and an intriguing high-redshift object behind it. Here, we report on the results of an extended strong-lensing (SL) analysis of this system. Using new JWST and ground-based Gemini-N and Keck data, we obtain 13 new spectroscopic redshifts of multiply imaged galaxies and identify 12 new photometric multiple-image systems and candidates, including two multiply imaged $z\sim7$ objects. Taking advantage of the larger areal coverage, our analysis reveals a new bimodal, massive SL structure adjacent to the cluster which we measure spectroscopically to lie at the same redshift and whose existence was implied by previous SL-modeling analyses. While based in part on photometric systems identified in ground-based imaging requiring further verification, our extended SL model suggests that the cluster may have the second-largest critical area and effective Einstein radius observed to date, $A_{\mathrm{crit}}\simeq2.16\,\mathrm{arcmin}^2$ and $\theta_{\mathrm{E}}=49.7''\pm5.0''$ for a source at $z_{\mathrm{s}}=2$, enclosing a total mass of $M(&lt;\theta_{\mathrm{E}})=(4.7\pm0.7)\times10^{14}\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$. Yet another, probably related massive cluster structure, discovered in X-rays $5'$ (1.7 Mpc) further north, suggests that MACS0600 is in fact part of an even larger filamentary structure. This discovery adds to several recent detections of massive structures around SL galaxy clusters and establishes MACS0600 as a prime target for future high-redshift surveys with JWST.</description>

      <title>MusE GAs FLOw and Wind (MEGAFLOW) XI. Scaling relations between outflows and host galaxy properties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Absorption line spectroscopy using background quasars can provide strong constraints on galactic outflows. In this paper, we investigate possible scaling relations between outflow properties, namely outflow velocity \Vout, the mass ejection rate $\dot M_{\rm out}$, and the mass loading factor $\eta$ and the host galaxy properties, such as star formation rate (SFR), SFR surface density, redshift, and stellar mass using galactic outflows probed by background quasars from MEGAFLOW and other surveys. We find that $V_{\rm out}$ ($\eta$) is (anti-)correlated with SFR and SFR surface density. We extend the formalism of momentum-driven outflows of Heckman et al. to show that it applies not only to down the barrel studies but also to winds probed by background quasars, suggesting a possible universal wind formalism. Under this formalism, we find a clear distinction between ``strong'' and ``weak'' outflows where ``strong'' outflows seem to have tighter correlations with galaxy properties (SFR or galaxy stellar mass) than ``weak'' outflows.</description>

      <title>First detection in space of the high-energy isomer of cyanomethanimine: H2CNCN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the first detection in the interstellar medium of $N$-cyanomethanimine (H$_2$CNCN), the stable dimer of HCN of highest energy, and the most complex organic molecule identified in space containing the prebiotically relevant NCN backbone. We have identified a plethora of $a$-type rotational transitions with 3 $\leq J_\text{up} \leq$ 11 and $K_\text{a} \leq$ 2 that belong to this species towards the Galactic Center G+0.693-0.027 molecular cloud, the only interstellar source showing the three cyanomethanimine isomers (including the $Z$- and $E$- isomers of $C$-cyanomethanimine, HNCHCN). We have derived a total column density for H$_2$CNCN of (2.9$\, \pm \,$0.1)$\times$10$^{12}$ cm$^{-2}$, which translates into a total molecular abundance with respect to H$_2$ of (2.1$\, \pm \,$0.3)$\times$10$^{-11}$. We have also revisited the previous detection of $E$- and $Z$-HNCHCN, and found a total $C/N$-cyanomethanimine abundance ratio of 31.8$\, \pm \,$1.8 and a $Z/E$-HNCHCN ratio of 4.5$\, \pm \,$0.2. While the latter can be explained on the basis of thermodynamic equilibrium, chemical kinetics are more likely responsible for the observed $C/N$-cyanomethanimine abundance ratio, where the gas-phase reaction between methanimine (CH$_2$NH) and the cyanogen radical (CN) arises as the primary formation route.</description>

      <title>CO radial gradients in the bulge of M31</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new H- and K-band spectroscopy for the bulge of M31, taken with the LUCI spectrograph at the Large Binocular Telescope (LBT). We studied radial trends of CO absorption features (namely, CO1.58, CO1.60, CO1.64, CO1.66, CO1.68, CO2.30, CO2.32, CO2.35) in the bulge of M31, out to a galactocentric distance of 100'' (380pc). We find that most COs do not exhibit a strong radial gradient, despite the strong metallicity gradient inferred from the optical spectral range, except for CO1.64, showing a steep increase in the center. We compared the observed line strengths to predictions of different state-of-the-art stellar population models, including an updated version of EMILES models, which also uses the extended IRTF spectral library. The observed COs are close to models' predictions, but in some models they turn out to be underestimated. We find that the lack of radial gradients is due to the combination of increasing CO strength with metallicity and C abundance, and decreasing CO strength with IMF slope and O abundance. We speculate that the steep gradient of CO1.64 might be due to Na overabundance. Remarkably, we were able to fit, at the same time, optical indices and all the NIR COs except for CO1.68, leaving abundance ratios (i.e., [C/Fe], [O/Fe], and [Mg/Fe]) as free-fitting parameters, imposing age and metallicity constraints from the optical, with no significant contribution from intermediate-age populations. For the majority of the bulge, we find [Mg/Fe]~0.15dex, [O/Fe] larger than [Mg/Fe] (by ~0.1dex), and C abundance consistent with that of Mg. In the central (few arcsec) region, we still find an enhancement of O and Mg, but significantly lower [C/Fe]. We find that the COs' line strengths of the bulge are significantly lower than those of massive galaxies, possibly because of a difference in carbon abundance, as well as, to some extent, total metallicity.</description>

      <title>Shell-type Tidal Features Are More Frequently Detected in Slowly Rotating Early-type Galaxies than Stream- and Tail-type Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To enhance our understanding of the impact of galaxy mergers on the kinematics of early-type galaxies (ETGs), we examine differences in specific stellar angular momentum within the half-light radius ($\lambda_{R_e}$) among ETGs with different types of tidal features and those without such features. This is accomplished by categorizing tidal features, which serve as direct evidence of recent mergers, into shells, streams, and tails, through deep images from the DESI Legacy Survey, and by using MaNGA data for the analysis of the kinematics of 1244 ETGs at $z&lt;0.055$. We find that ETGs with tidal features typically have reduced $\lambda_{R_e}$ values that are lower by 0.12 dex than ETGs without tidal features. ETGs with shells contribute most to the reduction in $\lambda_{R_e}$. Consequently, nearly half of ETGs with shells are classified as slow rotators, a fraction that is more than twice as high as that of ETGs with tails or streams, and over three times higher than that of ETGs without tidal features. These trends generally remain valid even when ETGs are divided into several mass bins. Our findings support the idea that radial mergers, which are more effective at reducing $\lambda_{R_e}$ than circular mergers, are more closely associated with the formation of shells rather than streams or tails. The detection of shells in slightly more massive ETGs compared to streams and tails may be attributed to the fact that massive satellite galaxies are more likely to be accreted through radial orbits, due to the nature of dynamical friction.</description>

      <title>Experimental studies of black holes: status and future prospects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: More than a century ago, Albert Einstein presented his general theory of gravitation (GR) to the Prussian Academy of Sciences. One of the predictions of the theory is that not only particles and objects with mass, but also the quanta of light, photons, are tied to the curvature of space-time, and thus to gravity. There must be a critical mass density, above which photons cannot escape. These are black holes (henceforth BH). It took fifty years after the theory was announced before possible candidate objects were identified by observational astronomy. And another fifty years have passed, until we finally have in hand detailed and credible experimental evidence that BHs of 10 to 10^10 times the mass of the Sun exist in the Universe. Three very different experimental techniques, but all based on Michelson interferometry or Fourier-inversion spatial interferometry have enabled the critical experimental breakthroughs. It has now become possible to investigate the space-time structure in the vicinity of the event horizons of BHs. We briefly summarize these interferometric techniques, and discuss the spectacular recent improvements achieved with all three techniques. Finally, we sketch where the path of exploration and inquiry may go on in the next decades.</description>

      <title>The Rise of Faint, Red AGN at $z&gt;4$: A Sample of Little Red Dots in the JWST Extragalactic Legacy Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a sample of 341 "little red dots" (LRDs) spanning the redshift range $z\sim2-11$ using data from the CEERS, PRIMER, JADES, UNCOVER and NGDEEP surveys. These sources are likely heavily-reddened AGN that trace a previously-hidden phase of dust-obscured black hole growth in the early Universe. Unlike past use of color indices to identify LRDs, we employ continuum slope fitting using shifting bandpasses to sample the same rest-frame emission blueward and redward of the Balmer break. This approach allows us to identify LRDs over a wider redshift range and is less susceptible to contamination from galaxies with strong breaks that otherwise lack a rising red continuum. The redshift distribution of our sample increases at $z&lt;8$ and then undergoes a rapid decline at $z\sim4.5$, which may tie the emergence, and obscuration, of these sources to the inside-out growth that galaxies experience during this epoch. We find that LRDs are 2-3 dex more numerous than bright quasars at $z\sim5-7$, but their number density is only 0.6-1 dex higher than X-ray and UV selected AGN at these redshifts. Within our sample, we have identified the first X-ray detected LRDs at $z=3.1$ and $z=4.66$. An X-ray spectral analysis confirms that these AGN are moderately obscured with $\log\,(N_{\rm H}/{\rm cm}^{2}$) of $23.3^{+0.4}_{-1.3}$ and $22.72^{+0.13}_{-0.16}$. Our analysis reveals that reddened AGN emission dominates their rest-optical light, while the rest-UV originates from their host galaxies. We also present NIRSpec follow-up spectroscopy of 17 LRDs that show broad emission lines consistent with AGN activity. The confirmed AGN fraction of our sample is $71\%$ for sources with F444W$&lt;26.5$. In addition, we find three LRDs with narrow blue-shifted Balmer absorption features in their spectra, suggesting an outflow of high-density, low ionization gas from near the central engine of these faint, red AGN.</description>

      <title>Identifying Quasars from the DESI Bright Galaxy Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) cosmology survey includes a Bright Galaxy Survey (BGS) which will yield spectra for over ten million bright galaxies (r&lt;20.2 AB mag). The resulting sample will be valuable for both cosmological and astrophysical studies. However, the star/galaxy separation criterion implemented in the nominal BGS target selection algorithm excludes quasar host galaxies in addition to bona fide stars. While this excluded population is comparatively rare (~3-4 per square degrees), it may hold interesting clues regarding galaxy and quasar physics. Therefore, we present a target selection strategy that was implemented to recover these missing active galactic nuclei (AGN) from the BGS sample. The design of the selection criteria was both motivated and confirmed using spectroscopy. The resulting BGS-AGN sample is uniformly distributed over the entire DESI footprint. According to DESI survey validation data, the sample comprises 93% quasi-stellar objects (QSOs), 3% narrow-line AGN or blazars with a galaxy contamination rate of 2% and a stellar contamination rate of 2%. Peaking around redshift z=0.5, the BGS-AGN sample is intermediary between quasars from the rest of the BGS and those from the DESI QSO sample in terms of redshifts and AGN luminosities. The stacked spectrum is nearly identical to that of the DESI QSO targets, confirming that the sample is dominated by quasars. We highlight interesting small populations reaching z&gt;2 which are either faint quasars with nearby projected companions or very bright quasars with strong absorption features including the Lyman-apha forest, metal absorbers and/or broad absorption lines.</description>

      <title>Scaling Laws for Galaxy Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first systematic investigation of supervised scaling laws outside of an ImageNet-like context - on images of galaxies. We use 840k galaxy images and over 100M annotations by Galaxy Zoo volunteers, comparable in scale to Imagenet-1K. We find that adding annotated galaxy images provides a power law improvement in performance across all architectures and all tasks, while adding trainable parameters is effective only for some (typically more subjectively challenging) tasks. We then compare the downstream performance of finetuned models pretrained on either ImageNet-12k alone vs. additionally pretrained on our galaxy images. We achieve an average relative error rate reduction of 31% across 5 downstream tasks of scientific interest. Our finetuned models are more label-efficient and, unlike their ImageNet-12k-pretrained equivalents, often achieve linear transfer performance equal to that of end-to-end finetuning. We find relatively modest additional downstream benefits from scaling model size, implying that scaling alone is not sufficient to address our domain gap, and suggest that practitioners with qualitatively different images might benefit more from in-domain adaption followed by targeted downstream labelling.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the spacetime variation of the fine-structure constant using DESI emission-line galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present strong constraints on the spacetime variation of the fine-structure constant $\alpha$ using the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). In this pilot work, we utilize $\sim110,000$ galaxies with strong and narrow O III $\lambda\lambda$4959,5007 emission lines to measure the relative variation $\Delta\alpha/\alpha$ in space and time. The O III doublet is arguably the best choice for this purpose owing to its wide wavelength separation between the two lines and its strong emission in many galaxies. Our galaxy sample spans a redshift range of $0&lt;z&lt;0.95$, covering half of all cosmic time. We divide the sample into subsamples in 10 redshift bins ($\Delta z=0.1$), and calculate $\Delta\alpha/\alpha$ for the individual subsamples. The uncertainties of the measured $\Delta\alpha/\alpha$ are roughly between $2\times10^{-6}$ and $2\times10^{-5}$. We find an apparent $\alpha$ variation with redshift at a level of $\Delta\alpha/\alpha=(2\sim3)\times10^{-5}$. This is highly likely to be caused by systematics associated with wavelength calibration, since such small systematics can be caused by a wavelength distortion of $0.002-0.003$ \AA, which is beyond the accuracy that the current DESI data can achieve. We refine the wavelength calibration using sky lines for a small fraction of the galaxies, but it does not change our main results. We further probe the spatial variation of $\alpha$ in small redshift ranges, and do not find obvious, large-scale structures in the spatial distribution of $\Delta\alpha/\alpha$. As DESI is ongoing, we will include more galaxies, and by improving the wavelength calibration, we expect to obtain a better constraint that is comparable to the strongest current constraint.</description>

      <title>The R-Process Alliance: Analysis of Limited-r Stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. In recent years, the R-Process Alliance (RPA) has conducted a successful search for stars enhanced in elements produced by the rapid neutron-capture (r-)process. In particular, the RPA has uncovered a number of stars strongly enriched in light r-process elements, such as Sr, Y and Zr, the so-called limited-r stars, in order to investigate the astrophysical production site(s) of these elements. Aims. With this paper, we aim to investigate the possible formation sites for light neutron-capture elements, by deriving detailed abundances for neutron-capture elements from high-resolution, high signal-to-noise spectra of three limited-r stars. Methods. We conducted a 1D local thermodynamic equilibrium spectroscopic abundance analysis of three stars, as well as a kinematic analysis. Further, we calculated the lanthanide mass fraction (XLa) of our stars and of limited-r stars from the literature. Results. We found that the neutron-capture element abundance pattern of limited-r stars behaves differently depending on their [Ba/Eu]] ratios, and suggest that this should be taken into account in future investigations of their abundances. Furthermore, we found that the XLa of limited-r stars is lower than that of the kilonova AT2017gfo. The latter seems to be in the transition zone between limited-r XLa and that of r-I, r-II stars. Finally, we found that, unlike r-I and r-II stars, the current sample of limited-r stars are largely born in the Galaxy rather than being accreted.</description>

      <title>Near-IR Weak-Lensing (NIRWL) Measurements in the CANDELS Fields I: Point-Spread Function Modeling and Systematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.07725v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have undertaken a Near-IR Weak Lensing (NIRWL) analysis of the wide-field CANDELS HST/WFC3-IR F160W observations. With the Gaia proper-motion-corrected catalog as an astrometric reference, we updated the astrometry of the five CANDELS mosaics and achieved an absolute alignment within $0.02\pm0.02$ arcsec on average, which is a factor of several superior to existing mosaics. These mosaics are available to download. We investigated the systematic effects that need to be corrected for weak-lensing measurements. We find the largest contributing systematic effect is caused by undersampling. Using stars as a probe of the point-spread function (PSF), we find a sub-pixel centroid dependence on the PSF shape that induces a change in the PSF ellipticity and size by up to 0.02 and $3\%$, respectively. We find that the brighter-fatter effect causes a $2\%$ increase in the size of the PSF and discover a brighter-rounder effect that changes the ellipticity by 0.006. Based on the narrow bandpasses of the WFC3-IR filters and the small range of slopes in a galaxy's spectral energy distribution (SED) within the bandpasses, we suggest that the impact of galaxy SED on PSF is minor in the NIR. Finally, we modeled the PSF of WFC3-IR F160W for weak lensing using a principal component analysis. The PSF models account for temporal and spatial variations of the PSF. The PSF corrections result in residual ellipticities and sizes, $|de_1| &lt; 0.0005\pm0.0003$, $|de_2| &lt; 0.0005\pm0.0003$, and $|dR| &lt; 0.0005\pm0.0001$, that are sufficient for the upcoming NIRWL search for massive overdensities in the five CANDELS fields.

      <title>The Merian Survey: Design, Construction, and Characterization of a Filter Set Optimized to Find Dwarf Galaxies and Measure their Dark Matter Halo Properties with Weak Lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.19310v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Merian survey is mapping $\sim$ 850 degrees$^2$ of the Hyper Suprime-Cam Strategic Survey Program (HSC-SSP) wide layer with two medium-band filters on the 4-meter Victor M. Blanco telescope at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory, with the goal of carrying the first high signal-to-noise (S/N) measurements of weak gravitational lensing around dwarf galaxies. This paper presents the design of the Merian filter set: N708 ($\lambda_c = 7080 \unicode{x212B}$, $\Delta\lambda = 275\unicode{x212B}$) and N540 ($\lambda_c = 5400\unicode{x212B}$, $\Delta\lambda = 210\unicode{x212B}$). The central wavelengths and filter widths of N708 and N540 were designed to detect the $\rm H\alpha$ and $\rm [OIII]$ emission lines of galaxies in the mass range $8&lt;\rm \log M_*/M_\odot&lt;9$ by comparing Merian fluxes with HSC broad-band fluxes. Our filter design takes into account the weak lensing S/N and photometric redshift performance. Our simulations predict that Merian will yield a sample of $\sim$ 85,000 star-forming dwarf galaxies with a photometric redshift accuracy of $\sigma_{\Delta z/(1+z)}\sim 0.01$ and an outlier fraction of $\eta=2.8\%$ over the redshift range $0.058&lt;z&lt;0.10$. With 60 full nights on the Blanco/Dark Energy Camera (DECam), the Merian survey is predicted to measure the average weak lensing profile around dwarf galaxies with lensing $\rm S/N \sim 32$ within $r&lt;0.5$ Mpc and lensing $\rm S/N \sim 90$ within $r&lt;1.0$ Mpc. This unprecedented sample of star-forming dwarf galaxies will allow for studies of the interplay between dark matter and stellar feedback and their roles in the evolution of dwarf galaxies.</description>

      <title>MHD Simulation in Galactic Center Region with Radiative Cooling and Heating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.15761v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the role of magnetic field on the gas dynamics in a galactic bulge region by three dimensional simulations with radiative cooling and heating. While high-temperature corona with $T&gt;10^6\ {\rm K}$ is formed in the halo regions, the temperature near the mid-plane is $\lesssim 10^4\ {\rm K}$ following the thermal equilibrium curve determined by the radiative cooling and heating. Although the thermal energy of the interstellar gas is lost by radiative cooling, the saturation level of the magnetic field strength does not significantly depend on the radiative cooling and heating. The magnetic field strength is amplified to $10\ {\rm \mu G}$ on average, and reaches several hundred ${\rm \mu G}$ locally. We find the formation of magnetically dominated regions at mid-latitudes in the case with the radiative cooling and heating, which is not seen in the case without radiative effect. The vertical thickness of the mid-latitude regions is $50-150\ {\rm pc}$ at the radial location of $0.4-0.8\ {\rm kpc}$ from the galactic center, which is comparable to the observed vertical distribution of neutral atomic gas. When we take the average of different components of energy density integrated over the galactic bulge region, the magnetic energy is comparable to the thermal energy. We conclude that the magnetic field plays a substantial role in controlling the dynamical and thermal properties of the galactic bulge region.</description>

      <title>Rotation Curve Fitting Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.04372v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One key piece of evidence for dark matter is the flat rotation curve problem: the disagreement between measured galactic rotation curves and their luminous mass. A novel solution to this problem is presented here. A model of relativistic frame effects on Doppler shifts due to the slightly curved frames of an emitting galaxy and the Milky Way is derived. This model predicts observed Doppler shifted spectra (in excess of the luminous mass) based only on the observed luminous matter profile and one free model parameter. Fits to the 175 galaxies reported in the SPARC database of galactic rotation profiles and accurate photometry measurements are compared between this novel model and dark matter and MOND (RAR) models. We find on the SPARC sample of 175 galaxies; that MOND-RAR has an average reduced chisquare of $\chi^2_r = 4.22$ for 175 galaxies fitted, the isothermal dark matter model has $\chi^2_r = 1.90$ for 165 galaxies fitted, and the new model we present has $\chi^2_r = 2.39$ for 172 galaxies fitted. Implications of this model are discussed.</description>

      <title>A self-similar model of galaxy formation and dark halo relaxation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13952v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a spherical self-similar model for the formation of a galaxy through gas collapsing in an isolated self-gravitating dark matter halo. We improve upon the existing literature on self-similar collapse in two ways. First, we include the effects of radiative cooling and the formation of a pseudo-disk at the center of collapse, in a parametrised manner. More importantly, we solve for the evolution of gas and dark matter simultaneously and self-consistently using a novel iterative approach. As a result, our model produces shell trajectories of both gas and dark matter that qualitatively agree with the results of full hydrodynamical simulations. We discuss the impact of various ingredients such as the accretion rate, gas equation of state, disk radius and cooling rate amplitude on the evolution of the gas shells. The self-consistent evolution of gas and dark matter allows us to study the response of the dark matter trajectories to the presence of collapsing gas, an effect that has gained increasing importance recently in the context of precision estimates of small-scale statistics like the matter power spectrum. Our default configuration produces a relaxation relation in qualitative agreement with that seen in cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, and further allows us to easily study the impact of the model ingredients mentioned above. As an initial application, we vary one ingredient at a time and find that the accretion rate and gas equation of state have the largest impact on the relaxation relation, while the cooling amplitude plays only a minor role. Our model thus provides a convenient framework to rapidly explore the coupled nonlinear impact of multiple astrophysical processes on the mass and velocity profiles of dark matter in galactic halos.

      <title>Radio imaging of gravitationally lensed radio-quiet quasars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19357v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present 6-GHz Very Large Array radio images of 70 gravitational lens systems at 300-mas resolution, in which the source is an optically-selected quasar, and nearly all of which have two lensed images. We find that about in half of the systems (40/70, with 33/70 secure), one or more lensed images are detected down to our detection limit of 20microJy/beam, similar to previous investigations and reinforcing the conclusion that typical optically-selected quasars have intrinsic GHz radio flux densities of a few microJy ($\sim10^{23}$WHz$^{-1}$ at redshifts of 1--2). In addition, for ten cases it is likely that the lensing galaxies are detected in the radio. Available detections of, and limits on the far-infrared luminosities from the literature, suggest that nearly all of the sample lie on the radio-FIR correlation typical of star-forming galaxies, and that their radio luminosities are at least compatible with the radio emission being produced by star formation processes. One object, WISE2329$-$1258, has an extra radio component that is not present in optical images, and is difficult to explain using simple lens models. In-band spectral indices, where these can be determined, are generally moderately steep and consistent with synchrotron processes either from star-formation/supernovae or AGN. Comparison of the A/B image flux ratios at radio and optical wavelengths suggests a 10 per cent level contribution from finite source effects or optical extinction to the optical flux ratios, together with sporadic larger discrepancies that are likely to be due to optical microlensing.</description>

      <title>Physical properties of circumnuclear ionising clusters. III. Kinematics of gas and stars in NGC 7742</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02303v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this third paper of a series, we study the kinematics of the ionised gas and stars, calculating the dynamical masses of the circumnuclear star-forming regions in the ring of of the face-on spiral NGC 7742. We have used high spectral resolution data from the MEGARA instrument attached to the Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC) to measure the kinematical components of the nebular emission lines of selected HII regions and the stellar velocity dispersions from the CaT absorption lines that allow the derivation of the associated cluster virialized masses. The emission line profiles show two different kinematical components: a narrow one with velocity dispersion $\sim$ 10 km/s and a broad one with velocity dispersion similar to those found for the stellar absorption lines. The derived star cluster dynamical masses range from 2.5 $\times$ 10$^6$ to 10.0 $\times$ 10$^7$ M$_\odot$. The comparison of gas and stellar velocity dispersions suggests a scenario where the clusters have formed simultaneously in a first star formation episode with a fraction of the stellar evolution feedback remaining trapped in the cluster, subject to the same gravitational potential as the cluster stars. Between 0.15 and 7.07 % of the total dynamical mass of the cluster would have cooled down and formed a new, younger, population of stars, responsible for the ionisation of the gas currently observed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.08785v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compile a catalog of 578 highly probable and 62 likely red supergiants (RSGs) of the Milky Way, which represents the largest list of Galactic RSG candidates designed for continuous follow-up to date. We match distances measured by Gaia DR3, 2MASS photometry, and a 3D Galactic dust map to obtain luminous bright late-type stars. Determining the stars' bolometric luminosities and effective temperatures, we compare to Geneva stellar evolution tracks to determine likely RSG candidates, and quantify contamination using a catalog of Galactic AGB in the same luminosity-temperature space. We add details for common or interesting characteristics of RSG, such as multi-star system membership, variability, and classification as a runaway. As potential future core-collapse supernova (SN) progenitors, we study the ability of the catalog to inform the Supernova Early Warning System (SNEWS) coincidence network made to automate pointing, and show that for 3D position estimates made possible by neutrinos, the number of progenitor candidates can be significantly reduced, improving our ability to observe the progenitor pre-explosion and the early phases of the core-collapse supernova.</description>

Abstract: It has been claimed in I. Arraut, 2023 EPL 144 29003 [arXiv:2311.05652] that General Relativity can generate effects equivalent to dark matter, based on a "new modified symmetry that emerges at galactic scale". We show that (i) the spacetime considered is unphysical, violating energy conditions everywhere; (ii) actually no new symmetry emerges, which results from incorrect definitions of angular momentum, velocity, and arclength in the proposed geometry; (iii) no Tully-Fisher law, or flat rotation curves are obtained either, they simply result from a series of errors in the equations.</description>

      <title>Discovery of Asymmetric Spike-like Structures of the 10 au Disk around the Very Low-luminosity Protostar Embedded in the Taurus Dense Core MC 27/L1521F with ALMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00305v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations have revealed an increasing number of compact protostellar disks with radii of less than a few tens of astronomical units and that young Class 0/I objects have an intrinsic size diversity. To deepen our understanding of the origin of such tiny disks, we performed the highest-resolution configuration observations with ALMA at a beam size of $\sim$0$''$03 (4 au) on the very low-luminosity Class 0 protostar embedded in the Taurus dense core MC 27/L1521F. The 1.3 mm continuum measurement successfully resolved a tiny, faint ($\sim$1 mJy) disk with a major axis length of $\sim$10 au, one of the smallest examples in the ALMA protostellar studies. In addition, we detected spike-like components in the northeastern direction at the disk edge. Gravitational instability or other fragmentation mechanisms cannot explain the structures, given the central stellar mass of $\sim$0.2 $M_{\odot}$ and the disk mass of $\gtrsim$10$^{-4}$ $M_{\odot}$. Instead, we propose that these small spike structures were formed by a recent dynamic magnetic flux transport event due to interchange instability that would be favorable to occur if the parental core has a strong magnetic field. The presence of complex arc-like structures on a larger ($\sim$2000 au) scale in the same direction as the spike structures suggests that the event was not single. Such episodic, dynamical events may play an important role in maintaining the compact nature of the protostellar disk in the complex gas envelope during the main accretion phase.</description>
