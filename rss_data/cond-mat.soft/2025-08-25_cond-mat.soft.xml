      <title>Sedimenting rigid particles of certain shapes approach a stationary orientation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates experimentally and numerically the dynamics of rigid particles settling under gravity in a highly viscous fluid. We demonstrate that certain shapes: cones, crescent moons, arrowheads, and open flat rings reorient and approach a stationary configuration. We determine the mobility coefficients and the characteristic reorientation times. We find out that the two rotational-translational mobility coefficients have opposite signs. Therefore, based on the equations of motion for rigid bodies with two orthogonal planes of symmetry, theoretically derived by Joshi and Govindarajan, Phys. Rev. Lett., 134, 2025, 014002 and Ekiel-Jezewska and Wajnryb, J. Phys. Condens. Matter, 21, 2009, 204102, we conclude that the approached stationary configurations are stable. Owing to the similarity principle, our experimental findings apply to micro-objects in water-based solutions. The reorientation of sedimenting rigid particles of certain shapes to a stationary stable configuration in a relatively short time might be used for biological, medical, or industrial applications.</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium evaporation of Lennard-Jones fluids: Enskog-Vlasov theory and Hertz-Knudsen model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enskog-Vlasov equation is currently the most sophisticated kinetic model for describing non-equilibrium evaporative flows. While it enables more efficient simulations than the molecular dynamics (MD) methods, its accuracy in reproducing the flow properties of real fluids is limited by the underlying assumptions of the Vlasov forcing term. To address this limitation, this work proposes a molecular kinetic model specifically designed for real fluids, with the Lennard-Jones fluids as an example. The model is first applied to evaluate the equilibrium characteristics of a liquid-vapour system, including the liquid-vapour coexistence curve, vapour pressure, and surface tension coefficient. The results show excellent agreement with the MD simulation and experimental data. Furthermore, the model is used to investigate non-equilibrium evaporation, with a particular focus on the velocity distribution function adjacent to the liquid-vapour interface. The findings reveal significant deviations from the Maxwellian distribution in the vapour region, suggesting that the classical Hertz-Knudsen relation becomes inaccurate when non-equilibrium effects are pronounced. Therefore, this work represents a critical step towards the development of an accurate and efficient computational framework for modelling non-equilibrium liquid-vapour flows for real fluids, with direct relevance to practical applications such as flow cooling.</description>

      <title>Noisy active matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Noise threads every scale of the natural world. Once dismissed as mere background hiss, it is now recognized as both a currency of information and a source of order in systems driven far from equilibrium. From nanometer-scale motor proteins to meter-scale bird flocks, active collectives harness noise to break symmetry, explore decision landscapes, and poise themselves at the cusp where sensitivity and robustness coexist. We review the physics that underpins this paradox: how energy-consuming feedback rectifies stochastic fluctuations, how multiplicative noise seeds patterns and state transitions, and how living ensembles average the residual errors. Bridging single-molecule calorimetry, critical flocking, and robophysical swarms, we propose a unified view in which noise is not background blur but a tunable resource for adaptation and emergent order in biology and engineered active matter.</description>

      <title>Dynamic driving enables independent control of material bits for targeted memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mechanical structures made from bistable elements can store configurational memories to enable tunable stiffness, sequential shape-morphing, and computation. While control over configurations is essential, it typically requires local and individual access to all elements. Here, we introduce a dynamic control strategy that enables transitions between any pair of configurations within a single global drive cycle by exploiting sensitivity to different (orders of) derivatives of the driving. We illustrate this approach using bistable beams that snap through based on their collective rotation rate and acceleration. Through rational design and selection of drive cycles, we demonstrate targeted transitions along controllable pathways, including the writing of five-bit memories that encode all alphabetic characters. This form of dynamical control can be generalized to inertial, fluidic, electromagnetic, and electronic systems, thus providing a powerful method for writing memories and enabling smart, remotely controllable devices for applications in microfluidics, implants, smart infrastructure, and underwater or medical robotics.</description>

      <title>Persistence of Coffee-Ring Deposits in Concentrated Suspensions of Anisotropic Colloids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When droplets of colloidal suspensions evaporate, the suspended colloids are transported to the edge of the drop by an outward radial flow. The resulting dried deposit has a high concentration of colloids along it's perimeter, and a low concentration near the center. This effect has been dubbed the coffee-ring effect [Deegan et al., Nature, 1997, 389, 827], and is undesirable in applications such as inkjet printing, where a smooth deposition would lead to more efficient coatings. Previous attempts at suppressing this effect using particle anisotropy have paradoxically shown that anisotropic particles can (1) form even deposits [Yunker et al., Nature, 2011, 476, 308] and (2) enhance the coffee ring effect [Dugyala et al., J. Phys. Chem. B, 2014, 119, 3860]. Here we use surface profilometry data to characterize the width of the dried deposits containing rod-shaped silica colloids of aspect ratios ranging from 1 to 20. We observe deposits over a broad range of concentrations (up to 0.35 volume fraction), and find that the width of the ring is independent of the particle anisotropy, even at previously unexplored high volume fractions. We also observe that polystyrene spheres form more even deposits than silica spheres when evaporated at high temperatures. This result serves to unify the literature by identifying a key parameter in controlling the deposit shape: the difference between the sedimentation velocity of colloids in solution and the velocity of the air-water interface.</description>

      <title>Multiscale Analysis of a Kinetic Model of Confined Suspensions of Self-Propelled Rods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The behavior of active matter under confinement poses significant challenges due to the intricate coupling between dynamics near boundaries and those in the bulk. A defining feature of active matter systems is that a substantial portion of their dynamics takes place near confining boundaries. In our previous work, we developed a kinetic framework that enables direct computation of the probability distribution functions for both the position and orientation of active rods. A distinguishing aspect of this approach is its explicit treatment of wall accumulation through the use of two coupled probability distribution functions: one describing the bulk population and the other representing rods accumulated at the boundary. Another novel feature is the structure of the governing equation, which is degenerate: it is second-order in one non-temporal variable and first-order in another. The main focus of this paper is to rigorously justify this model via multi-scale analysis. We first establish well-posedness of the system and then employ two distinct multi-scale derivations to obtain the model as a singular limit of a more classical kinetic system in the regime of vanishing translational diffusion. For analytical clarity, we consider the case in which active rods, once accumulated at the wall, remain permanently confined there. This work provides a rigorous mathematical foundation for reduced kinetic models of confined active matter, bridging microscopic dynamics and macroscopic accumulation phenomena.</description>

      <title>Crystal growth at a liquid-liquid interface upon drop impact</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The crystallisation that occurs when a drop is placed in contact with a cold surface is a particularly challenging phenomenon to capture experimentally and describe theoretically. The situation of a liquid-liquid interface, where crystals appear on a mobile interface is scarcely studied although it provides a defect-free interface. In this paper, we quantify the dynamics of crystals appearing upon the impact of a drop on a cool liquid bath. We rationalize our observations with a model considering that crystals appear at a constant rate depending on the thermal shock on the expanding interface. This model provides dimensionless curves on the number and the surface area of crystals that we compare to our experimental measurements.</description>

      <title>Multiscale Growth Kinetics of Model Biomolecular Condensates Under Passive and Active Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Living cells exhibit a complex organization comprising numerous compartments, among which are RNA- and protein-rich membraneless, liquid-like organelles known as biomolecular condensates. Energy-consuming processes regulate their formation and dissolution, with (de-)phosphorylation by specific enzymes being among the most commonly involved reactions. By employing a model system consisting of a phosphorylatable peptide and homopolymeric RNA, we elucidate how enzymatic activity modulates the growth kinetics and alters the local structure of biomolecular condensates. Under passive condition, time-resolved ultra-small-angle X-ray scattering with synchrotron source reveals a nucleation-driven coalescence mechanism maintained over four decades in time, similar to the coarsening of simple binary fluid mixtures. Coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations show that peptide-decorated RNA chains assembled shortly after mixing constitute the relevant subunits. In contrast, actively-formed condensates initially display a local mass fractal structure, which gradually matures upon enzymatic activity before condensates undergo coalescence. Both types of condensate eventually reach a steady state but fluorescence recovery after photobleaching indicates a peptide diffusivity twice higher in actively-formed condensates consistently with their loosely-packed local structure. We expect multiscale, integrative approaches implemented with model systems to link effectively the functional properties of membraneless organelles to their formation and dissolution kinetics as regulated by cellular active processes.</description>

      <title>Mechanical non-reciprocity programmed by shear jamming in soft composite solids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17083v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mechanical non-reciprocity-manifested as asymmetric responses to opposing mechanical stimuli-has traditionally been achieved through intricate structural nonlinearities in metamaterials. However, continuum solids with inherent non-reciprocal mechanics remain underexplored, despite their promising potential for applications such as wave guiding, robotics, and adaptive materials. Here, we introduce a design principle by employing the shear jamming transition from granular physics to engineer non-reciprocal mechanics in soft composite solids. Through the control of the interplay between inclusion contact networks and matrix elasticity, we achieve tunable, direction-dependent asymmetry in both shear and normal mechanical responses. In addition to static regimes, we demonstrate programmable non-reciprocal dynamics by combining responsive magnetic profiles with the anisotropic characteristics of shear-jammed systems. This strategy enables asymmetric spatiotemporal control over motion transmission, a previously challenging feat in soft materials. Our work establishes a novel paradigm for designing non-reciprocal matter, bridging granular physics with soft material engineering to realize functionalities essential for mechano-intelligent systems.</description>

      <title>Breaking better: How imperfections increase fracture resistance in architected lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08873v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fracture behavior in architected materials can be influenced by heterogeneities, yet the mechanisms by which imperfections affect crack propagation remain poorly understood. In this study, we introduce well-controlled, localized defects in the form of isolated missing struts to evaluate their impact on crack growth in brittle lattice specimens. Using mechanical testing combined with digital image correlation (DIC), we track crack propagation and identify failure processes at the scale of individual lattice cells. While the imperfections do not alter the location of crack initiation or the peak load, they consistently lead to an increase in work to failure when the crack path is tortuous or crack bridging occurs. These findings demonstrate how small, targeted modifications to an otherwise regular lattice can significantly influence fracture resistance in brittle architected materials.</description>

      <title>A physics-informed neural network for modeling fracture without gradient damage: formulation, application, and assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07272v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate computational modeling of damage and fracture remains a central challenge in solid mechanics. The finite element method (FEM) is widely used for numerical modeling of fracture problems; however, classical damage models without gradient regularization yield mesh-dependent and usually inaccurate predictions. The use of gradient damage with FEM improves numerical robustness but introduces significant mathematical and numerical implementation complexities. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) can encode the governing partial differential equations, boundary conditions, and constitutive models into the loss functions, offering a new method for fracture modeling. Prior applications of PINNs have been limited to small-strain problems and have incorporated gradient damage formulation without a critical evaluation of its necessity. Since PINNs in their basic form are meshless, this work presents a PINN framework for modeling fracture in elastomers undergoing large deformation without the gradient damage formulation. The PINN implementation here does not require training data and utilizes the collocation method to formulate physics-informed loss functions. We have validated the PINN's predictions for various defect configurations using benchmark solutions obtained from FEM with gradient damage formulation. The crack paths obtained using the PINN are approximately insensitive to the collocation point distribution. This study offers new insights into the feasibility of using PINNs without gradient damage and suggests a simplified and efficient computational modeling strategy for fracture problems. The performance of the PINN has been evaluated through systematic variations in key neural network parameters to provide guidance for future applications. The results provide motivation for extending PINN-based approaches to a broader class of materials and damage models in mechanics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07055v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We adapt the Edwards-Muthukumar theoretical framework for a single polymer chain to investigate the interplay between proton binding and counterion condensation for poly-acids. We find that changes to pH enable non-monotonic transitions between anti- and conventional polyelectrolyte behaviors. In the former, the net charge and the overall dimensions increase with increasing salt concentration, while the converse is true for conventional polyelectrolytes. The polymeric nature and local solvent polarization drive significant pKa shifts when compared to the values of reference monoacids. These pKa shifts are enhanced in semi-flexible chains.</description>

      <title>Objective comparison of methods to decode anomalous diffusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2105.06766v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deviations from Brownian motion leading to anomalous diffusion are found in transport dynamics from quantum physics to life sciences. The characterization of anomalous diffusion from the measurement of an individual trajectory is a challenging task, which traditionally relies on calculating the trajectory mean squared displacement. However, this approach breaks down for cases of practical interest, e.g., short or noisy trajectories, heterogeneous behaviour, or non-ergodic processes. Recently, several new approaches have been proposed, mostly building on the ongoing machine-learning revolution. To perform an objective comparison of methods, we gathered the community and organized an open competition, the Anomalous Diffusion challenge (AnDi). Participating teams applied their algorithms to a commonly-defined dataset including diverse conditions. Although no single method performed best across all scenarios, machine-learning-based approaches achieved superior performance for all tasks. The discussion of the challenge results provides practical advice for users and a benchmark for developers.</description>

      <title>Critical Motility-Induced Phase Separation in Three Dimensions is Consistent with Ising Universality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09069v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Identifying the universality class of critical active phase transitions has been the subject of recent interest and controversy. Resolving these controversies will require robust numerical investigations to determine whether active critical exponents point to novel universality classes or are consistent with established ones. Here, we conduct large-scale computer simulations and a finite-size scaling analysis of motility-induced phase separation (MIPS) in three dimensions (3D), finding that the static and dynamic critical exponents all closely match those of the 3D Ising universality class with a conserved scalar order parameter. This finding is corroborated by a fluctuating hydrodynamic description of the critical dynamics of the order parameter field which flows to the Wilson-Fisher fixed point in three dimensions. Our work suggests that 3D MIPS and likely the entire phase diagram of active Brownian spheres is similar to that of molecular passive fluids despite the absence of Boltzmann statistics.</description>

Abstract: In statistical physics, it is well established that the liquid-gas (LG) phase transition with divergent critical fluctuations belongs to the Ising universality class. Whether non-equilibrium effects can alter this universal behavior remains a fundamental open question. Here, we theoretically investigate LG criticality in a hyperuniform (HU) fluid of active spinners, where phase separation is driven by dissipative collisions. Strikingly, at the critical point the HU fluid displays normal Gaussian density fluctuations rather than the expected divergence, while the compressibility still diverges. The system is thus calm yet highly susceptible, in fundamental violation of the conventional fluctuation-dissipation theorem. Consistently, we observe anomalous zero-range correlation functions coexisting with quasi-long-range response functions. Based on a generalized model B and renormalization-group analysis, we show that hyperuniformity reduces the upper critical dimension from $d_c = 4$ to $d_c = 2$, and the system exhibits anomalous finite-size scaling in density fluctuations, energy fluctuations, and the Binder cumulant. Furthermore, the HU fluid undergoes non-classical spinodal decomposition, where the decomposition time diverges but the characteristic length scale remains finite as criticality is approached. The origin of these anomalies lies in the center-of-mass-conserving dynamics of the spinners, which endows the system with a scale-dependent effective temperature, $T_{\rm eff} \propto q^2$, underlying a generalized fluctuation-dissipation relationship. These findings establish a striking exception to classical paradigms of critical phenomena and illustrate how non-equilibrium forces can fundamentally reshape universality classes.</description>
