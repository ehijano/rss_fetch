      <title>Pairing at a single Van Hove point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that an interacting electronic system with a single ordinary or extended Van Hove point, which crosses the Fermi energy, is unstable against triplet superconductivity. The pairing mechanism is unconventional. There is no Cooper instability. Instead, pairing is due to the divergence of the density of states at a Van Hove point, leading to a superconducting quantum critical point at a finite detuning from the Van Hove point. The transition temperature is universally determined by the exponent governing the divergence of the density of states. Enhancing this exponent drastically increases $T_c$. The Cooper pair wave function has a non-monotonic momentum dependence with a steep slope near the gap nodes. In the absence of spin-orbit coupling, pairing fluctuations suppress a $2e$ spin-triplet state, but allow pairs of triplets to condense into a charge-$4e$ singlet state at a temperature of similar order as our result.</description>

      <title>Spin dynamics in itinerant antiferromagnet ${\rm\bf SrCr_2As_2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SrCr$_2$As$_2$ is an itinerant antiferromagnet in the same structural family as the SrFe2As2 high-temperature superconductors. We report our calculations of exchange coupling parameters $J_{ij}$ for SrCr$_2$As$_2$ using a static linear-response method based on first-principles electronic structure calculations. We find that the dominant nearest neighbor exchange coupling $J_{\rm{1}} &gt; 0$ is antiferromagnetic whereas the next-nearest neighbor interaction $J_{\rm{2}} &lt; 0$ is ferromagnetic with $J_{\rm{2}}$/$J_{\rm{1}}$~=~$-0.68$, reinforcing the checkerboard in-plane structure. Thus, unlike other transition-metal arsenides based on Mn, Fe, or Co, we find no competing magnetic interactions in SrCr$_2$As$_2$, which aligns with experimental findings. Moreover, the orbital resolution of exchange interactions shows that $J_1$ and $J_2$ are dominated by direct exchange mediated by the Cr $d$ orbitals. To validate the calculations we conduct inelastic neutron-scattering measurements on powder samples that show steeply dispersive magnetic excitations arising from the magnetic $\Gamma$ points and persisting up to energies of at least 175 meV. The spin-wave spectra are then modeled using the Heisenberg Hamiltonian with the theoretically calculated exchange couplings. The calculated neutron scattering spectra are in good agreement with the experimental data.</description>

      <title>CMOS-Compatible Ultrathin Superconducting NbN Thin Films Deposited by Reactive Ion Sputtering on 300 mm Si Wafer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a milestone in achieving large-scale, ultrathin (~5 nm) superconducting NbN thin films on 300 mm Si wafers using a high-volume manufacturing (HVM) industrial physical vapor deposition (PVD) system. The NbN thin films possess remarkable structural uniformity and consistently high superconducting quality across the entire 300 mm Si wafer, by incorporating an AlN buffer layer. High-resolution X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy analyses unveiled enhanced crystallinity of (111)-oriented {\delta}-phase NbN with the AlN buffer layer. Notably, NbN films deposited on AlN-buffered Si substrates exhibited a significantly elevated superconducting critical temperature (~2 K higher for the 10 nm NbN) and a higher upper critical magnetic field or Hc2 (34.06 T boost in Hc2 for the 50 nm NbN) in comparison with those without AlN. These findings present a promising pathway for the integration of quantum-grade superconducting NbN films with the existing 300 mm CMOS Si platform for quantum information applications.</description>

      <title>Quasiperiodic pairing in graphene quasicrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the superconducting phase diagram of twisted bilayer graphene quasicrystals (TBGQC) obtained by stacking two monolayer graphene sheets with a $30^\circ$ relative twisting. The electronic energy spectrum of TBGQC contains periodic energy ranges (PER) and quasiperiodic energy ranges (QER), where the underlying local density of states (LDOS) exhibits periodic and quasiperiodic distribution, respectively. We found that superconductivity in the PER is a simple superposition of two monolayer superconductors. This is because, particularly near the charge neutrality point of TBGQC, the two layers are weekly coupled, leading to pairing instabilities with uniform distribution in real space. On the other hand, within QER, the inhomogeneous distribution of the LDOS enhances the superconducting instability with a non-uniform distribution of pairing amplitudes, leading to quasiperiodic superconductivity. Our study can qualitatively explain the superconductivity in recently discovered moir\'e quasicrystals, which show superconductivity in its QER.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity Discovered in Niobium Polyhydride at High Pressures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Niobium polyhydride was synthesized at high pressure and high temperature conditions by using diamond anvil cell combined with in situ high pressure laser heating techniques. High pressure electric transport experiments demonstrate that superconducting transition occurs with critical temperature(Tc) 42 K at 187 GPa. The shift of Tc as function of external applied magnetic field is in consistent to the nature of superconductivity while the upper critical field at zero temperature Hc2(0) is estimated to~16.8 Tesla while the GL coherent length ~57 angstrom is estimated. The structure investigation using synchrotron radiation implies that the observed superconductivity may come from Fm-3m phase of NbH3.</description>

      <title>Drone based superconducting single photon detection system with detection efficiency more than 90%</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bounded by the size, weight, and power consumption (SWaP) of conventional superconducting single photon detectors (SSPD), applications of SSPDs were commonly confined in the laboratory. However, booming demands for high efficiency single photon detector incorporated with avionic platforms arise with the development of remote imaging and sensing or long-haul quantum communication without topographical constraints. We herein designed and manufactured the first drone based SSPD system with a SDE as high as 91.8%. This drone based SSPD system is established with high performance NbTiN SSPDs, self-developed miniature liquid helium dewar, and homemade integrated electric setups, which is able to be launched in complex topographical conditions. Such a drone based SSPD system may open the use of SSPDs for applications that demand high-SDE in complex environments.</description>

      <title>Observation of single-quantum vortex splitting in the Ba$_{1-x}$K$_x$Fe$_2$As$_2$ superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since their theoretical discovery more than a half-century ago, vortices observed in bulk superconductors have carried a quantized value of magnetic flux determined only by fundamental constants. A recent experiment reported 'unquantized' quantum vortices carrying the same fraction of flux quantum in Ba$_{0.23}$K$_{0.77}$Fe$_2$As$_2$ in a small temperature range below its superconducting critical temperature ($T_C$). Here, we use scanning superconducting quantum interference device (sSQUID) microscopy with improved sensitivity to investigate the genesis of fractional vortices in Ba$_{0.23}$K$_{0.77}$Fe$_2$As$_2$. We report the direct observation of a single-flux quantum vortex splitting into two different fractions with increasing temperature. The flux of the two fractions has opposite dependence on temperature, while the total flux sums up to one flux quantum despite their spatial separation. Overall, our study shows the existence of different fractional vortices and their stability in temperature ranging from 0.1 to 0.99 $T_C$. Besides the implications of this observation for the fundamental question of quantum vorticity, the discovery of these objects paves the way for the new platform for anyon quasiparticles and applications for fractional fluxonics.</description>

      <title>Lifetime of edge modes at rough surfaces of chiral superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the effect of diffuse surface scattering on the edge modes in two-dimensional chiral superconductors with time-reversal symmetry-breaking Cooper pairs, each carrying angular momentum $m \hbar$ ($m = 1,2,3, \cdots$). To elucidate the diffuse scattering effect, we formulate the inverse lifetime $\Gamma = \hbar/\tau$ corresponding to the broadening of the surface density of states (SDOS) for the edge mode. This derivation uses random S-matrix theory, which allows us to describe the surface effect in a unified way from the specular to the diffuse limit within the quasiclassical theory framework of superconductivity. We find that $\Gamma$ in the chiral states with $m \geq 2$ is larger than that in the chiral $p$-wave state ($m = 1$) because of the multiple edge mode branches in former superconducting states (the number of which equals $m$). Diffuse scattering between the different branches causes a significant broadening of SDOS. In contrast, the edge mode in the chiral $p$-wave state is robust to diffuse scattering because only a single edge mode branch exists. We also discuss SDOS at the diffuse limit, where the description in terms of $\Gamma$ is not useful. The diffuse scattering effect on SDOS can be understood qualitatively in terms of destructive interference analogous to that caused by impurity scattering in unconventional superconductors.</description>

      <title>Effect of low-temperature compression on superconductivity and crystal structure in strontium metal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The superconducting and structural properties of elemental strontium metal were investigated under pressures up to 60 GPa while maintaining cryogenic conditions during pressure application. Applying pressure at low temperatures reveals differences in superconducting and structural phases compared to previous reports obtained at room temperatures. Notably, the superconducting critical temperature exhibits a twofold increase under compression after cryogenic cooling within the pressure range of 35-42 GPa, compared to cryogenic cooling after room-temperature compression. Subsequently, the transition width becomes significantly sharper above 42 GPa. Low-temperature X-ray diffraction measurements under pressure reveal that this change corresponds to the Sr-III to Sr-IV transition, with no evidence of any metastable structure. Furthermore, the monoclinic Sr-IV structure was observed to remain stable to much higher pressures - at least up to 60 GPa, without the appearance of the incommensurate Sr-V phase present at room temperature. This implies that thermal activation energy plays an important role in overcoming the presence of a kinetic barrier to the Sr-V phase at room temperature.</description>

      <title>Emergent superconductivity and pair density wave at antiphase boundaries of charge density wave order in kagome metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Central to the layered kagome lattice superconductors AV3Sb5 (A = K, Cs, Rb) is a cascade of novel quantum states triggered by an unconventional charge density wave (CDW) order. The three-dimensional (3D) order involves a 2x2x2 phase coherent stacking of 2x2 charge density modulations in the kagome plane at low temperatures, exhibiting a CDW energy gap and evidence for time-reversal symmetry breaking. Here we report the discovery of emergent superconductivity and primary pair density wave (PDW) at the antiphase boundaries and stacking faults of bulk CDW order. We find that the {\pi}-phase shift dislocations can naturally appear on the surface as the Cs atoms form 2x2 superstructures that are out of phase with the bulk CDW. An incipient narrow band of surface states inside bulk CDW gap emerge close to the Fermi level where a particle-hole symmetric energy gap develops. We demonstrate that the energy gap originates from a novel quasi-2D kagome superconducting state (Tc ~ 5.4 K) intertwined with bulk CDW order, exhibiting an unprecedented vortex core spectrum and spatial modulations of the superconducting gap consistent with a 4x4 PDW. Intriguingly, the 2D kagome superconductivity is shown to be tunable on and off by atomically manipulating the Cs atoms on the surface. Our findings provide fresh new insights for understanding the interplay between the unconventional CDW and superconductivity in kagome metals and a pathway for atomic manipulation and topological defects engineering of quantum many-body states in correlated materials.</description>

      <title>Time-reversal symmetry-breaking phenomena in transport study of kagome superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies have found that all three materials within the vanadium-based kagome superconductors ($\textit{A}$V$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$, $\textit{A}$ = K, Cs, Rb) exhibit time-reversal symmetry-breaking behaviors in the superconducting states. Among the three, the Josephson junctions structured Nb/K$_{1-x}$V$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$/Nb and RbV$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$ show magnetic hysteresis below the superconducting transition temperature. CsV$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$ exhibits a zero-field superconducting diode effect, meaning the magnitude of the positive and negative superconducting critical currents are different. We first discuss the similarities and differences among the three above-mentioned experiments. Then, we discuss the possible mechanisms responsible for the unconventional superconducting transport phenomena: such as a chiral superconducting order parameter, and chiral pair density waves arising from the intertwining of the chiral charge order with superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Observation of vortex stripes in UTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum vortices are fundamentally important for properties of superconductors. In conventional type-II superconductor they determine the magnetic response of the system and tend to form regular lattices. UTe$_2$ is a recently discovered heavy fermion superconductor exhibiting many anomalous macroscopic behaviors. However, the question whether it has a multicomponent order parameter remains open. Here, we study magnetic properties of UTe$_2$ by employing scanning superconducting quantum interference device microscopy. We find vortex behavior which is very different from that in ordinary superconductors. We imaged vortices generated by cooling in magnetic field applied along different crystalline directions. While a small out-of-plane magnetic field produces typical isolated vortices, higher field generates vortex stripe patterns which evolve with vortex density. The stripes form at different locations and along different directions in the surface plane when the vortices are crystalized along the crystalline b or c axes. The behavior is reproduced by our simulation based on an anisotropic two-component order parameter. This study shows that UTe$_2$ has a nontrivial disparity of multiple length scales, placing constraints on multicomponent superconductivity. The tendency of vortex stripe formation and their control by external field may be useful in fluxonics applications.</description>

      <title>Possible Superconducting Phase in Janus Transition Metal Dichalcogenide TiSeS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD) have attracted a lot of attention because they can host a number of novel phases, including charge density wave and topological superconductivity. This class of compounds is significant from application and fundamental standpoints. Here we report on the synthesis and characterization of Janus TMD compound TiSeS, which is a subclass of TMDs. We observe characters of filamentary superconductivity in TiSeS, which was not reported in earlier studies. Magnetization measurements (ZFCW&amp; FCW) as well as isothermal magnetization indicates towards type-II superconductivity whereas transport measurements lacks of zero resistivity due to possible weak inter-grain connectivity. The observed behavior can be safely attributed to filamentary superconductivity in TiSeS. Further studies need to be carried out to determine the origin of this superconducting phase.</description>

      <title>Order by projection in single-band Hubbard model: a DMRG study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a Fermi system near or at half-filling, a specific superconducting pairing channel, if not explicitly included in the Hamiltonian, can be boosted by suppressing a competing pairing channel; this is exemplified by the enhancement of extended $s$-wave correlations upon suppressing $s$-wave Cooper pairing. This phenomenon, originally found by the use of generalized uncertainty relations is referred to as \emph{order by projection}. The case of zero on-site Coulomb interaction in the thermodynamic limit, confirms this mechanism through the analytical solution. In this study, we go further and systematically investigate this mechanism for a strongly correlated fermionic Hubbard model, now with finite on-site interaction, on a square lattice with an extended set of hopping parameters. We explore the behaviors of different pairing channels when one of them is suppressed, utilizing density matrix renormalization group calculations. Our findings provide numerical evidence supporting the existence of \emph{order by projection} in the strongly correlated system we studied. We also investigate the effect of the strength of Hubbard $U$, next-nearest neighbor $t'$, hole-doping, as well as finite-size scaling approaching the thermodynamic limit.</description>

      <title>Doping Dependence of Spin-Momentum Locking in Bismuth-Based High-Temperature Cuprate Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-zero spin orbit coupling has been reported in several unconventional superconductors due to the absence of inversion symmetry breaking. This contrasts with cuprate superconductors, where such interaction has been neglected for a long time. The recent report of a non-trivial spin orbit coupling in overdoped Bi2212 cuprate superconductor, has re-opened an old debate on both the source and role of such interaction and its evolution throughout the superconducting dome. Using high-resolution spin- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we reveal a momentum-dependent spin texture throughout the hole-doped side of the superconducting phase diagram for single- and double-layer bismuth-based cuprates. The universality of the reported effect among different dopings and the disappearance of spin polarization upon lead substitution, suggest a common source. We argue that local structural fluctuations of the CuO planes and the resulting charge imbalance may cause local inversion symmetry breaking and spin polarization, which might be crucial for understanding cuprates physics.</description>

      <title>Period-doubling in the phase dynamics of a shunted HgTe quantum well Josephson junction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fractional AC Josephson effect is a discerning property of topological superconductivity in hybrid Josephson junctions. Recent experimental observations of missing odd Shapiro steps and half Josephson frequency emission in various materials have sparked significant debate regarding their potential origin in the effect. In this study, we present microwave emission measurements on a resistively shunted Josephson junction based on a HgTe quantum well. We demonstrate that, with significant spurious inductance in the shunt wiring, the experiment operates in a nonlinear dynamic regime characterized by period-doubling. This leads to additional microwave emission peaks at half of the Josephson frequency, $f_J/2$, which can mimic the $4\pi$-periodicity of topological Andreev states. The observed current-voltage characteristics and emission spectra are well-described by a simple RCLSJ model. Furthermore, we show that the nonlinear dynamics of the junction can be controlled using gate voltage, magnetic field, and temperature, with our model accurately reproducing these effects without incorporating any topological attributes. Our observations urge caution in interpreting emission at $f_J/2$ as evidence for gapless Andreev bound states in topological junctions and suggest the appropriate parameter range for future experiments.</description>

      <title>$^{19}$F NMR and defect spins in vacuum-annealed LaO$_{0.5}$F$_{0.5}$BiS$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report results of magnetization and $^{19}$F NMR measurements in the normal state of as-grown LaO$_{0.5}$F$_{0.5}$BiS$_2$. The magnetization is dominated by a temperature-independent diamagnetic component and a field- and temperature-dependent paramagnetic contribution $M_\mu(H,T)$ from a $\sim$1000~ppm concentration of local moments, an order of magnitude higher than can be accounted for by measured rare-earth impurity concentrations. $M_\mu(H,T)$ can be fit by the Brillouin function $B_J(x)$ or, perhaps more realistically, a two-level $\tanh(x)$ model for magnetic Bi $6p$ ions in defect crystal fields. Both fits require a phenomenological Curie-Weiss argument $x = \mu_\mathrm{eff}H/(T + T_W)$, $T_W \approx 1.7$ K. There is no evidence for magnetic order down to 2 K, and the origin of $T_W$ is not clear. $^{19}$F frequency shifts, linewidths, and spin-lattice relaxation rates are consistent with purely dipolar $^{19}$F/defect-spin interactions. The defect-spin correlation time $\tau_c(T)$ obtained from $^{19}$F spin-lattice relaxation rates obeys the Korringa relation $\tau_cT = \text{const.}$, indicating the relaxation is dominated by conduction-band fluctuations.</description>

Abstract: We present a theoretical prediction of a phonon-mediated two-gap superconductivity in infinite-layer nickelates Nd$_{0.8}$Sr$_{0.2}$NiO$_2$ by performing $\textit{ab initio}$ $GW$ and $GW$ perturbation theory calculations. Electron $GW$ self-energy effects significantly alter the characters of the two-band Fermi surface and enhance the electron-phonon coupling, compared with results based on density functional theory. Solutions of the fully $\textbf{k}$-dependent anisotropic Eliashberg equations yield two dominant $s$-wave superconducting gaps - a large gap on a band of rare-earth Nd $d$ and interstitial orbital characters and a small gap on a band of transition-metal Ni $d$ character. Increasing hole doping induces a non-rigid-band response in the electronic structure, leading to a rapid drop of the superconducting $T_c$ in the overdoped regime in agreement with experiments.</description>

      <title>$d$-wave Charge-$4e$ Superconductivity From Fluctuating Pair Density Waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.17631v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a theory for charge-$4e$ superconductivity as a leading low-temperature instability with a nontrivial $d$-wave symmetry. We show that in several microscopic models for the pair-density-wave (PDW) state, when the PDW wave vectors connect special parts of the Fermi surface, the predominant interaction is in the bosonic pairing channel mediated by exchanging low-energy fermions. This bosonic pairing interaction is repulsive in the $s$-wave channel but attractive in the $d$-wave one, leading to a $d$-wave charge-$4e$ superconductor. By analyzing the Ginzburg-Landau free energy including higher-order fluctuation effects of PDW, we find that the charge-$4e$ superconductivity emerges as a vestigial order of PDW, and sets in via a first-order transition. Both the gap amplitude and the transition temperature decay monotonically with increasing superfluid stiffness of the PDW order. Our work provides a microscopic mechanism of higher-charge condensates with unconventional ordering symmetry in strongly-correlated materials.</description>

      <title>Topological signatures of a p-wave superconducting wire through light</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14501v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show how the $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ topological index of a one-dimensional topological p-wave superconductor can be revealed when driving with a classical vector potential i.e. an electromagnetic wave, through the light-induced transition probabilities and the profile of the induced quasiparticles population. As a function of driving frequency $\omega$, it is possible to obtain a measure of this topological invariant from the resonance envelope classifying the two distinct topological phases of the short-range Kitaev wire. We propose to probe the topological phase transition in the model through the responses of the global capacitance in the presence of the light field and through the Josephson current between the wire and the proximity coupled bulk superconductor. The system may also be implemented on the Bloch sphere allowing alternative ways to measure the $\mathbb{Z}$ and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological invariants through circuit or cavity quantum electrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Strong enhancement of superconductivity via engineered dielectric environment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03288v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We recently showed that strong enhancement of superconductivity can occur in systems with a resonant anti-shielding effect wherein the nonlocal dielectric function of the environment vanishes. This effect is universal, since it relies on the fact that Cooper pairs, regardless of the pairing mechanism, are simply charges that can be affected by external charges / fields induced in an engineered dielectric environment. In our earlier work, we proposed a composite system containing a superconductor and a topological insulator that satisfies the stringent conditions for the anti-shielding. Here, we propose a superlattice system containing a metal-organic framework medium that also satisfies these conditions, but with the effect even stronger and more controllable. Our estimates show that ambient temperature and pressure operation could be achievable in this configuration with e.g. MgB2, or even with cuprate superconductors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1702.02578v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological superconductivity is a state of matter that can host Majorana modes, the building blocks of a topological quantum computer. Many experimental platforms predicted to show such a topological state rely on proximity-induced superconductivity. However, accessing the topological properties requires an induced hard superconducting gap, which is challenging to achieve for most material systems. We have systematically studied how the interface between an InSb semiconductor nanowire and a NbTiN superconductor affects the induced superconducting properties. Step by step, we improve the homogeneity of the interface while ensuring a barrier-free electrical contact to the superconductor, and obtain a hard gap in the InSb nanowire. The magnetic field stability of NbTiN allows the InSb nanowire to maintain a hard gap and a supercurrent in the presence of magnetic fields (~ 0.5 Tesla), a requirement for topological superconductivity in one-dimensional systems. Our study provides a guideline to induce superconductivity in various experimental platforms such as semiconductor nanowires, two dimensional electron gases and topological insulators, and holds relevance for topological superconductivity and quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Majorana modes in striped two-dimensional inhomogeneous topological superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08439v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Majorana zero modes have gained significant interest due to their potential applications in topological quantum computing and in the realization of exotic quantum phases. These zero-energy quasiparticle excitations localize at the vortex cores of two-dimensional topological superconductors or at the ends of one-dimensional topological superconductors. Here we describe an alternative platform: a two-dimensional topological superconductor with inhomogeneous superconductivity, where Majorana modes localize at the ends of topologically nontrivial one-dimensional stripes induced by the spatial variations of the order parameter phase. In certain regimes, these Majorana modes hybridize into a single highly nonlocal state delocalized over spatially separated points, with exactly zero energy at finite system sizes and with emergent quantum-mechanical supersymmetry. We then present detailed descriptions of braiding and fusion protocols and showcase the versatility of our proposal by suggesting possible setups that can potentially lead to the realization of Yang-Lee anyons and the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07633v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe the mean-field model of a one-dimensional topological superconductor with two orbitals per unit cell. Time-reversal symmetry is absent, but a nonsymmorphic symmetry, involving a translation by a fraction of the unit cell, mimics the role of time-reversal symmetry. As a result, the topological superconductor has $\mathbb{Z}_4$ topological phases, two which support Majorana bound states and two which do not, in agreement with a prediction based on K-theory classification [K. Shiozaki et al., Phys. Rev. B 93, 195413 (2016)]. As with the Kitaev chain, the presence of Majorana bound states gives rise to the $4\pi$-periodic Josephson effect. A random matrix with nonsymmorphic time-reversal symmetry may be block diagonalized, and every individual block has time-reversal symmetry described by one of the Gaussian orthogonal, unitary or symplectic ensembles. We show how this is manifested in the energy level statistics of a random system in the $\mathbb{Z}_4$ class as the spatial period of the nonsymmorphic symmetry is varied from much less than to of the order of the system size.</description>
