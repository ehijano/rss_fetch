      <title>Tropical temperature distributions over a wide range of climates: theory and idealized simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding future changes in temperature variability and extremes is an important scientific challenge with societal impacts. Here the responses of daily near-surface temperature distributions to climate warming is explored using an idealized GCM. Simulations of a wide range of climate states are performed using both a slab-ocean aquaplanet configuration and a simple continental configuration with a bucket-style model for land hydrology. In the tropics, the responses of extreme temperatures to climate change contrast strongly over land and ocean. Over land, warming is amplified for hot days relative to the average summer day. But over ocean, warming is suppressed for hot days, implying a narrowing of the temperature distribution. Previous studies have developed theories based on convective coupling to interpret changes in extreme temperatures over land. Building on that work, the contrasting temperature distribution responses over land and ocean are investigated using a novel theoretical framework based on local convective coupling. The theory highlights five physical mechanisms with the potential to drive differential warming across temperature percentiles: free-tropospheric temperature change, relative humidity change, convective available potential energy (CAPE) change, the hot-get-hotter mechanism, and the drier-get-hotter mechanism. Hot days are relatively dry over land due to limited moisture availability, which drives the drier-get-hotter mechanism and amplified warming of the warm tail of the distribution. This mechanism is the primary factor explaining the contrasting responses of hot days over land and ocean to climate change. But other mechanisms also contribute to changing the temperature distribution, with changes in free-tropospheric temperature and surface relative humidity having large influences (which partially cancel).</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic and Elliptic Points Tracking Algorithm (HEPTA) in two-dimensional non-stationary velocity fields defined on a discrete grid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents a new algorithm, the Hyperbolic and Elliptic Points Tracking Algorithm (HEPTA), designed for automated tracking of elliptic and hyperbolic stationary points in two-dimensional non-stationary velocity fields defined on a discrete grid. HEPTA analyzes the stability, bifurcations, and Lagrangian dynamics of stationary points. By leveraging bilinear interpolation, Jacobian matrix analysis, and trajectory tracking, the algorithm accurately identifies the locations of vortex centers (elliptic points) and strain zones (hyperbolic points). A methodology has been developed to address bifurcation events and transitions across grid cell boundaries that occur during the evolution of stationary points in a discrete velocity field. The algorithm was tested on AVISO satellite altimetry data in the Kuroshio Current region, which is characterized by intense eddy formation. These data represent a two-dimensional discrete velocity field with a daily time step. The results show that HEPTA accurately identifies and tracks both cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies, even under conditions of rapid eddy drift and complex hydrodynamic conditions. This study provides a reliable and efficient tool for analyzing the dynamics of mesoscale formations, which may be useful in oceanographic research, climate modeling, and operational oceanography.</description>

      <title>Stability analyses of divergence and vorticity damping on gnomonic cubed-sphere grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Divergence and vorticity damping are explicit diffusion mechanisms used in dynamical cores to ensure numerical stability. There is a mesh-dependent upper bound on the corresponding diffusion coefficient, else the diffusion itself becomes a source of instability. This work considers such stability limits for three gnomonic cubed-sphere meshes -- 1) equidistant, 2) equiangular, and 3) equi-edge mappings. Von Neumann analysis is used to derive linear stability limits, which show that the stability of divergence and vorticity damping depends on the cell areas and aspect ratios of the cubed-sphere grid. The linear theory is compared to practical divergence and vorticity damping limits in the CAM-FV3 dynamical core, using a baroclinic wave test case on the equiangular and equi-edge grids. For divergence damping, both the magnitude of maximum stable coefficients and the locations of instability agree with linear theory. Due to implicit vorticity diffusion from the transport scheme, practical limits for vorticity damping are lower than the explicit stability limits. The maximum allowable vorticity damping coefficient varies with the choice of horizontal transport scheme for the equi-edge grid; it is hypothesised that this indicates the relative implicit diffusion of the transport scheme in this test.</description>

      <title>GECAM Discovery of Peculiar Oscillating Particle Precipitation Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Charged particle precipitation typically manifests as a gradual increase and decrease of flux observed by space detectors. Cases with rapidly flux variation are very rare. Periodic events are even more extraordinary. These oscillating particle precipitation (OPP) events are usually attributed to the bounce motion of electrons, which are induced by lightning. Owing to the observation limitations, there has been debate regarding whether these oscillations originate from temporal flux evolution or spatial structure evolution. Here we report three peculiar charged particle precipitation events detected by GECAM during a geomagnetic storm on March 21, 2024, with two exhibiting significant periodicity. These events were observed around the same region during three consecutive orbits. Through comprehensive temporal and spectral analyses, we revealed that one of the OPP events exhibited a transition in spectral lag of mini-pulses, shifting from "softer-earlier" to "softer-later" while showing no significant time evolution in overall frequency characteristics. And there is no association found between these two OPP events and lightning activity. Several possible scenarios are discussed to explain these charged particles with a life time of more than 3.5 hours, but the nature of these three events remains an enigma. We suggest that these GECAM-detected OPP events may represent a new type of particle precipitation event or a peculiar Lightning-induced Electron Precipitations (LEPs).</description>
