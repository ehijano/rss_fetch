      <title>Fair Distribution of Digital Payments: Balancing Transaction Flows for Regulatory Compliance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concentration of digital payment transactions in just two UPI apps like PhonePe and Google Pay has raised concerns of duopoly in India s digital financial ecosystem. To address this, the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has mandated that no single UPI app should exceed 30 percent of total transaction volume. Enforcing this cap, however, poses a significant computational challenge: how to redistribute user transactions across apps without causing widespread user inconvenience while maintaining capacity limits? In this paper, we formalize this problem as the Minimum Edge Activation Flow (MEAF) problem on a bipartite network of users and apps, where activating an edge corresponds to a new app installation. The objective is to ensure a feasible flow respecting app capacities while minimizing additional activations. We further prove that Minimum Edge Activation Flow is NP-Complete. To address the computational challenge, we propose scalable heuristics, named Decoupled Two-Stage Allocation Strategy (DTAS), that exploit flow structure and capacity reuse. Experiments on large semi-synthetic transaction network data show that DTAS finds solutions close to the optimal ILP within seconds, offering a fast and practical way to enforce transaction caps fairly and efficiently.</description>

      <title>A Deep-SIC Channel Estimator Scheme in NOMA Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 5G and next-generation mobile ad-hoc networks, reliable handover is a key requirement, which guarantees continuity in connectivity, especially for mobile users and in high-density scenarios. However, conventional handover triggers based on instantaneous channel measurements are prone to failures and the ping-pong effect due to outdated or inaccurate channel state information. To address this, we introduce Deep-SIC, a knowledge-based channel prediction model that employs a Transformer-based approach to predict channel quality and optimise handover decisions. Deep-SIC is a unique model that utilises Partially Decoded Data (PDD), a byproduct of successive interference cancellation (SIC) in NOMA, as a feedback signal to improve its predictions continually. This special purpose enables learners to learn quickly and stabilise their learning. Our model learns 68\% faster than existing state-of-the-art algorithms, such as Graph-NOMA, while offering verifiable guarantees of stability and resilience to user mobility (Theorem~2). When simulated at the system level, it can be shown that our strategy can substantially enhance network performance: the handover failure rate can be reduced by up to 40\%, and the ping-pong effect can be mitigated, especially at vehicular speeds (e.g., 60 km/h). Moreover, Deep-SIC has a 20\% smaller normalised root mean square error (NRMSE) in low-SNR situations than state-of-the-art algorithms with linear computational complexity, $O(K)$. This work has introduced a new paradigm for robust and predictive mobility management in dynamic wireless networks.</description>

      <title>A Secure Edge Gateway Architecture for Wi-Fi-Enabled IoT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a Secure Edge Gateway Architecture for Wi-Fi-Enabled IoT designed to strengthen local network protection without altering existing infrastructure. The proposed gateway acts as an intermediate control point between Wi-Fi access points and the core network, monitoring traffic, isolating untrusted devices, and preventing common wireless attacks such as spoofing, deauthentication, and unauthorized access. The design focuses on adaptive traffic filtering and lightweight policy enforcement instead of complex analytical models, making it suitable for medium-sized network environments. The prototype gateway was deployed in a real office with around 70 total devices, including 28 IoT units such as sensors, cameras, and smart controllers. Over ten days of continuous operation, the system reduced successful spoofing incidents by 87% and improved recovery time after deauthentication by 42%, while increasing network latency by only 3.1% and reducing throughput by less than 4% compared to a baseline WPA3 configuration. These results confirm that implementing security functions at the edge layer can significantly improve the resilience of Wi-Fi-enabled IoT environments without introducing noticeable overhead or requiring specialized hardware.</description>

      <title>How to Discover Knowledge for FutureG: Contextual RAG and LLM Prompting for O-RAN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a retrieval-augmented question answering framework for 5G/6G networks, where the Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) has become central to disaggregated, virtualized, and AI-driven wireless systems. While O-RAN enables multi-vendor interoperability and cloud-native deployments, its fast-changing specifications and interfaces pose major challenges for researchers and practitioners. Manual navigation of these complex documents is labor-intensive and error-prone, slowing system design, integration, and deployment. To address this challenge, we adopt Contextual Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Contextual RAG), a strategy in which candidate answer choices guide document retrieval and chunk-specific context to improve large language model (LLM) performance. This improvement over traditional RAG achieves more targeted and context-aware retrieval, which improves the relevance of documents passed to the LLM, particularly when the query alone lacks sufficient context for accurate grounding. Our framework is designed for dynamic domains where data evolves rapidly and models must be continuously updated or redeployed, all without requiring LLM fine-tuning. We evaluate this framework using the ORANBenchmark-13K dataset, and compare three LLMs, namely, Llama3.2, Qwen2.5-7B, and Qwen3.0-4B, across both Direct Question Answering (Direct Q&amp;A) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting strategies. We show that Contextual RAG consistently improves accuracy over standard RAG and base prompting, while maintaining competitive runtime and CO2 emissions. These results highlight the potential of Contextual RAG to serve as a scalable and effective solution for domain-specific Q&amp;A in ORAN and broader 5G/6G environments, enabling more accurate interpretation of evolving standards while preserving efficiency and sustainability.</description>

      <title>Base Station Deployment under EMF constrain by Deep Reinforcement learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As 5G networks rapidly expand and 6G technologies emerge, characterized by dense deployments, millimeter-wave communications, and dynamic beamforming, the need for scalable simulation tools becomes increasingly critical. These tools must support efficient evaluation of key performance metrics such as coverage and radio-frequency electromagnetic field (RF-EMF) exposure, inform network design decisions, and ensure compliance with safety regulations. Moreover, base station (BS) placement is a crucial task in the network design, where satisfying coverage requirements is essential. To address these, based on our previous work, we first propose a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) that predicts location specific received signal strength (RSS), and EMF exposure simultaneously from the network topology, as images. As a network designing application, we propose a Deep Q Network (DQN) framework, using the trained cGAN, for optimal base station (BS) deployment in the network. Compared to conventional ray tracing simulations, the proposed cGAN reduces inference and deployment time from several hours to seconds. Unlike a standalone cGAN, which provides static performance maps, the proposed GAN-DQN framework enables sequential decision making under coverage and exposure constraints, learning effective deployment strategies that directly solve the BS placement problem. Thus making it well suited for real time design and adaptation in dynamic scenarios in order to satisfy pre defined network specific heterogeneous performance goals.</description>

      <title>Regional Resource Management for Service Provisioning in LEO Satellite Networks: A Topology Feature-Based DRL Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Satellite networks with wide coverage are considered natural extensions to terrestrial networks for their long-distance end-to-end (E2E) service provisioning. However, the inherent topology dynamics of low earth orbit satellite networks and the uncertain network scales bring an inevitable requirement that resource chains for E2E service provisioning must be efficiently re-planned. Therefore, achieving highly adaptive resource management is of great significance in practical deployment applications. This paper first designs a regional resource management (RRM) mode and further formulates the RRM problem that can provide a unified decision space independent of the network scale. Subsequently, leveraging the RRM mode and deep reinforcement learning framework, we develop a topology feature-based dynamic and adaptive resource management algorithm to combat the varying network scales. The proposed algorithm successfully takes into account the fixed output dimension of the neural network and the changing resource chains for E2E service provisioning. The matched design of the service orientation information and phased reward function effectively improves the service performance of the algorithm under the RRM mode. The numerical results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm with the best convergence performance and fastest convergence rate significantly improves service performance for varying network scales, with gains over compared algorithms of more than 2.7%, 11.9%, and 10.2%, respectively.</description>

      <title>Generative AI for Networking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) and Large Language Models (LLMs) are revolutionizing network management systems, paving the way towards fully autonomous and self-optimizing communication systems. These models enable networks to address complex decision-making tasks across both short-term operational scenarios and long-term strategic planning. Through natural language understanding, LLMs can analyze customer inquiries, predict network congestion patterns, and automate troubleshooting processes, leading to more efficient customer support and network maintenance. GenAI can optimize content delivery by generating personalized recommendations, improving user engagement, and dynamically adjusting network resources based on real-time demands, ultimately enhancing overall performance and user experience in telecommunication services. In this paper, we discuss the pivotal role of GenAI in advancing network performance and achieving the ultimate objective of self-adaptive networks. Moreover, we present a use case that leverages the self-attention mechanism of transformers to perform long-term traffic prediction. Harnessing these cutting-edge technologies demonstrates the transformative power of LLM and GenAI in revolutionizing telecommunication networks, elevating resilience and adaptability to unprecedented levels.</description>

      <title>SLASh: Simulation of LISLs Aboard LEO Satellite Shells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in satellite technology have introduced a new frontier of wireless networking by establishing Low Earth Orbit (LEO) Satellite networks that work to connect difficult to reach areas and improve global connectivity. These novel advancements lack robust open-source simulation models that can highlight potential bottlenecks or potential wasted resources, wasting terrestrial users and the companies that provide these networks time and money. To that end, we propose SLASh, a highly-customizable satellite network simulation which allows users to design a simulated network with specific characteristics, and constructs them analog to real-world conditions. Additionally, SLASh can generate abstract telemetry that can be simulated moving throughout the network, allowing users to compare network capabilities across a variety of frameworks.</description>

      <title>AI-Native Integrated Sensing and Communications for Self-Organizing Wireless Networks: Architectures, Learning Paradigms, and System-Level Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC) is emerging as a foundational paradigm for next-generation wireless networks, enabling communication infrastructures to simultaneously support data transmission and environment sensing. By tightly coupling radio sensing with communication functions, ISAC unlocks new capabilities for situational awareness, localization, tracking, and network adaptation. At the same time, the increasing scale, heterogeneity, and dynamics of future wireless systems demand self-organizing network intelligence capable of autonomously managing resources, topology, and services. Artificial intelligence (AI), particularly learning-driven and data-centric methods, has become a key enabler for realizing this vision. This survey provides a comprehensive and system-level review of AI-native ISAC-enabled self-organizing wireless networks. We develop a unified taxonomy that spans: (i) ISAC signal models and sensing modalities, (ii) network state abstraction and perception from sensing-aware radio data, (iii) learning-driven self-organization mechanisms for resource allocation, topology control, and mobility management, and (iv) cross-layer architectures integrating sensing, communication, and network intelligence. We further examine emerging learning paradigms, including deep reinforcement learning, graph-based learning, multi-agent coordination, and federated intelligence that enable autonomous adaptation under uncertainty, mobility, and partial observability. Practical considerations such as sensing-communication trade-offs, scalability, latency, reliability, and security are discussed alongside representative evaluation methodologies and performance metrics. Finally, we identify key open challenges and future research directions toward deployable, trustworthy, and scalable AI-native ISAC systems for 6G and beyond.</description>

      <title>Auction-Driven Spectrum Allocation With AutoEncoder-Based Compression in Rural Wireless Networks: A Novel Framework for Reliable Telemedicine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rural healthcare faces numerous challenges, including limited access to specialized medical services and diagnostic equipment, which delays patient care. Enhancing the ability to transmit medical images and data from rural areas to urban hospitals via wireless networks is critical. However, bandwidth limitations, unreliable networks, and concerns over data security and privacy hinder efficient transmission. Additionally, the high data volume of medical content and the limited battery life of IoT devices pose further challenges. To address these challenges, data compression techniques such as Autoencoders (AEs) offer promising solutions by significantly reducing the communication overhead without sacrificing essential image quality or details. Additionally, spectrum allocation mechanisms in rural areas are often inefficient, leading to poor resource utilization. Auction theory presents a dynamic and adaptive approach to optimize spectrum allocation. This paper proposes a novel hybrid framework that integrates AE-based data compression with auction-based spectrum allocation, addressing both communication efficiency and spectrum utilization in rural wireless networks. Extensive simulations validate the framework's ability to improve spectrum utilization, transmission efficiency, and overall connectivity, offering a practical solution for enhancing rural telemedicine infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Optimal Oblivious Load-Balancing for Sparse Traffic in Large-Scale Satellite Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Oblivious load-balancing in networks involves routing traffic from sources to destinations using predetermined routes independent of the traffic, so that the maximum load on any link in the network is minimized. We investigate oblivious load-balancing schemes for a $N\times N$ torus network under sparse traffic where there are at most $k$ active source-destination pairs. We are motivated by the problem of load-balancing in large-scale LEO satellite networks, which can be modelled as a torus, where the traffic is known to be sparse and localized to certain hotspot areas. We formulate the problem as a linear program and show that no oblivious routing scheme can achieve a worst-case load lower than approximately $\frac{\sqrt{2k}}{4}$ when $1&lt;k \leq N^2/2$ and $\frac{N}{4}$ when $N^2/2\leq k\leq N^2$. Moreover, we demonstrate that the celebrated Valiant Load Balancing scheme is suboptimal under sparse traffic and construct an optimal oblivious load-balancing scheme that achieves the lower bound. Further, we discover a $\sqrt{2}$ multiplicative gap between the worst-case load of a non-oblivious routing and the worst-case load of any oblivious routing. The results can also be extended to general $N\times M$ tori with unequal link capacities along the vertical and horizontal directions.</description>

      <title>Which Deep Learner? A Systematic Evaluation of Advanced Deep Forecasting Models Accuracy and Efficiency for Network Traffic Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Network traffic prediction is essential for automating modern network management. It is a difficult time series forecasting (TSF) problem that has been addressed by Deep Learning (DL) models due to their ability to capture complex patterns. Advances in forecasting, from sophisticated transformer architectures to simple linear models, have improved performance across diverse prediction tasks. However, given the variability of network traffic across network environments and traffic series timescales, it is essential to identify effective deployment choices and modeling directions for network traffic prediction. This study systematically identify and evaluates twelve advanced TSF models -including transformer-based and traditional DL approaches, each with unique advantages for network traffic prediction- against three statistical baselines on four real traffic datasets, across multiple time scales and horizons, assessing performance, robustness to anomalies, data gaps, external factors, data efficiency, and resource efficiency in terms of time, memory, and energy. Results highlight performance regimes, efficiency thresholds, and promising architectures that balance accuracy and efficiency, demonstrating robustness to traffic challenges and suggesting new directions beyond traditional RNNs.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Time Slot Leasing in TDMA-Based IoT Networks for Enhanced Channel Utilization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In large-scale resource-constrained wireless networks, such as those prevalent in the Internet of Things (IoT), efficient communication scheduling remains a critical challenge. Among the various approaches, Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) protocols have been widely adopted for their structured and collision-free communication capabilities. Nevertheless, despite extensive research in this area, current solutions often exhibit suboptimal performance, particularly in dynamic environments where node activity levels fluctuate over time.
  This paper introduces a novel fully distributed TDMA-based scheduling protocol that intelligently maximizes the utilization of communication resources. The proposed approach adaptively reallocates underutilized time slots, originally assigned to temporarily inactive nodes, to those experiencing higher communication demands. This dynamic reallocation not only improves channel utilization but also reduces idle periods, thereby enhancing overall network efficiency. To further enhance performance, we incorporate a lightweight probabilistic mechanism that governs the temporal leasing of unused slots. This mechanism balances the trade-off between slot availability and transmission reliability, minimizing packet loss while preserving fairness and stability within the network.
  Simulations across a range of network scenarios demonstrate that our protocol significantly improves throughput, latency, and reliability in resource-constrained environments. These results highlight the protocol's potential as a robust and scalable solution for adaptive and energy-efficient scheduling in next-generation IoT networks.</description>

      <title>Eco-WakeLoc: An Energy-Neutral and Cooperative UWB Real-Time Locating System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Indoor localization systems face a fundamental trade-off between efficiency and responsiveness, which is especially important for emerging use cases such as mobile robots operating in GPS-denied environments. Traditional RTLS either require continuously powered infrastructure, limiting their scalability, or are limited by their responsiveness. This work presents Eco-WakeLoc, designed to achieve centimeter-level UWB localization while remaining energy-neutral by combining ultra-low power wake-up radios (WuRs) with solar energy harvesting. By activating anchor nodes only on demand, the proposed system eliminates constant energy consumption while achieving centimeter-level positioning accuracy. To reduce coordination overhead and improve scalability, Eco-WakeLoc employs cooperative localization where active tags initiate ranging exchanges (trilateration), while passive tags opportunistically reuse these messages for TDOA positioning. An additive-increase/multiplicative-decrease (AIMD)-based energy-aware scheduler adapts localization rates according to the harvested energy, thereby maximizing the overall performance of the sensor network while ensuring long-term energy neutrality. The measured energy consumption is only 3.22mJ per localization for active tags, 951uJ for passive tags, and 353uJ for anchors. Real-world deployment on a quadruped robot with nine anchors confirms the practical feasibility, achieving an average accuracy of 43cm in dynamic indoor environments. Year-long simulations show that tags achieve an average of 2031 localizations per day, retaining over 7% battery capacity after one year -- demonstrating that the RTLS achieves sustained energy-neutral operation. Eco-WakeLoc demonstrates that high-accuracy indoor localization can be achieved at scale without continuous infrastructure operation, combining energy neutrality, cooperative positioning, and adaptive scheduling.</description>

      <title>Multi-Modal Data-Enhanced Foundation Models for Prediction and Control in Wireless Networks: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) are recognized as a transformative breakthrough that has started to reshape the future of artificial intelligence (AI) across both academia and industry. The integration of FMs into wireless networks is expected to enable the development of general-purpose AI agents capable of handling diverse network management requests and highly complex wireless-related tasks involving multi-modal data. Inspired by these ideas, this work discusses the utilization of FMs, especially multi-modal FMs in wireless networks. We focus on two important types of tasks in wireless network management: prediction tasks and control tasks. In particular, we first discuss FMs-enabled multi-modal contextual information understanding in wireless networks. Then, we explain how FMs can be applied to prediction and control tasks, respectively. Following this, we introduce the development of wireless-specific FMs from two perspectives: available datasets for development and the methodologies used. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of the challenges and future directions for FM-enhanced wireless networks.</description>

      <title>TaNG: Modeling Packet Classification with TSS-assisted Neural Networks on GPUs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Packet classification is a core function in software-defined networks, and learning-based methods have recently shown significant throughput gains on large-scale rulesets. However, existing learning-based approaches struggle with overlapping rules, leading to incomplete model coverage or excessive rule replication. Their limited GPU integration also hampers performance with large-scale rulesets. To address these issues, we propose TaNG, which utilizes a single neural network trained on multi-dimensional features to ensure complete coverage without duplicating rules. TaNG employs a semi-structured design that combines the neural network model with a tuple space, reducing model complexity. Furthermore, we develop a mechanism based on the semi-structure for rule updates. Finally, we implement a CPU-GPU hybrid streaming framework tailored for learning-based methods, further enhancing throughput. On our GPU-based classification framework with 512k rulesets, TaNG achieves 12.19x and 9.37x higher throughput and 98.84x and 156.98x higher performance stability compared to two state-of-the-art learning methods NuevoMatch and NeuTree, respectively.</description>

      <title>oneTwin: Online Digital Network Twin via Neural Radio Radiance Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital network twin is a promising technology that replicates real-world networks in real-time and assists with the design, operation, and management of next-generation networks. However, existing approaches (e.g., simulator-based and neural-based) cannot effectively realize the digital network twin, in terms of fidelity, synchronicity, and tractability. In this paper, we propose oneTwin, the first online digital twin system, for the prediction of physical layer metrics. We architect the oneTwin system with two primary components: an enhanced simulator and a neural radio radiance field (NRRF). On the one hand, we achieve the enhanced simulator by designing a material tuning algorithm that incrementally optimizes the building materials to minimize the twin-to-real gap. On the other hand, we achieve the NRRF by designing a neural learning algorithm that continually updates its DNNs based on both online and simulated data from the enhanced simulator. We implement oneTwin system using Sionna RT as the simulator and developing new DNNs as the NRRF, under a public cellular network. Extensive experimental results show that, compared to state-of-the-art solutions, oneTwin achieves real-time updating (0.98s), with 36.39% and 57.50% reductions of twin-to-real gap under in-distribution and out-of-distribution test datasets, respectively.</description>

      <title>inRAN: Interpretable Online Bayesian Learning for Network Automation in Open Radio Access Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emerging AI/ML techniques have been showing great potential in automating network control in open radio access networks (Open RAN). However, existing approaches heavily rely on blackbox policies parameterized by deep neural networks, which inherently lack interpretability, explainability, and transparency, and create substantial obstacles in practical network deployment. In this paper, we propose inRAN, a novel interpretable online Bayesian learning framework for network automation in Open RAN. The core idea is to integrate interpretable surrogate models and safe optimization solvers to continually optimize control actions, while adapting to non-stationary dynamics in real-world networks. We achieve the inRAN framework with three key components: 1) an interpretable surrogate model via ensembling Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs); 2) safe optimization solvers via integrating genetic search and trust-region descent method; 3) an online dynamics tracker via continual model learning and adaptive threshold offset. We implement inRAN in an end-to-end O-RAN-compliant network testbed, and conduct extensive over-the-air experiments with the focused use case of network slicing. The results show that, inRAN substantially outperforms state-of-the-art works, by guaranteeing the chance-based constraint with a 92.67% assurance ratio with comparative resource usage throughout the online network control, under unforeseeable time-evolving network dynamics.</description>

      <title>Permission Manifests for Web Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rise of Large Language Model (LLM)-based web agents represents a significant shift in automated interactions with the web. Unlike traditional crawlers that follow simple conventions, such as robots.txt, modern agents engage with websites in sophisticated ways: navigating complex interfaces, extracting structured information, and completing end-to-end tasks. Existing governance mechanisms were not designed for these capabilities. Without a way to specify what interactions are and are not allowed, website owners increasingly rely on blanket blocking and CAPTCHAs, which undermine beneficial applications such as efficient automation, convenient use of e-commerce services, and accessibility tools. We introduce agent-permissions.json, a robots.txt-style lightweight manifest where websites specify allowed interactions, complemented by API references where available. This framework provides a low-friction coordination mechanism: website owners only need to write a simple JSON file, while agents can easily parse and automatically implement the manifest's provisions. Website owners can then focus on blocking non-compliant agents, rather than agents as a whole. By extending the spirit of robots.txt to the era of LLM-mediated interaction, and complementing data use initiatives such as AIPref, the manifest establishes a compliance framework that enables beneficial agent interactions while respecting site owners' preferences.</description>

      <title>On the Capacity Region of Individual Key Rates in Vector Linear Secure Aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide new insights into an open problem recently posed by Yuan-Sun [ISIT 2025], concerning the minimum individual key rate required in the vector linear secure aggregation problem. Consider a distributed system with $K$ users, where each user $k\in [K]$ holds a data stream $W_k$ and an individual key $Z_k$. A server aims to compute a linear function $\mathbf{F}[W_1;\ldots;W_K]$ without learning any information about another linear function $\mathbf{G}[W_1;\ldots;W_K]$, where $[W_1;\ldots;W_K]$ denotes the row stack of $W_1,\ldots,W_K$. The open problem is to determine the minimum required length of $Z_k$, denoted as $R_k$, $k\in [K]$. In this paper, we characterize a new achievable region for the rate tuple $(R_1,\ldots,R_K)$. The region is polyhedral, with vertices characterized by a binary rate assignment $(R_1,\ldots,R_K) = (\mathbf{1}(1 \in \mathcal{I}),\ldots,\mathbf{1}(K\in \mathcal{I}))$, where $\mathcal{I}\subseteq [K]$ satisfies the \textit{rank-increment condition}: $\mathrm{rank}\left(\bigl[\mathbf{F}_{\mathcal{I}};\mathbf{G}_{\mathcal{I}}\bigr]\right) =\mathrm{rank}\bigl(\mathbf{F}_{\mathcal{I}}\bigr)+N$. Here, $\mathbf{F}_\mathcal{I}$ and $\mathbf{G}_\mathcal{I}$ are the submatrices formed by the columns indexed by $\mathcal{I}$. Our results uncover the novel fact that it is not necessary for every user to hold a key, thereby strictly enlarging the best-known achievable region in the literature. Furthermore, we provide a converse analysis to demonstrate its optimality when minimizing the number of users that hold keys.</description>

Abstract: The growing performance demands and higher deployment densities of next-generation wireless systems emphasize the importance of adopting strategies to manage the energy efficiency of mobile networks. In this demo, we showcase a framework that enables research on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) techniques for improving the energy efficiency of intelligent and programmable Open Radio Access Network (RAN) systems. Using the open-source simulator ns-O-RAN and the reinforcement learning environment Gymnasium, the framework enables to train and evaluate DRL agents that dynamically control the activation and deactivation of cells in a 5G network. We show how to collect data for training and evaluate the impact of DRL on energy efficiency in a realistic 5G network scenario, including users' mobility and handovers, a full protocol stack, and 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP)-compliant channel models. The tool will be open-sourced and a tutorial for energy efficiency testing in ns-O-RAN.</description>

Abstract: We propose EFPIX (Encrypted Flood Protocol for Information eXchange), a flood-based relay communication protocol that achieves end-to-end encryption, plausible deniability for users, and untraceable messages while hiding metadata, such as sender and receiver, from those not involved. It also has built-in spam resistance and multiple optional enhancements. It can be used in privacy-critical communication, infrastructure-loss scenarios, space/research/military communication, where central servers are infeasible, or general-purpose messaging.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Secure Semantic Communications in the Age of Generative and Agentic AI: Threats and Opportunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01791v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Semantic communication (SemCom) improves communication efficiency by transmitting task-relevant information instead of raw bits and is expected to be a key technology for 6G networks. Recent advances in generative AI (GenAI) further enhance SemCom by enabling robust semantic encoding and decoding under limited channel conditions. However, these efficiency gains also introduce new security and privacy vulnerabilities. Due to the broadcast nature of wireless channels, eavesdroppers can also use powerful GenAI-based semantic decoders to recover private information from intercepted signals. Moreover, rapid advances in agentic AI enable eavesdroppers to perform long-term and adaptive inference through the integration of memory, external knowledge, and reasoning capabilities. This allows eavesdroppers to further infer user private behavior and intent beyond the transmitted content. Motivated by these emerging challenges, this paper comprehensively rethinks the security and privacy of SemCom systems in the age of generative and agentic AI. We first present a systematic taxonomy of eavesdropping threat models in SemCom systems. Then, we provide insights into how GenAI and agentic AI can enhance eavesdropping threats. Meanwhile, we also highlight potential opportunities for leveraging GenAI and agentic AI to design privacy-preserving SemCom systems.</description>
