      <title>Quantifying discontinuity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a compact space $X$ that does not admit an embedding (an injective continuous function) into $\mathbb{R}^d$, we study the ''degree'' of discontinuity that any injective function $X \to \mathbb{R}^d$ must have. To this end, we define a scale invariant modulus of discontinuity and obtain general lower bounds, thus obtaining quantified nonembeddability results of Haefliger--Weber type. Moreover, we establish analogous lower bounds for simplicial complexes that do not admit an almost $r$-embedding in $\mathbb{R}^d$, thus obtaining a quantified version of the topological Tverberg theorem.</description>

      <title>Towards Constructing Geodesic Nets with Four Boundary Vertices and an Increasing Number of Balanced Vertices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a geodesic net in the plane with four boundary (unbalanced) vertices that has 25 balanced vertices and that is irreducible, i.e. it does not contain nontrivial subnets.
  This net is novel and remarkable for several reasons: (1) It increases the previously known maximum for balanced vertices of nets of this kind from 16 to 25. (2) It is, to our knowledge, the first such net that includes balanced vertices whose incident edges are not exhibiting symmetries of any kind. (3) The approach taken in the construction is quite promising as it might have the potential for generalization. This would allow to construct a series of irreducible geodesic nets with four boundary vertices and an arbitrary number of balanced vertices, answering a conjecture that the number of balanced vertices is in fact unbounded for nets with four boundary vertices. This would stand in stark contrast to the previously proven theorem that for three boundary vertices, there can be at most one single balanced vertex.</description>

      <title>The Shape of Symmetric Binary Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mandelbrot and Frame studied the geometry of self-contracting symmetric binary trees in which they stated that the height of such trees occurred at the branch tip of the path consisting of branches that alternate left and right. Taylor proved that this happens for both self-avoiding as well as self-contacting symmetric binary trees (if we ignore the height of the trunk and just consider the branch tips). In his commentary on the work by Mandelbrot and Frame, West gave an example of a self-overlapping tree in which this alternating left-right path does not give the highest point of the tree, and said that more analysis was needed. In this paper we show how such examples can be constructed for all but a countable number of angles. We also investigate the conditions for when the sides and bottom of a self-overlapping symmetric binary tree differ from what happens with self-avoiding and self-contacting trees.</description>

      <title>Completeness conditions for spacetimes with low-regularity metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend Beem's three completeness notions -- finite compactness, timelike Cauchy completeness, and Condition A -- originally defined for spacetimes, to Lorentzian length spaces and study their relationships.
  We prove that finite compactness implies timelike Cauchy completeness and that
  timelike Cauchy completeness implies Condition A for globally hyperbolic Lorentzian length spaces.
  Furthermore, for globally hyperbolic $C^{1}$-spacetimes under suitable assumptions
  ensuring good behavior of causal geodesics, we show that the three conditions are equivalent.
  These results can be regarded as a Hopf-Rinow type theorem for low-regularity Lorentzian geometry.
  The appendix presents examples of $C^{1}$-spacetimes -- where geodesic uniqueness may fail -- in which causal geodesics nevertheless behave well, illustrating the scope of our results.</description>

      <title>On two notions of curvature on singular surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the equivalence of two distinct notions of curvature bounds on singular surfaces. The first notion involves inequalities of the form $\omega\geq\kappa\mu$ (resp. $\omega\leq\kappa\mu$) where $\omega$ is the curvature measure and $\mu$ the Hausdorff measure. The second notion is the classical Alexandrov curvature bound CBB (resp. CAT). We demonstrate that these two definitions are, in fact, equivalent. Specifically, we fill an important gap in the theory by showing that the inequalities imply the corresponding Alexandrov CBB (resp. CAT) bound. One striking application of our result is that, in combination with a result of Petrunin, the lower bound $\omega\geq\kappa\mu$ implies $RCD(\kappa, 2)$.</description>

      <title>The entrywise calculus and dimension-free positivity preservers, with an Appendix on sphere packings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an overview of a classical theme in analysis and matrix positivity: the question of which functions preserve positive semidefiniteness when applied entrywise. In addition to drawing the attention of experts such as Schoenberg, Rudin, and Loewner, the subject has attracted renewed attention owing to its connections to various applied fields and techniques. In this survey we will focus mainly on the question of preserving positivity in all dimensions. Connections to distance geometry and metric embeddings, positive definite sequences and functions, Fourier analysis, applications and covariance estimation, Schur polynomials, and finite fields will be discussed.
  The Appendix contains a mini-survey of sphere packings, kissing numbers, and their "lattice" versions. This part overlaps with the rest of the article via Schoenberg's classification of the positive definite functions on spheres, aka dimension-free entrywise positivity preservers with a rank constraint - applied via Delsarte's linear programming method.</description>

      <title>First-Order Axiom Systems $\mathscr{E}_{d}$ and $\mathscr{E}_{da}$ Extending Tarski's $\mathscr{E}_{2}$ with Distance and Angle Function Symbols for Quantitative Euclidean Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tarski's first-order axiom system $\mathscr{E}_{2}$ for Euclidean geometry is notable for its completeness and decidability. However, the Pythagorean theorem -- either in its modern algebraic form $a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}$ or in Euclid's Elements -- cannot be directly expressed in $\mathscr{E}_{2}$, since neither distance nor area is a primitive notion in the language of $\mathscr{E}_{2}$. In this paper, we introduce an alternative axiom system $\mathscr{E}_{d}$ in a two-sorted language, which takes a two-place distance function $d$ as the only geometric primitive. We also present a conservative extension $\mathscr{E}_{da}$ of it, which also incorporates a three-place angle function $a$. The system $\mathscr{E}_{d}$ has two distinctive features: it is simple (with a single geometric primitive) and it is quantitative. Numerical distance can be directly expressed in this language. The Axiom of Similarity plays a central role in $\mathscr{E}_{d}$, effectively killing two birds with one stone: it provides a rigorous foundation for the theory of proportion and similarity, and it implies Euclid's Parallel Postulate (EPP). The Axiom of Similarity can be viewed as a quantitative formulation of EPP. The Pythagorean theorem and other quantitative results from similarity theory can be directly expressed in the languages of $\mathscr{E}_{d}$ and $\mathscr{E}_{da}$, motivating the name Quantitative Euclidean Geometry. The traditional analytic geometry can be united under synthetic geometry in $\mathscr{E}_{d}$. Namely, analytic geometry is not treated as a model of $\mathscr{E}_{d}$, but rather, its statements can be expressed as first-order formal sentences in the language of $\mathscr{E}_{d}$. The system $\mathscr{E}_{d}$ is shown to be consistent, complete, and decidable. Finally, we extend the theories to hyperbolic geometry and Euclidean geometry in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>A continuous invariant-based asymmetry of a periodic crystal quantifies its deviation from higher symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13746v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ideal symmetry is known to break down under almost any noise. One measure of asymmetry in a periodic crystal is the relative multiplicity Z' of geometrically non-equivalent units. However, Z' discontinuously changes under almost any displacement of atoms, which can arbitrarily scale up a primitive cell. This discontinuity was recently resolved by a hierarchy of invariant descriptors that continuously change under all small perturbations.
  We introduce a Continuous Invariant-based Asymmetry (CIA) to quantify (in physically meaningful Angstroms) the deviation of a periodic crystal from a higher symmetry form. Our experiments on Crystal Structure Prediction datasets show that many simulated crystals may be non-synthesisable not only due to high energy but also due to high CIA values, which are much faster to compute. On another hand, many crystals with high Z' values in the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) turned out to be close to more symmetric forms with Z'&lt;=1 due to low CIA values.</description>

      <title>Classification of metric fibrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.04387v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study `a fibration of metric spaces' that was originally introduced by Leinster in the study of the magnitude and called metric fibrations. He showed that the magnitude of a metric fibration splits into the product of those of the fiber and the base, which is analogous to the Euler characteristic and topological fiber bundles. His idea and our approach is based on Lawvere's suggestion of viewing a metric space as an enriched category. Actually, the metric fibration turns out to be the restriction of the enriched Grothendieck fibrations to metric spaces. We give a complete classification of metric fibrations by several means, which is parallel to that of topological fiber bundles. That is, the classification of metric fibrations is reduced to that of `principal fibrations', which is done by the `1-Cech cohomology' in an appropriate sense. Here we introduce the notion of torsors in the category of metric spaces, and the discussions are analogous to the sheaf theory. Further, we can define the `fundamental group $\pi^m_1(X)$' of a metric space $X$, which is a group object in metric spaces, such that the conjugation classes of homomorphisms $Hom(\pi^m_1(X), G)$ corresponds to the isomorphism classes of `principal $G$-fibrations' over $X$. Namely, it is classified like topological covering spaces.</description>
