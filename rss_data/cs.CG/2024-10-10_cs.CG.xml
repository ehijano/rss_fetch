      <title>VisDiff: SDF-Guided Polygon Generation for Visibility Reconstruction and Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The capability to learn latent representations plays a key role in the effectiveness of recent machine learning methods. An active frontier in representation learning is understanding representations for combinatorial structures which may not admit well-behaved local neighborhoods or distance functions. For example, for polygons, slightly perturbing vertex locations might lead to significant changes in their combinatorial structure and may even lead to invalid polygons. In this paper, we investigate representations to capture the underlying combinatorial structures of polygons. Specifically, we study the open problem of Visibility Reconstruction: Given a visibility graph G, construct a polygon P whose visibility graph is G.
  We introduce VisDiff, a novel diffusion-based approach to reconstruct a polygon from its given visibility graph G. Our method first estimates the signed distance function (SDF) of P from G. Afterwards, it extracts ordered vertex locations that have the pairwise visibility relationship given by the edges of G. Our main insight is that going through the SDF significantly improves learning for reconstruction. In order to train VisDiff, we make two main contributions: (1) We design novel loss components for computing the visibility in a differentiable manner and (2) create a carefully curated dataset. We use this dataset to benchmark our method and achieve 21% improvement in F1-Score over standard methods. We also demonstrate effective generalization to out-of-distribution polygon types and show that learning a generative model allows us to sample the set of polygons with a given visibility graph. Finally, we extend our method to the related combinatorial problem of reconstruction from a triangulation. We achieve 95% classification accuracy of triangulation edges and a 4% improvement in Chamfer distance compared to current architectures.</description>

      <title>Noncrossing Longest Paths and Cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Edge crossings in geometric graphs are sometimes undesirable as they could lead to unwanted situations such as collisions in motion planning and inconsistency in VLSI layout. Short geometric structures such as shortest perfect matchings, shortest spanning trees, shortest spanning paths, and shortest spanning cycles on a given point set are inherently noncrossing. However, the longest such structures need not be noncrossing. In fact, it is intuitive to expect many edge crossings in various geometric graphs that are longest.
  Recently, \'Alvarez-Rebollar, Cravioto-Lagos, Mar\'in, Sol\'e-Pi, and Urrutia (Graphs and Combinatorics, 2024) constructed a set of points for which the longest perfect matching is noncrossing. They raised several challenging questions in this direction. In particular, they asked whether the longest spanning path, on any finite set of points in the plane, must have a pair of crossing edges. They also conjectured that the longest spanning cycle must have a pair of crossing edges.
  In this paper, we give a negative answer to the question and also refute the conjecture. We present a framework for constructing arbitrarily large point sets for which the longest perfect matchings, the longest spanning paths, and the longest spanning cycles are noncrossing.</description>

      <title>Flips in Odd Matchings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{P}$ be a set of $n=2m+1$ points in the plane in general position. We define the graph $GM_\mathcal{P}$ whose vertex set is the set of all plane matchings on $\mathcal{P}$ with exactly $m$ edges. Two vertices in $GM_\mathcal{P}$ are connected if the two corresponding matchings have $m-1$ edges in common. In this work we show that $GM_\mathcal{P}$ is connected and give an upper bound of $O(n^2)$ on its diameter. Moreover, we present a tight bound of $\Theta(n)$ for the diameter of the flip graph of points in convex position.</description>

      <title>Provable Methods for Searching with an Imperfect Sensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Assume that a target is known to be present at an unknown point among a finite set of locations in the plane. We search for it using a mobile robot that has imperfect sensing capabilities. It takes time for the robot to move between locations and search a location; we have a total time budget within which to conduct the search. We study the problem of computing a search path/strategy for the robot that maximizes the probability of detection of the target. Considering non-uniform travel times between points (e.g., based on the distance between them) is crucial for search and rescue applications; such problems have been investigated to a limited extent due to their inherent complexity. In this paper, we describe fast algorithms with performance guarantees for this search problem and some variants, complement them with complexity results, and perform experiments to observe their performance.</description>

      <title>Score Design for Multi-Criteria Incentivization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a framework for designing scores to summarize performance metrics. Our design has two multi-criteria objectives: (1) improving on scores should improve all performance metrics, and (2) achieving pareto-optimal scores should achieve pareto-optimal metrics. We formulate our design to minimize the dimensionality of scores while satisfying the objectives. We give algorithms to design scores, which are provably minimal under mild assumptions on the structure of performance metrics. This framework draws motivation from real-world practices in hospital rating systems, where misaligned scores and performance metrics lead to unintended consequences.</description>

      <title>Online Epsilon Net and Piercing Set for Geometric Concepts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: VC-dimension and $\varepsilon$-nets are key concepts in Statistical Learning Theory. Intuitively, VC-dimension is a measure of the size of a class of sets. The famous $\varepsilon$-net theorem, a fundamental result in Discrete Geometry, asserts that if the VC-dimension of a set system is bounded, then a small sample exists that intersects all sufficiently large sets.
  In online learning scenarios where data arrives sequentially, the VC-dimension helps to bound the complexity of the set system, and $\varepsilon$-nets ensure the selection of a small representative set. This sampling framework is crucial in various domains, including spatial data analysis, motion planning in dynamic environments, optimization of sensor networks, and feature extraction in computer vision, among others. Motivated by these applications, we study the online $\varepsilon$-net problem for geometric concepts with bounded VC-dimension. While the offline version of this problem has been extensively studied, surprisingly, there are no known theoretical results for the online version to date. We present the first deterministic online algorithm with an optimal competitive ratio for intervals in $\mathbb{R}$. Next, we give a randomized online algorithm with a near-optimal competitive ratio for axis-aligned boxes in $\mathbb{R}^d$, for $d\le 3$. Furthermore, we introduce a novel technique to analyze similar-sized objects of constant description complexity in $\mathbb{R}^d$, which may be of independent interest. Next, we focus on the continuous version of this problem, where ranges of the set system are geometric concepts in $\mathbb{R}^d$ arriving in an online manner, but the universe is the entire space, and the objective is to choose a small sample that intersects all the ranges.</description>

      <title>Online Maximum Independent Set of Hyperrectangles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.13261v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The maximum independent set problem is a classical NP-hard problem in theoretical computer science. In this work, we study a special case where the family of graphs considered is restricted to intersection graphs of sets of axis-aligned hyperrectangles and the input is provided in an online fashion. We prove results for several adversary models, classes of hyperrectangles, and restrictions on the order of the input. Under the adaptive offline and adaptive online adversary models, we find the optimal online algorithm for unit hypercubes, $\sigma$-bounded hypercubes, unit-volume hyperrectangles, and arbitrary hypercubes, in both non-dominated and arbitrary order. Under the oblivious adversary model, we prove bounds on the competitive ratio of an optimal online algorithm for the same classes of hyperrectangles and input orders, and we find algorithms that are optimal up to constant factors. For input in dominating order, we find the optimal online algorithm for arbitrary hyperrectangles under all adversary models. We conclude by discussing several promising directions for future work.</description>
