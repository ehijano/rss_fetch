      <title>Role of symmetry in the correlated orientational disorder phase of entropic crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Correlated orientational disordered phase is a thermodynamic phase with the constituent particles following some conserved laws or correlation despite the orientational disorder present in the system. Polyhedral particles in the presence of hard interaction serve the purpose of studying the orientational disorder in entropy driven self-assembly. We report the computational evidence of the role of symmetry of both particle and self-assembled crystal in the single-component system of anisotropic polyhedra in the correlated orientational disordered phase. The point groups of the particle and crystal structure appear to make a direct correspondence with the existence of multiple unique orientations of the system satisfying all the orientational conserved quantities towards the correlation. As a signature of correlation, the system exhibits orientationally frozen state at sufficiently higher packing fractions and discrete orientational hopping of the particles are observed at comparatively lower density solids. This symmetry relationship appears to control all the aspects of orientational correlation in the crystalline solids which might be useful to draw fundamental insights about the disordered crystalline solids with orientational correlation as well as designing the disorder in the crystals.</description>

      <title>A foundational framework for the mesoscale modeling of dynamic elastomers and gels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discrete mesoscale network models, in which explicitly modeled polymer chains are replaced by implicit pairwise potentials, are capable of predicting the macroscale mechanical response of polymeric materials such as elastomers and gels, while offering greater insight into microstructural phenomena than constitutive theory or macroscale experiments alone. However, whether such mesoscale models accurately represent the molecular structures of polymer networks requires investigation during their development, particularly in the case of dynamic polymers that restructure in time. We here introduce and compare the topological and mechanical predictions of an idealized, reduced-order mesoscale approach in which only tethered dynamic bonding sites and crosslinks in a polymer's backbone are explicitly modeled, to those of molecular theory and a Kremer-Grest, coarse-grained molecular dynamics approach. We find that for short chain networks at intermediate polymer packing fractions, undergoing relatively slow loading rates, the mesoscale approach reasonably reproduces the chain conformations, bond kinetic rates, and ensemble stress responses predicted by molecular theory and the bead-spring model. Further, it does so with a 90% reduction in computational cost. These savings grant the mesoscale model access to larger spatiotemporal domains than conventional molecular dynamics, enabling simulation of large deformations as well as durations approaching experimental timescales (e.g., those utilized in DMA). While the model investigated is for monodisperse polymer networks in theta-solvent, without entanglement, charge interactions, long-range dynamic bond interactions, or other confounding physical effects, this work highlights the utility of these models and lays a foundational groundwork for the incorporation of such phenomena moving forward.</description>

      <title>Chemically active droplets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: These lecture notes describe a basic theory of chemically active droplets, which are droplets kept away from equilibrium by driven chemical reactions. The notes assume a basic familiarity with equilibrium thermodynamics of phase separation, and thus focus on three separate themes, which were discussed in three separate lectures: (i) The kinetics of phase separation, including the early-stage dynamics of spinodal decomposition and the late-stage dynamics of Ostwald ripening. (ii) Transition state theory as a simple, thermodynamically-consistent kinetic theory of chemical reactions, which permits explicit driving in open systems. (iii) The combination of phase separation and reactions, leading to active droplets. We discuss the two fundamental classes of internally-maintained and externally-maintained droplets. A simple version of externally-maintained droplets permits an effective electrostatic analogy, which indicates how the reaction-diffusion system mediates long-ranged interactions. All these aspects are discussed in the context of biomolecular condensates.</description>

      <title>Active nematic pumps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microfluidics involves the manipulation of flows at the microscale, typically requiring external power sources to generate pressure gradients. Alternatively, harnessing flows from active fluids, which are usually chaotic, has been proposed as a paradigm for the development of micro-machines. Here, by combining experimental realizations and simulations, we demonstrate that the addition of triangular-shaped inclusions into an active nematic gel can locally break the fore-aft symmetry of active turbulence and stabilize flow fields with self-pumping capabilities. The proposed strategy has enabled us to generate wall-free and self-powered microfluidic systems capable of both cargo transport and mixing along with the downstream flow. We analyze the performance of these active pumps, both isolated and within cooperative ensembles in terms of their output velocity and hydrostatic pressure buildup. Finally, we demonstrate strategies to incorporate them into specifically designed microfluidic platforms to advantageously tailor the geometry of active flows. Our results reveal new possibilities for leveraging the self-organized mechanodynamics of active fluids.</description>

      <title>Migration and deformation of a droplet enclosing an active particle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The encapsulation of active particles, such as bacteria or active colloids, inside a droplet gives rise to nontrivial shape dynamics and droplet motility. To understand this behavior, we derive an asymptotic solution for the fluid flow about a deformable droplet containing an active particle, modeled as a Stokes-flow singularity, in the case of small shape distortions. Offsetting of the active particle from the center of the drop breaks symmetry and leads to excitation of large number of shape modes as well as particle and drop displacement. Flows due to common singularity representations of active particles, such as Stokeslets, rotlets, and stresslets, are computed and compared to results for non-deformable droplets enclosing active particles. The effect of interfacial properties is also investigated. Surfactants adsorbed at the droplet interface immobilize the interface and arrest the droplet motion. Our results highlight strategies to steer the flows of active particles and create autonomously navigating containers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of many macromolecular machines is characterized by chemically-mediated structural changes that achieve large scale functional deployment through local rearrangements of constitutive protein sub-units. Motivated by recent high resolution structural microscopy of a particular class of such machines, contractile injection systems (CIS), we construct a coarse grained semi-analytical model that recapitulates the geometry and bistable mechanics of CIS in terms of a minimal set of measurable physical parameters. We use this model to predict the size, shape and speed of a dynamical actuation front that underlies contraction. Scaling laws for the velocity and physical extension of the contraction front are consistent with our numerical simulations, and may be generally applicable to related systems.</description>

      <title>A generalized geometric mechanics theory for multi-curve-fold origami: vertex constrained universal configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Folding paper along curves leads to spatial structures that have curved surfaces meeting at spatial creases, defined as curve-fold origami. In this work, we provide an Eulerian framework focusing on the mechanics of arbitrary curve-fold origami, especially for multi-curve-fold origami with vertices. We start with single-curve-fold origami that has wide panels. Wide panel leads to different domains of mechanical responses induced by various generator distributions of the curved surface. The theories are then extended to multi-curve-fold origami, involving additional geometric correlations between creases. As an illustrative example, the deformation and equilibrium configuration of origami with annular creases are studied both theoretically and numerically. Afterward, single-vertex curved origami theory is studied as a special type of multi-curve-fold origami. We find that the extra periodicity at the vertex strongly constrains the configuration space, leading to a region near the vertex that has a striking universal equilibrium configuration regardless of the mechanical properties. Both theories and numerics confirm the existence of the universality in the near-field region. In addition, the far-field deformation is obtained via energy minimization and validated by finite element analysis. Our generalized multi-curve-fold origami theory, including the vertex-contained universality, is anticipated to provide a new understanding and framework for the shape programming of the curved fold origami system.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Motion of Liquid Droplets on Soft Gradient Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report an experimental investigation of the spontaneous motion of liquid droplets on soft gels with a crosslinking gradient. By systematically adjusting the spatial difference in crosslinking density, we observed that millimeter-sized liquid droplets moved along the gradient of elastic modulus and even climbed tilted slopes against gravity. Unlike the wetting dynamics of micro-droplets, which are governed by elastocapillary effects, we demonstrated that the observed spontaneous movements of millimeter-sized droplets were attributed to the surface energy difference resulting from the variation in crosslinking density. Using {\em in-situ} confocal microscopy imaging, we analyzed the viscoelastic dissipation induced by the moving wetting ridges near dynamic contact lines. Based on the relationship between the crosslinking density and surface energy of soft gels, our findings reveal a new method for controlling droplet dynamics at soft and dissipative interfaces.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Density Functional Theory on Lane Formation in Electric-Field-Driven Ionic Mixtures: Flow-Kernel-Based Formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulation and experimental studies have demonstrated non-equilibrium ordering in driven colloidal suspensions: with increasing driving force, a uniform colloidal mixture transforms into a locally demixed state characterized by the lane formation or the emergence of strongly anisotropic stripe-like domains. Theoretically, we have found that a linear stability analysis of density dynamics can explain the non-equilibrium ordering by adding a non-trivial advection term. This advection arises from fluctuating flows due to non-Coulombic interactions associated with oppositely driven migrations. Recent studies based on the dynamical density functional theory (DFT) without multiplicative noise have introduced the flow kernel for providing a general description of the fluctuating velocity. Here, we assess and extend the above deterministic DFT by treating electric-field-driven binary ionic mixtures as the primitive model. First, we develop the stochastic DFT with multiplicative noise for the laning phenomena. The stochastic DFT considering the fluctuating flows allows us to determine correlation functions in a steady state. In particular, asymptotic analysis on the stationary charge-charge correlation function reveals that the above dispersion relation for linear stability analysis is equivalent to the pole equation for determining the oscillatory wavelength of charge--charge correlations. Next, the appearance of stripe-like domains is demonstrated not only by using the pole equation but also by performing the 2D inverse Fourier transform of the charge--charge correlation function without the premise of anisotropic homogeneity in the electric field direction.</description>

      <title>X-ray diffraction reveals the consequences of strong deformation in thin smectic films: dilation and chevron formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Smectic liquid crystals can be viewed as model systems for lamellar structures for which there has been extensive theoretical development. We demonstrate that a nonlinear energy description is required with respect to the usual Landau-de Gennes elasticity in order to explain the observed layer spacing of highly curved smectic layers. Using X-ray diffraction we have quantitatively determined the dilation of bent layers distorted by antagonistic anchoring (as high as 1.8% of dilation for the most bent smectic layers) and accurately described it by the minimal nonlinear expression for energy. We observe a 1{\deg} tilt of planar layers that are connected to the curved layers. This value is consistent with simple energetic calculations, demonstrating how the bending energy impacts the overall structure of a thin distorted smectic film. Finally, we show that combined X-ray measurements and theoretical modeling allow for the quantitative determination of the number of curved smectic layers and of the resulting thickness of the dilated region with unprecedented precision.</description>

      <title>Ion Selectivity in Uncharged Tapered Nanoslits through Heterogeneous Water Polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ molecular dynamics simulations to investigate ion and water transport driven by an electric field through quasi-two-dimensional nanoslits with a tapered geometry. Despite the absence of surface charge on the channel walls and the associated electric double layer, we do observe a robust ion selectivity. This selectivity favors the transport of cations from base to tip when the electric field is directed from base to tip, and anions from base to tip when the field direction is reversed. Additionally, we observe a corresponding electro-osmotic water flow from base to tip, regardless of the electric field direction. Intriguingly, ion selectivity and electro-osmotic flow are conventionally associated with surface charge and electric double layers. However, in uncharged tapered nanoslits, we uncover a novel mechanism for these phenomena, where ion selectivity arises from the divergence of the heterogeneous water polarization.</description>

      <title>Edwards thermodynamic framework controls density segregation in cyclically sheared granular materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using X-ray tomography, we experimentally investigate granular segregation phenomena in a mixture of particles with different densities under quasi-static cyclic shear. We quantitatively characterize their height distributions at steady states by minimizing effective free energy based on a segregation temperature that captures the competition between the mixing entropy and gravitational potential energy. We find this temperature coincides with Edwards' compactivity within error under various pressures and cyclic shear amplitudes. Therefore, we find that granular segregation in quasi-static conditions can be fundamentally explained by an effective granular thermodynamic framework including real energy terms based on the Edwards statistical ensemble.</description>

      <title>Phase behavior and crystal nucleation of hard triangular prisms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay between densification and positional ordering during the process of crystal nucleation is a greatly investigated topic. Even for the simplest colloidal model -- hard spheres -- there has been much debate regarding the potential foreshadowing of nucleation by significant fluctuations in either local density or local structure. Considering anisotropic particles instead of spheres adds a third degree of freedom to the self-organization process of crystal nucleation: orientational ordering. Here, we investigate the crystal nucleation of hard triangular prisms. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we first carefully determine the crystal-fluid coexistence values and calculate the nucleation barriers for two degrees of supersaturation. Next, we use brute force simulations to obtain a large set of spontaneous nucleation events. By studying the time evolution of the local density, positional ordering, and orientational ordering in the region in which the nucleus first arises, we demonstrate that all local order parameters increase simultaneously from the very start of the nucleation process. We thus conclude that we observe no precursor for the crystal nucleation of hard triangular prisms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We highlight the current state-of-the-art in modeling emulsion rheology, ranging from dilute to jammed dense systems. We focus on analytical and numerical methods developed for calculating, computing, and tracking drop deformation en route to developing constitutive models for flowing emulsions. We identify material properties and dimensionless parameters, collate the small deformation theories and resulting expressions for viscometric quantities, list theoretical and numerical methods, and take stock of challenges for capturing connections between drop deformation, morphology, and rheology of emulsions. We highlight the substantial progress in providing quantitative descriptions of the rheological response using analytical theories, dimensional analysis, and powerful computational fluid dynamics to determine how macroscopic rheological properties emerge from microscopic features, including deformation and dynamics of non-interacting or interacting drops and molecular aspects that control the interfacial properties.</description>

      <title>Modeling Ion-Specific Effects in Polyelectrolyte Brushes: A Modified Poisson-Nernst-Planck Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polyelectrolyte brushes consist of a set of charged linear macromolecules each tethered at one end to a surface. An example is the glycocalyx which refers to hair-like negatively charged sugar molecules that coat the outside membrane of all cells. We consider the transport and equilibrium distribution of ions, and the resulting electrical potential, when such a brush is immersed in a salt buffer containing monovalent cations (sodium and/or potassium). The Gouy-Chapman model for ion screening at a charged surface captures the effects of the Coulombic force that drives ion electrophoresis and diffusion, but neglects non-Coulombic forces and ion pairing. By including the distinct binding affinities of these counter-ions with the brush, and their so-called Born radii, which account for Born forces acting on them when the permittivity is non-uniform, we propose modified Poisson-Nernst-Planck continuum models that show the distinct profiles that may result depending on those ion-specific properties.</description>

      <title>Condensates in aggregation processes with input: a new power law and intermittency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large-mass condensates, which coexist with a power-law-decaying distribution in the one-dimensional Takayasu model of mass aggregation with input, were recently found in numerical simulations. Here we establish the occurrence of condensates by analyzing exact recursions, and further show that they have a strong effect on the properties of the system. In the steady state of a large but finite system, there is a single condensate, whose movement through the system leads to a reorganization of the mass profile on a macroscopic scale. A scaling analysis of the mean mass and standard deviation at different distances from the condensate leads to the surprising conclusion that the mass distribution on sites close to the condensate follow a power-law decay with a new exponent 5/3, while further-away sites show the customary Takayasu exponent 4/3, with a crossover in between. Finally, the exit of condensates from a system with open boundaries has a strong effect on the temporal fluctuations of the total mass in the steady state. Their departure is followed by a build-up of mass and subsequent departures, leading to strong intermittency, established through a divergence of the flatness as the scaled time approaches zero.</description>

      <title>Metabolic activity controls the emergence of coherent flows in microbial suspensions</title>

Abstract: Photosynthetic microbes have evolved and successfully adapted to the ever-changing environmental conditions in complex microhabitats throughout almost all ecosystems on Earth. In the absence of light, they can sustain their biological functionalities through aerobic respiration, and even in anoxic conditions through anaerobic metabolic activity. For a suspension of photosynthetic microbes in an anaerobic environment, individual cellular motility is directly controlled by its photosynthetic activity, i.e. the intensity of the incident light absorbed by chlorophyll. The effects of the metabolic activity on the collective motility on the population level, however, remain elusive so far. Here, we demonstrate that at high light intensities, a suspension of photosynthetically active microbes exhibits a stable reverse sedimentation profile of the cell density due to the microbes' natural bias to move against gravity. With decreasing photosynthetic activity, and therefore suppressed individual motility, the living suspension becomes unstable giving rise to coherent bioconvective flows. The collective motility is fully reversible and manifests as regular, three-dimensional plume structures, in which flow rates and cell distributions are directly controlled via the light intensity. The coherent flows emerge in the highly unfavourable condition of lacking both light and oxygen and, thus, might help the microbial collective to expand the exploration of their natural habitat in search for better survival conditions.</description>

      <title>Crosslinking degree variations enable programming and controlling soft fracture via sideways cracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large deformations of soft materials are customarily associated with strong constitutive and geometrical nonlinearities that originate new modes of fracture. Some isotropic materials can develop strong fracture anisotropy, which manifests as modifications of the crack path. Sideways cracking occurs when the crack deviates to propagate in the loading direction, rather than perpendicular to it. This fracture mode results from higher resistance to propagation perpendicular to the principal stretch direction. It has been demonstrated that such fracture anisotropy is related to the microstructural stretch of the polymer chains, also known as strain crystallization mechanisms. However, the precise variation of the fracture behavior with the degree of crosslinking is not fully understood. Leveraging experiments and computational simulations, here we show that the tendency of a crack to propagate sideways in the two component Elastosil P7670 increases with the degree of crosslinking. We explore the mixing ratio for the synthesis of the elastomer that establishes the transition from forward to sideways fracturing. To assist the investigations, we construct a novel phase-field model for fracture where the critical energy release rate is directly related to the crosslinking degree. Our results demonstrate that fracture anisotropy can be programmed during the synthesis of the polymer. Then, we propose a roadmap with composite soft structures with low- and high-crosslinked phases that allow for control over fracture, arresting and/or directing the fracture. By extending our computational framework as a virtual testbed, we capture the fracture performance of the composite samples and enable predictions based on more intricate composite unit cells. Overall, our work offers promising avenues for enhancing the fracture toughness of soft polymers.</description>

      <title>Pole Analysis of the Inter-Replica Correlation Function in a Two-Replica System as a Binary Mixture: Mean Overlap in the Cluster Glass Phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To investigate the cluster glass phase of ultrasoft particles, we examine an annealed two-replica system endowed with an attractive inter-replica field similar to that of a binary symmetric electrolyte. Leveraging this analogy, we conduct pole analysis on the total correlation functions in the two-replica system where the inter-replica field will eventually be switched off. By synthesizing discussions grounded in the pole analysis with a hierarchical view of the free-energy landscape, we derive an analytical form of the mean overlap between two replicas within the mean field approximation of the Gaussian core model. This formula elucidates novel numerical findings observed in the cluster glass phase.</description>

      <title>Forces from coarse-graining nonequilibrium degrees of freedom: exact results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study paradigmatic examples of a tracer trapped in a harmonic potential and coupled to a bath particle of various types. Restricting to linear couplings between tracer and bath allows for analytical treatment. We discuss the resulting stochastic Langevin equation for the tracer and its relaxation function, for which this equation is averaged under an initial tracer position. For equilibrium, the tracer-bath force on average vanishes, a well known consequence of Boltzmann statistics. If tracer and bath are subject to different temperatures, the conditioned tracer-bath force is finite, and can be as large in magnitude as the force between tracer and trapping potential. For a bath particle with intrinsic memory, e.g., an active particle, even the noise felt by the bath particle takes a finite average under conditioning of the tracer. If the noise of the bath particle is non-Gaussian, the relaxation function of the tracer can be non-monotonic as a function of time. We display how these phenomena are reflected in the Langevin equation of the tracer.</description>

      <title>Roadmap for Animate Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Humanity has long sought inspiration from nature to innovate materials and devices. As science advances, nature-inspired materials are becoming part of our lives. Animate materials, characterized by their activity, adaptability, and autonomy, emulate properties of living systems. While only biological materials fully embody these principles, artificial versions are advancing rapidly, promising transformative impacts across various sectors. This roadmap presents authoritative perspectives on animate materials across different disciplines and scales, highlighting their interdisciplinary nature and potential applications in diverse fields including nanotechnology, robotics and the built environment. It underscores the need for concerted efforts to address shared challenges such as complexity management, scalability, evolvability, interdisciplinary collaboration, and ethical and environmental considerations. The framework defined by classifying materials based on their level of animacy can guide this emerging field encouraging cooperation and responsible development. By unravelling the mysteries of living matter and leveraging its principles, we can design materials and systems that will transform our world in a more sustainable manner.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium Probability Currents in Optically-Driven Colloidal Suspensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.12718v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the absence of directional motion it is often hard to recognize athermal fluctuations. Probability currents provide such a measure in terms of the rate at which they enclose area in the reduced phase space. We measure this area enclosing rate for trapped colloidal particles, where only one particle is driven. By combining experiment, theory, and simulation, we single out the effect of the different time scales in the system on the measured probability currents. In this controlled experimental setup, particles interact hydrodynamically. These interactions lead to a strong spatial dependence of the probability currents and to a local influence of athermal agitation. In a multiple-particle system, we show that even when the driving acts only on one particle, probability currents occur between other, non-driven particles. This may have significant implications for the interpretation of fluctuations in biological systems containing elastic networks in addition to a suspending fluid.</description>

      <title>The Countoscope: Measuring Self and Collective Dynamics without Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00647v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Driven by physical questions pertaining to quantifying particle dynamics, microscopy can now resolve complex systems at the single particle level, from cellular organisms to individual ions. Yet, available analysis techniques face challenges reconstructing trajectories in dense and heterogeneous systems where accurately labelling particles is difficult. Furthermore, the inescapable finite field of view of experiments hinders the measurement of collective effects. Inspired by Smoluchowski, we introduce a broadly applicable analysis technique that probes dynamics of interacting particle suspensions based on a remarkably simple principle: counting particles in finite observation boxes. Using colloidal experiments, advanced simulations and theory, we first demonstrate that statistical properties of fluctuating counts can be used to determine self-diffusion coefficients, so alleviating the hurdles associated with trajectory reconstruction. We also provide a recipe for practically extracting the diffusion coefficient from experimental data at variable particle densities, which is sensitive to steric and hydrodynamic interactions. Remarkably, by increasing the observation box size, counting naturally enables the study of collective dynamics in dense suspensions. Using our novel analysis of particle counts, we uncover a surprising enhancement of collective behaviour, as well as a new length scale associated with hyperuniform-like structure. Our counting framework, the Countoscope, thus enables efficient measurements of self and collective dynamics in dense suspensions and opens the way to quantifying dynamics and identifying novel physical mechanisms in diverse complex systems where single particles can be resolved.</description>

      <title>Geometric frustration and pairing order transition in confined bacterial vortices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15257v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dense systems of active matter exhibit highly dynamic collective motion characterized by intermingled vortices, referred to as active turbulence. The interaction between these vortices is key to controlling turbulent dynamics, and a promising approach for revealing the rules governing their interaction is geometric confinement. In this study, we investigate the vortex-pairing patterns in confined bacterial suspensions as a model frustrated system in which a perfect antiferromagnetic state is prohibited. We found that three-body vortex interactions exhibited anomalous pairing-order transition from co-rotational vortex-pairing to counter-rotating patterns with frustration. Although an active matter system is in non-equilibrium, our theory based on bending energy accounts for significant features including pattern transition and shift of the transition point in frustrated systems. Moreover, the interplay between the chirality in collective motion and frustration in vortex pairing creates a collective rotational flow under the broad geometric conditions of a confined space. Our results show that frustrated vortex patterning promotes a geometric approach for arranging active turbulence in microfluidic systems.</description>

      <title>Flocking by Turning Away</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17153v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Flocking, as paradigmatically exemplified by birds, is the coherent collective motion of active agents. As originally conceived, flocking emerges through alignment interactions between the agents. Here, we report that flocking can also emerge through interactions that turn agents away from each other. Combining simulations, kinetic theory, and experiments, we demonstrate this mechanism of flocking in self-propelled Janus colloids with stronger repulsion on the front than on the rear. The polar state is stable because particles achieve a compromise between turning away from left and right neighbors. Unlike for alignment interactions, the emergence of polar order from turn-away interactions requires particle repulsion. At high concentration, repulsion produces flocking Wigner crystals. Whereas repulsion often leads to motility-induced phase separation of active particles, here it combines with turn-away torques to produce flocking. Therefore, our findings bridge the classes of aligning and non-aligning active matter. Our results could help to reconcile the observations that cells can flock despite turning away from each other via contact inhibition of locomotion. Overall, our work shows that flocking is a very robust phenomenon that arises even when the orientational interactions would seem to prevent it.</description>

      <title>Scaling Properties of Liquid Dynamics Predicted from a Single Configuration: Pseudoisomorphs for Harmonic-Bonded Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10859v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Isomorphs are curves in the thermodynamic phase diagram of invariant excess entropy, structure, and dynamics, while pseudoisomorphs are curves of invariant structure and dynamics, but not of the excess entropy. The latter curves have been shown to exist in molecular models with flexible bonds [A. E. Olsen et al., J. Chem. Phys. 145, 241103 (2016)]. We here present three force-based methods to trace out pseudoisomorphs based on a single configuration and test them on the asymmetric dumbbell and 10-bead Lennard-Jones chain models with bonds modeled as harmonic springs. The three methods are based on requiring that particle forces, center-of-mass forces, and torques, respectively, are invariant in reduced units. For each of the two investigated models we identify a method that works well for tracing out pseudoisomorphs, but these methods are not the same. Overall, it appears that the more internal degrees of freedom there are in the molecule studied, the less they affect the gross dynamical behavior. Moreover, the "internal" degrees of freedom (including rotation) do not appear to significantly affect the scaling behavior of the dynamical/transport coefficients provided some "quenching" is performed.</description>

      <title>Donnan equilibrium in charged slit-pores from a hybrid nonequilibrium Molecular Dynamics / Monte Carlo method with ions and solvent exchange</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18957v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ion partitioning between different compartments (\emph{e.g.} a porous material and a bulk solution reservoir), known as Donnan equilibrium, plays a fundamental role in various contexts such as energy, environment, or water treatment. The linearized Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) equation, capturing the thermal motion of the ions with mean-field electrostatic interactions, is practically useful to understand and predict ion partitioning, despite its limited applicability to conditions of low salt concentrations and surface charge densities. Here, we investigate the Donnan equilibrium of coarse-grained dilute electrolytes confined in charged slit-pores in equilibrium with a reservoir of ions and solvent. We introduce and use an extension to confined systems of a recently developed hybrid nonequilibrium molecular dynamics / grand canonical Monte Carlo simulation method ("H4D"), which enhances the efficiency of solvent and ion-pair exchange via a fourth spatial dimension. We show that the validity range of linearized PB theory to predict the Donnan equilibrium of dilute electrolytes can be extended to highly charged pores, by simply considering \textit{renormalized} surface charge densities. We compare with simulations of implicit solvent models of electrolytes and show that in the low salt concentrations and thin electric double layer limit considered here, an explicit solvent has a limited effect on the Donnan equilibrium and that the main limitations of the analytical predictions are not due to the breakdown of the mean-field description, but rather to the charge renormalization approximation, because it only focuses on the behavior far from the surfaces.</description>

      <title>Smectic-like bundle formation of planktonic bacteria upon nutrient starvation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05031v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bacteria aggregate through various intercellular interactions to build biofilms, but the effect of environmental changes thereupon remains largely unexplored. Here, by using an experimental device that overcomes past difficulties, we observed the collective response of Escherichia coli aggregates against dynamic changes in the growth condition. We discovered that nutrient starvation caused bacterial cells to arrange themselves into bundle-shaped clusters, developing a structure akin to that of smectic liquid crystal. The degree of the smectic-like bundle order was evaluated by a deep learning approach. Our experiments suggest that both the depletion attraction by extracellular polymeric substances and the growth arrest are essential for the bundle formation. Since these effects of nutrient starvation at the single-cell level are common to many bacterial species, bundle formation might also be common collective behavior that bacterial cells may exhibit under harsh environments.</description>
