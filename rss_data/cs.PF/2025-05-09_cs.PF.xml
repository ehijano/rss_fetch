      <title>Multiserver-job Response Time under Multilevel Scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the multiserver-job setting in the load-focused multilevel scaling limit, where system load approaches capacity much faster than the growth of the number of servers $n$.
  We specifically consider the ``1 and $n$'' system, where each job requires either one server or all $n$ servers. Within the multilevel scaling limit, we examine three regimes: load dominated by $n$-server jobs, 1-server jobs, or balanced. In each regime, we characterize the asymptotic growth rate of the boundary of the stability region and the scaled mean queue length.
  We numerically verify our asymptotic results against exact formulae.</description>

      <title>Performance Characterization of Containers in Edge Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02082v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Edge computing addresses critical limitations of cloud computing such as high latency and network congestion by decentralizing processing from cloud to the edge. However, the need for software replication across heterogeneous edge devices introduces dependency and portability challenges, driving the adoption of containerization technologies like Docker. While containers offer lightweight isolation and deployment advantages, they introduce new bottlenecks in edge environments, including cold-start delays, memory constraints, network throughput variability, and inefficient IO handling when interfacing with embedded peripherals. This paper presents an empirical evaluation of Docker containers on resource-constrained edge devices, using Raspberry Pi as a representative platform. We benchmark performance across diverse workloads, including microbenchmarks (CPU, memory, network profiling) and macrobenchmarks (AI inference, sensor IO operations), to quantify the overheads of containerization in real-world edge scenarios. Our testbed comprises physical Raspberry Pi nodes integrated with environmental sensors and camera modules, enabling measurements of latency, memory faults, IO throughput, and cold start delays under varying loads. Key findings reveal trade-offs between container isolation and edge-specific resource limitations, with performance degradation observed in IO heavy and latency sensitive tasks. We identify configuration optimizations to mitigate these issues, providing actionable insights for deploying containers in edge environments while meeting real time and reliability requirements. This work advances the understanding of containerized edge computing by systematically evaluating its feasibility and pitfalls on low-power embedded systems.</description>

      <title>On the Role of Search Budgets in Model-Based Software Refactoring Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.15179v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Software model optimization is a process that automatically generates design alternatives aimed at improving quantifiable non-functional properties of software systems, such as performance and reliability. Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms effectively help designers identify trade-offs among the desired non-functional properties. To reduce the use of computational resources, this work examines the impact of implementing a search budget to limit the search for design alternatives. In particular, we analyze how time budgets affect the quality of Pareto fronts by utilizing quality indicators and exploring the structural features of the generated design alternatives. This study identifies distinct behavioral differences among evolutionary algorithms when a search budget is implemented. It further reveals that design alternatives generated under a budget are structurally different from those produced without one. Additionally, we offer recommendations for designers on selecting algorithms in relation to time constraints, thereby facilitating the effective application of automated refactoring to improve non-functional properties.</description>
