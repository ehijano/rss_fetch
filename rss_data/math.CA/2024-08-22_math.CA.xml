      <title>Projection Theorems in the Presence of Expansions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a restricted projection theorem for a certain one dimensional family of projections from $\mathbb R^n$ to $\mathbb R^k$. The family we consider here arises naturally in the study of quantitative equidistribution problems in homogeneous dynamics.</description>

      <title>Lower Bounds for Weighted Chebyshev and Orthogonal Polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive optimal asymptotic and non-asymptotic lower bounds on the Widom factors for weighted Chebyshev and orthogonal polynomials on compact subsets of the real line. In the Chebyshev case we extend the optimal non-asymptotic lower bound previously known only in a handful of examples to regular compact sets and a large class weights. Using the non-asymptotic lower bound, we extend Widom's asymptotic lower bound for weights bounded away from zero to a large class of weights with zeros including weights with strong zeros and infinitely many zeros. As an application of the asymptotic lower bound we extend Bernstein's 1931 asymptotics result for weighted Chebyshev polynomials on an interval to arbitrary Riemann integrable weights with finitely many zeros and to some continuous weights with infinitely many zeros. In the case of orthogonal polynomials, we derive optimal asymptotic and non-asymptotic lower bound on arbitrary regular compact sets for a large class of weights in the non-asymptotic case and for arbitrary Szeg\H{o} class weights in the asymptotic case, extending previously known bounds on finite gap and Parreau--Widom sets.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear excitations in multi-dimensional nonlocal lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the formation of breathers in multi-dimensional lattices with nonlocal coupling that decays algebraically. By variational methods, the exact relationship between various parameters (dimension, nonlinearity, nonlocal parameter $\alpha$) that defines positive excitation thresholds is characterized. At the anti-continuum regime, there exists a family of unique ground states that determines excitation thresholds. We not only characterize the sharp spatial decay of ground states, which varies continuously in $\alpha$, but also identify the time decay of dispersive waves, which undergoes a discontinuous transition in $\alpha$.</description>

      <title>Lower bounds on the measure of the support of positive and negative parts of trigonometric polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.05308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.05308v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a finite set of natural numbers $D$ consider a complex polynomial of the form $f(z) = \sum_{d \in D} c_d z^d$. Let $\rho_+(f)$ and $\rho_-(f)$ be the fractions of the unit circle that $f$ sends to the right($\operatorname{Re} f(z) &gt; 0$) and left($\operatorname{Re} f(z) &lt; 0$) half-planes, respectively. Note that $\operatorname{Re} f(z)$ is a real trigonometric polynomial, whose allowed set of frequencies is $D$. It turns out that $\min(\rho_+(f), \rho_-(f))$ is always bounded from below by a numerical characteristic $\alpha(D)$ of our set $D$ which comes from a seemingly unrelated combinatorial problem. Furthermore, this result could be generalized to power series, almost periodic functions, functions of several variables and multivalued algebraic functions.</description>

      <title>The Laplace asymptotic expansion in high dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12706v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the classical Laplace asymptotic expansion of $\int_{\mathbb R^d} g(x)e^{-nz(x)}dx$, $n\gg1$ extends to the high-dimensional regime in which $d$ may grow large with $n$. We formulate simple conditions on the growth of the derivatives of $g$ and $z$ near the minimizer of $z$ under which the terms of the expansion and the remainder are bounded as powers of $(\tau d/\sqrt n)^2$. The parameter $\tau$ controls the growth rates of the derivatives and can be potentially large, but we obtain a useful expansion whenever $\tau d/\sqrt n\ll 1$. Our result relies on a new and transparent proof of the Laplace expansion valid for any $d$. The proof leads to a new representation of the terms and remainder, which is crucial in obtaining tight control on the growth of these quantities with $d$. To demonstrate that our bounds are tight, we consider the case of a quartic $z$ and $g\equiv1$, showing that the $k$th term is precisely of the order $(d^2/n)^k$ for all $k$, and that our bounds on the terms are of the same order of magnitude. We also apply our results to derive a high-dimensional Laplace expansion for a particular function $z$ arising in the context of Bayesian inference, which is both random and depends on $n$. We show that with high probability, the terms of the expansion and the remainder are bounded in powers of $d^2/n$. In both of these examples, $\tau=1$.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness and non-uniqueness results for spacetime extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.07752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.07752v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a function $f : A \to \mathbb{R}^n$ of a certain regularity defined on some open subset $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}^m$, it is a classical problem of analysis to investigate whether the function can be extended to all of $\mathbb{R}^m$ in a certain regularity class. If an extension exists and is continuous, then certainly it is uniquely determined on the closure of $A$. A similar problem arises in general relativity for Lorentzian manifolds instead of functions on $\mathbb{R}^m$. It is well-known, however, that even if the extension of a Lorentzian manifold $(M,g)$ is analytic, various choices are in general possible at the boundary. This paper establishes a uniqueness condition for extensions of globally hyperbolic Lorentzian manifolds $(M,g)$ with a focus on low regularities: any two extensions which are anchored by an inextendible causal curve $\gamma : [-1,0) \to M$ in the sense that $\gamma$ has limit points in both extensions, must agree locally around those limit points on the boundary as long as the extensions are at least locally Lipschitz continuous. We also show that this is sharp: anchored extensions which are only H\"older continuous do in general not enjoy this local uniqueness result.</description>

      <title>Matrix-Weighted Besov-Type and Triebel--Lizorkin-Type Spaces II: Sharp Boundedness of Almost Diagonal Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13548v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article is the second one of three successive articles of the authors on the matrix-weighted Besov-type and Triebel--Lizorkin-type spaces. In this article, we obtain the sharp boundedness of almost diagonal operators on matrix-weighted Besov-type and Triebel--Lizorkin-type sequence spaces. These results not only possess broad generality but also improve several existing related results in various special cases covered by this family of spaces. This improvement depends, on the one hand, on the notion of $A_p$-dimensions of matrix weights and their properties introduced in the first article of this series and, on the other hand, on a careful direct analysis of sequences of averages avoiding maximal operators. While a recent matrix-weighted extension of the Fefferman--Stein vector-valued maximal inequality would provide an alternative route to some of our results in the restricted range of function space parameters $p,q\in(1,\infty)$, our approach covers the full scale of exponents $p\in(0,\infty)$ and $q\in(0,\infty]$ that is relevant in the theory of function spaces.</description>

      <title>Pushforward measures on homogeneous spaces of non-unimodular groups and properties of modular functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00670v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper shows that a formula for the pushforward measures on the fiber bundle $ G \to G / H $ of homogeneous space of locally compact groups $ G $ and $ H $ can be written down by using the modular functions. As a result, we obtain the equality \begin{align} \frac{ \Delta_G ( h ) }{ \Delta_{ G / N } ( h N ) } = \frac{ \Delta_H ( h ) }{ \Delta_{ H / N } ( h N ) } \end{align} on the modular functions for any closed subgroups $ N $ and $ H $ of a locally compact group $ G $ with $ N \lhd G $ and $ N \subset H \subset G $ and any $ h \in H $.</description>
