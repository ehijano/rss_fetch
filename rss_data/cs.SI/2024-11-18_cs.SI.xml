      <title>Assessing Response Disparities in California Wildland-Urban-Interface (WUI) Cities Using the Compartmental Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing frequency and severity of wildfires pose significant risks to communities, infrastructure, and the environment, especially in Wildland-Urban Interface (WUI) areas. Effective disaster management requires understanding how the public perceives and responds to wildfire threats in real-time. This study uses social media data to assess public responses and explores how these responses are linked to city-level community characteristics. Specifically, we leveraged a transformer-based topic modeling technique called BERTopic to identify wildfire response-related topics and then utilized the Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) model to compute two key metrics associated with wildfire responses - awareness and resilience indicators. Additionally, we used GIS-based spatial analysis to map wildfire locations along with four groups of city-level factors (racial/ethnic, socioeconomic, demographic, and wildfire-specific). Our findings reveal significant geographic and socio-spatial differences in public responses. Southern California cities with larger Hispanic populations demonstrate higher wildfire awareness and resilience. In contrast, urbanized regions in Central and Northern California exhibit lower awareness levels. Furthermore, resilience is negatively correlated with unemployment rates, particularly in southern regions where higher unemployment aligns with reduced resilience. These findings highlight the need for targeted and equitable wildfire management strategies to improve the adaptive capacity of WUI communities.</description>

      <title>Static network structure cannot stabilize cooperation among Large Language Model agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to model human social behavior, with recent research exploring their ability to simulate social dynamics. Here, we test whether LLMs mirror human behavior in social dilemmas, where individual and collective interests conflict. Humans generally cooperate more than expected in laboratory settings, showing less cooperation in well-mixed populations but more in fixed networks. In contrast, LLMs tend to exhibit greater cooperation in well-mixed settings. This raises a key question: Are LLMs about to emulate human behavior in cooperative dilemmas on networks? In this study, we examine networked interactions where agents repeatedly engage in the Prisoner's Dilemma within both well-mixed and structured network configurations, aiming to identify parallels in cooperative behavior between LLMs and humans. Our findings indicate critical distinctions: while humans tend to cooperate more within structured networks, LLMs display increased cooperation mainly in well-mixed environments, with limited adjustment to networked contexts. Notably, LLM cooperation also varies across model types, illustrating the complexities of replicating human-like social adaptability in artificial agents. These results highlight a crucial gap: LLMs struggle to emulate the nuanced, adaptive social strategies humans deploy in fixed networks. Unlike human participants, LLMs do not alter their cooperative behavior in response to network structures or evolving social contexts, missing the reciprocity norms that humans adaptively employ. This limitation points to a fundamental need in future LLM design -- to integrate a deeper comprehension of social norms, enabling more authentic modeling of human-like cooperation and adaptability in networked environments.</description>

      <title>How the interplay between power concentration, competition, and propagation affects the resource efficiency of distributed ledgers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Forks in the Bitcoin network result from the natural competition in the blockchain's Proof-of-Work consensus protocol. Their frequency is a critical indicator for the efficiency of a distributed ledger as they can contribute to resource waste and network insecurity. We introduce a model for the estimation of natural fork rates in a network of heterogeneous miners as a function of their number, the distribution of hash rates and the block propagation time over the peer-to-peer infrastructure. Despite relatively simplistic assumptions, such as zero propagation delay within mining pools, the model predicts fork rates which are comparable with the empirical stale blocks rate. In the past decade, we observe a reduction in the number of mining pools approximately by a factor 3, and quantify its consequences for the fork rate, whilst showing the emergence of a truncated power-law distribution in hash rates, justified by a rich-get-richer effect constrained by global energy supply limits. We demonstrate, both empirically and with the aid of our quantitative model, that the ratio between the block propagation time and the mining time is a sufficiently accurate estimator of the fork rate, but also quantify its dependence on the heterogeneity of miner activities. We provide empirical and theoretical evidence that both hash rate concentration and lower block propagation time reduce fork rates in distributed ledgers. Our work introduces a robust mathematical setting for investigating power concentration and competition on a distributed network, for interpreting discrepancies in fork rates -- for example caused by selfish mining practices and asymmetric propagation times -- thus providing an effective tool for designing future and alternative scenarios for existing and new blockchain distributed mining systems.</description>

      <title>The ParClusterers Benchmark Suite (PCBS): A Fine-Grained Analysis of Scalable Graph Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the ParClusterers Benchmark Suite (PCBS) -- a collection of highly scalable parallel graph clustering algorithms and benchmarking tools that streamline comparing different graph clustering algorithms and implementations.
  The benchmark includes clustering algorithms that target a wide range of modern clustering use cases, including community detection, classification, and dense subgraph mining.
  The benchmark toolkit makes it easy to run and evaluate multiple instances of different clustering algorithms, which can be useful for fine-tuning the performance of clustering on a given task, and for comparing different clustering algorithms based on different metrics of interest, including clustering quality and running time.
  Using PCBS, we evaluate a broad collection of real-world graph clustering datasets. Somewhat surprisingly, we find that the best quality results are obtained by algorithms that not included in many popular graph clustering toolkits. The PCBS provides a standardized way to evaluate and judge the quality-performance tradeoffs of the active research area of scalable graph clustering algorithms. We believe it will help enable fair, accurate, and nuanced evaluation of graph clustering algorithms in the future.</description>

      <title>An "Opinion Reproduction Number" for Infodemics in a Bounded-Confidence Content-Spreading Process on Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01066v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the spreading dynamics of content on networks. To do this, we use a model in which content spreads through a bounded-confidence mechanism. In a bounded-confidence model (BCM) of opinion dynamics, the agents of a network have continuous-valued opinions, which they adjust when they interact with agents whose opinions are sufficiently close to theirs. The employed content-spreading model introduces a twist into BCMs by using bounded confidence for the content spread itself. We define an analogue of the basic reproduction number from disease dynamics that we call an \emph{opinion reproduction number}. A critical value of the opinion reproduction number indicates whether or not there is an ``infodemic'' (i.e., a large content-spreading cascade) of content that reflects a particular opinion. By determining this critical value, one can determine whether or not an opinion dies off or propagates widely as a cascade in a population of agents. Using configuration-model networks, we quantify the size and shape of content dissemination by calculating a variety of summary statistics, and we illustrate how network structure and spreading-model parameters affect these statistics. We find that content spreads most widely when the agents have a large expected mean degree or a large receptiveness to content. When the spreading process slightly exceeds the infodemic threshold, there can be longer dissemination trees than when the expected mean degree or receptiveness are larger, even though the total number of content shares is smaller.</description>

      <title>The SIS process on Erd\"os-R\'enyi graphs: determining the infected fraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12560v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There are many methods to estimate the quasi-stationary infected fraction of the SIS process on (random) graphs. A challenge is to adequately incorporate correlations, which is especially important in sparse graphs. Methods typically are either significantly biased in sparse graphs, or computationally very demanding already for small network sizes. The former applies to Heterogeneous Mean Field and to the N-intertwined Mean Field Approximation, the latter to most higher order approximations. In this paper we present a new method to determine the infected fraction in sparse graphs, which we test on Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs. Our method is based on degree-pairs, does take into account correlations and gives accurate estimates. At the same time, computations are very feasible and can easily be done even for large networks.</description>
