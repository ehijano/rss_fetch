      <title>Transformer For Low-frequency Extrapolating of Seismic Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Full waveform inversion (FWI) is used to reconstruct the physical properties of subsurface media which plays an important role in seismic exploration. However, the precision of FWI is seriously affected by the absence or inaccuracy of low-frequency information. Therefore, reconstructing the low-frequency signals accurately is highly significant in seismic data processing. Low-frequency extrapolation of seismic records can be approached as a deep learning regression problem. Thus, to obtain low-frequency information from band-limited seismic records, a novel network structure called low-frequency extrapolation transformer (LFET) is proposed to construct the nonlinear mapping relationship between the data missing low-frequency and low-frequency data in a supervised learning approach, which is inspired by the transformer model widely used in natural language processing (NLP). We apply multi-head self-attention (MSA) modules to model the remote dependencies of seismic data. Based on this, we introduce a shifted window partitioning approach to reduce the calculating amount. Due to the field data are not suitable for supervised learning, we generate synthetic seismic records using submodels selected from the benchmark Marmousi model as training data whose characteristics are similar to that of the field data. A single trace of synthetic band-limited seismic data in the time domain is used as the input data, and the parameters of LFET are updated based on the errors between the predicted trace and the corresponding label. The experimental results on the data generated by different models, different wavelets, and different kinds of field marine data demonstrate the feasibility and generalization of the proposed method. Furthermore, the proposed method achieves higher accuracy with lower computational expense than the traditional CNN method.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness and potential-based formulation for the propagation of hydro-acoustic waves and tsunamis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a linear model for the propagation of hydro-acoustic waves and tsunami in a stratified free-surface ocean. A formulation was previously obtained by linearizing the compressible Euler equations. The new formulation is obtained by studying the functional spaces and operators associated to the model. The mathematical study of this new formulation is easier and the discretization is also more efficient than for the previous formulation. We prove that both formulations are well posed and show that the solution to the first formulation can be obtained from the solution to the second. Finally, the formulations are discretized using a spectral element method, and we simulate tsunamis generation from submarine earthquakes and landslides.</description>

      <title>Inverse analysis of granular flows using differentiable graph neural network simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13695v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inverse problems in granular flows, such as landslides and debris flows, involve estimating material parameters or boundary conditions based on target runout profile. Traditional high-fidelity simulators for these inverse problems are computationally demanding, restricting the number of simulations possible. Additionally, their non-differentiable nature makes gradient-based optimization methods, known for their efficiency in high-dimensional problems, inapplicable. While machine learning-based surrogate models offer computational efficiency and differentiability, they often struggle to generalize beyond their training data due to their reliance on low-dimensional input-output mappings that fail to capture the complete physics of granular flows. We propose a novel differentiable graph neural network simulator (GNS) by combining reverse mode automatic differentiation of graph neural networks with gradient-based optimization for solving inverse problems. GNS learns the dynamics of granular flow by representing the system as a graph and predicts the evolution of the graph at the next time step, given the current state. The differentiable GNS shows optimization capabilities beyond the training data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for inverse estimation across single and multi-parameter optimization problems, including evaluating material properties and boundary conditions for a target runout distance and designing baffle locations to limit a landslide runout. Our proposed differentiable GNS framework offers an orders of magnitude faster solution to these inverse problems than the conventional finite difference approach to gradient-based optimization.</description>

      <title>Toward Routing River Water in Land Surface Models with Recurrent Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14212v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning is playing an increasing role in hydrology, supplementing or replacing physics-based models. One notable example is the use of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for forecasting streamflow given observed precipitation and geographic characteristics. Training of such a model over the continental United States has demonstrated that a single set of model parameters can be used across independent catchments, and that RNNs can outperform physics-based models. In this work, we take a next step and study the performance of RNNs for river routing in land surface models (LSMs). Instead of observed precipitation, the LSM-RNN uses instantaneous runoff calculated from physics-based models as an input. We train the model with data from river basins spanning the globe and test it in streamflow hindcasts. The model demonstrates skill at generalization across basins (predicting streamflow in unseen catchments) and across time (predicting streamflow during years not used in training). We compare the predictions from the LSM-RNN to an existing physics-based model calibrated with a similar dataset and find that the LSM-RNN outperforms the physics-based model. Our results give further evidence that RNNs are effective for global streamflow prediction from runoff inputs and motivate the development of complete routing models that can capture nested sub-basis connections.</description>
