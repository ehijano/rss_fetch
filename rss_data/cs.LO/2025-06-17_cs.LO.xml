      <title>Programming and Reasoning in Partially Observable Probabilistic Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Probabilistic partial observability is a phenomenon occuring when computer systems are deployed in environments that behave probabilistically and whose exact state cannot be fully observed. In this work, we lay the theoretical groundwork for a probabilistic belief programming language pBLIMP, which maintains a probability distribution over the possible environment states, called a belief state. pBLIMP has language features to symbolically model the behavior of and interaction with the partially observable environment and to condition the belief state based on explicit observations. In particular, pBLIMP programs can perform state estimation and base their decisions (i.e. the control flow) on the likelihood that certain conditions hold in the current state. Furthermore, pBLIMP features unbounded loops, which sets it apart from many other probabilistic programming languages. For reasoning about pBLIMP programs and the situations they model, we present a weakest-precondition-style calculus (wp) that is capable of reasoning about unbounded loops. Soundness of our wp calculus is proven with respect to an operational semantics. We further demonstrate how our wp calculus reasons about (unbounded) loops with loop invariants.</description>

      <title>Assessing the Quality of Binomial Samplers: A Statistical Distance Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Randomized algorithms depend on accurate sampling from probability distributions, as their correctness and performance hinge on the quality of the generated samples. However, even for common distributions like Binomial, exact sampling is computationally challenging, leading standard library implementations to rely on heuristics. These heuristics, while efficient, suffer from approximation and system representation errors, causing deviations from the ideal distribution. Although seemingly minor, such deviations can accumulate in downstream applications requiring large-scale sampling, potentially undermining algorithmic guarantees. In this work, we propose statistical distance as a robust metric for analyzing the quality of Binomial samplers, quantifying deviations from the ideal distribution. We derive rigorous bounds on the statistical distance for standard implementations and demonstrate the practical utility of our framework by enhancing APSEst, a DNF model counter, with improved reliability and error guarantees. To support practical adoption, we propose an interface extension that allows users to control and monitor statistical distance via explicit input/output parameters. Our findings emphasize the critical need for thorough and systematic error analysis in sampler design. As the first work to focus exclusively on Binomial samplers, our approach lays the groundwork for extending rigorous analysis to other common distributions, opening avenues for more robust and reliable randomized algorithms.</description>

      <title>Building Trustworthy AI by Addressing its 16+2 Desiderata with Goal-Directed Commonsense Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current advances in AI and its applicability have highlighted the need to ensure its trustworthiness for legal, ethical, and even commercial reasons. Sub-symbolic machine learning algorithms, such as the LLMs, simulate reasoning but hallucinate and their decisions cannot be explained or audited (crucial aspects for trustworthiness). On the other hand, rule-based reasoners, such as Cyc, are able to provide the chain of reasoning steps but are complex and use a large number of reasoners. We propose a middle ground using s(CASP), a goal-directed constraint-based answer set programming reasoner that employs a small number of mechanisms to emulate reliable and explainable human-style commonsense reasoning. In this paper, we explain how s(CASP) supports the 16 desiderata for trustworthy AI introduced by Doug Lenat and Gary Marcus (2023), and two additional ones: inconsistency detection and the assumption of alternative worlds. To illustrate the feasibility and synergies of s(CASP), we present a range of diverse applications, including a conversational chatbot and a virtually embodied reasoner.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning as Iterated Belief Change a la Darwiche and Pearl</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are powerful machine-learning models capable of capturing intricate non-linear relationships. They are widely used nowadays across numerous scientific and engineering domains, driving advancements in both research and real-world applications. In our recent work, we focused on the statics and dynamics of a particular subclass of ANNs, which we refer to as binary ANNs. A binary ANN is a feed-forward network in which both inputs and outputs are restricted to binary values, making it particularly suitable for a variety of practical use cases. Our previous study approached binary ANNs through the lens of belief-change theory, specifically the Alchourron, Gardenfors and Makinson (AGM) framework, yielding several key insights. Most notably, we demonstrated that the knowledge embodied in a binary ANN (expressed through its input-output behaviour) can be symbolically represented using a propositional logic language. Moreover, the process of modifying a belief set (through revision or contraction) was mapped onto a gradual transition through a series of intermediate belief sets. Analogously, the training of binary ANNs was conceptualized as a sequence of such belief-set transitions, which we showed can be formalized using full-meet AGM-style belief change. In the present article, we extend this line of investigation by addressing some critical limitations of our previous study. Specifically, we show that Dalal's method for belief change naturally induces a structured, gradual evolution of states of belief. More importantly, given the known shortcomings of full-meet belief change, we demonstrate that the training dynamics of binary ANNs can be more effectively modelled using robust AGM-style change operations -- namely, lexicographic revision and moderate contraction -- that align with the Darwiche-Pearl framework for iterated belief change.</description>

      <title>Automata Linear Dynamic Logic on Finite Traces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2108.12003v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Temporal logics are widely used by the Formal Methods and AI communities. Linear Temporal Logic is a popular temporal logic and is valued for its ease of use as well as its balance between expressiveness and complexity. LTL is equivalent in expressiveness to Monadic First-Order Logic and satisfiability for LTL is PSPACE-complete. Linear Dynamic Logic (LDL), another temporal logic, is equivalent to Monadic Second-Order Logic, but its method of satisfiability checking cannot be applied to a nontrivial subset of LDL formulas.
  Here we introduce Automata Linear Dynamic Logic on Finite Traces (ALDL_f) and show that satisfiability for ALDL_f formulas is in PSPACE. A variant of Linear Dynamic Logic on Finite Traces (LDL_f), ALDL_f combines propositional logic with nondeterministic finite automata (NFA) to express temporal constraints. ALDL$_f$ is equivalent in expressiveness to Monadic Second-Order Logic. This is a gain in expressiveness over LTL at no cost.</description>

      <title>The interdefinability of expansions of Belnap-Dunn logic</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04641v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Belnap-Dunn logic, also knows as the logic of First-Degree Entailment, is a logic that can serve as the underlying logic of theories that are inconsistent or incomplete. For various reasons, different expansions of Belnap-Dunn logic with non-classical connectives have been studied. This paper investigates the question whether those expansions are interdefinable with an expansion whose connectives include only classical connectives. Surprisingly, this relevant question is not addressed anywhere in the published studies. The notion of interdefinability of logics used is based on a general notion of definability of a connective in a logic that seems to have been forgotten. Attention is also paid to the extent to which the expansion whose connectives include only classical connectives is related to the version of classical logic with the same connectives.</description>

      <title>Concurrent Games over Relational Structures: The Origin of Game Comonads</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11267v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spoiler-Duplicator games are used in finite model theory to examine the expressive power of logics. Their strategies have recently been reformulated as coKleisli maps of game comonads over relational structures, providing new results in finite model theory via categorical techniques. We present a novel framework for studying Spoiler-Duplicator games by viewing them as event structures. We introduce a first systematic method for constructing comonads for all one-sided Spoiler-Duplicator games: game comonads are now realised by adjunctions to a category of games, generically constructed from a comonad in a bicategory of game schema (called signature games). Maps of the constructed categories of games are strategies and generalise coKleisli maps of game comonads; in the case of one-sided games they are shown to coincide with suitably generalised homomorphisms. Finally, we provide characterisations of strategies on two-sided Spoiler-Duplicator games; in a common special case they coincide with spans of event structures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15647v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a logical framework that enables us to define a formal theory of computational trust in which this notion is analysed in terms of epistemic attitudes towards the possible objects of trust and in relation to existing evidence in favour of the trustworthiness of these objects. The framework is based on a quantified epistemic and justification logic featuring a non-standard handling of identities. Thus, the theory is able to account for the hyperintensional nature of computational trust. We present a proof system and a frame semantics for the logic, we prove soundness and completeness results and we introduce the syntactical machinery required to define a theory of trust.</description>

      <title>Compositional Shielding and Reinforcement Learning for Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10460v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning has emerged as a powerful tool for obtaining high-performance policies. However, the safety of these policies has been a long-standing issue. One promising paradigm to guarantee safety is a shield, which shields a policy from making unsafe actions. However, computing a shield scales exponentially in the number of state variables. This is a particular concern in multi-agent systems with many agents. In this work, we propose a novel approach for multi-agent shielding. We address scalability by computing individual shields for each agent. The challenge is that typical safety specifications are global properties, but the shields of individual agents only ensure local properties. Our key to overcome this challenge is to apply assume-guarantee reasoning. Specifically, we present a sound proof rule that decomposes a (global, complex) safety specification into (local, simple) obligations for the shields of the individual agents. Moreover, we show that applying the shields during reinforcement learning significantly improves the quality of the policies obtained for a given training budget. We demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of our multi-agent shielding framework in two case studies, reducing the computation time from hours to seconds and achieving fast learning convergence.</description>

      <title>An Incremental Framework for Topological Dialogue Semantics: Efficient Reasoning in Discrete Spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.00615v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a tractable, incremental framework for topological dialogue semantics based on finite, discrete semantic spaces. Building on the intuition that utterances correspond to open sets and their combinatorial relations form a simplicial complex (the dialogue nerve), we give a rigorous foundation, a provably correct incremental algorithm for nerve updates, and a reference implementation in the Wolfram Language. The framework supports negative nerve computation (inconsistency tracking), consequence extraction, and a transparent, set-theoretic ranking of entailments. We clarify which combinatorial properties hold in the discrete case, provide motivating examples, and outline limitations and prospects for richer logical and categorical extensions.</description>

      <title>DHoTT: A Temporal Extension of Homotopy Type Theory for Semantic Drift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09671v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce Dynamic Homotopy Type Theory (DHoTT), a temporal extension of Homotopy Type Theory (HoTT) designed to reason formally about concepts whose meanings evolve continuously or rupture discontinuously over time. While traditional HoTT captures identity and equivalence within a fixed semantic landscape, DHoTT enriches this framework by explicitly indexing types with a temporal parameter, allowing types themselves to deform, rupture, and reassemble as contexts shift.
  Formally, we show that DHoTT serves as the internal language of a presheaf topos over the linearly ordered time category. As a result, DHoTT (1) conservatively extends HoTT, recovering standard homotopy-theoretic reasoning when time is held constant; (2) preserves foundational structures such as univalence and higher inductive types; and (3) introduces new constructs (drift paths and rupture types) for precisely capturing semantic evolution and discontinuity.
  We illustrate the expressiveness of DHoTT through a worked example derived from conversational dynamics in large language models, highlighting its relevance to posthuman intelligence and the formal modeling of evolving meaning.</description>

      <title>Beyond Value Iteration for Parity Games: Strategy Iteration with Universal Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.13338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.13338v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Parity games have witnessed several new quasi-polynomial algorithms since the breakthrough result of Calude et al. (STOC 2017). The combinatorial object underlying these approaches is a universal tree, as identified by Czerwi\'nski et al. (SODA 2019). By proving a quasi-polynomial lower bound on the size of a universal tree, they have highlighted a barrier that must be overcome by all existing approaches to attain polynomial running time. This is due to the existence of worst case instances which force these algorithms to explore a large portion of the tree.

As an attempt to overcome this barrier, we propose a strategy iteration framework which can be applied on any universal tree. It is at least as fast as its value iteration counterparts, while allowing one to take bigger leaps in the universal tree. Our main technical contribution is an efficient method for computing the least fixed point of 1-player games. This is achieved via a careful adaptation of shortest path algorithms to the setting of ordered trees. By plugging in the universal tree of Jurdzi\'nski and Lazi\'c (LICS 2017), or the Strahler universal tree of Daviaud et al. (ICALP 2020), we obtain instantiations of the general framework that take time $O(mn^2\log n\log d)$ and $O(mn^2\log^3 n \log d)$ respectively per iteration.</description>

Abstract: Our main result is a succinct counterpoint to Courcelle's meta-theorem as follows: every cw-nontrivial monadic second-order (MSO) property is either NP-hard or coNP-hard over graphs given by succinct representations. Succint representations are Boolean circuits computing the adjacency relation. Cw-nontrivial properties are those which have infinitely many models and infinitely many countermodels with bounded cliquewidth. Moreover, we explore what happens when the cw-nontriviality condition is dropped and show that, under a reasonable complexity assumption, the previous dichotomy fails, even for questions expressible in first-order logic.</description>

      <title>Free Doubly-Infinitary Distributive Categories are Cartesian Closed</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10447v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate categories in which products distribute over coproducts, a structure we call doubly-infinitary distributive categories. Through a range of examples, we explore how this notion relates to established concepts such as extensivity, infinitary distributivity, and cartesian closedness. We show that doubly-infinitary distributivity strictly strengthens the classical notion of infinitary distributivity. Moreover, we prove that free doubly-infinitary distributive categories are cartesian closed, unlike free distributive categories. The paper concludes with observations on non-canonical isomorphisms, alongside open questions and directions for future research.</description>
