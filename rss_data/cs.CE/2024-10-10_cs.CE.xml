      <title>Micrometer: Micromechanics Transformer for Predicting Mechanical Responses of Heterogeneous Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heterogeneous materials, crucial in various engineering applications, exhibit complex multiscale behavior, which challenges the effectiveness of traditional computational methods. In this work, we introduce the Micromechanics Transformer ({\em Micrometer}), an artificial intelligence (AI) framework for predicting the mechanical response of heterogeneous materials, bridging the gap between advanced data-driven methods and complex solid mechanics problems. Trained on a large-scale high-resolution dataset of 2D fiber-reinforced composites, Micrometer can achieve state-of-the-art performance in predicting microscale strain fields across a wide range of microstructures, material properties under any loading conditions and We demonstrate the accuracy and computational efficiency of Micrometer through applications in computational homogenization and multiscale modeling, where Micrometer achieves 1\% error in predicting macroscale stress fields while reducing computational time by up to two orders of magnitude compared to conventional numerical solvers. We further showcase the adaptability of the proposed model through transfer learning experiments on new materials with limited data, highlighting its potential to tackle diverse scenarios in mechanical analysis of solid materials. Our work represents a significant step towards AI-driven innovation in computational solid mechanics, addressing the limitations of traditional numerical methods and paving the way for more efficient simulations of heterogeneous materials across various industrial applications.</description>

      <title>DDES Study of Confined and Unconfined NACA Wing Sections Using Spectral Elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop hybrid RANS-LES strategies within the spectral element code Nek5000 based on the $k-\tau$ class of turbulence models. We chose airfoil sections at small flight configurations as our target problem to comprehensively test the solver accuracy and performance. We present verification and validation results of an unconfined NACA0012 wing section in a pure RANS and in a hybrid RANS-LES setup for an angle of attack ranging from 0 to 90 degrees. The RANS results shows good corroboration with existing experimental and numerical datasets for low incoming flow angles. A small discrepancy appears at higher angle in comparison with the experiments, which is in line with our expectations from a RANS formulation. On the other hand, DDES captures both the attached and separated flow dynamics well when compared with available numerical datasets. We demonstrate that for the hybrid turbulence modeling approach a high-order spectral element discretization converges faster (i.e., with less resolution) and captures the flow dynamics more accurately than representative low-order finite-volume and finite-difference approaches. We also revise some of the guidelines on sample size requirements for statistics convergence. Furthermore, we analyze some of the observed discrepancies of our unconfined DDES at higher angles with the experiments by evaluating the side wall "blocking" effect. We carry out additional simulations in a confined 'numerical wind tunnel' and assess the observed differences as a function of Reynolds number.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider management of the fish species Plecoglossus altivelis altivelis, a major inland fishery resource in Japan playing important roles from economic, cultural, and recreational viewpoints. We firstly summarize the collected body weight data of the fish in the Hii River, Japan since 2016. The two kinds of data are available in each year with few exceptions: the historical data during summer and autumn collected with the help of an angular and the annual distribution data at the Toami (casting net) competition where we could obtain the data from many anglers during two hours in one day. We fit deterministic and uncertain logistic growth models to the data in each year and discuss their performance. The fitted uncertain logistic growth model is applied to an optimal harvesting problem of the fish subject to a sustainability concern and model distortion. Several numerical schemes for solving the problem are examined and compared both theoretically and numerically.</description>

      <title>A novel, finite-element-based framework for sparse data solution reconstruction and multiple choices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital twinning offers a capability of effective real-time monitoring and control, which are vital for cost-intensive experimental facilities, particularly the ones where extreme conditions exist. Sparse experimental measurements collected by various diagnostic sensors are usually the only source of information available during the course of a physical experiment. Consequently, in order to enable monitoring and control of the experiment (digital twinning), the ability to perform inverse analysis, facilitating the full field solution reconstruction from the sparse experimental data in real time, is crucial. This paper shows for the first time that it is possible to directly solve inverse problems, such as solution reconstruction, where some or all boundary conditions (BCs) are unknown, by purely using a finite-element (FE) approach, without needing to employ any traditional inverse analysis techniques or any machine learning models, as is normally done in the field. This novel and efficient FE-based inverse analysis framework employs a conventional FE discretisation, splits the loading vector into two parts corresponding to the known and unknown BCs, and then defines a loss function based on that split. In spite of the loading vector split, the loss function preserves the element connectivity. This function is minimised using a gradient-based optimisation. Furthermore, this paper presents a novel modification of this approach, which allows it to generate a range of different solutions satisfying given requirements in a controlled manner. Controlled multiple solution generation in the context of inverse problems and their intrinsic ill-posedness is a novel notion, which has not been explored before. This is done in order to potentially introduce the capability of semi-autonomous system control with intermittent human intervention to the workflow.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Fusion for Battery Degradation Diagnostics Using Minimal Real-World Data: Bridging Laboratory and Practical Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unpredictability of battery lifetime has been a key stumbling block to technology advancement of safety-critical systems such as electric vehicles and stationary energy storage systems. In this work, we present a novel hybrid fusion strategy that combines physics-based and data-driven approaches to accurately predict battery capacity. This strategy achieves an average estimation error of only 0.63% over the entire battery lifespan, utilizing merely 45 real-world data segments along with over 1.7 million simulated data segments derived from random partial charging cycles. By leveraging a thoroughly validated physics-based battery model, we extract typical aging patterns from laboratory aging data and extend them into a more comprehensive parameter space, encompassing diverse battery aging states in potential real-world applications while accounting for practical cell-to-cell variations. By bridging the gap between controlled laboratory experiments and real-world usage scenarios, this method highlights the significant potential of transferring underlying knowledge from high-fidelity physics-based models to data-driven models for predicting the behavior of complex dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Participatory Budget Allocation Method for Approval Ballots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of Participatory Budgeting (PB) with approval ballots, inspired by Multi-Winner Voting schemes. We present generalized preference aggregation methods for participatory budgeting, especially for finding seemingly fair budget allocations. To achieve this, we generalize such preference aggregation methods from the well-known methods, namely the Sequential Chamberlin Courant rule and the Sequential Monroe Rule in the realm of social choice theory. Further, we provide an experimental evaluation of the preference aggregation methods using an impartial culture method of preference generation and study the extent to which such polynomial time algorithms satisfy one of the most popular notions of fairness called proportional representation.</description>

      <title>Constrained TLBO algorithm for lightweight cable-stiffened scissor-like deployable structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Present works discusses the efficient structural analysis and weight optimization of the cable-stiffened deployable structures. The stiffening effect of cables is incorporated through a matrix analysis based iterative strategy to identify the active and passive cables. The structural form can be easily deployed to cartesian as well as polar coordinates through the arrangement of duplet members. The large span utility of cable stiffened bar members can pose challenges to the deployability due to increased weight. A novel teaching-learning based optimization (TLBO) algorithm is utilized to optimize the overall weight of the structure through efficient section designs with proper constraint on the yield criteria. The penalty function approach is adopted to identify the unfeasible designs. A number of example cases are analysed and comparison is presented with the existing literature to show the suitability of the proposed approach. Finally, a new form of three-dimensional deployable structure is proposed. It is seen that such deployable structure can be accurately analysed using the iterative matrix analysis approach and efficiently optimized using the present algorithm.</description>

      <title>Analysis of vessel traffic flow characteristics in inland restricted waterways using multi-source data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To effectively manage vessel traffic and alleviate congestion on busy inland waterways, a comprehensive understanding of vessel traffic flow characteristics is crucial. However, limited data availability has resulted in minimal research on the traffic flow characteristics of inland waterway vessels. This study addresses this gap by conducting vessel-following experiments and fixed-point video monitoring in inland waterways, collecting multi-source data to analyze vessel traffic flow characteristics. First, the analysis of vessel speed distribution identifies the economic speed for vessels operating in these environments. Next, the relationship between microscopic vessel speed and gap distance is examined, with the logarithmic model emerging as the most accurate among various tested models. Additionally, the study explores the relationships among macroscopic speed, density, and flow rate, proposing a novel piecewise fundamental diagram model to describe these relationships. Lastly, the inland vessel traffic states are categorized using K-means clustering algorithm and applied to vessel navigation services. These findings provide valuable insights for enhancing inland waterway transportation and advancing the development of an integrated waterway transportation system.</description>

      <title>Graph Network Surrogate Model for Optimizing the Placement of Horizontal Injection Wells for CO2 Storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimizing the locations of multiple CO2 injection wells will be essential as we proceed from demonstration-scale to large-scale carbon storage operations. Well placement optimization is, however, a computationally intensive task because the flow responses associated with many potential configurations must be evaluated. There is thus a need for efficient surrogate models for this application. In this work we develop and apply a graph network surrogate model (GNSM) to predict the global pressure and CO2 saturation fields in 3D geological models for arbitrary configurations of four horizontal wells. The GNSM uses an encoding-processing-decoding framework where the problem is represented in terms of computational graphs. Separate networks are applied for pressure and saturation predictions, and a multilayer perceptron is used to provide bottom-hole pressure (BHP) for each well at each time step. The GNSM is shown to achieve median relative errors of 4\% for pressure and 6\% for saturation over a test set involving very different plume shapes and dynamics. Speedup is about a factor of $120\times$ relative to high-fidelity simulation. The GNSM is applied for optimization using a differential evolution algorithm, where the goal is to minimize the CO2 footprint subject to constraints on the well configuration, plume location and well BHPs. Optimization results using the GNSM are shown to be comparable to those achieved using (much more expensive) high-fidelity simulation.</description>

      <title>Training Stiff Neural Ordinary Differential Equations with Implicit Single-Step Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stiff systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) are pervasive in many science and engineering fields, yet standard neural ODE approaches struggle to learn them. This limitation is the main barrier to the widespread adoption of neural ODEs. In this paper, we propose an approach based on single-step implicit schemes to enable neural ODEs to handle stiffness and demonstrate that our implicit neural ODE method can learn stiff dynamics. This work addresses a key limitation in current neural ODE methods, paving the way for their use in a wider range of scientific problems.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Alphabet: Deep Signal Embedding for Enhanced DNA Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emerging field of DNA storage employs strands of DNA bases (A/T/C/G) as a storage medium for digital information to enable massive density and durability. The DNA storage pipeline includes: (1) encoding the raw data into sequences of DNA bases; (2) synthesizing the sequences as DNA \textit{strands} that are stored over time as an unordered set; (3) sequencing the DNA strands to generate DNA \textit{reads}; and (4) deducing the original data. The DNA synthesis and sequencing stages each generate several independent error-prone duplicates of each strand which are then utilized in the final stage to reconstruct the best estimate for the original strand. Specifically, the reads are first \textit{clustered} into groups likely originating from the same strand (based on their similarity to each other), and then each group approximates the strand that led to the reads of that group. This work improves the DNA clustering stage by embedding it as part of the DNA sequencing. Traditional DNA storage solutions begin after the DNA sequencing process generates discrete DNA reads (A/T/C/G), yet we identify that there is untapped potential in using the raw signals generated by the Nanopore DNA sequencing machine before they are discretized into bases, a process known as \textit{basecalling}, which is done using a deep neural network. We propose a deep neural network that clusters these signals directly, demonstrating superior accuracy, and reduced computation times compared to current approaches that cluster after basecalling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.13001v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the Conversational Factor Information Retrieval Method (ConFIRM), a novel approach to fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) for domain-specific retrieval tasks. ConFIRM leverages the Five-Factor Model of personality to generate synthetic datasets that accurately reflect target population characteristics, addressing data scarcity in specialized domains. We demonstrate ConFIRM's effectiveness through a case study in the finance sector, fine-tuning a Llama-2-7b model using personality-aligned data from the PolyU-Asklora Fintech Adoption Index. The resulting model achieved 91% accuracy in classifying financial queries, with an average inference time of 0.61 seconds on an NVIDIA A100 GPU. ConFIRM shows promise for creating more accurate and personalized AI-driven information retrieval systems across various domains, potentially mitigating issues of hallucinations and outdated information in LLMs deployed</description>

      <title>AIGB: Generative Auto-bidding via Conditional Diffusion Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16141v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Auto-bidding plays a crucial role in facilitating online advertising by automatically providing bids for advertisers. Reinforcement learning (RL) has gained popularity for auto-bidding. However, most current RL auto-bidding methods are modeled through the Markovian Decision Process (MDP), which assumes the Markovian state transition. This assumption restricts the ability to perform in long horizon scenarios and makes the model unstable when dealing with highly random online advertising environments. To tackle this issue, this paper introduces AI-Generated Bidding (AIGB), a novel paradigm for auto-bidding through generative modeling. In this paradigm, we propose DiffBid, a conditional diffusion modeling approach for bid generation. DiffBid directly models the correlation between the return and the entire trajectory, effectively avoiding error propagation across time steps in long horizons. Additionally, DiffBid offers a versatile approach for generating trajectories that maximize given targets while adhering to specific constraints. Extensive experiments conducted on the real-world dataset and online A/B test on Alibaba advertising platform demonstrate the effectiveness of DiffBid, achieving 2.81% increase in GMV and 3.36% increase in ROI.</description>
