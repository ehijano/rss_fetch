      <title>Highly Sensitive Differential Microwave Sensor Using Enhanced Spiral Resonators for Precision Permittivity Measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a highly sensitive microwave sensor for dielectric sensing. One of the main disadvantages of microwave resonant-based sensors is cross-sensitivity originated by time-dependent uncontrolled environmental factors such as temperature that affect the material under test (MUT) behavior, leading to undesirable frequency shifts and, hence, lower accuracy. However, this work eliminates the unwanted errors using the differential measurement technique by comparing two transmission resonance frequencies during a unit test setup to measure the permittivity of MUT over time. The proposed structure comprises a spiral resonator with an extended horizontal microstrip line (EH-ML) coupled to a microstrip transmission line (MTL). Creating EH-ML within the structure comprises two primary contributions: enhanced sensitivity resulting from stronger fringing fields generated by increasing the effective area and improved resolution due to higher resonance frequencies caused by a lower total capacitive coupling effect. The proposed sensor is fabricated and tested using MUTs with a permittivity of less than 80 to verify the performance. In this regard, a frequency detection resolution (FDR) of 44MHz and a sensitivity of 0.85% are achieved at a maximum permittivity of 78.3. The results of theoretical analysis, simulation, and measurement are in relatively good agreement. Consequently, the proposed highly sensitive microwave sensor offers significant advantages, such as low complexity in design and fabrication. It also offers high resolution and precision in a wide range of permittivity, which can be an attractive candidate for dielectric sensing in health, chemical and agriculture applications.</description>

      <title>Meta-Learning Empowered Graph Neural Networks for Radio Resource Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a radio resource management (RRM) problem in the dynamic wireless networks, comprising multiple communication links that share the same spectrum resource. To achieve high network throughput while ensuring fairness across all links, we formulate a resilient power optimization problem with per-user minimum-rate constraints. We obtain the corresponding Lagrangian dual problem and parameterize all variables with neural networks, which can be trained in an unsupervised manner due to the provably acceptable duality gap. We develop a meta-learning approach with graph neural networks (GNNs) as parameterization that exhibits fast adaptation and scalability to varying network configurations. We formulate the objective of meta-learning by amalgamating the Lagrangian functions of different network configurations and utilize a first-order meta-learning algorithm, called Reptile, to obtain the meta-parameters. Numerical results verify that our method can efficiently improve the overall throughput and ensure the minimum rate performance. We further demonstrate that using the meta-parameters as initialization, our method can achieve fast adaptation to new wireless network configurations and reduce the number of required training data samples.</description>

      <title>Desynchronization Index: a New Approach for Exploring Complex Epileptogenic Networks in Stereoelectroencephalography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) is an invasive surgical procedure to record the electrical activities in cortical brain regions, aiming at identifying the Epileptogenic Zone (EZ) in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. To improve the accuracy of the EZ definition, SEEG analysis can be supported by computational tools, among which the Epileptogenic Index (EI) represents the most common solution. However, the scientific community has still not found an agreement on which quantitative biomarkers can characterize the cortical sites within the EZ. In this work, we design a new algorithm, named Desynchronization Index (DI), to assist neurophysiologists in SEEG interpretation. Our algorithm estimates the effective connectivity between cortical sites and hypothesizes that the EZ is identified by those sites getting abnormally desynchronized from the network during the seizure generation. We test the proposed method over a SEEG dataset of 10 seizures, comparing its accuracy in terms of EZ definition against the EI algorithm and clinical ground truth. Our results indicate that the DI algorithm underscores specific connectivity dynamics that can hardly be identified with a pure visual analysis, increasing sensitivity in detecting epileptogenic cortical sites.</description>

      <title>Phase Optimization and Relay Selection for Joint Relay and IRS-Assisted Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces (IRSs) is considered a potential enabling technology for enhancing the spectral and energy efficiency of beyond 5G communication systems. In this paper, a joint relay and intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-assisted communication is considered to investigate the gains of optimizing both the phase angles and selection of relays. The combination of successive refinement and reinforcement learning is proposed. Successive refinement algorithm is used for phase optimization and reinforcement learning is used for relay selection. Experimental results indicate that the proposed approach offers improved achievable rate performance and scales better with number of relays compared to considered benchmark approaches.</description>

      <title>On Transfer Learning for a Fully Convolutional Deep Neural SIMO Receiver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning has been used to tackle problems in wireless communication including signal detection, channel estimation, traffic prediction, and demapping. Achieving reasonable results with deep learning typically requires large datasets which may be difficult to obtain for every scenario/configuration in wireless communication. Transfer learning (TL) solves this problem by leveraging knowledge and experience gained from one scenario or configuration to adapt a system to a different scenario using smaller dataset. TL has been studied for various stand-alone parts of the radio receiver where individual receiver components, for example, the channel estimator are replaced by a neural network. There has however been no work on TL for receivers where the entire receiver chain is replaced by a neural network. This paper fills this gap by studying the performance of fine-tuning based transfer learning techniques for various configuration mismatch cases using a deep neural single-input-multiple-output(SIMO) receiver. Simulation results show that overall, partial fine-tuning better closes the performance gap between zero target dataset and sufficient target dataset.</description>

      <title>UAV's Rotor Micro-Doppler Feature Extraction Using Integrated Sensing and Communication Signal: Algorithm Design and Testbed Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid application of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in urban areas, the identification and tracking of hovering UAVs have become critical challenges, significantly impacting the safety of aircraft take-off and landing operations. As a promising technology for 6G mobile systems, integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) can be used to detect high-mobility UAVs with a low deployment cost. The micro-Doppler signals from UAV rotors can be leveraged to address the detection of low-mobility and hovering UAVs using ISAC signals. However, determining whether the frame structure of the ISAC system can be used to identify UAVs, and how to accurately capture the weak rotor micro-Doppler signals of UAVs in complex environments, remain two challenging problems. This paper first proposes a novel frame structure for UAV micro-Doppler extraction and the representation of UAV micro-Doppler signals within the channel state information (CSI). Furthermore, to address complex environments and the interference caused by UAV body vibrations, the rotor micro-Doppler null space pursuit (rmD-NSP) algorithm and the feature extraction algorithm synchroextracting transform (SET) are designed to effectively separate UAV's rotor micro-Doppler signals and enhance their features in the spectrogram. Finally, both simulation and hardware testbed demonstrate that the proposed rmD-NSP algorithm enables the ISAC base station (BS) to accurately and completely extract UAV's rotor micro-Doppler signals. Within a 0.1s observation period, ISAC BS successfully captures eight rotations of the DJI M300 RTK UAV's rotor in urban environments. Compared to the existing AM-FM NSP and NSP signal decomposition algorithms, the integrity of the rotor micro-Doppler features is improved by 60%.</description>

      <title>Optimal Weight Scheme for Fusion-Assisted Cooperative Multi-Monostatic Object Localization in 6G Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cooperative multi-monostatic sensing enables accurate positioning of passive targets by combining the sensed environment of multiple base stations (BS). In this work, we propose a novel fusion algorithm that optimally finds the weight to combine the time-of-arrival (ToA) and angle-of-arrival (AoA) likelihood probability density function (PDF) of multiple BSs. In particular, we employ a log-linear pooling function that fuses all BSs' PDFs using a weighted geometric average. We formulated an optimization problem that minimizes the Reverse Kullback Leibler Divergence (RKLD) and proposed an iterative algorithm based on the Monte Carlo importance sampling (MCIS) approach to obtain the optimal fusion weights. Numerical results verify that our proposed fusion scheme with optimal weights outperforms the existing benchmark in terms of positioning accuracy in both unbiased (line-of-sight only) and biased (multipath-rich environment) scenarios.</description>

      <title>Subspace Representation Learning for Sparse Linear Arrays to Localize More Sources than Sensors: A Deep Learning Methodology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Localizing more sources than sensors with a sparse linear array (SLA) has long relied on minimizing a distance between two covariance matrices and recent algorithms often utilize semidefinite programming (SDP). Although deep neural network (DNN)-based methods offer new alternatives, they still depend on covariance matrix fitting. In this paper, we develop a novel methodology that estimates the co-array subspaces from a sample covariance for SLAs. Our methodology trains a DNN to learn signal and noise subspace representations that are invariant to the selection of bases. To learn such representations, we propose loss functions that gauge the separation between the desired and the estimated subspace. In particular, we propose losses that measure the length of the shortest path between subspaces viewed on a union of Grassmannians, and prove that it is possible for a DNN to approximate signal subspaces. The computation of learning subspaces of different dimensions is accelerated by a new batch sampling strategy called consistent rank sampling. The methodology is robust to array imperfections due to its geometry-agnostic and data-driven nature. In addition, we propose a fully end-to-end gridless approach that directly learns angles to study the possibility of bypassing subspace methods. Numerical results show that learning such subspace representations is more beneficial than learning covariances or angles. It outperforms conventional SDP-based methods such as the sparse and parametric approach (SPA) and existing DNN-based covariance reconstruction methods for a wide range of signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), snapshots, and source numbers for both perfect and imperfect arrays.</description>

      <title>Design of stacked intelligent metasurfaces with reconfigurable amplitude and phase for multiuser downlink beamforming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel technology based on stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIM) has recently emerged. This platform involves cascading multiple metasurfaces, each acting as a digitally programmable physical layer within a diffractive neural network. SIM enable the implementation of signal-processing transformations directly in the electromagnetic wave domain, eliminating the need for expensive, high-precision, and power-intensive digital platforms. However, existing studies employing SIM in wireless communication applications rely solely on nearly passive structures that control only the phase of the meta-atoms in each layer. In this study, we propose a SIM-aided downlink multiuser transmission scheme, where the SIM at the base station (BS) end is designed by combining nearly passive layers with phase-only reconfiguration capabilities and active layers integrated with amplifier chips to enable amplitude control. Our optimal design aims at maximizing the sum rate for the best group of users by jointly optimizing the transmit power allocation at the BS and the wave-based beamforming at the SIM. In addition to the standard sum-power constraint at the BS, our optimization framework includes two additional constraints: (i) a per-stream power preserving constraint to prevent propagation losses across the SIM, and (ii) an amplitude constraint to account for power limitations for each active layer. To further reduce the complexity of the optimal beamforming solution, we explore a simple yet suboptimal zero-forcing (ZF) beamforming design, where the wavebased transformation implemented by the SIM is selected to eliminate interference among user streams. Finally, extensive Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that incorporating both nearly passive and active layers within the SIM significantly enhances capacity compared to previously reported phase-only coding SIM.</description>

      <title>Is 9D localization possible with unsynchronized LEO Satellites?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we ask if $9$D localization ($3$D position, $3$D velocity, and $3$D orientation estimation) is possible with the signals received from low earth orbit (LEO) satellites. To answer this question, we define a system model that captures i) the possibility of a time offset between LEOs caused by having cheap synchronization clocks, ii) the possibility of a frequency offset between LEOs, and iii) multiple transmission time slots from a particular LEO. We transform the Fisher information matrix (FIM) for the channel parameters to the FIM for the location parameters and show the possible localization conditions. Subsequently, we derive the FIM for the $9$D localization ($3$D position, $3$D orientation, and $3$D velocity estimation) in terms of the FIM for the $3$D localization. With these derivations, we show that even in the presence of time and frequency offsets between the LEOs, it is possible to perform $9$D localization ($3$D position, $3$D velocity, and $3$D orientation estimation) of a receiver by utilizing the signals from three LEO satellites observed during three transmission time slots received through multiple receive antennas.</description>

      <title>Joint 9D Receiver Localization and Ephemeris Correction with LEO and $5$G Base Stations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we use the Fisher information matrix (FIM) to analyze the interaction between low-earth orbit (LEO) satellites and $5$G base stations in providing $9$D receiver localization and correcting LEO ephemeris. First, we give a channel model that captures all the information in the LEO-receiver, LEO-BS, and BS-receiver links. Subsequently, we use FIM to capture the amount of information about the channel parameters in these links. Then, we transform these FIM for channel parameters to the FIM for the $9$D ($3$D position, $3$D orientation, and $3$D velocity estimation) receiver localization parameters and the LEO position and velocity offset. Closed-form expressions for the entries in the FIM for these location parameters are presented. Our results on identifiability utilizing the FIM for the location parameters indicate: i) with one LEO, we need three BSs and three time slots to both estimate the $9$D location parameters and correct the LEO position and velocity, ii) with two LEO, we need three BSs and three time slots to both estimate the $9$D location parameters and correct the LEO position and velocity, and iii) with three LEO, we need three BSs and four-time slots to both estimate the $9$D location parameters and correct the LEO position and velocity. We notice from the Cramer Rao lower bound that the operating frequency and number of receive antennas have negligible impact on the estimation accuracy of the orientation of the receiver and the LEO velocity, respectively.</description>

      <title>Negative Binomial Matrix Completion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Matrix completion focuses on recovering missing or incomplete information in matrices. This problem arises in various applications, including image processing and network analysis. Previous research proposed Poisson matrix completion for count data with noise that follows a Poisson distribution, which assumes that the mean and variance are equal. Since overdispersed count data, whose variance is greater than the mean, is more likely to occur in realistic settings, we assume that the noise follows the negative binomial (NB) distribution, which can be more general than the Poisson distribution. In this paper, we introduce NB matrix completion by proposing a nuclear-norm regularized model that can be solved by proximal gradient descent. In our experiments, we demonstrate that the NB model outperforms Poisson matrix completion in various noise and missing data settings on real data.</description>

      <title>Variational Mode Decomposition and Linear Embeddings are What You Need For Time-Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time-series forecasting often faces challenges due to data volatility, which can lead to inaccurate predictions. Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) has emerged as a promising technique to mitigate volatility by decomposing data into distinct modes, thereby enhancing forecast accuracy. In this study, we integrate VMD with linear models to develop a robust forecasting framework. Our approach is evaluated on 13 diverse datasets, including ETTm2, WindTurbine, M4, and 10 air quality datasets from various Southeast Asian cities. The effectiveness of the VMD strategy is assessed by comparing Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) values from models utilizing VMD against those without it. Additionally, we benchmark linear-based models against well-known neural network architectures such as LSTM, BLSTM, and RNN. The results demonstrate a significant reduction in RMSE across nearly all models following VMD application. Notably, the Linear + VMD model achieved the lowest average RMSE in univariate forecasting at 0.619. In multivariate forecasting, the DLinear + VMD model consistently outperformed others, attaining the lowest RMSE across all datasets with an average of 0.019. These findings underscore the effectiveness of combining VMD with linear models for superior time-series forecasting.</description>

      <title>Neural Network-Assisted Hybrid Model Based Message Passing for Parametric Holographic MIMO Near Field Channel Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Holographic multiple-input and multiple-output (HMIMO) is a promising technology with the potential to achieve high energy and spectral efficiencies, enhance system capacity and diversity, etc. In this work, we address the challenge of HMIMO near field (NF) channel estimation, which is complicated by the intricate model introduced by the dyadic Green's function. Despite its complexity, the channel model is governed by a limited set of parameters. This makes parametric channel estimation highly attractive, offering substantial performance enhancements and enabling the extraction of valuable sensing parameters, such as user locations, which are particularly beneficial in mobile networks. However, the relationship between these parameters and channel gains is nonlinear and compounded by integration, making the estimation a formidable task. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel neural network (NN) assisted hybrid method. With the assistance of NNs, we first develop a novel hybrid channel model with a significantly simplified expression compared to the original one, thereby enabling parametric channel estimation. Using the readily available training data derived from the original channel model, the NNs in the hybrid channel model can be effectively trained offline. Then, building upon this hybrid channel model, we formulate the parametric channel estimation problem with a probabilistic framework and design a factor graph representation for Bayesian estimation. Leveraging the factor graph representation and unitary approximate message passing (UAMP), we develop an effective message passing-based Bayesian channel estimation algorithm. Extensive simulations demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Double-decker: Productive Backscatter Communication Using a Single Commodity Receiver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Backscatter communication has attracted significant attention for Internet-of-Things applications due to its ultra-low-power consumption. The state-of-the-art backscatter systems no longer require dedicated carrier generators and leverage ambient signals as carriers. However, there is an emerging challenge: most prior systems need dual receivers to capture the original and backscattered signals at the same time for tag data demodulation. This is not conducive to the widespread deployment of backscatter communication. To address this problem, we present double-decker, a novel backscatter system that only requires a single commercial device for backscatter communication. The key technology of double-decker is to divide the carrier OFDM symbols into two parts, which are pilot symbols and data symbols. Pilot symbols can be used as reference signals for tag data demodulation, thus getting rid of the dependence on the dual receiver structure. We have built an FPGA prototype and conducted extensive experiments. Empirical results show that when the excitation signal is 802.11g, double-decker achieves a tag data rate of 35.2kbps and a productive data rate of 38kbps, respectively. The communication range of double-decker is up to 28m in LOS deployment and 24m in NLOS deployment.</description>

      <title>Flexible framework for generating synthetic electrocardiograms and photoplethysmograms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By generating synthetic biosignals, the quantity and variety of health data can be increased. This is especially useful when training machine learning models by enabling data augmentation and introduction of more physiologically plausible variation to the data. For these purposes, we have developed a synthetic biosignal model for two signal modalities, electrocardiography (ECG) and photoplethysmography (PPG). The model produces realistic signals that account for physiological effects such as breathing modulation and changes in heart rate due to physical stress. Arrhythmic signals can be generated with beat intervals extracted from real measurements. The model also includes a flexible approach to adding different kinds of noise and signal artifacts. The noise is generated from power spectral densities extracted from both measured noisy signals and modeled power spectra. Importantly, the model also automatically produces labels for noise, segmentation (e.g. P and T waves, QRS complex, for electrocardiograms), and artifacts. We assessed how this comprehensive model can be used in practice to improve the performance of models trained on ECG or PPG data. For example, we trained an LSTM to detect ECG R-peaks using both real ECG signals from the MIT-BIH arrythmia set and our new generator. The F1 score of the model was 0.83 using real data, in comparison to 0.98 using our generator. In addition, the model can be used for example in signal segmentation, quality detection and bench-marking detection algorithms. The model code has been released in \url{https://github.com/UTU-Health-Research/framework_for_synthetic_biosignals}</description>

      <title>Passenger hazard perception based on EEG signals for highly automated driving vehicles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Enhancing the safety of autonomous vehicles is crucial, especially given recent accidents involving automated systems. As passengers in these vehicles, humans' sensory perception and decision-making can be integrated with autonomous systems to improve safety. This study explores neural mechanisms in passenger-vehicle interactions, leading to the development of a Passenger Cognitive Model (PCM) and the Passenger EEG Decoding Strategy (PEDS). Central to PEDS is a novel Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) that captures spatial and temporal EEG data patterns. The CRNN, combined with stacking algorithms, achieves an accuracy of $85.0\% \pm 3.18\%$. Our findings highlight the predictive power of pre-event EEG data, enhancing the detection of hazardous scenarios and offering a network-driven framework for safer autonomous vehicles.</description>

      <title>ESPARGOS: Phase-Coherent WiFi CSI Datasets for Wireless Sensing Research</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The use of WiFi signals to sense the physical environment is gaining popularity, with some common applications being motion detection and transmitter localization. Standard-compliant WiFi provides a cost effective, easy and backward-compatible approach to Joint Communication and Sensing and enables a seamless transfer of results from experiments to practical applications. However, most WiFi sensing research is conducted on channel state information (CSI) data from current-generation devices, which are usually not meant for sensing applications and thus lack sufficient spatial diversity or phase synchronization. With ESPARGOS, we previously developed a phase-coherent, real-time capable many-antenna WiFi channel sounder specifically for wireless sensing. We describe how we use ESPARGOS to capture large CSI datasets that we make publicly available. The datasets are extensively documented and labeled, for example with information from reference positioning systems, enabling data-driven and machine learning-based research.</description>

      <title>Addressing the Mutual Interference in Uplink ISAC Receivers: A Projection Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dual function radar and communication (DFRC) is a promising research direction within integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), improving hardware and spectrum efficiency by merging sensing and communication (S&amp;C) functionalities into a shared platform. However, the DFRC receiver (DFRC-R) is tasked with both uplink communication signal detection and simultaneously target-related parameter estimation from the echoes, leading to issues with mutual interference. In this paper, a projection-based scheme is proposed to equivalently transform the joint signal detection and target estimation problem into a joint signal detection process across multiple snapshots. Compared with conventional successive interference cancellation (SIC) schemes, our proposed approach achieves a higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and a higher ergodic rate when the radar signal is non-negligible. Nonetheless, it introduces an ill-conditioned signal detection problem, which is addressed using a non-linear detector. By jointly processing an increased number of snapshots, the proposed scheme can achieve high S&amp;C performance simultaneously.</description>

      <title>WavTokenizer: an Efficient Acoustic Discrete Codec Tokenizer for Audio Language Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Language models have been effectively applied to modeling natural signals, such as images, video, speech, and audio. A crucial component of these models is the codec tokenizer, which compresses high-dimensional natural signals into lower-dimensional discrete tokens. In this paper, we introduce WavTokenizer, which offers several advantages over previous SOTA acoustic codec models in the audio domain: 1)extreme compression. By compressing the layers of quantizers and the temporal dimension of the discrete codec, one-second audio of 24kHz sampling rate requires only a single quantizer with 40 or 75 tokens. 2)improved subjective quality. Despite the reduced number of tokens, WavTokenizer achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality with outstanding UTMOS scores and inherently contains richer semantic information. Specifically, we achieve these results by designing a broader VQ space, extended contextual windows, and improved attention networks, as well as introducing a powerful multi-scale discriminator and an inverse Fourier transform structure. We conducted extensive reconstruction experiments in the domains of speech, audio, and music. WavTokenizer exhibited strong performance across various objective and subjective metrics compared to state-of-the-art models. We also tested semantic information, VQ utilization, and adaptability to generative models. Comprehensive ablation studies confirm the necessity of each module in WavTokenizer. The related code, demos, and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/jishengpeng/WavTokenizer.</description>

      <title>An Adaptive Latent Factorization of Tensors Model for Embedding Dynamic Communication Network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Dynamic Communication Network (DCN) describes the interactions over time among various communication nodes, and it is widely used in Big-data applications as a data source. As the number of communication nodes increases and temporal slots accumulate, each node interacts in with only a few nodes in a given temporal slot, the DCN can be represented by an High-Dimensional Sparse (HDS) tensor. In order to extract rich behavioral patterns from an HDS tensor in DCN, this paper proposes an Adaptive Temporal-dependent Tensor low-rank representation (ATT) model. It adopts a three-fold approach: a) designing a temporal-dependent method to reconstruct temporal feature matrix, thereby precisely represent the data by capturing the temporal patterns; b) achieving hyper-parameters adaptation of the model via the Differential Evolutionary Algorithms (DEA) to avoid tedious hyper-parameters tuning; c) employing nonnegative learning schemes for the model parameters to effectively handle an the nonnegativity inherent in HDS data. The experimental results on four real-world DCNs demonstrate that the proposed ATT model significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art models in both prediction errors and convergence rounds.</description>

      <title>Sparse Signal Reconstruction for Overdispersed Low-photon Count Biomedical Imaging Using $\ell_p$ Total Variation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The negative binomial model, which generalizes the Poisson distribution model, can be found in applications involving low-photon signal recovery, including medical imaging. Recent studies have explored several regularization terms for the negative binomial model, such as the $\ell_p$ quasi-norm with $0 &lt; p &lt; 1$, $\ell_1$ norm, and the total variation (TV) quasi-seminorm for promoting sparsity in signal recovery. These penalty terms have been shown to improve image reconstruction outcomes. In this paper, we investigate the $\ell_p$ quasi-seminorm, both isotropic and anisotropic $\ell_p$ TV quasi-seminorms, within the framework of the negative binomial statistical model. This problem can be formulated as an optimization problem, which we solve using a gradient-based approach. We present comparisons between the negative binomial and Poisson statistical models using the $\ell_p$ TV quasi-seminorm as well as common penalty terms. Our experimental results highlight the efficacy of the proposed method.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a novel dataset for multi-robot activity recognition (MRAR) using two robotic arms integrating WiFi channel state information (CSI), video, and audio data. This multimodal dataset utilizes signals of opportunity, leveraging existing WiFi infrastructure to provide detailed indoor environmental sensing without additional sensor deployment. Data were collected using two Franka Emika robotic arms, complemented by three cameras, three WiFi sniffers to collect CSI, and three microphones capturing distinct yet complementary audio data streams. The combination of CSI, visual, and auditory data can enhance robustness and accuracy in MRAR. This comprehensive dataset enables a holistic understanding of robotic environments, facilitating advanced autonomous operations that mimic human-like perception and interaction. By repurposing ubiquitous WiFi signals for environmental sensing, this dataset offers significant potential aiming to advance robotic perception and autonomous systems. It provides a valuable resource for developing sophisticated decision-making and adaptive capabilities in dynamic environments.</description>

      <title>Enhanced forecasting of stock prices based on variational mode decomposition, PatchTST, and adaptive scale-weighted layer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The significant fluctuations in stock index prices in recent years highlight the critical need for accurate forecasting to guide investment and financial strategies. This study introduces a novel composite forecasting framework that integrates variational mode decomposition (VMD), PatchTST, and adaptive scale-weighted layer (ASWL) to address these challenges. Utilizing datasets of four major stock indices--SP500, DJI, SSEC, and FTSE--from 2000 to 2024, the proposed method first decomposes the raw price series into intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) using VMD. Each IMF is then modeled with PatchTST to capture temporal patterns effectively. The ASWL module is applied to incorporate scale information, enhancing prediction accuracy. The final forecast is derived by aggregating predictions from all IMFs. The VMD-PatchTST-ASWL framework demonstrates significant improvements in forecasting accuracy compared to traditional models, showing robust performance across different indices. This innovative approach provides a powerful tool for stock index price forecasting, with potential applications in various financial analysis and investment decision-making contexts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.13011v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel method for inferior myocardial infarction (MI) detection using lead II of electrocardiogram (ECG). We evaluate our proposed method on a public dataset, namely, Physikalisch Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) ECG dataset from Physionet. Under our proposed method, we first clean the noisy ECG signals using db4 wavelet, followed by an R-peak detection algorithm to segment the ECG signals into beats. We then translate the ECG timeseries dataset to an equivalent dataset of gray-scale images using Gramian Angular Summation Field (GASF) and Gramian Angular Difference Field (GADF) operations. Subsequently, the gray-scale images are fed into a custom two-dimensional convolutional neural network (2D-CNN) which efficiently differentiates between a healthy subject and a subject with MI. Our proposed approach achieves an average classification accuracy of 99.68%, 99.80%, 99.82%, and 99.84% under GASF dataset with noise and baseline wander, GADF dataset with noise and baseline wander, GASF dataset with noise and baseline wander removed, and GADF dataset with noise and baseline wander removed, respectively. Most importantly, this work opens the floor for innovation in wearable devices to measure lead II ECG (e.g., by a smart watch worn on right wrist, along with a smart patch on left leg), in order to do accurate, real-time and early detection of inferior wall MI.</description>

Abstract: An indirect Pulse-based Time-of-Flight camera can be modelled as a linear sensing system in which the target's depth is recovered from few measurements through a sensing matrix formed by a set of demodulation functions. Each demodulation function is the result of the convolution of a (0,1)-binary code and a cross-correlation function which models the entire modulation-demodulation process. In this paper, we present a practical scheme for the construction of the sensing matrix which relies on the optimization of the coherence, and is based on low-density codes. We demonstrate that our methodology eliminates the intrinsic variability of random and pseudo-random approaches, and allows for the recovery of the target's depth in a grid much finer than the number of distinct elements in the binary codes.</description>

      <title>The Family of LML Detectors and the Family of LAS Detectors for Massive MIMO Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19709v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The family of local maximum likelihood (LML) detectors, including the global maximum likelihood (GML) detector, and the family of likelihood ascent search (LAS) detectors are akin to each other and possess common properties significant in both theory and practical multi-input multi-output (MIMO) communications. It is proved that a large MIMO channel possesses the LML characteristic, implying and predicting that a local search detector with likelihood ascent, like a wide-sense sequential LAS (WSLAS) detector, can approach the GML detection. By the replica method, the bit error rate (BER) of an LML detector in the large MIMO channel is obtained. The BER indicates that in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime, both the LML and GML detectors achieve the AWGN channel performance when the channel load is as high as up to 1.5086 bits/dimension with an equal-energy distribution, and the channel load can be higher with an unequal-energy distribution. The analytical result is verified by simulation in the equal-energy distribution that the sequential LAS (SLAS) detector, a linear-complexity LML detector, can approach the BER of the NP-hard GML detector. The LML and LAS detectors in the two families are successfully applied to symbol detection in massive antenna MIMO communications and demonstrate the performance near the GML detection. This book chapter reviews the LML and LAS detectors in a unified framework. The focus is on their formulation, relationships, properties, and GML performance in BER and spectral efficiency in large MIMO channels.</description>

      <title>FAST functional connectivity implicates P300 connectivity in working memory deficits in Alzheimer's disease</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18489v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Measuring transient functional connectivity is an important challenge in Electroencephalogram (EEG) research. Here, the rich potential for insightful, discriminative information of brain activity offered by high temporal resolution is confounded by the inherent noise of the medium and the spurious nature of correlations computed over short temporal windows. We propose a novel methodology to overcome these problems called Filter Average Short-Term (FAST) functional connectivity. First, long-term, stable, functional connectivity is averaged across an entire study cohort for a given pair of Visual Short Term Memory (VSTM) tasks. The resulting average connectivity matrix, containing information on the strongest general connections for the tasks, is used as a filter to analyse the transient high temporal resolution functional connectivity of individual subjects. In simulations, we show that this method accurately discriminates differences in noisy Event-Related Potentials (ERPs) between two conditions where standard connectivity and other comparable methods fail. We then apply this to analyse activity related to visual short-term memory binding deficits in two cohorts of familial and sporadic Alzheimer's disease. Reproducible significant differences were found in the binding task with no significant difference in the shape task in the P300 ERP range. This allows new sensitive measurements of transient functional connectivity, which can be implemented to obtain results of clinical significance.</description>

      <title>Massive Digital Over-the-Air Computation for Communication-Efficient Federated Edge Learning</title>

Abstract: Over-the-air computation (AirComp) is a promising technology converging communication and computation over wireless networks, which can be particularly effective in model training, inference, and more emerging edge intelligence applications. AirComp relies on uncoded transmission of individual signals, which are added naturally over the multiple access channel thanks to the superposition property of the wireless medium. Despite significantly improved communication efficiency, how to accommodate AirComp in the existing and future digital communication networks, that are based on discrete modulation schemes, remains a challenge. This paper proposes a massive digital AirComp (MD-AirComp) scheme, that leverages an unsourced massive access protocol, to enhance compatibility with both current and next-generation wireless networks. MD-AirComp utilizes vector quantization to reduce the uplink communication overhead, and employs shared quantization and modulation codebooks. At the receiver, we propose a near-optimal approximate message passing-based algorithm to compute the model aggregation results from the superposed sequences, which relies on estimating the number of devices transmitting each code sequence, rather than trying to decode the messages of individual transmitters. We apply MD-AirComp to the federated edge learning (FEEL), and show that it significantly accelerates FEEL convergence compared to state-of-the-art while using the same amount of communication resources. To support further research and ensure reproducibility, we have made our code available at https://github.com/liqiao19/MD-AirComp.</description>

      <title>Movable Antennas Meet Intelligent Reflecting Surface: When Do We Need Movable Antennas?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15668v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) and movable antenna (MA)/fluid antenna (FA) techniques have both received increasing attention in the realm of wireless communications due to their ability to reconfigure and improve wireless channel conditions. In this paper, we investigate the integration of MAs/FAs into an IRS-assisted wireless communication system. In particular, we consider the downlink transmission from a multi-MA base station (BS) to a single-antenna user with the aid of an IRS, aiming to maximize the user's received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), by jointly optimizing the BS/IRS active/passive beamforming and the MAs' positions. Due to the similar capability of MAs and IRS for channel reconfiguration, we first conduct theoretical analysis of the performance gain of MAs over conventional fixed-position antennas (FPAs) under the line-of-sight (LoS) BS-IRS channel and derive the conditions under which the performance gain becomes more or less significant. Next, to solve the received SNR maximization problem, we propose an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm that decomposes it into two subproblems and solve them alternately. Numerical results are provided to validate our analytical results and evaluate the performance gains of MAs over FPAs under different setups.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Based Speckle Filtering for Polarimetric SAR Images. Application to Sentinel-1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15678v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Speckle suppression in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images is a key processing step which continues to be a research topic. A wide variety of methods, using either spatially-based approaches or transform-based strategies, have been developed and have shown to provide outstanding results. However, recent advances in deep learning techniques and their application to SAR image despeckling have been demonstrated to offer state-of-the-art results. Unfortunately, they have been mostly applied to single-polarimetric images. The extension of a deep learning-based approach for speckle removal to polarimetric SAR (PolSAR) images is complicated because of the complex nature of the measured covariance matrices for every image pixel, the properties of which must be preserved during filtering. In this work, we propose a complete framework to remove speckle in polarimetric SAR images using a convolutional neural network. The methodology includes a reversible transformation of the original complex covariance matrix to obtain a set of real-valued intensity bands which are fed to the neural network. In addition, the proposed method includes a change detection strategy to avoid the neural network to learn erroneous features in areas strongly affected by temporal changes, so that the network only learns the underlying speckle component present in the data. The method is implemented and tested with dual-polarimetric images acquired by Sentinel-1. Experiments show that the proposed approach offers exceptional results in both speckle reduction and resolution preservation. More importantly, it is also shown that the neural network is not generating artifacts or introducing bias in the filtered images, making them suitable for further polarimetric processing and exploitation.</description>
