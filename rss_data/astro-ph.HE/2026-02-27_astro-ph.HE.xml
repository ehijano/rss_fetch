      <title>A steadily declining dispersion measure for the repeating fast radio burst FRB 20220529A: Evidence for an FRB engine embedded in an expanding supernova remnant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the discovery and subsequent 3.2 year monitoring campaign of the repeating fast radio burst FRB 20220529A with CHIME/FRB. We observe a gradual dispersion measure (DM) decline of $-0.881\pm0.001~\mathrm{pc}~\mathrm{cm}^{-3}~\mathrm{year}^{-1}$ ($-1.235\pm0.001~\mathrm{pc}~\mathrm{cm}^{-3}~\mathrm{year}^{-1}$ in the rest frame), implying a $\geq3.5\pm0.2$% decrease of the total electron column in the source environment, and we see scattering timescale variations over weeks to years. We observe a short-lived excursion in which the DM rises by $\sim 1~\mathrm{pc}~\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$, immediately preceding a transient $\sim 2000~\mathrm{rad}~\mathrm{m}^{-2}$ Faraday rotation measure (RM) increase previously reported for this source, before returning to its gradual DM decline. We identify a local line-of-sight magnetic field around FRB 20220529A during this DM/RM excursion of $3.4 \pm 0.2~\mathrm{mG}$, corresponding to one of the most strongly magnetized FRB environments. We measure a decrease in the linear polarization fraction of FRB 20220529A bursts with decreasing frequency that we attribute to depolarization from multi-path propagation in the source environment. We also place a $5\sigma$ upper limit on the spectral luminosity of an associated persistent radio source of $\leq 5\times10^{28}~\mathrm{erg}~\mathrm{s}^{-1}~\mathrm{Hz}^{-1}$ at 1.5 GHz. These observations are consistent with FRB 20220529A originating from a young ($\sim$ years to centuries old) expanding supernova remnant, with short-lived DM and RM variability arising from interactions with the supernova remnant or with a binary companion.</description>

      <title>XRISM Observation of the Supernova Remnant N103B: Velocity Structure and Thermal Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first analysis of the X-ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission (XRISM) observation of the supernova remnant (SNR) N103B. We fit the X-ray spectrum taken with the Resolve microcalorimeter, which captured emission lines from the predominantly ejecta elements Si, S, Ar, Ca, Cr, Mn, and Fe. Notably, our fits require a previously unidentified high-temperature, highly-ionized, Fe-dominated plasma component with particularly high Cr and Mn abundances, matching a feature also present in the recent XRISM analysis of the SNR N132D. We find that all ejecta in N103B exhibits significant line broadening arising mostly from thermal Doppler broadening: increasing from $\sigma_{\rm th}\sim1700$ km s$^{-1}$ for intermediate-mass element (IME: Si, S, Ar, and Ca) ejecta to $\sim$2800 km s$^{-1}$ for Fe-rich ejecta. These velocities correspond to reverse shock velocities of $\sim$3500 and $\sim$5900 km s$^{-1}$, respectively, in the ejecta frame of rest. Finally, we find that the IMEs are redshifted with a bulk velocity of $\sim$360 km s$^{-1}$ while the Fe-dominated components are split: one redshifted at $\sim$1560 km s$^{-1}$ and the other blueshifted at $\sim$1020 km s$^{-1}$. Our results provide further support for the double-ring structure of N103B as it expands into the bipolar winds of a non-degenerate companion and highlight the strength of high-resolution spectroscopic observations of SNRs.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the X-ray properties of the eclipsing Cataclysmic Variable UU Aqr: spatially and spectrally-resolved two-component emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-magnetic Cataclysmic Variables (CVs) show two distinct X-ray components: a hard, optically thin component and a soft, optically thick, blackbody-like component, both produced in the boundary layer between the accretion disk and the White Dwarf (WD). An additional soft component originating from a more extended region has been reported in few CVs. In a short Chandra exposure, we identified a tentative X-ray eclipse in UU Aqr, a non-magnetic CV which shows deep optical eclipses. Using observations with the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR) and the XMM-Newton, we detect total eclipses in the orbital intensity profiles of this system in the hard X-ray band (3-10 keV with XMM and 3-25 keV with NuSTAR). However, the soft X-ray band (0.3-2.0 keV) shows no evidence of an eclipse. Detailed eclipse modeling, energy-resolved power spectral analysis and broadband spectral modeling indicate that the hard absorbed X-ray emission originates from a compact region near the WD, such as a boundary layer, while the soft, unabsorbed and un-eclipsed X-ray emission originates in an extended region. Neither scattering of hard X-rays nor colliding winds can account for the observed un-eclipsed soft emission. We instead propose that this component is produced by shocks within vertically extended, radiatively driven accretion-disk winds. We also provide new estimates on the emitting regions, mass and radius of the WD and the donor star using eclipse modeling.</description>

      <title>ZTF Monitoring of $\gamma-$ray emitting Narrow Line Seyfert 1 Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $\gamma$-ray-emitting narrow-line Seyfert-I ($\gamma$-NLSy1) are among the most interesting systems for studying disk-jet coupling. The soft X-ray properties of these systems suggest the presence of a disc component, which peaks in the optical/UV regime, in addition to the active jet. In this work, we investigate the optical emission from $\gamma$-NLSy1 using long-term Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) observations and discussed in the context of blazars. We have reported the long-term flux and color variability in the g- and r-bands. The fractional variability ($F_{\rm var}$) goes as high as 72\%, with a mean value of 23\%, while the amplitude of variability ($\psi$) values range from 0.24 to 3.20, which is consistent with the long-term Swift-UVOT variability studies. The color-magnitude diagrams exhibit an RWB or BWB trend similar to that of blazars. The $t_{\rm var}$ suggests an emitting region size of $10^{15-17}$ cm, aligned with emissions coming from the inner accretion disk or base of the jet. The PSD analysis using both DRW and CARMA modeling exhibits a characteristic break timescale of a few days to hundreds of days, which is likely linked to fundamental physical timescales in the system, such as thermal or viscous timescales in the accretion disk or timescales for acceleration and energy dissipation in the jet. The existence of these timescales acts as another signature of the disc-jet connection. These time scales are correlated with black hole mass, and the relation is consistent with previous studies.</description>

      <title>High Spectral Resolution X-ray Observations of the Evolved Supermassive Stellar Binary System $\eta$ Carinae - Iron K$\alpha$ Band Profile Revealed with XRISM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The supermassive binary system, $\eta$ Carinae, is experiencing enormous wind-driven mass loss at a rate unparalleled in the rest of the Galaxy. Their wind-wind collision (WWC) continuously produces shock heated, X-ray emitting plasmas. The XRISM X-ray observatory observed the system in 2023 and 2024 when the X-ray emission began to increase toward periastron passage in 2025. This manuscript reports unprecedentedly high-resolution X-ray spectra in the iron K$\alpha$ band between 6.2 and 7.1 keV, obtained with the Resolve X-ray microcalorimeter. The hydrogen-like (Ly$\alpha$) and helium-like (He$\alpha$) lines reveal three velocity components. Two of them are broadened with maximum velocities of 2000-3000 km/s, likely originating from the post-shock companion wind. The other is relatively narrow, with a Gaussian broadening of only ~290 km/s in 1 sigma, which may originate from the post-shock companion wind at the WWC stagnation point or penetrating the primary wind. The iron fluorescent lines exhibit a moderate blueshift and broadening with velocities at 100-200 km/s, consistent with the primary wind's velocity field. The spectra also confirm a Compton shoulder of the He$\alpha$ line complex for the first time. Both fluorescing and scattering spectral profiles indicate that the binary system is seen from the companion side during these observations. The flux ratio of the Compton scattering emission to the fluorescent line suggests substantial hydrogen depletion of the primary wind, expected from CNO-cycled hydrogen nuclear fusion gas.</description>

      <title>Accretion-modified Stars in Accretion Disks of Active Galactic Nuclei: Contribution to AGN disk viscosity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is widely believed that stellar-mass black holes (sMBHs) exist within the accretion disks of active galactic nuclei (AGN), forming a distinct population termed ``accretion-modified star" (AMS). Gas from the dense disk accretes onto these AMSs, dissipating substantial gravitational energy through a mini-disk around the sMBHs, which drives powerful outflows that interact with the surrounding disk gas. In this study, we investigate two scenarios for AMS accretion: episodic Bondi explosions with hyper-Eddington accretion (Scenario A) and steady Eddington accretion (Scenario B). These outflows generate turbulence, facilitating outward angular momentum transport in the AGN disk via shock interactions and angular momentum exchange. We explore a broad parameter space-spanning the central supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass ($M_{\rm p}$), dimensionless accretion rate ($\dot{\mathscr{M}}_{\rm p}$), sMBH mass function, and spatial distribution-to calculate the effective viscosity parameter $\alpha_{\rm AMS}$. Our analysis reveals the scaling relations $\alpha_{\rm AMS}\propto\zeta M_{\rm p}^2\dot{\mathscr{M}}_{\rm p}$ for Scenario A and $\alpha_{\rm AMS}\propto\zeta M_{\rm p}^{1.5}\dot{\mathscr{M}}_{\rm p}^{0.1}$ for Scenario B, where $\zeta$ denotes the ratio of total sMBH mass to the SMBH disk mass. For $\zeta={0.01}$ and $M_{\rm p}=10^8 M_\odot$, $\alpha_{\rm AMS}$ ranges from $\sim{3\times10^{-4}}$ to ${0.01}$ (Scenario A) and $\sim{3\times10^{-3}}$ to ${0.04}$ (Scenario B) from the inner to outer disk regions. These results demonstrate that AMS feedback provides an efficient mechanism for angular momentum transport in AGN disks.</description>

      <title>Universality in Space Time $\omega$ modes of Quarkyonic Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gravitational wave $\omega$ mode spectrum presents a unique window into the dense interior of neutron stars, probing physics inaccessible to electromagnetic observations. This work investigates the $\omega$ modes of compact stars composed of quarkyonic matter. The quarkyonic model, which describes a cross-over transition between nucleonic and quark matter treated as quasi-particles, is formulated within the Relativistic Mean-Field (RMF) theory using the G3 and IOPB-I parameterizations. This core is surrounded by a mantle of hadronic matter, creating a multicomponent stellar interior. The overall Equation of State (EOS) is governed by two key parameters: the transition density ($n_t$), the QCD confinement scale ($\Lambda_{\rm cs}$), which are varied to construct models consistent with current astrophysical constraints on mass and radius. We compute the complex eigenfrequencies (damped oscillations) of the fundamental and first excited $\omega$ modes using the phase-amplitude method within a full general relativistic framework. Our simulations reveal that the admixed quarkyonic structure produces a unique $\omega$ mode signature, distinctly different from pure hadronic or hybrid stars. The spectrum exhibits a strong, degenerate dependence on the EOS, where the stiffening effect of the quarkyonic matter influences oscillation frequencies and damping times in a characteristic manner. We also demonstrate that $\omega$ mode frequencies for quarkyonic stars follow approximate universal relations, largely independent of the EOS.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Tidal Dissipation and the Gravitational-wave Signal of a White Dwarf Orbiting an Intermediate-Mass Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finding intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) and measuring their masses and spins are key to understanding massive black hole formation. White dwarf (WD)-IMBH binaries provide a unique probe because they emit both electromagnetic radiation and gravitational waves (GWs), thereby conveying richer information. However, such multi-messenger sources often enter the regime of strong gravity, where existing models fail to capture their relativistic dynamics. Here, we develop a fully relativistic model for the tidal response of a WD close to an IMBH and use it to study the secular orbital evolution as well as the GW signal. We find that for IMBHs more massive than 10^5 solar masses, tidal interaction becomes relativistic and sensitive to IMBH spin. The interaction generally dissipates binary orbital energy and angular momentum, but due to relativistic frame rotation, which reduces phase coherence across pericenter passages, the orbit-averaged tidal dissipation rate can be suppressed by up to about 50% relative to Newtonian predictions. Including tidal dissipation leads to more rapid damping of the orbital eccentricity, to the extent that the pericenter distance may even increase over time, potentially explaining quasi-periodic eruptions and secular orbital period growth. Such tidal effects accumulate into measurable phase and amplitude deviations in the GW signal. For typical space-based observations, the GW waveform mismatch can reach values of order 0.1 within 6 months. Our results indicate that relativistic tidal dissipation is both dynamically important and observationally essential for reliably predicting the multi-messenger signals of WD-IMBH systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.22753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are brief flashes of emission detectable to cosmological distances. Cosmology applications rely on an understanding of how the detected sample relates to the underlying population. To this end we examine the dispersion measure `tolerance' parameter employed by the FRB search tool \textsc{heimdall} and provide the relation between this and minimum search depth. Several FRB samples can be `retro-fitted' using this to more properly account for survey completeness.</description>

      <title>Black hole Limits Redefined: Extreme Efficiency in Black Hole Jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relativistic jets from black holes can extract energy not only from accretion but also directly from the black hole's spin, as described by the Blandford-Znajek mechanism. A longstanding question is whether magnetic flux can accumulate near the event horizon to such an extent that it halts accretion entirely, enabling energy extraction purely from spin. Previous studies have shown that accretion persists through instabilities and that jet power only modestly exceeds the accretion energy budget, yet some observational results suggest much higher efficiencies. Here we present state-of-the-art general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations that sustain a quasi-steady magnetically arrested disk state for approximately 10,000 dynamical times, during which accretion is globally suppressed across the full azimuthal extent. In this regime, jet power exceeds the accretion energy input by more than two orders of magnitude, demonstrating a previously unachieved level of efficiency. These results challenge conventional assumptions about the limits of black hole energy extraction and suggest a new framework for interpreting powerful jet systems. Our findings raise important questions about the long-term stability of such states and the fundamental limits of the Blandford-Znajek process.</description>

      <title>The MARTINI Platform (I): Se I-X atomic calculation and expansion opacity for early-stage kilonova spectral analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kilonovae represent key sites of r-process nucleosynthesis, making opacity estimation and spectral analysis crucial for constraining their composition. Since light r-process elements shape the early ($\sim$0.5-1.5$\mathrm{d}$) ejecta opacity, a detailed study of the selenium element with a focus on atomic data calculation, expansion opacity estimation and spectral analysis is presented. Se atomic data are calculated from Se I to Se X using the GRASP2018 code. A systematic analysis and evaluation of their precision is performed through detailed comparison with the NIST ASD, and other works available in the literature. These atomic data are then used to estimate expansion opacity at different temperatures (e.g., T=5000 K, 10000 K, 20000 K, 100000 K) and densities (e.g., $\rho = 10^{-13}\,\mathrm{g\,cm^{-3}},\,3\times10^{-12}\,\mathrm{g\,cm^{-3}}$). Spectral analysis has been performed with radiative transfer code POSSIS with a pre-computed opacity grid calculated with new densities and temperatures, ranging from -19.5 to -4.5 $\mathrm{g\,cm^{-3}}$ in log-scale and from 1 000 to 51 000 K, respectively. Two scenarios are considered: one in which the opacity contribution comes from 100\% Se ejecta, and another in which Se contributes only partially to the total opacity ($\sim$ 10\% of the total mass). Se atomic calculations show a good agreement with NIST ASD, with accurate energy levels and transitions determined alongside atomic data for higher ionisation stages not fully covered by NIST. The expansion opacities calculated with these new Se data exhibit differences in comparison to existing literature works. Se spectral features can only be observed in the KN scenario consisting of 100\% Se. When Se accounts for about 10\% of the total KN mass, these features become undetectable. All Se results are now available in the new open-source MARTINI platform dedicated to element nucleosynthesis.</description>

      <title>Pulse-resolved Classification and Characteristics of Long-duration GRBs with \emph{Swift}-BAT Data.II. Main Burst versus Extended Emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) frequently exhibit complex prompt emission structures with multiple temporally distinct episodes, such as a main emission (ME) phase followed by a weak extended emission (EE) tail. Whether these subcomponents from a common physical origin with similar classification properties, or instead represent fundamentally different emission mechanisms within a single event, remains an open question. Here, we present a systematic, pulse-resolved analysis of 22 \emph{Swift}/BAT long-duration GRBs, each exhibiting a well-separated, bright ME ($G_1$) followed by a fainter EE ($G_2$) after a background-consistent quiescent gap. For each component, we independently measure standard classification diagnostics, including duration ($T_{90}$), spectral hardness ratio (HR), minimum variability timescale (MVT), and spectral lag. We then compare these properties between the ME and EE within individual bursts. We find that the EE is systematically softer (lower HR in 19 of 22 events), smoother (longer MVT in 17 of 22 events), and more diverse in spectral lag than the ME. However, both components still occupy the long-GRB track in the traditional duration-hardness and duration-MVT planes, indicating a common Type~II (collapsar) origin. These results suggest that the EE in long GRBs represents a physically distinct regime of the central engine, characterized by a lower luminosity, longer emission timescales, and evolved spectral properties, rather than a simple continuation of the main burst. This picture is consistent with late-time fallback accretion onto a black hole or proto-magnetar spin-down.</description>

      <title>The Evolution of Nulling in Pulsars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nulling is a phenomenon where the emission from a pulsar becomes undetectable (or significantly weaker) for a relatively short period of time, followed by a return to a normal emission state. The timescale of nulling ranges from a few pulse periods to many hours or even days. The fraction of time a nulling pulsar spends in a null state varies across the population of canonical pulsars, from 0 to 95 per cent. The long-term behaviour of a pulsar's nulling fraction, however, is currently unknown, as published values have typically been obtained through single observations. Here, we present the first long-term analysis of nulling behaviour in eight pulsars observed in the Parkes Multibeam Pulsar Survey over the course of eight to ten years. We also apply a new Bayesian method for pulse-energy analysis, yielding posterior estimates of the nulling fraction per observation. In several cases, the nulling affects only specific components of the pulse profile, rather than the entirety of the emission. Our analysis reveals that, while most pulsars show no significant trend in their nulling fraction over time, a subset exhibit some evidence for non-zero gradients in nulling fraction. In particular, PSRs J1048$-$3832, J1745$-$3040, and J1825$-$0935 show statistically significant trends over the span of the data. Studying the behaviour of nulling over years and decades is valuable as it can provide insights into the physical emission processes within pulsars. Studying how nulling evolves also provides valuable insights into pulsar evolution and the characterisation of the broader pulsar population.</description>

      <title>Energy Deposition by Galactic Cosmic Rays and Implications for Ozone Chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a Monte Carlo study of galactic cosmic-ray (GCR) energy deposition and its implications for stratospheric chemistry, performed with the Geant4 toolkit. Primary nuclei (protons, $\alpha$, CNO, and Si) were propagated through an atmosphere modeled from 0 to 120~g~cm$^{-2}$, considering both Polar ($R_{\mathrm{c}}=0.1$~GV) and Equatorial ($R_{\mathrm{c}}=15$~GV) geomagnetic cutoff conditions. The simulations resolve the variation of energy deposition with altitude for primary and secondary particles, revealing that $\sim$~96\% of the stratospheric energy budget arises from cascade secondaries within the 15--35~km domain. By converting layer-resolved energy deposition into ion pair production rates, we quantify the resulting formation of odd nitrogen (NO$_{\rm x}$) and odd hydrogen (HO$_{\rm x}$) radicals, which catalyze the destruction of ozone. The modeled production rates peak between 18 and 22~km altitude, leading to an estimated fractional ozone decrease of order $10^{-3}$--$10^{-2}$ under average GCR fluxes, consistent with observed background modulation over the solar cycle. These results establish a physically consistent link between cosmic-ray induced energy deposition and ozone chemistry, providing a benchmark framework for coupling high-energy particle transport to atmospheric photochemical models.</description>

      <title>Tight bounds on the Mawell-Carroll-Field-Jackiw parameters using Fast Radio Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate {the arrival time and the Faraday rotation} of extragalactic electromagnetic signals from fast radio bursts (FRBs) propagating through chiral cosmic media within the framework of Maxwell-Carroll-Field-Jackiw {(MCFJ)} electrodynamics. By treating the interstellar medium as a cold, ionized chiral plasma, {we derive} the time delay between two traveling signals, expressing it in terms of modified dispersion measures (DMs) {containing chiral contributions}. {The Faraday rotation angle is then} written in terms of modified rotation measures (RMs). By combining the DMs and redshift data from a set of FRBs, {we obtain} constraints on the chiral parameter magnitude at the order of $10^{-26}$--$10^{-24}$ GeV. {Using the Faraday} rotation formulae and RM measurements, {upper bounds as stringent as $10^{-43}$ GeV on the MCFJ parameters are also obtained.}</description>

      <title>The extremely low-luminosity Type Iax SNe 2022ywf and 2023zgx</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the optical follow-up of SNe 2022ywf and 2023zgx, two examples from the Iax subclass of thermonuclear supernova (SN) events. With peak absolute magnitudes of $M_\mathrm{V} = -13.7$ and $-14.4$ mag, respectively, both objects belong to the extremely low-luminosity (EL) population of the class. A common origin of SNe in the Iax subclass is still under debate since the distribution of certain observables may indicate that the extremely low-luminosity explosions form a distinct population. We aim to estimate the physical properties of the two EL objects, including mapping the ejecta structure. We perform spectral tomography on the spectral series of SNe 2022ywf and 2023zgx around their maxima to map the physical properties of the ejecta. Together with the analysis of BgVriz photometry, a wide range of observables can be studied to investigate their distribution against luminosity. The constrained chemical abundances of the ejecta are compared to the predictions of the hydrodynamic simulations with similar peak luminosities. Constant abundances provide a good match for the distribution of chemical elements for both SNe 2022ywf and 2023zgx. The discrepancies compared to the least luminous pure deflagration model N5def_hybrid are minor, especially at post-maximum epochs. The two SNe also share similar characteristics in their constrained density structures, as well as the evolution of the photosphere. The analysis supports the assumption that pure deflagration models can reproduce the main characteristics of SNe Iax, even for the EL population. The presented indirect observational evidence indicates that these objects show similar intrinsic properties to the relatively luminous Iax sample and fit into the velocity distribution of the subclass.</description>

      <title>A Lorentz-Covariant Spectral Universality of Stochastic Fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.23195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a Lorentz-covariant spectral universality for stationary stochastic fields in Minkowski spacetime. We show that no covariant local mapping can relate temporal and spatial power spectra in more than one spatial dimension. For Lorentz homogeneous spectra, the temporal index is symmetry protected, observer invariant, and offset from the spatial index by a universal geometric factor set by effective momentum space dimensionality. We show how spectral universality breaks down for anisotropic scaling and dispersion dominated spectra, establishing the necessity of a Lorentz-covariant formulation of relativistic spectral inference.</description>

      <title>The Axion-Photon Mixing and the Extragalactic Magnetic Background: Plateau Regimes, Resonances, and Non-Gaussian Boosts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analytical treatment of Axion-Like-Particle (ALP)--photon mixing with extragalactic background light (EBL) attenuation for constant, Gaussian-stochastic, and non-Gaussian magnetic field configurations--with direct implications for Very High Energy (VHE) gamma-ray observations such as LHAASO, HAWC, and CTA experiments. For constant fields, we derive exact probabilities and identify a perturbative plateau regime where photon survival scales as quartic order of magnetic field, isolating the four-point magnetic correlation as a sensitive probe of non-Gaussianity. For Gaussian stochastic fields, we obtain--for the first time--analytical formulas for non-exponential-decay components in the strong-attenuation regime. Contrary to the widely used domain-like model, photon survival is suppressed by 4-6 orders of magnitude, while both conversion and survival probabilities exhibit distinct multi-peak structures from mass-equal resonance, stochastic resonance, and EBL attenuation. Extending to non-Gaussian fields, we show that non-Gaussianity can enhance photon survival by several orders of magnitude relative to the Gaussian case, potentially explaining the unexpectedly VHE photon event observed by LHAASO. Our results demonstrate that stochastic magnetic fields cannot be reduced to domain-like coherence without losing essential physics, and that VHE gamma-ray spectra encode observable information about both the power spectrum and non-Gaussian structure of intergalactic magnetic fields--critical as next-generation observatories push toward PeV sensitivities.</description>

      <title>Variability of the X-ray obscuring wind in Mrk 335 with XMM-Newton/RGS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transient X-ray obscuration in Seyfert 1 galaxies is thought to arise from clumpy accretion-disk winds near the broad-line region (BLR), but the wind structure and its short-timescale variability are difficult to measure because high-resolution spectra are often suppressed during deep low states. We analyse a coordinated XMM-Newton/NuSTAR campaign on Mrk 335 in June 2021, complemented by long-term Swift monitoring, which captured the source in an intermediate-flux state that preserves strong RGS absorption features. We first model the broadband spectral energy distribution to determine the ionising continuum and then perform self-consistent photoionisation modelling of the RGS spectra. The stacked RGS spectrum requires three photoionised absorbers with time-averaged log xi approx 3.63, 3.10, and 2.01 and outflow velocities |v_out| approx 5820, 3210, and 2140 km/s. Their properties are broadly consistent with the three-phase obscurer reported in the 2009 intermediate state, indicating recurring multi-phase obscuration over decade timescales. Using five consecutive RGS observations, we track the wind evolution on day timescales and find strong variability in column density and ionisation in all phases, together with smaller but coherent changes in outflow velocity. During a flare, the low-ionisation phase shows an extreme drop in N_H, and the subsequent epoch exhibits an increase in outflow velocity in all phases, consistent with rapid restructuring and possible radiative acceleration in a clumpy wind. The high-ionisation phase responds most directly to changes in the ionising luminosity, while the lowest-ionisation phase shows at most a delayed response. Order-of-magnitude constraints place the obscurer at BLR scales (approx 10^3-10^5 R_g), and simple continuity arguments suggest kinetic power that can reach the percent level of L_bol for plausible estimates of geometry and clumpiness.</description>

      <title>A White Dwarf Tidal Disruption by an Intermediate-Mass Black Hole as the Progenitor of Ultra-long GRB 250702B</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent detection of GRB 250702B, the longest gamma-ray burst observed to date with prompt emission lasting $\sim 2.5\times 10^4$ seconds, challenges the conventional collapsar model. Its remarkable features--including an extraordinary X-ray flare at $\sim 1.3$ days post-detection, a late-time transition from steep to shallow decay in the X-ray afterglow, and hard spectra extending from keV to MeV energies--point to a novel progenitor. Here we show that these multiwavelength signatures can be consistently explained by a relativistic jet powered by successive partial tidal disruptions of a white dwarf (WD) by an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH). By modeling the time-dependent accretion rate from repeated partial disruptions and the resulting jet evolution, we show that the external forward and reverse shocks account for the long-term X-ray, near-infrared, and radio afterglow, whereas the luminous X-ray flare originates from internal energy dissipation caused by collisions between fast and slow relativistic ejecta associated with the final complete disruption. Our findings establish IMBH-WD tidal disruption events as a viable engine for ultra-long GRBs.</description>

      <title>A precessing jet from a supermassive black hole: multi-wavelength observations of S5 1044+71</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The bright gamma-ray blazar S5 1044+71 has been identified as showing very significant quasi-periodic oscillations in the Fermi-LAT data in recent studies, with a periodicity of about 3 years. With the completion of a new gamma-ray cycle, we aim to revisit the periodicity in Fermi-LAT data, and analyze all available multi-wavelength (MWL) data to search for possible correlations and time-lags. These observations will be used to test for the compatibility of the observed periodicity with a precessing jet from the supermassive black hole. We analyze data from Fermi-LAT, NuSTAR, Swift, AstroSat, ASAS-SN, ZTF, Pan-STARRS, and NEOWISE. In addition we present an analysis from historical observations from Palomar and Pulkovo. Single-band spectral variability, MWL correlations, and cross-correlations are computed. We then model the Fermi-LAT light curve with a precessing jet model, providing constraints on the geometry of the system and providing the evolution of the Doppler factor with time. The latter is used as input for MWL fitting of the spectral energy distribution. We confirm previous claims on the existence of a periodic gamma-ray signal. We detect significant spectral variability in gamma-ray, X-rays, and optical/UV data. We detect significant correlation between low-energy (infrared/optical/ultraviolet) data and gamma-rays, with a correlation index of about 1; the correlation between X-rays and gamma-ray is milder, with a correlation index of about 0.3. We do not detect any significant time-lag between bands. The Fermi-LAT light curve is successfully fit by a precessing jet model. The fit to the spectral energy distributions indicate that S5 1044+71 is a typical blazar, in which the gamma-ray emission is located beyond the broad-line region. All MWL observations we present in this work are consistent with the existence of a precessing relativistic jet from the supermassive black hole.</description>

      <title>Conformal symmetry in force-free electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is shown that conformal symmetry exists in force-free electrodynamics (FFE) in Minkowski spacetime, a foundational framework for describing magnetospheres around astronomical objects. In force-free magnetospheres, charges are constrained to move along magnetic field lines and experience zero Lorentz force, due to the everywhere perpendicular orientation of electric and magnetic fields. However, a general angle-preserving conformal mapping of force-free fields does not necessarily produce another physically admissible force-free configuration when sources are present. In this work, we demonstrate that such invariance can nevertheless arise for certain choices of the free functions. Specifically, the governing stream equation is shown to be invariant under M\"obius transformations. This symmetry reveals a structural linkage between known solutions and, notably, maps the region inside a magnetospheric horizon (the lightsurface) of one solution to the exterior of its dual counterpart, and vice versa.</description>

      <title>You can't see me: super-Eddington growth hindering X-ray detection in high-z broad-line AGNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit black hole mass estimates for high-redshift broad-line AGNs discovered with JWST by jointly analysing their broad emission lines and their systematic non-detections in deep Chandra imaging. Building upon the self-shadowed, super-Eddington accretion flow framework and the coronal over-cooling prescription of Madau &amp; Haardt (2024), we couple funnel-dependent Comptonization physics with slim-disc spectra from Kubota &amp; Done (2019) and explore the resulting parameter space through a full MCMC inference. Using the sample analysed by Lupi et al. (2024) and Maiolino et al. (2025), we show that X-ray weakness - manifested as extreme bolometric corrections, suppressed 2-10 keV luminosities, and non-detections in the 0.5-5 keV Chandra band - naturally arises when the corona is confined and radiatively over-cooled inside a narrow super-Eddington funnel. The combined broad line+X-ray analysis yields strongly bimodal posteriors: either very massive, very low-Eddington black holes (physically disfavoured), or a population of low-mass ($\sim 10^{6}-10^{7} ~M_{\odot}$) black holes accreting at $f_{\rm Edd} \gg 1$. The latter solution is strongly preferred for nearly all objects and returns masses consistent with, or lower than, local $M_{\rm BH}-M_{\rm star}$ relations, mitigating the extreme mass ratios implied by single-epoch virial estimators. The predicted intrinsic spectra are redder and exhibit reduced hard-X-ray output but higher bolometric luminosities, implying bolometric corrections larger than those typical of the local AGN population, yet consistent with low-redshift highly accreting counterparts. These results support a picture in which many JWST broad-line AGNs are powered by rapidly growing, super-Eddington black holes whose suppressed coronal emission and self-shadowed BLR geometry combine to mimic overmassive black holes at $z \gtrsim 6$.</description>

      <title>Little Red Dots as Obscured Little Blue Dots: A Super-Eddington Unification Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We test whether "Little Red Dots" (LRDs) are dust-reddened, high-inclination counterparts of compact, blue broad-line AGNs ("Little Blue Dots", LBDs) powered by super-Eddington accretion. We model the central engine as a geometrically thick, radiation-pressure supported accretion flow whose funnel yields strongly anisotropic, intrinsically blue ionizing continua, coupled to an equatorially concentrated BLR and a dusty screen with modest covering factor. Using inclination-dependent SEDs as input to Cloudy, we show that the extreme broad Halpha equivalent widths (EWs) of JWST LRDs are reproduced with global BLR covering factors of only 15%, consistent with standard Type 1 AGNs. Large Balmer EWs arise because self-shadowing suppresses the high-inclination optical continuum while the BLR is illuminated by an EUV-rich SED. Weak high-ionization lines follow from orientation-dependent suppression of the XUV/soft X-ray continuum toward equatorial directions, without requiring a fully enclosing gaseous "cocoon". With a gray attenuation law of AV = 2.8 along LRD-selected sightlines, the fiducial model matches the V-shaped UV-optical continua and large Balmer decrements; strong Balmer breaks occur only for the most obscured views. A compact equatorial dust component tied to the BLR and normalized by energy conservation intercepts and reradiates only a small fraction of Lbol, producing a modest hot-dust bump and far-IR/sub-mm emission consistent with current limits and implying small dust masses. The model unifies LRD and LBD observables via orientation, predicting correlated trends in Halpha EW, Balmer decrement, Balmer break, high-ionization line strengths, and IR emission.</description>

      <title>Anomalous cosmic rays within the inner heliosphere: Observations of helium by the High Energy Telescope onboard Solar Orbiter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22418v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radial gradients of cosmic rays are key parameters for understanding the transport of particles in space. Solar Orbiter, launched on 2020 February 10, approaches the Sun approximately every half year, with a closest perihelion distance of 0.29 au after the end of 2022 during the nominal mission phase. The two double-ended high energy telescopes(HET)onboard the Solar Orbiter measure energetic particles in the energy range between a few MeV/nuc and a few hundred MeV/nuc, which are dominated by anomalous cosmic rays (ACRs) and galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) during solar quiet times. By obtaining the radial gradient of the ACR helium in the inner heliosphere, we advance our understanding of how the transport of the cosmic rays is affected by the particle drift effect and the large-scale magnetic field. The helium observations at Solar Orbiter/HET between 11.1 and 49 MeV/nuc are analyzed. Since we focus on quiet time measurements, we remove the periods of solar energetic particle (SEP) events. The intensities are averaged over the Carrington rotation period. The helium observations from the Proton and Helium Instrument(EPHIN)onboard SOHO were utilized as the baseline to correct the long-term variation caused by the solar modulations. We present the first observation of ACR helium at Solar Orbiter/HET between 2020 February and 2022 July in the inner heliosphere before the sun became fully active. We derive the radial gradient of the ACR helium between 0.3 and 1 au. The averaged radial gradient between 11.1 and 49MeV/nuc is about 22$\pm$4%/au and the averaged value between 11.1 and 41.2MeV/nuc is raised to 32$\pm$8%/au after removing the GCR contribution, which is estimated by a GCR model. In addition, the temporal variation of radial gradients indicates that the gradients are increasing with the enhancement of the solar modulation and the increased tilt angle of the heliospheric current sheet.</description>

      <title>VLBI Detections of Compact Nuclei in Spiral-hosted Double-lobed Radio-loud Active Galactic Nuclei (DRAGNs): Evidence for Weak Parsec-Scale Jet Activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report milliarcsecond-scale VLBI detections of compact radio nuclei in four spiral-hosted, double-lobed radio-loud AGNs (spiral DRAGNs), a rare class that challenges the traditional association of powerful jets with elliptical hosts. Using public VLBI data archives, we identify compact cores in four sources and resolve parsec-scale jets in two of them. The VLBI components show low brightness temperatures ($T_{\rm b} \approx 10^9$ K in the core) and jet-to-counterjet ratios consistent with only mildly relativistic intrinsic speeds ($\beta \lesssim 0.6$ for inclinations $\theta \lesssim 80^\circ$), indicating weakly powered pc-scale outflows. The low radio-Eddington ratios $\log(L_{\rm R,1.4\,GHz}/L_{\rm Edd}) \approx -5$ to $-8$ support this interpretation. Three objects lie on the fundamental plane of black hole activity, implying that global accretion-jet coupling in spiral DRAGNs is similar to that in other AGNs. Comparison with recent GRMHD simulations of thin-disk jets suggests that the VLBI-scale cores in spiral DRAGNs may trace an early or intermittently magnetized phase of jet launching. The coexistence of weak pc-scale jets and large kpc-scale lobes implies recurrent or long-duty-cycle jet activity in these late-type hosts.</description>

      <title>The ASKAP Variables and Slow Transients (VAST) Extragalactic Survey - Data Release 1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Variables and Slow Transients (VAST) Survey on the Australian SKA Pathfinder (ASKAP) is designed to systematically explore the dynamic radio sky, detecting sources that vary on timescales from minutes to several years. In this paper, we present Data Release 1 of the VAST Extragalactic Survey, which targets slowly evolving synchrotron transients in the southern sky. The observations were carried out between June 2023 and May 2025, comprising 2945 images of 276 fields spanning $\sim 12300\ \mathrm{deg}^2$, observed at 888 MHz with a typical rms sensitivity of 0.24 mJy $\rm{beam}^{-1}$ and 12-20 arcsec resolution. Each field was revisited approximately every two months, yielding 10 or 11 observations per field. The VAST pipeline extracts the light curves for all the observed sources, and additional filters are implemented to improve the reliability of the resulting light curve database. The light curve database contains 0.5 million sources and 6.4 million individual measurements, publicly available through the CSIRO data access portal. An untargeted variability search yields 117 astrophysical variables, including 27 pulsars, 40 radio stars (10 newly detected at radio wavelengths), 44 active galactic nuclei, two optically identified supernovae, one supernova candidate, one brown dwarf, and two sources without multi-wavelength counterparts that are yet to be identified. This data release provides the first large-scale, high-cadence, uniform view of long-term radio variability in the extragalactic sky and lays the groundwork for future population studies of radio transients with ASKAP.</description>

      <title>The Environmental Switch in Black Hole Feeding: Bar-Driven vs. Merger-Driven Growth in IllustrisTNG50</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The relative roles of secular disc processes and galaxy interactions in driving the growth of supermassive black hole (SMBH) remain unclear. We present a time-resolved, per galaxy analysis of SMBH mass assembly that explicitly tracks bar formation, merger events, and the environment along the main progenitor branches using the high resolution IllustrisTNG50 cosmological simulation. We analyze barred and unbarred disc galaxies in isolated and non-isolated environments using physically motivated boundary definitions. We found that SMBH fueling pathways are regulated by the environment through the timing of bar formation relative to mergers. In isolated barred galaxies, stellar bars form early in dynamically cold discs and establish sustained, coherent accretion phases that regulate late-time SMBH growth. In contrast, in non-isolated galaxies, SMBH growth is dominated by early merger-driven accretion episodes, whereas bars form later and contribute weakly to the primary growth phase. Unbarred control samples show that mergers can trigger rapid SMBH growth without bars, but such growth remains episodic, whereas isolated discs without bars lack sustained accretion. These results demonstrate an environmental bifurcation in SMBH fueling: mergers act as efficient triggers of early growth in dynamically active systems, while bars regulate prolonged accretion only when they form in quiescent discs. This study provides a unified time-domain framework linking galaxy environment, disc dynamics, and SMBH growth by resolving the temporal ordering of bars, mergers, and accretion.</description>

      <title>The Delta-isobar masquerade: intrahadronic phase transitions and their quark-mimicking signatures in neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the conditions under which $\Delta(1232)$ isobars trigger a first-order phase transition within purely hadronic neutron-star matter, using the SW4L relativistic mean-field parametrization. For scalar-vector coupling differences $0.15 \lesssim x_{\sigma\Delta} - x_{\omega\Delta} \lesssim 0.2$ and $x_{\sigma\Delta} \gtrsim 1.3$, the onset of $\Delta^-$ resonances produces a van der Waals-like instability driven by a self-amplifying feedback in the scalar meson sector, in which the $\Delta^-$ particle fraction acts as the order parameter of a Landau-type transition. A Maxwell construction yields a sharp density discontinuity at baryon densities $n_b \sim (1.3$-$2)\,n_0$, separating a $\Delta$-free outer core from a $\Delta$-rich inner core. The resulting neutron-star sequences satisfy all current multimessenger constraints: maximum masses $M_{\rm max} \approx 2.15$-$2.25\,M_\odot$, radii $R_{1.4} \approx 11$-$12$ km, and tidal deformabilities $\Lambda_{1.4} \approx 190$-$480$, compatible with NICER observations and GW170817. We compute, for the first time for a $\Delta$-induced interface, the $\ell = 2$ composition $g$-mode eigenfrequencies, obtaining $\nu_g \sim 400$-$1100$ Hz with gravitational-wave damping times $\tau_g \sim 10^3$-$10^9$ s. These frequencies overlap quantitatively with those predicted for hadron-quark phase-transition interfaces, demonstrating that the mass-radius ``knee'', reduced tidal deformability, and $g$-mode spectrum conventionally regarded as signatures of quark deconfinement can be reproduced by a purely intrahadronic mechanism. This extends the masquerade problem from static observables to the domain of gravitational-wave asteroseismology, implying that a future detection of a discontinuity $g$-mode alone would not suffice to identify quark matter in neutron-star cores.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Perseus Cluster III: Role of Aspherical Explosions on its Chemical Composition and Extension to Metal-Poor Stars and Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Perseus Cluster has been precisely measured by the legacy Hitomi telescope on the Si-group (Si, S, Ar, Ca) and Fe-group elements (Cr, Mn, Ni). These element abundance ratios provide insight into the typical behaviour of supernovae. In Paper II, we presented new massive star explosion models at various metallicity, assuming spherical explosions. We show that while the fitting is improved, some features (e.g., Ni/Fe) remain to be improved. In this article, we extend our calculation to an aspherical explosion using the jet-induced explosion mechanism. The detailed pre- and post-explosion chemical profiles are calculated with a large post-processing network to capture the production of odd-number elements (V, Mn, Cu) and iron-group elements. We further explore how the jet-driven explosions create the diversity of models which could be compatible with the observed diversity in terms of $^{56}$Ni-mass vs ejecta mass, Ti-V relation, and stellar abundances. Finally, we apply the new collapsar models in the Galactic Chemical Evolution context. We study how the galactic stars, including the Zn-enriched star HE 1327-2326, can put constraints on the relative rates of collapsar and some of its model parameters. We show that collapsar could lead to significant changes in some elements, e.g., Zn. Our study shows that the collapsar is a necessary component to explain multiple elemental trends observed in the Milky Way Galaxy.</description>

      <title>Decoding FRB energetics and frequency features hidden by observational incompleteness</title>

Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration radio flashes of extragalactic origin, with magnetars implicated as viable central engines. Yet their triggering and radiation mechanisms remain unknown. Radio telescopes inevitably record bursts incompletely, as limited sensitivity and finite bandwidth lead to observational truncation. Here we establish a general analytical framework to reconstruct intrinsic population-level frequency characteristics and energetic parameters directly from observationally truncated FRB data. Applying this method to 2,223 bursts of FRB 20121102A observed by three different telescopes, we show that the narrow spectra of repeating FRBs are predominantly an observational selection effect. Only intrinsically high-energy bursts are genuinely narrowband. We further quantify, for the first time, the number and energy of completely undetected bursts, and reveal intrinsic long-term frequency evolution of the source. Our methodology transforms incomplete archival observations into physically meaningful probes, bridging instrumental readouts and intrinsic FRB physics.</description>

      <title>Mergers Fall Short: Non-merger Channels Required for Galactic Heavy Element Production</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06020v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since the discovery of the binary neutron star merger GW170817 and its associated kilonova, neutron star mergers have been established as a key production channel for r-process elements in the Universe. However, various lines of evidence, including observations of r-process abundances inferred from stellar spectra of Milky Way disk stars, suggest that additional channels are needed to fully account for r-process element enrichment in the Milky Way. Neutron star-black hole mergers and fast-merging binary neutron star systems are among the leading alternative candidates. In this paper, we combine gravitational-wave observations from LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA with data from short gamma-ray bursts, Galactic pulsars, and Galactic Eu/Fe versus Fe/H abundance observations to assess the contribution of these mergers to r-process enrichment in the Galactic disk. Our analysis employs a unified, likelihood-based inference framework that consistently propagates uncertainties in merger rates, delay-time distributions, mass- and spin-dependent ejecta yields, and stellar abundance measurements. We find that neither neutron star-black hole mergers nor fast- merging binary neutron star populations can serve as the dominant additional channel without generating strong tension with existing observations and theoretical expectations. These results constrain the viable sources of Galactic r-process enrichment and underscore the necessity of non- merger production channels.</description>

      <title>Superluminal Wave Activation at Relativistic Magnetized Shocks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19892v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are extremely energetic radio transients, some are generated in magnetar magnetospheres and winds. Despite a growing number of observations, their emission mechanisms remain elusive. It has recently been proposed that Alfv\'enic perturbations can convert into superluminal O-modes at magnetized shocks and propagate downstream as a radio signal. We validate this superluminal wave activation mechanism using pair-plasma theory and particle-in-cell simulations. Theory predicts two different downstream modes: nonpropagating Alfv\'enic perturbations and propagating superluminal O-modes. Superluminal wave activation occurs if the frequency of upstream perturbations in the shock frame exceeds the downstream plasma frequency. 1D particle-in-cell simulations confirm wavenumber and frequency jumps across the shock for upstream perturbations with frequencies well above the plasma frequency. Our simulations model both monochromatic upstream waves and broadband spectra with the downstream plasma frequency acting like a high-pass filter for superluminal O-modes. We discuss implications for FRB generation in relativistic magnetized winds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.22148v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The current Fermi-LAT source catalog (4FGL-DR4: 7194 sources over 14 years) was built incrementally from the 8-year catalog. In a survey mission like Fermi, data accumulate on each source over time, so after 16 years (reached in August 2024) and twice the data for the original 4FGL sources we have more precise localization (by 24% on average). It is thus time to generate a new original catalog, which implies, beyond adding the sources newly detectable after two more years, changing the existing source names (derived from their coordinates) and reviewing the associations.
  We present an early 16-year list (FL16Y) of 7220 sources, which relocalizes all sources and improves a few aspects of the catalog analysis, but still uses the same model of interstellar diffuse emission as 4FGL-DR4.</description>

      <title>The dramatic transition of the extreme Red Supergiant WOH G64 to a Yellow Hypergiant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19329v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Red Supergiants (RSGs) are cool, evolved massive stars in their final evolutionary stage before exploding as a supernova. However, the evolution and fate of the most luminous RSGs remain uncertain. Observational evidence for luminous warm, post-RSG objects and the apparent lack of luminous RSGs as supernova progenitors suggest a blueward evolution. Since the 1980s, WOH G64 has been considered the most extreme RSG in the Large Magellanic Cloud, given its large obscuration, outstanding size, luminosity, and mass-loss rate. Here we report a sudden, yet smooth change in its apparent nature. Time-series photometry and subsequent spectroscopy revealed the most extreme transition ever seen in the optical spectral features of a RSG. We discovered that WOH G64 is a rare, massive symbiotic binary system where the RSG transitioned to a Yellow Hypergiant. The dramatic transition can be explained either by the partial ejection of the pseudo-atmosphere during a common-envelope phase, or the return to a quiescent state after an outstanding eruption exceeding 30 years. WOH G64 offers a unique opportunity to witness stellar evolution in real-time and assess the role of binarity on the final phases of massive stars and their resulting supernovae.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear causality of Israel-Stewart theory with diffusion</title>

Abstract: We present the first fully nonlinear causality constraints in $D = 3 + 1$ dimensions for Israel-Stewart theory in the presence of energy and number diffusion in the Eckart and Landau hydrodynamic frames, respectively. These constraints are algebraic inequalities that make no assumption on the underlying geometry of the spacetime or the equation of state. In order to highlight the distinct physical and structural behavior of the two hydrodynamic frames, we discuss the special ultrarelativistic ideal gas equation of state considered in earlier literature in $D = 1 + 1$ dimensions, and show that our general $D = 3 + 1$ constraints reduce to their results upon an appropriate choice of angles. For this equation of state in both $D = 1 + 1$ and $D = 3 + 1$ dimensions one can show that: (i) there exists a region allowed by nonlinear causality in which the baryon current transitions into a spacelike vector in the Landau frame, and (ii) an analogous argument shows that the solutions of the Eckart frame equations of motion never violate the dominant energy condition, assuming nonlinear causality holds. We then compare our results with those from linearized Israel-Stewart theory and show that the linear causality bounds fail to capture the new physical constraints on energy and number diffusion that are successfully obtained through our nonlinear causality approach.</description>

      <title>Accretion of a Vlasov gas by a Kerr black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04783v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the accretion of a collisionless, relativistic kinetic gas by a rotating Kerr black hole, assuming that at infinity the state of the gas is described by a distribution function depending only on the energy of the particles. Neglecting the self-gravity of the gas, we show that relevant physical observables, including the particle current density and the accretion rates associated with the mass, the energy, and the angular momentum, can be expressed in the form of closed integrals that can be evaluated numerically or approximated analytically in the slow-rotation limit. The accretion rates are computed in this manner for both monoenergetic particles and the Maxwell-J\"uttner distribution and compared with the corresponding results in the non-rotating case. We show that the angular momentum accretion rate decreases the absolute value of the black hole spin parameter. It is also found that the rotation of the black hole has a small but non-vanishing effect on the mass and the energy accretion rates, which is remarkably well described by an analytic calculation in the slow-rotation approximation to quadratic order in the rotation parameter. The effects of rotation on the morphology of the accretion flow are also analyzed.</description>

      <title>Bondi-type accretion onto a Kerr black hole in the kinetic regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20189v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive an exact solution representing a Bondi-type stationary accretion of a kinetic (Vlasov) gas onto the Kerr black hole. The solution is exact in the sense that relevant physical quantities, such as the particle current density or the accretion rates, are expressed as explicit integrals, which can be evaluated numerically. We provide an analytic approximation which allows us to obtain simple formulas for the mass, energy, and angular momentum accretion rates. These formulas are used to derive characteristic time scales of the black hole mass growth and the associated spin-down in two different scenarios: assuming that the ambient energy density is either constant or decreases on a cosmological scale.</description>

      <title>Resonance in black hole ringdown: Benchmarking quasinormal mode excitation and extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06411v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate how resonant excitation near exceptional points manifests in Kerr black hole ringdown waveforms and examine its extraction. Using waveforms generated by localized initial data, where quasinormal mode amplitudes are given solely by excitation factors, we establish a controlled benchmark for overtone extraction. Applying an iterative fitting method with mirror modes, we analyze a mild resonance in the $(l,m)=(2,2)$ multipole and a sharp resonance in the $(3,1)$ multipole occurring as part of a sequence of successive resonances. For $(2,2)$, we extract the fundamental mode, the first three overtones, and the fundamental mirror mode with relative errors below $10\%$, and show that residual waveforms exhibit the expected damped sinusoids together with distinctive resonance signatures. For $(3,1)$, we demonstrate that resonances can not only amplify but also reduce quasinormal mode excitations, reshaping the overtone hierarchy and rendering the sharp resonance more pronounced in ringdown. Our results clarify the imprint of resonance in Kerr ringdown and highlight both the robustness and limitations of current extraction techniques, providing a foundation for more reliable extraction of higher overtones and for applications to observational data analysis.</description>

      <title>Black Hole Superradiance of Interacting Multi-Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10892v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate black hole superradiance evolution of the interacting multiple fields. We consider a model of two scalar fields interacting with a cubic coupling, and study the superradiant evolution of the cloud. We demonstrate that superradiance is typically suppressed when the superradiant field couples to another field, even with a very weak coupling strength. This implies that the constraints on dark particles derived from single-field analyses can be revised in the presence of interactions. Moreover, we find that the multi-field superradiant evolution and its corresponding observational signatures can be different across parameter spaces, which makes black hole superradiance an even more powerful probe of the dark sector in particle physics.</description>

      <title>Thermoelectric coefficients of two-flavor quark matter from the Kubo formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02602v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The hot quark matter created in heavy-ion collision experiments can exhibit strong temperature and chemical-potential gradients, which in turn can generate electric fields through thermoelectric effects. In this work, we investigate two relevant thermoelectric coefficients -- the thermopower (Seebeck coefficient) and the Thomson coefficient -- of two-flavor quark matter using the Kubo formalism and the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model as an effective description of dense, finite-temperature QCD. The required two-point equilibrium correlation functions are evaluated using the Matsubara formalism of thermal field theory, applying a 1/Nc expansion to the relevant multi-loop Feynman diagrams. We employ previously derived quark spectral functions obtained from one--meson-exchange diagrams above the Mott transition temperature. Our numerical results show that both thermoelectric coefficients increase approximately linearly with temperature and decrease with increasing chemical potential. We also estimate the magnitude of the electric fields that can be generated in heavy-ion collisions by thermal gradients via the Seebeck effect.</description>
