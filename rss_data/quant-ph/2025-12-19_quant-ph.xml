      <title>Relational Emergent Time for Quantum System: A Multi-Observer, Gravitational, and Cosmological Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a relational framework in which temporal structure is not fundamental but emerges from correlations within a globally stationary quantum state. Each subsystem includes an internal clock, and conditional states evolve effectively with respect to these internal readings. The construction naturally extends to relativistic motion, gravitational redshift, and cosmological expansion, leading to a unified emergent-time functional valid across diverse physical regimes. The theory reproduces classical time dilation, predicts correlation-dependent deviations from standard evolution, and suggests that non-interacting or massless particles exhibit negligible internal time. These consequences open directions for conceptual and experimental investigations in the foundations of temporal physics, from multi-clock quantum systems to precision metrology and cosmological settings. In particular, the framework suggests measurable deviation from standard quantum evolution for highly entangled systems and predicts negligible internal time for massless particles.</description>

      <title>Geometric Latent Space Tomography with Metric-Preserving Autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum state tomography faces exponential scaling with system size, while recent neural network approaches achieve polynomial scaling at the cost of losing the geometric structure of quantum state space. We introduce geometric latent space tomography, combining classical neural encoders with parameterized quantum circuit decoders trained via a metric-preservation loss that enforces proportionality between latent Euclidean distances and quantum Bures geodesics. On two-qubit mixed states with purity 0.85--0.95 representing NISQ-era decoherence, we achieve high-fidelity reconstruction (mean fidelity $F = 0.942 \pm 0.03$) with an interpretable 20-dimensional latent structure. Critically, latent geodesics exhibit strong linear correlation with Bures distances (Pearson $r = 0.88$, $R^2 = 0.78$), preserving 78\% of quantum metric structure. Geometric analysis reveals intrinsic manifold dimension 6.35 versus 20 ambient dimensions and measurable local curvature ($\kappa = 0.011 \pm 0.006$), confirming non-trivial Riemannian geometry with $O(d^2)$ computational advantage over $O(4^n)$ density matrix operations. Unlike prior neural tomography, our geometry-aware latent space enables direct state discrimination, fidelity estimation from Euclidean distances, and interpretable error manifolds for quantum error mitigation without repeated full tomography, providing critical capabilities for NISQ devices with limited coherence times.</description>

      <title>Optimization Techniques in Quantum Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This thesis focuses on the intersection of mathematical and computational optimization and quantum information. Main contributions are open-source software code: A hybrid approach mixing "traditional" nonconvex and convex methods can make difficult problems more accessible. A demonstration of how to efficiently implement such an algorithm, avoiding interfacial bottlenecks, is provided, finding optimal protocols to establish entanglement through a lossy channel. The central software package developed addresses polynomial optimization problems. Many problems naturally involve only a polynomial objective and constraint polynomials. Such problems can automatically be cast into semidefinite programs that provide a hierarchy of outer approximations. The resulting problems are often so large and scale so unfavorably with respect to the variable number and degree involved that the boundary of the doable is reached quickly. However, technical progress both in hardware and algorithms has pushed this boundary - but software frameworks for polynomial optimization have not followed in the same manner, often now making them the bottleneck that before was the solver. The package PolynomialOptimization.jl developed during this thesis aims to fill the gap and provide a very resource-efficient intermediate layer together with a wide number of algorithms to reduce the problem size, and naturally supporting complex numbers and semidefinite constraints ubiquitous in quantum information problems. Its application on an entanglement distribution problem is demonstrated, showing that even relaxations with semidefinite matrices of three- and four-digit size can be solved conveniently. Finally, a new way to calculate interior-point barriers for the cone of sums-of-squares matrices in a nearly time-optimal way is developed, whose efficient implementation has the potential of further reducing resource consumption.</description>

      <title>Low-Latency FPGA Control System for Real-Time Neural Network Processing in CCD-Based Trapped-Ion Qubit Measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate and low-latency qubit state measurement is critical for trapped-ion quantum computing. While deep neural networks (DNNs) have been integrated to enhance detection fidelity, their latency performance on specific hardware platforms remains underexplored. This work benchmarks the latency of DNN-based qubit detection on field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and graphics processing units (GPUs). The FPGA solution directly interfaces an electron-multiplying charge-coupled device (EMCCD) with the subsequent data processing logic, eliminating buffering and interface overheads. As a baseline, the GPU-based system employs a high-speed PCIe image grabber for image input and I/O card for state output. We deploy Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and Vision Transformer (ViT) models on hardware to evaluate measurement performance. Compared to conventional thresholding, DNNs reduce the mean measurement fidelity (MMF) error by factors of 1.8-2.5x (one-qubit case) and 4.2-7.6x (three-qubit case). FPGA-based MLP and ViT achieve nanosecond- and microsecond-scale inference latencies, while the complete single-shot measurement process achieves over 100x speedup compared to the GPU implementation. Additionally, clock-cycle-level signal analysis reveals inefficiencies in EMCCD data transmission via Cameralink, suggesting that optimizing this interface could further leverage the advantages of ultra-low-latency DNN inference, guiding the development of next-generation qubit detection systems.</description>

      <title>Efficient Simulation of Sparse, Non-Local Fermion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient simulation of interacting fermionic systems is a key application of near-term quantum computers, but is hindered by the overhead required to encode fermionic operators on qubit hardware. Here, we consider models with $N$ fermionic modes in which each participates in at most a constant number $d$ of interactions and study the circuit depth required to implement the Trotterized time evolution on qubit hardware with all-to-all connectivity. We introduce an encoding that augments each physical fermionic mode with a small number of auxiliary fermions, enabling the removal of Jordan--Wigner strings. Although the preparation of the auxiliary fermion state incurs an initial overhead, this state remains invariant under time evolution. As a result, long-time evolution can be implemented with asymptotically optimal circuit depth, reducing a previously multiplicative $O(\log N)$ overhead to an additive overhead. Our results thus establish that the simulation of sparse fermionic models on qubit hardware matches the performance achievable on ideal fermionic hardware up to constant factors and $O(dN)$ ancillary qubits.</description>

      <title>Solvable Quantum Circuits from Spacetime Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years dual-unitary circuits and their multi-unitary generalizations have emerged as exactly solvable yet chaotic models of quantum many-body dynamics. However, a systematic picture for the solvability of multi-unitary dynamics remains missing. We present a framework encompassing a large class of such non-integrable models with exactly solvable dynamics, which we term \emph{completely reducible} circuits. In these circuits, the entanglement membrane determining operator growth and entanglement dynamics can be characterized analytically. Completely reducible circuits extend the notion of space-time symmetry to more general lattice geometries, breaking dual-unitarity globally but not locally, and allow for a rich phenomenology going beyond dual-unitarity. As example, we introduce circuits that support four and five directions of information flow. We derive a general expression for the entanglement line tension in terms of the pattern of information flow in spacetime. The solvability is shown to be related to the absence of knots of this information flow, connecting entanglement dynamics to the Kauffman bracket as knot invariant. Building on these results, we propose that in general non-integrable dynamics the curvature of the entanglement line tension can be interpreted as a density of information transport. Our results provide a new and unified framework for exactly solvable models of many-body quantum chaos, encompassing and extending known constructions.</description>

      <title>On the power of moving quantum sensors: fully flexible and noise-resilient sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that a single moving quantum sensor provides complete access to spatially correlated scalar fields. We demonstrate that with either trajectory or internal state control, one can selectively measure any linear functional, e.g. a gradient or a spatial Fourier series coefficient, while successfully eliminating {\it all} noise signals with orthogonal spatial correlation. This even exceeds the capabilities of a sensor network consisting of multiple entangled, yet spatially fixed, quantum sensors, where the number of suppressed noise signals is limited by the number of sensor positions. We show that one can achieve an improved scaling of the quantum Fisher information for moving sensors beyond the static fundamental limit of $T^2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the statistical properties of orthogonal, or real, Clifford circuits doped with magic and imaginary resources. By developing the Weingarten calculus for the real Clifford group, we derive the exact overlap distribution of real stabilizer states, identifying a new universality class: the orthogonal Clifford Porter-Thomas distribution. We prove that local real architectures recover this global statistic in logarithmic depth. Furthermore, we uncover a sharp hierarchy in resource requirements: while retrieving Haar statistics necessitates a polylogarithmic amount of magic states, recovering the full unitary Clifford statistics requires only a single phase gate.</description>

      <title>Noncooperative Quantum Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing protocols for quantum communication networks usually assume an initial allocation of quantum entanglement resources, which are then manipulated through local operations and classical communication (LOCC) to establish high-fidelity entanglement between distant parties. It is generally held that the resulting fidelity would increase monotonically with the entanglement budget. Here, we show that for noncooperative LOCC protocols, the resulting fidelity may decrease as more entanglement is added to a network with non-pure states. This effect results from a quantum analog of selfish routing and constitutes a potential obstacle to the optimal use of resources in large quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Deflating quantum error-correcting codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a technique for reducing the length of a quantum stabilizer code, and we call this deflation of the code. Deflation can be seen as a generalization of the well-known puncturing and shortening techniques in cases where more than a single qudit is removed. We show that the parameters of the deflated quantum code can be controlled, and argue that a similar approach is not as beneficial when applied to classical linear codes. Furthermore, it is shown that deflation introduces additional freedom compared to applying just puncturing and shortening consecutively. We exemplify that it is possible to obtain better parameters by deflating a code rather than consecutively using puncturing and shortening.</description>

      <title>Quantum Algorithms for Photoreactivity in Cancer-Targeted Photosensitizers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a targeted cancer treatment that uses light-activated photosensitizers to generate reactive oxygen species that selectively destroy tumor cells, generally causing less collateral damage than conventional treatments. However, its clinical success hinges on the availability of photosensitizers with strong optical sensitivity and high efficiency in generating reactive oxygen species. While classical computational methods have provided useful insights into photosensitizer design, they struggle to scale and often lack the accuracy needed for these simulations. In this work, we show how fault-tolerant quantum algorithms can be used to identify promising photosensitizer candidates for PDT. To predict photosensitizer performance, we assess two computational properties. First, we quantify light sensitivity by calculating the cumulative absorption in the therapeutic window with a threshold projection algorithm. Second, we determine the efficiency of reactive oxygen generation by estimating intersystem crossing (ISC) rates using the evolution-proxy approach, complemented by a vibronic dynamic treatment where appropriate. We apply these algorithms to a clinically relevant and actively pursued class of photosensitizers, BODIPY derivatives, including heavy-atom and transition-metal-substituted systems that are challenging for classical methods. Our resource estimates, obtained with PennyLane, suggest that systems with active spaces ranging from 11 to 45 spatial orbitals can be simulated using $180$-$350$ logical qubits and Toffoli gate depths between $10^7$ and $10^9$, placing our algorithms within reach of realistic fault-tolerant quantum devices. This paves the way to an efficient quantum-based workflow for designing photosensitizers that can accelerate the discovery of new PDT agents.</description>

      <title>Universal and Maximal Entanglement Swapping in General Fermionic Gaussian States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exploring universal entanglement structure in many-body systems is both fundamental and challenging, particularly when the system undergoes non-unitary operations. In this work, we uncover a universal mechanism for realizing maximal entanglement swapping in fermionic Gaussian states subjected to projective Bell measurements. We consider two initially decoupled, half-filled copies of a free-fermion system in arbitrary dimensions and perform post-selective Bell measurements on half of the corresponding sites across the two copies. Remarkably, the post-measurement state factorizes into a product of Bell pairs, establishing maximal interlayer entanglement entirely independent of the initial Gaussian state. We derive this post-measurement state exactly for general particle-number-conserving fermionic Gaussian states, establishing both the validity and universality of the mechanism, with numerical simulations serving as consistency checks. This phenomenon arises from a robust interplay between fermionic statistics and Gaussianity, revealing a distinct fermionic route to measurement-induced maximal entanglement.</description>

      <title>Closed-Form Optimal Quantum Circuits for Single-Query Identification of Boolean Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study minimum-error identification of an unknown single-bit Boolean function given black-box (oracle) access with one allowed query. Rather than stopping at an abstract optimal measurement, we give a fully constructive solution: an explicit state preparation and an explicit measurement unitary whose computational-basis readout achieves the Helstrom-optimal success probability 3/4 for distinguishing the four possible functions. The resulting circuit is low depth, uses a fixed gate set, and (in this smallest setting) requires no entanglement in the input state. Beyond the specific example, the main message is operational. It highlights a regime in which optimal oracle discrimination is not only well-defined but implementably explicit: the optimal POVM collapses to a compact gate-level primitive that can be compiled, verified, and composed inside larger routines. Motivated by this, we discuss a "what if" question that is open in spirit: for fixed (n,m,k), could optimal k-query identification (possibly for large hypothesis classes) admit deterministic, closed-form descriptions of the inter-query unitaries and the final measurement unitary acting on the natural n+m-qubit input--output registers (and, if needed, small work registers)? Even when such descriptions are not compact and do not evade known circuit-complexity barriers for generic Boolean functions, making the optimum constructive at the circuit level would be valuable for theory-to-hardware translation and for clarifying which forms of "oracle access" are physically meaningful.</description>

      <title>Resource-resolved quantum fluctuation theorems in end-point measurement scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluctuation theorems provide universal constraints on nonequilibrium energy and entropy fluctuations, making them a natural framework to assess how and to what extent quantum resources become thermodynamically relevant. We develop a unified framework for incorporating a generic quantum resource, including athermality, quantum coherence, and entanglement, into fluctuation theorems. We work within the end point measurement scheme, which avoids an initial energy measurement and allows quantum resources in the initial state to affect nonequilibrium energy statistics. We derive a family of quantum fluctuation theorems, including generalized Jarzynski equalities and Crooks type fluctuation relations, in which corrections decompose into resource resolved contributions. For single systems, we introduce the concept of weight of athermality, and combine it with the weight of coherence to isolate distinct thermodynamic effects of these quantum resources. For bipartite systems, we furthermore obtain two families of entanglement-resolved fluctuation theorems using an appended correlation operator and the best separable approximation, respectively. Finally, we introduce the concepts of coherence and entanglement fluctuation distances, as Kullback Leibler divergences, which quantify the thermodynamic relevance of quantum resources in a process-dependent and operational manner.</description>

Abstract: The probabilistic interference fringes observed in the double slit experiment vividly demonstrate the quantum superposition principle, yet they also highlight a fundamental conceptual challenge: the relationship between a system before and after the measurement. According to Copenhagen interpretation, an unobserved quantum system evolves continuously based on the Schrodinger equation, whereas observation induces an instantaneous collapse of the wave function to an eigenstate. This contrast between continuous evolution and sudden collapse renders the single particle behavior particularly enigmatic, especially given that quantum mechanics itself is constructed upon the statistical behavior of ensembles rather than individual entities. In this study, we introduce a Double Slit Diffraction Surrogate Model DSM based on deep learning, designed to capture the mapping between wave functions and probability distributions. The DSM explores multiple potential propagation paths and adaptively selects optimal transmission channels using gradient descent, forming a backbone for the information through the network. By comparing the interpretability of paths and interference, we propose an intuitive physical analogy: the particle behaves like a stretchable dough, extending across both slits, reconnecting after transmission, allowing detachment before the barrier. Monte Carlo simulations confirm that this framework can naturally reproduce the characteristic interference and diffraction probability patterns. Our approach offers a novel, physically interpretable perspective on quantum superposition and measurement induced collapse. The dough analogy is expected to extend to other quantum phenomena. Finally, we provide a dough based picture, attempting to unify interference, entanglement, and tunneling as manifestations of the same underlying phenomenon.</description>

      <title>AC Stark effect or time-dependent Aharonov-Bohm effect for particle on a ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the effect of a time-varying solenoidal vector potential for a quantum particle confined to a ring. The setup appears to be a time-varying version of the Aharonov-Bohm effect, but since the particle moves in the presence of fields, it is not strictly an Aharonov-Bohm effect. The results are similar to the ac Stark effect, but with a time-varying electric field coming from the vector potential, rather than the scalar potential. We compare and contrast the present effect with the standard ac Stark effect. The signature of this setup is the generation of quasi-energy sidebands which are observable via spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Random coding for long-range continuous-variable QKD</title>

Abstract: Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) schemes are key exchange protocols based on the physical properties of quantum channels. They avoid the computational-hardness assumptions that underlie the security of classical key exchange. Continuous-Variable QKD (CVQKD), in contrast to qubit-based discrete-variable (DV) schemes, makes use of quadrature measurements of the electromagnetic field. CVQKD has the advantage of being compatible with standard telecom equipment, but at long distances has to deal with very low signal to noise ratios, which necessitates labour-intensive error correction. It is challenging to implement the error correction decoding in realtime.
  In this paper we introduce a random-codebook error correction method that is suitable for long range Gaussian-modulated CVQKD. We use likelihood ratio scoring with block rejection based on thresholding. For proof-technical reasons, the accept/reject decisions are communicated in encrypted form; in this way we avoid having to deal with non-Gaussian states in the analysis of the leakage. The error correction method is highly parallelisable, which is advantageous for realtime implementation. Under conservative assumptions on the computational resources, we predict a realtime key ratio of at least 8% of the Devetak-Winter value, which outperforms existing reconciliation schemes.</description>

      <title>Stationary two-qubit entanglement mediated by one-dimensional plasmonic nanoarrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement is one of the key measures of quantum correlations present in nanophotonic systems, with promising applications in quantum optics and beyond. Previous studies have shown that the degree of entanglement between two quantum dot qubits is preserved when a metal nanoparticle is used to mediate the interactions between the qubits. In this work, we investigate long-range plasmonic mediation of qubit--qubit entanglement by studying the impact of the number of mediating metal nanoparticles on stationary concurrence. Collinear and periodically spaced metal nanoparticles that satisfy the weak-coupling approximation are considered. An effective model that enables the derivation of the mediated interactions within the framework of cavity quantum electrodynamics is employed. Under weak driving at the single particle resonance frequency, the model shows that odd-number arrays are more robust to entanglement decay. We attribute this to strong inter-qubit dissipative coupling as a result of a hybridized dipole plasmon resonating with the driving frequency in odd-number arrays. These arrays can sustain non-vanishing stationary entanglement beyond an inter-qubit spacing of one micron, opening up the possibility of independent spatial optical probing of each quantum dot.</description>

Abstract: Combining the long-coherence of spin qubits and the capability to transmit information and entanglement through photons, spin-photon interfaces (SPIs) are a promising platform for networked quantum computation and long-distance quantum communication. SPIs that possess local `memory' qubits in addition to the optically coupled `communication' qubit can improve remote entanglement fidelities through brokered entanglement schemes and entanglement purification. In these schemes, it is critical to protect the memory qubit from decoherence during entanglement operations on the communications qubit. Silicon, a platform with mature microelectronic and nanophotonic fabrication, is host to the T centre, an SPI with emission in the telecommunications O-band that directly integrates with silicon nanophotonics. Cavity-coupled T centres are a platform for brokered entanglement distribution in silicon photonic circuits and over long-distance optical fibre links. The T centre's electron and nuclear spin qubits are an intrinsic register of communication and memory qubits respectively, with anisotropic hyperfine coupling. In this work we determine the T centre's hydrogen hyperfine coupling tensor. We also introduce schemes to protect against dephasing or eliminate relaxation of the T centre's hydrogen memory qubit during optical excitation. These results address a key challenge for practical T centre quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Discrete time crystals enhanced by Stark potentials in Rydberg atom arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discrete time crystals (DTCs) are non-equilibrium phases in periodically driven systems that exhibit spontaneous breaking of discrete time-translation symmetry. The stabilization of most DTC phases is achieved via the disorder-induced many-body localization. In this work, we propose an experimental scheme to realize disorder-free DTCs in a periodically driven Rydberg atom array. Our scheme utilizes a linear potential in the atomic detuning to enhance the DTC order, without being tired to (Stark) many-body localization. We numerically demonstrate that the Stark potential enhances the robustness of the DTC against the flip imperfections and extends its lifetime, which are independent of initial states. Thus, our scheme provides a promising way to explore DTCs in Rydberg atom arrays without disorder averaging and special state preparation.</description>

      <title>Analyzing the performance of CV-MDI QKD under continuous-mode scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuous-variable measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution (CV-MDI QKD) can address vulnerabilities on the detection side of a QKD system. The core of this protocol involves continuous-variable Bell measurements performed by an untrusted third party. However, in high-speed systems, spectrum broadening causes Bell measurements to deviate from the ideal single-mode scenario, resulting in mode mismatches, reduced performance, and compromised security. Here, we introduce temporal modes (TMs) to analyze the performance of CV-MDI QKD under continuous-mode scenarios. The mismatch between Bob's transmitting mode and Bell measurement mode has a more significant effect on system performance compared to that on Alice's side. When the Bell receiver is close to Bob and the mismatch is set to just 5%, the transmission distance drastically decreases from 87.96 km to 18.50 km. In comparison, the same mismatch for Alice reduces the distance to 86.83 km. This greater degradation on Bob's side can be attributed to the asymmetry in the data modification step. Furthermore, the mismatch in TM characteristics leads to a significant reduction in the secret key rate by 83% when the transmission distance is set to 15 km, which severely limits the practical usability of the protocol over specific distances. These results indicate that in scenarios involving continuous-mode interference, such as large-scale MDI network setups, careful consideration of each user's TM characteristics is crucial. Rigorous pre-calibration of these modes is essential to ensure the system's reliability and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Antisymmetrization of composite fermionic states for quantum simulations of nuclear reactions in first-quantization mapping</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I present a first-quantization deterministic algorithm for antisymmetrizing a spatially separated target-projectile system containing $N_T$ and $N_p$ identical fermions, respectively. The method constructs a fully antisymmetric wavefunction from the product of two independently antisymmetrized many-body states, each of which may be a superposition of Slater determinants. The algorithm uses a Dicke-state ancilla register that coherently encodes all one-particle exchange channels between the two subsystems, and, crucially, requires only single-particle swaps to generate the full antisymmetric structure. A total of $O(N_T N_p)$ single-particle exchanges are needed, with up to $N_p$ of them implemented in parallel, if an additional $N_p$ ancillae are used. The correct fermionic phase is incorporated through application of $Z$ gates on $N_T$ ancillae, after which the ancilla register is efficiently uncomputed using a compact sequence of controlled operations. This construction provides a nontrivial and scalable protocol for preparing fully antisymmetric states in reaction and scattering simulations, significantly expanding the range of systems that can be addressed with first-quantized quantum algorithms.</description>

      <title>Tunneling in double-well potentials within stochastic quantization: Application to ammonia inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic quantization - introduced by Nelson in 1966 - describes quantum behavior as a conservative diffusion process in which a particle undergoes Brownian-like motion with a fluctuation amplitude set by Planck's constant. While it fully reproduces conventional quantum mechanics, this approach provides an alternative framework that enables the study of dynamical quantities not easily defined within the standard formulation. In the present work, stochastic quantization is employed to investigate tunneling-time statistics for bound states in double-well potentials. Using first-passage time theory within the stochastic quantization framework, both the mean tunneling time, $\bar{\tau}$, and the full probability distribution, $p({\tau})$, are computed, and the theoretical predictions are validated through extensive numerical simulations of stochastic trajectories for the two potentials considered as representative cases. For the square double-well potential, analytical expressions for $\bar{\tau}$ are derived and show excellent agreement with simulations. In the high-barrier limit, the results reveal a direct relation between the stochastic-mechanical and quantum-mechanical tunneling times, expressed as $\tau_{\mathrm{QM}} = (\pi/2)\bar{\tau}$, where $\tau_{\mathrm{QM}}$ corresponds to half the oscillation period of the probability of finding the particle in either well. This relation is further confirmed for generic double-well systems through a WKB analysis. As a concrete application, the inversion dynamics of the ammonia molecule is analyzed, yielding an inversion frequency of approximately $24$ GHz, in close agreement with experimental observations. These results highlight the potential of stochastic quantization as a powerful and physically insightful framework for analyzing tunneling phenomena in quantum systems.</description>

Abstract: Effective molecular representations are essential for ligand-based virtual screening. We investigate how quantum data embedding strategies can improve this task by developing and evaluating a family of quantum-classical hybrid embedding approaches. These approaches combine classical neural networks with parameterized quantum circuits in different ways to generate expressive molecular representations and are assessed across two benchmark datasets of different sizes: the LIT-PCBA and COVID-19 collections. Across multiple biological targets and class-imbalance settings, several quantum and hybrid embedding variants consistently outperform classical baselines, especially in limited-data regimes. These results highlight the potential of optimized quantum data embeddings as data-efficient tools for ligand-based virtual screening.</description>

      <title>Entropy Stability and Spectral Concentration under Convex Block Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate entropy minimization problems for quantum states subject to convex block-diagonal constraints. Our principal result is a quantitative stability theorem: if a state has entropy within epsilon of the minimum possible value under a fixed block constraint, then it must lie within O(epsilon^{1/2}) in trace norm of the manifold of entropy minimizers. We show that this rate is optimal. The analysis is entirely finite-dimensional and relies on a precise decomposition of entropy into classical and internal components, together with sharp relative entropy inequalities. As an application, we study finite additive operators whose spectral decomposition induces natural block constraints. In this setting, the stability theorem yields quantitative non-concentration bounds for induced spectral measures. The framework is abstract and independent of arithmetic input. It provides a general stability principle for entropy minimizers under linear spectral constraints.</description>

      <title>Near-Infrared Quantum Emission from Oxygen-Related Defects in hBN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Color centers hosted in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) have emerged as a promising platform for single-photon emission and coherent spin-photon interfaces that underpin quantum communication and quantum networking technologies. As a wide-bandgap van der Waals material, hBN can host individual optically active quantum defects emitting across the ultraviolet to visible spectrum, but existing color centers often show broad phonon sidebands (PSBs), unstable emission, or inconvenient wavelengths. Here, we show a simple, scalable oxygen-plasma process that reproducibly creates oxygen-related single quantum emitters in hBN with blinking-free zero-phonon lines spanning the near-infrared (NIR) spectrum from 700-960 nanometers. These emitters demonstrate room-temperature operation, high brightness, and ultra-sharp cryogenic linewidths in the few-gigahertz range under non-resonant excitation. Analysis of the PSBs shows weak electron-phonon coupling and predominant zero-phonon-line emission, while first-principles calculations identify plausible oxygen-related defect configurations. These emitters provide a promising platform for indistinguishable NIR single photons towards free-space quantum networking.</description>

      <title>Amplifying Decoherence-Free Many-Body Interactions with Giant Atoms Coupled to Parametric Waveguide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parametric amplification offers a powerful means to enhance quantum interactions through field squeezing, yet it typically introduces additional noise which accelerates quantum decoherence, a major obstacle for scalable quantum information processing. The squeezing field is implemented in cavities rather than continuous waveguides, thereby limiting its scalability for applications in quantum simulation. Giant atoms, which couple to waveguides at multiple points, provide a promising route to mitigate dissipation via engineered interference, enabling decoherence-free interactions. We extend the squeezing-amplified interaction to a novel quantum platform combining giant atoms with traveling-wave parametric waveguides based on $\chi^{(2)}$ nonlinearity. By exploiting destructive interference between different coupling points, the interaction between giant atoms is not only significantly enhanced but also becomes immune to squeezed noise. Unlike conventional waveguide quantum electrodynamics without a squeezing pump, the giant emitters exhibit both exchange and pairing interactions, making this platform particularly suitable for simulating many-body quantum physics. More intriguingly, the strengths of these interactions can be smoothly tuned by adjusting the squeezing and coupling parameters. Our architecture thus provides a versatile and scalable platform for quantum simulation of strongly correlated physics and paves the way toward robust quantum control in many-body regimes.</description>

      <title>Self-testing GHZ state via a Hardy-type paradox</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-testing is a correlation-based framework that enables the certification of both the underlying quantum state and the implemented measurements without imposing any assumptions on the internal structure of the devices. In this work, we introduce a self-testing protocol for the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state based on a natural generalization of Hardy's nonlocality argument. Within this framework, we prove that the correlation achieving the maximal Hardy success probability constitutes an extremal point of the quantum correlation set and, moreover, that this point is \emph{exposed}. To address experimentally relevant imperfections, we further develop a robust self-testing analysis tailored to the Hardy construction. Additionally, we show that, in this scenario, the quantum correlation that attains the maximal violation of the Hardy-type paradox coincides with the correlation that yields the maximal violation of the Mermin inequality. This establishes a unified perspective in which the same multipartite correlation admits both a logical-paradox interpretation and a Bell-inequality-based characterization. Collectively, our results pave the way for investigating whether the correlations that maximally violate the generalized $N$-party Hardy paradox remain exposed in higher-party regimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we revisit prefix sums through the lens of linear algebra. We describe an identity that decomposes triangular all-ones matrices as a sum of two Kronecker products, and apply it to design recursive prefix sum algorithms and circuits. Notably, the proposed family of circuits is the first one that achieves the following three properties simultaneously: (i) zero-deficiency, (ii) constant fan-out per-level, and (iii) depth that is asymptotically strictly smaller than $2\log(n)$ for input length n. As an application, we show how to use these circuits to design quantum adders with $1.893\log(n) + O(1)$ Toffoli depth, $O(n)$ Toffoli gates, and $O(n)$ additional qubits, improving the Toffoli depth and/or Toffoli size of existing constructions.</description>

      <title>Feedback Cooling and Thermometry of a Single Trapped Ion Using a Knife Edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the first feedback cooling of a single trapped ion below the Doppler limit of $\hbar\Gamma/2 k_\mathrm{B}$. The motion of a single ion is monitored in real-time and cooled up to 9-times below the Doppler cooling temperature by applying electronic feedback. Real-time motion detection is implemented by imaging the fluorescence photons emitted by the ion onto a knife edge and detecting the transmitted light, a method used so far to cool trapped nanoparticles. The intensity modulation of the fluorescence resulting from the ion motion is used to generate and apply the feedback signal and also to determine the ion temperature. The method benefits from a high rate of detected scattered photons, which can be a challenge, and which we address by using a parabolic mirror for collecting the fluorescence.</description>

      <title>Instantaneous velocity during quantum tunnelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum tunnelling, a hallmark phenomenon of quantum mechanics, allows particles to pass through the classically forbidden region. It underpins fundamental processes ranging from nuclear fusion and photosynthesis to the operation of superconducting qubits. Yet the underlying dynamics of particle motion during tunnelling remain subtle and are still the subject of active debate. Here, by analyzing the temporal evolution of the tunnelling process, we show that the particle velocity inside the barrier continuously relaxes from a large initial value toward a smaller one, and may even approach zero in the evanescent regime. Meanwhile, the probability density within the barrier gradually builds up before reaching its stationary profile, in contrast to existing inherently. In addition, starting from the steady-state equations, we derive an explicit relation between the particle velocity and the barrier width, and show that the velocity in evanescent states approaches zero when the barrier is sufficiently wide. These findings resolve the apparent paradox of a vanishing steady-state velocity coexisting with a finite particle density. We point out that defining an effective speed from the probability density, rather than from the probability current, can lead to spuriously nonzero "stationary speed," as appears to be the case in Ref. [Nature 643, 67 (2025)]. Our work establishes a clear dynamical picture for the formation of tunnelling flow and provides a theoretical foundation for testing time-resolved tunnelling phenomena.</description>

      <title>Coined Quantum Walks on Complex Networks for Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a quantum circuit design for implementing coined quantum walks on complex networks. In complex networks, the coin and shift operators depend on the varying degrees of the nodes, which makes circuit construction more challenging than for regular graphs. To address this issue, we use a dual-register encoding. This approach enables a simplified shift operator and reduces the resource overhead compared to previous methods. We implement the circuit using Qmod, a high-level quantum programming language, and evaluated the performance through numerical simulations on Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi, Watts-Strogatz, and Barab\'asi-Albert models. The results show that the circuit depth scales as approximately $N^{1.9}$ regardless of the network topology. Furthermore, we execute the proposed circuits on the ibm\_torino superconducting quantum processor for Watts-Strogatz models with $N=4$ and $N=8$. The experiments show that hardware-aware optimization slightly improved the $L_1$ distance for the larger graph, whereas connectivity constraints imposed overhead for the smaller one. These results indicate that while current NISQ devices are limited to small-scale validations, the polynomial scaling of our framework makes it suitable for larger-scale implementations in the early fault-tolerant quantum computing era.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Inspired Ising Machines for Quantum Chemistry Calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Four decades after Richard Feynman's famous remark, we have reached a stage at which nature can be simulated quantum mechanically. Quantum simulation is among the most promising applications of quantum computing. However, like many quantum algorithms, it is severely constrained by noise in near-term hardware. Quantum-inspired algorithms provide an attractive alternative by avoiding the need for error-prone quantum devices. In this study, we demonstrate that the coherent Ising machine and simulated bifurcation algorithms can accurately reproduce the electronic energy profiles of H_2 and H_2O, capturing their essential energetic features. Notably, we obtain computational times of 1.2 s and 2.4 s for the H_2 and H_2O profiles, respectively, representing a substantial speed-up compared to gate-based quantum computing approaches, which typically require at least 6 s to compute a single molecular geometry with comparable accuracy. These results highlight the potential of quantum-inspired approaches for scaling to larger molecular systems and for future applications in chemistry and materials science.</description>

      <title>Classical and quantum electromagnetic momentum in anisotropic optical waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The guided modes supported by dielectric channel waveguides act as individual carriers of momentum. We show this by proving that the modes satisfy an orthogonality condition which relates to the momentum of the optical electromagnetic field, with a link to the more familiar power (energy) orthogonality. This result forms the basis for a rigorous, self-consistent procedure for the quantization of broadband guided electromagnetic fields in the typical channels used in integrated photonic circuits. Our work removes the existing theoretical gap between the classical solution of the Maxwell equations for guided fields and the intuitive understanding of photons in waveguides. The presented approach is valid for straight, lossless, and potentially anisotropic, dielectric waveguides of general shape, in the linear regime, and including material dispersion. Examples for the hybrid modes of a thin film lithium niobate strip waveguide are briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Replica Keldysh field theory of quantum-jump processes: General formalism and application to imbalanced and inefficient fermion counting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measurement-induced phase transitions have largely been explored for projective or continuous measurements of Hermitian observables, assuming perfect detection without information loss. Yet such transitions also arise in more general settings, including quantum-jump processes with non-Hermitian jump operators, and under inefficient detection. A theoretical framework for treating these broader scenarios has been missing. Here we develop a comprehensive replica Keldysh field theory for general quantum-jump processes in both bosonic and fermionic systems. Our formalism provides a unified description of pure-state quantum trajectories under efficient detection and mixed-state dynamics emerging from inefficient monitoring, with deterministic Lindbladian evolution appearing as a limiting case. It thus establishes a direct connection between phase transitions in nonequilibrium steady states of driven open quantum matter and in measurement-induced dynamics. As an application, we study imbalanced and inefficient fermion counting in a one-dimensional lattice system: monitored gain and loss of fermions occurring at different rates, with a fraction of gain and loss jumps undetected. For imbalanced but efficient counting, we recover the qualitative picture of the balanced case: entanglement obeys an area law for any nonzero jump rate, with an extended quantum-critical regime emerging between two parametrically separated length scales. Inefficient detection introduces a finite correlation length beyond which entanglement, as quantified by the fermionic logarithmic negativity, obeys an area law, while the subsystem entropy shows volume-law scaling. Numerical simulations support our analytical findings. Our results offer a general and versatile theoretical foundation for studying measurement-induced phenomena across a wide class of monitored and open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Wichmann-Kroll vacuum polarization density in a finite Gaussian basis set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work further develops the calculation of QED effects in a finite Gaussian basis. We focus on the non-linear ${\alpha}(Z{\alpha})^{n\ge 3}$ contribution to the vacuum polarization density, computing the energy shift of 1s$_{1/2}$ states of hydrogen-like ions. Our goal is to improve the numerical computations to achieve a precision comparable to that of Green's function methods reported in the literature. To do so, an analytic expression for the linear contribution to the vacuum polarization density is derived using Riesz projectors. Alternative formulations of the vacuum polarization density and their relation is discussed. The convergence of the finite Gaussian basis scheme is investigated, and the numerical difficulties that arise are characterized. In particular, an error analysis is performed to assess the method's robustness to numerical noise. We then report a strategy for computing the energy shift with sufficient precision to enable a sensible extrapolation of the partial-wave expansion. A key feature of the procedure is the use of even-tempered basis sets, allowing for an extrapolation towards the complete basis set limit.</description>

      <title>The measured speed in the evanescent regime reflects the spatial decay of the wavefunction, not particle motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent paper by Sharoglazova et al. reports an energy-dependent parameter $\nu$ extracted from the spatial distribution of photons in a coupled-waveguide experiment. The authors interpret $\nu$ as the speed of quantum particles, even in the classically forbidden regime, and claim that its finite value contradicts the Bohmian mechanics prediction of zero particle velocity. This challenge arises from a fundamental misunderstanding of the operational meaning of v within the Bohmian ontological framework. We demonstrate that v quantifies the spatial gradient of the wavefunctions amplitude, a geometric property of the guiding field, not the kinematical velocity of point-like particles. The experiment therefore does not challenge but rather illustrates the clean ontological separation between the wave and particle aspects inherent to Bohmian mechanics.</description>

      <title>Giant-atom quantum acoustodynamics in hybrid superconducting-phononic integrated circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a giant atom by coupling a superconducting transmon qubit to a lithium niobate phononic waveguide at two points separated by about 600 acoustic wavelengths, with a propagation delay of 125 ns. The giant atom yields non-Markovian relaxation dynamics characterized by phonon backflow and a frequency-dependent effective decay rate varying four-fold over merely 4 MHz, corresponding to a Purcell factor exceeding 40. Exploiting this frequency-dependent dissipation, we prepare quantum superposition states with high purity. Our results establish phononic integrated circuits as a versatile platform for giant-atom physics, providing highly tunable quantum devices for advanced quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Indistinguishable photons from a two-photon cascade</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decay of a four-level diamond scheme via a cascade is a potential source of entangled photon pairs. A solid-state implementation is the biexciton cascade in a semiconductor quantum dot. While high entanglement fidelities have been demonstrated, the two photons, XX and X, are temporally correlated, typically resulting in poor photon coherence. Here, we demonstrate a high two-photon interference visibility (a measure of the photon coherence) for both XX (V=94$\pm$2%) and X (V=82$\pm$6%) photons. This is achieved by Purcell-enhancing the biexciton transition in a low-noise device. We find that the photon coherence follows the well-known quantum optics result upon tuning the XX:X lifetime ratio over two orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Fast Native Three-Qubit Gates and Fault-Tolerant Quantum Error Correction with Trapped Rydberg Ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trapped ions as one of the most promising quantum-information-processing platforms, yet conventional entangling gates mediated by collective motion remain slow and difficult to scale. Exciting trapped ions to high-lying electronic Rydberg states provides a promising route to overcome these limitations by enabling strong, long-range dipole-dipole interactions that support much faster multi-qubit operations. Here, we introduce the first scheme for implementing a native controlled-controlled-Z gate with microwave-dressed Rydberg ions by optimizing a single-pulse protocol that accounts for the finite Rydberg-state lifetime. The resulting gate outperforms standard decompositions into one- and two-qubit gates by achieving fidelities above 97% under realistic conditions, with execution times of about 2 microseconds at cryogenic temperatures. To explore the potential of trapped Rydberg ions for fault-tolerant quantum error correction, and to illustrate the utility of three-qubit Rydberg-ion gates in this context, we develop and analyze a proposal for fault-tolerant, measurement-free quantum error correction using the nine-qubit Bacon-Shor code. Our simulations confirm that quantum error correction can be performed in a fully fault-tolerant manner on a linear Rydberg-ion chain despite its limited qubit connectivity. These results establish native multiqubit Rydberg-ion gates as a valuable resource for fast, high-fidelity quantum computing and highlight their potential for fault-tolerant quantum error correction.</description>

      <title>Scalable tests of quantum contextuality from stabilizer-testing nonlocal games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Soon after the dawn of quantum error correction, DiVincenzo and Peres observed that stabilizer codewords could give rise to simple proofs of quantumness via contextuality. This discovery can be recast in the language of nonlocal games: every $n$-qubit stabilizer state defines a specific "stabilizer-testing" $n$-player nonlocal game, which quantum players can win with probability one. If quantum players can moreover outperform all possible classical players, then the state is contextual. However, the classical values of stabilizer-testing games are largely unknown for scalable examples beyond the $n$-qubit GHZ state. We introduce several new methods for upper-bounding the classical values of these games. We first prove a general coding-theory bound for all stabilizer-testing games: if the classical value $p_{\mathrm{cl}}^* &lt; 1$, then $p_{\mathrm{cl}}^* \leq 7/8$, i.e., there is no classical strategy that can perform as well as the optimal quantum strategy even in an asymptotic sense. We then show how to tighten this bound for the most common scalable examples, namely GHZ, toric-code and cyclic cluster states. In particular, we establish an asymptotically tight upper bound for cyclic cluster states using transfer-matrix methods. This leads to the striking conclusion that measuring an exponentially small fidelity to the cyclic cluster state will suffice to witness its contextuality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate how different reservoir memory profiles influence the dynamical evolution of a single waveguide coupled to an external environment. We compare three representative memory kernels: Lorentzian, Gaussian and Uniform, highlighting their distinct spatial correlations and their impact on system behavior. We compute the transmission amplitude, transparency properties, as well as long-time behavior of the system under each memory model. To quantify deviations from Markovian dynamics, we employ a non-Markovianity measure based on information backflow, allowing a direct comparison between the structured reservoirs and the Markovian limit. Our results reveal clear signatures of memoryless-induced modifications in the transmission spectrum and demonstrate how specific reservoir profiles enhance or suppress non-Markovian effects.</description>

      <title>Topological magic response in quantum spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological matter provides natural platforms for robust, non-local information storage, central to quantum error correction. Yet, while the relation between entanglement and topology is well established, little is known about the role of nonstabilizerness (or magic), a pivotal concept in fault-tolerant quantum computation, in topological phases. We introduce the concept of topological magic response, the ability of a state to spread over stabilizer space when perturbed by finite-depth non-Clifford circuits. Unlike a topological invariant or order parameter, this response function probes how a phase reacts to non-Clifford perturbations, revealing the presence of non-local quantum correlations. In Ising-type spin chains, we show that symmetry-broken and paramagnetic phases lack such a response, whereas symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases always display it. To capture this, we utilize a combination of stabilizer R\'{e}nyi entropies that, in analogy with topological entanglement entropy, isolates non-locally stored information. Using exact analytic computations and matrix product states simulations based on an algorithmic technique we introduce, we show that SPT phases doped with $T$ gates support robust topological magic response, while trivial phases remain featureless.</description>

      <title>Symbolic Pauli Propagation for Gradient-Enabled Pre-Training of Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Machine Learning models typically require expensive on-chip training procedures and often lack efficient gradient estimation methods. By employing Pauli propagation, it is possible to derive a symbolic representation of observables as analytic functions of a circuit's parameters. Although the number of terms in such functional representations grows rapidly with circuit depth, suitable choices of ansatz and controlled truncations on Pauli weights and frequency components yield accurate yet tractable estimators of the target observables. With the right ansatz design, this approach can be extended to system sizes beyond the reach of classical simulation, enabling scalable training for larger quantum systems. This also enables a form of classical pre-training through gradient-based optimization prior to deployment on quantum hardware. The proposed approach is demonstrated on the Variational Quantum Eigensolver for obtaining the ground state of a spin model, showing that accurate results can be achieved with a scalable and computationally efficient procedure.</description>

Abstract: Bell nonlocality is an intriguing property of quantum mechanics with far reaching consequences for information processing, philosophy and our fundamental understanding of nature. However, nonlocality is a statement about static correlations only. It does not take into account dynamics, i.e. time evolution of those correlations. Consider a dynamic situation where the correlations remain local for all times. Then at each moment in time there exists a local hidden-variable (LHV) model reproducing the momentary correlations. Can the time evolution of the correlations then be captured by evolving the hidden variables? In this light, we define dynamical LHV models and motivate and discuss potential additional physical and mathematical assumptions. Based on a simple counter example we conjecture that such LHV dynamics does not always exist. This is further substantiated by a rigorous no-go theorem. Our results suggest a new type of nonlocality that can be deduced from the observed time evolution of measurement statistics and which generically occurs in interacting quantum systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Darboux transformations of the singular harmonic oscillator are considered. Analytical expressions for the propagators are obtained, using the image method applied to formal singular propagators. Two-well and three-well families of potentials and the corresponding propagators are presented. Axially symmetric magnetic field configurations corresponding to these potentials have been identified.</description>

      <title>QuantumSavory: Write Symbolically, Run on Any Backend -- A Unified Simulation Toolkit for Quantum Computing and Networking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Progress in quantum computing and networking depends on codesign across abstraction layers: device-level noise and heterogeneous hardware, algorithmic structure, and distributed classical control. We present QuantumSavory, an open-source toolkit built to make such end-to-end studies practical by cleanly separating a symbolic computer-algebra frontend from interchangeable numerical simulation backends. States, operations, measurements, and protocol logic are expressed in a backend-agnostic symbolic language; the same model can be executed across multiple backends (e.g., stabilizer, wavefunction, phase-space), enabling rapid exploration of accuracy-performance tradeoffs without rewriting the model. Furthermore, new custom backends can be added via a small, well-defined interface that immediately reuses existing models and protocols.
  QuantumSavory also addresses the classical-quantum interaction inherent to LOCC protocols via discrete-event execution and a tag/query system for coordination. Tags attach structured classical metadata to quantum registers and message buffers, and queries retrieve, filter, or wait on matching metadata by wildcards or arbitrary predicates. This yields a data-driven control plane where protocol components coordinate by publishing and consuming semantic facts (e.g., resource availability, pairing relationships, protocol outcomes) rather than by maintaining rigid object graphs or bespoke message plumbing, improving composability and reuse as models grow. Our toolkit is also not limited to qubits and Bell pairs; rather, any networking dynamics of any quantum system under any type of multipartite entanglement can be tackled. Lastly, QuantumSavory ships reusable libraries of standard states, circuits, and protocol building blocks with consistent interfaces, enabling full-stack examples to be assembled, modified, and compared with minimal glue code.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of Quantum Fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the traditional ways of introducing bosons and fermions is through creation and annihilation algebras. Historically, these have been associated with emission and absorption processes at the quantum level and are characteristic of the language of second quantization. In this work, we formulate the transition from first to second quantization by taking quotients of the state spaces of distinguishable particles, so that the resulting equivalence classes identify states that contain no information capable of distinguishing between particles, thereby generalising the usual symmetrisation procedure. Assuming that the resulting indistinguishable-particle space (i) admits an ordered basis compatible with how an observer may label the accessible modes, (ii) is invariant under unitary transformations of those modes, and (iii) supports particle counting as a mode-wise local operation, we derive a new class of creation-annihilation algebras. These algebras reproduce the partition functions of transtatistics-maximal generalisations of bosons and fermions consistent with these operational principles.</description>

      <title>A magic criterion (almost) as nice as PPT, with applications in distillation and detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a mixed-state magic criterion, the Triangle Criterion, which plays a role for magic analogous to the Positive Partial Transposition (PPT) criterion for entanglement: it combines strong detection capability, a clear geometric interpretation, and an operational link to magic distillation. Using this criterion, we uncover several new features of multi-qubit magic distillation and detection. We prove that genuinely multi-qubit magic distillation protocols are strictly more powerful than all single-qubit schemes by showing that the Triangle Criterion is not stable under tensor products, in sharp contrast to the PPT criterion. Moreover, we show that, with overwhelming probability, multi-qubit magic states with relatively low rank cannot be distilled by any single-qubit distillation protocol. We derive an upper bound on the minimal purity of magic states, which is conjectured to be tight with both numerical and constructive evidences. Using this minimal-purity result, we predict the existence of unfaithful magic states, namely states that cannot be detected by any fidelity-based magic witness, and reveal fundamental limitations of mixed-state magic detection in any single-copy scheme.</description>

      <title>Non-Linear Strong Data-Processing for Quantum Hockey-Stick Divergences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data-processing is a desired property of classical and quantum divergences and information measures. In information theory, the contraction coefficient measures how much the distinguishability of quantum states decreases when they are transmitted through a quantum channel, establishing linear strong data-processing inequalities (SDPI). However, these linear SDPI are not always tight and can be improved in most of the cases. In this work, we establish non-linear SDPI for quantum hockey-stick divergence for noisy channels that satisfy a certain noise criterion. We also note that our results improve upon existing linear SDPI for quantum hockey-stick divergences and also non-linear SDPI for classical hockey-stick divergence. We define $F_\gamma$ curves generalizing Dobrushin curves for the quantum setting while characterizing SDPI for the sequential composition of heterogeneous channels. In addition, we derive reverse-Pinsker type inequalities for $f$-divergences with additional constraints on hockey-stick divergences. We show that these non-linear SDPI can establish tighter finite mixing times that cannot be achieved through linear SDPI. Furthermore, we find applications of these in establishing stronger privacy guarantees for the composition of sequential private quantum channels when privacy is quantified by quantum local differential privacy.</description>

      <title>Numerically exact open quantum system work statistics with process tensors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately quantifying the thermodynamic work costs of quantum operations is essential for the continued development and optimisation of emerging quantum technologies. This present a significant challenge in regimes of rapid control within complex, non-equilibrium environments - conditions under which many contemporary quantum devices operate and conventional approximations break down. Here, we introduce a process tensor framework that enables the computation of the full numerically exact quantum work statistics of driven open quantum systems. We demonstrate the utility of our approach by applying it to a Landauer erasure protocol operating beyond the weak-coupling, Markovian, and slow-driving limits. The resulting work probability distributions reveal distinct quantum signatures that are missed by low-order moments yet significantly impact the erasure fidelity of the protocol. Our framework delivers non-perturbative accuracy and detail in characterising energy-exchange fluctuations in driven open quantum systems, establishing a powerful and versatile tool for exploring thermodynamics and control in the operating regimes of both near-term and future quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Nonstabilizerness in Stark many-body localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum many-body disorder-free localization can suppress transport while still allowing the buildup of computationally costly non-Clifford resources. In a transverse-field Ising chain realizing disorder-free Stark many-body localization, we show that the stabilizer R\'enyi entropy remains nonzero and grows slowly to a finite plateau deep in the strong Stark-field regime, with strong initial-state selectivity. As the Stark field strength increases, long-time magic and entanglement consistently signal a crossover from ergodic to constrained localized dynamics. These results establish nonstabilizerness (``magic'') as a practical complexity probe for disorder-free ergodicity breaking and constrained localization, with direct relevance to benchmarking and designing near-term quantum simulators, and fill a gap in the understanding of nonstabilizerness in disorder-free many-body localization.</description>

      <title>Random purification channel for passive Gaussian bosons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The random purification channel, which, given $n$ copies of an unknown mixed state $\rho$, prepares $n$ copies of an associated random purification, has proved to be an extremely valuable tool in quantum information theory. In this work, we construct a Gaussian version of this channel that, given $n$ copies of a bosonic passive Gaussian state, prepares $n$ copies of one of its randomly chosen Gaussian purifications. The construction has the additional advantage that each purification has a mean photon number which is exactly twice that of the initial state. Our construction relies on the characterisation of the commutant of passive Gaussian unitaries via the representation theory of dual reductive pairs of unitary groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulating electron-phonon interactions on quantum computers remains challenging, with most algorithmic effort focused on Hamiltonian simulation and circuit optimization. In this work, we study the single-electron Holstein model and propose an initial-state ansatz that substantially enhances ground state overlap in the strong coupling regime, thereby reducing the number of iterations required in standard quantum phase estimation. We further show that this ansatz can be implemented efficiently and yields an exponential reduction in overall circuit costs relative to conventional initial guesses. Our results highlight the practical value of incorporating physical intuition into initial state preparation for electron-phonon coupled systems.</description>

      <title>Many-body contextuality and self-testing quantum matter via nonlocal games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contextuality is arguably the fundamental property that makes quantum mechanics different from classical physics. It is responsible for quantum computational speedups in both magic-state-injection-based and measurement-based models of computation, and can be directly probed in a many-body setting by multiplayer nonlocal quantum games. Here, we discuss a family of games that can be won with certainty when performing single-site Pauli measurements on a state that is a codeword of a Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) error-correcting quantum code. We show that these games require deterministic computation of a code-dependent Boolean function, and that the classical probability of success is upper bounded by a generalized notion of nonlinearity/nonquadraticity. This success probability quantifies the state's contextuality, and is computed via the function's (generalized) Walsh-Hadamard spectrum. To calculate this, we introduce an efficient, many-body-physics-inspired method that involves identifying the symmetries of an auxiliary hypergraph state. We compute the classical probability of success for several paradigmatic CSS codes and relate it to both classical statistical mechanics models and to strange correlators of symmetry-protected topological states. We also consider CSS submeasurement games, which can only be won with certainty by sharing the appropriate codeword up to local isometries. These games therefore enable self-testing, which we illustrate explicitly for the 2D toric code. We also discuss how submeasurement games enable an extensive notion of contextuality in many-body states.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Anubuddhi, a multi-agent AI system that designs and simulates quantum optics experiments from natural language prompts without requiring specialized programming knowledge. The system composes optical layouts by arranging components from a three-tier toolbox via semantic retrieval, then validates designs through physics simulation with convergent refinement. The architecture combines intent routing, knowledge-augmented generation, and dual-mode validation (QuTiP and FreeSim). We evaluated 13 experiments spanning fundamental optics (Hong-Ou-Mandel interference, Michelson/Mach-Zehnder interferometry, Bell states, delayed-choice quantum eraser), quantum information protocols (BB84 QKD, Franson interferometry, GHZ states, quantum teleportation, hyperentanglement), and advanced technologies (boson sampling, electromagnetically induced transparency, frequency conversion). The system achieves design-simulation alignment scores of 8--9/10, with simulations faithfully modeling intended physics. A critical finding distinguishes structural correctness from quantitative accuracy: high alignment confirms correct physics architecture, while numerical predictions require expert review. Free-form simulation outperformed constrained frameworks for 11/13 experiments, revealing that quantum optics diversity demands flexible mathematical representations. The system democratizes computational experiment design for research and pedagogy, producing strong initial designs users can iteratively refine through conversation.</description>

      <title>Localization from Infinitesimal Kinetic Grading: Critical Scaling and Kibble-Zurek Universality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a one-dimensional lattice model with site-dependent nearest-neighbor hopping amplitudes that follow a power-law profile. The hopping variation is controlled by a grading exponent, $\alpha$, which serves as the tuning parameter of the system. In the thermodynamic limit, the ground state becomes localized as $|\alpha| \to 0$, signaling the presence of a critical point characterized by a diverging localization length. Using exact diagonalization, we perform finite-size scaling analysis and extract the associated critical exponent governing this divergence, revealing a universality class distinct from well-known Anderson, Aubry-Andre, and Stark localization. To further characterize the critical behavior, we analyze the inverse participation ratio, the energy gap between the ground and first excited states, and the fidelity susceptibility. We also investigate nonequilibrium dynamics by linearly ramping the hopping profile at various rates and tracking the evolution of the localization length and the inverse participation ratio. The Kibble-Zurek mechanism successfully captures the resulting dynamics using the critical exponents obtained from the static scaling analysis. Our results demonstrate a clean, disorder-free route to localization and provide a tunable platform relevant to photonic lattices and ultracold atom arrays with engineered hopping profiles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a direct correspondence between the Lanczos approach and the orthogonal polynomials approach in random matrix theory. In the large-$N$ and continuum limits, the average Lanczos coefficients and the recursion coefficients become equivalent, with the precise mapping $\sqrt{R(x)} = b(1-x)$ and $S(x) = a(1-x)$. As a result, the two formalisms yield identical expressions for the leading density of states. We further analyze the Krylov dynamics associated with the recursion coefficients and show that the orthogonal polynomials admit a natural interpretation as Krylov polynomials. This picture is realized explicitly in the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble, where all quantities can be computed analytically.</description>

      <title>Classifying one-dimensional Floquet phases through two-dimensional topological order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Floquet systems display rich phenomena, such as time crystals, with many-body localisation (MBL) protecting the phases from heating. While several types of Floquet phases have been classified, a unified picture of Floquet MBL is still emerging. Static phases have been fruitfully studied via "symmetry topological field theory" (SymTFT), wherein the universal features of $G$-symmetric systems are elucidated by placing them on the boundary of a topological order of one dimension higher. In this work, we provide a SymTFT approach to classifying $G$-symmetric Floquet MBL phases in 1D, for $G$ a finite Abelian group with on-site unitary action. In the SymTFT, these 1D systems correspond to the boundaries of the quantum double associated to $G$, and the classification naturally arises from considering the Lagrangian subgroups and boundary excitations of the quantum double. The classification covers all known Floquet phases while uncovering others previously unexplored, along with bulk features of phases thought to have only boundary signatures. We refer to the latter phases as "dual" time crystals. For static phases, we show how anyons of the quantum double and (string) order parameters provide a natural and simple interpretation of known classification schemes. By extending our framework to the boundaries of twisted quantum doubles, we uncover a new time-crystalline phase with non-onsite symmetry, which cannot be obtained through local, symmetric Hamiltonian drives. We numerically demonstrate evidence for the absolute stability of this phase, and observe that for open boundary conditions it has greater stability to symmetric perturbations. We finally discuss perspectives on using programmable quantum devices to realise and probe the phases we discuss. Our results show that SymTFT provides a powerful approach to unifying phases and features of Floquet systems.</description>

Abstract: We develop and employ general Tree Tensor Networks (TTNs) to compute the vibrational spectra for two model systems: a set of 64-dimensional coupled oscillators and acetonitrile. We explore various tree architectures, ranging from the simple linear structure of Matrix Product States (MPS), to trees where only the leaf nodes carry a physical leg -- as seen in the underlying ansatz of the Multilayer Multiconfiguration Time-Dependent Hartree (ML-MCTDH) method -- and further to more general trees in which all nodes are allowed to possess a physical leg. In addition, we implement Locally Optimal Block Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient (LOBPCG) methods and Inverse Iteration methods as eigensolvers. By means of comprehensive benchmarking of runtime and accuracy, we demonstrate that sub-wavenumber accuracy in vibrational spectra is achievable with all TTN structures. MPS and three-legged tree tensor network states (T3NS) have similar runtimes, whereas leaf-only trees require significantly more time. All numerical simulations were performed using PyTreeNet, a Python package designed for flexible tensor network computations.</description>

      <title>Entangled two-proton emission from 16Ne and its sensitivity to diproton correlation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss how the spin correlation, which reflects the quantum entanglement between two fermions, can serve as a probe of diproton correlation in the two-proton ($2p$) emission. We investigated the 16Ne nucleus using the time-dependent three-body (14O + 2p) model, and found that the $2p$-spin correlation exceeded the limit of local-hidden-variable (LHV) theory when the initial state had a spin-singlet diproton configuration. In contrast, for other configurations, it was remarkably reduced. This suggests that a strong initial diproton correlation is essential to generate a spin correlation nearly identical to that of a pure spin-singlet diproton. Such sensitivity indicates that $2p$-spin correlation can serve as a sensitive probe of diproton configurations, which could facilitate future studies on quantum entanglement and spin-dependent phenomena in atomic nuclei as well as in broader multi-fermion systems.</description>

      <title>Higher-form entanglement asymmetry. Part I. The limits of symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entanglement asymmetry is a relative entropy that faithfully diagnoses symmetry breaking in quantum states, possibly within a spatial subregion. In this work, we extend such framework to higher-form symmetries and compute entanglement asymmetry in theories with spontaneously-broken continuous zero- and higher-form symmetries. One of our central results is an entropic Coleman--Mermin--Wagner theorem, for $0$- and $p$-form symmetries, valid also on subregions, which forbids spontaneous breaking of continuous $p$-form symmetries in spacetime dimensions $d\leq p+2$. Our theorem not only qualifies symmetry breaking, it also quantifies it: spontaneous breaking triggers a nonvanishing entanglement asymmetry that grows monotonically towards the infrared, and counts the number of Goldstone fields. Along the way, we derive standalone results concerning the entanglement entropy of Goldstone bosons and gauge fields.</description>

      <title>Tensor network approaches for plasma dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of plasmas are governed by a set of non-linear differential equations which remain challenging to solve directly for large 2D and 3D problems. Here we investigate how tensor networks could be applied to plasmas described by the Vlasov-Maxwell system of equations and investigate parameter regimes which show promise for efficient simulations. We show for low-dimensional problems that the simplest form of tensor networks known as a Matrix Product State performs sufficiently well, however in regimes with a strong permanent magnetic field or high-dimensional problems one may need to consider alternative tensor network geometries. We conclude the study of the Vlasov-Maxwell system with the application of tensor networks to an industrially relevant test case and validate our results against state of the art plasma solvers based on Particle-In-Cell codes. We also extend the application of tensor networks to the alternative plasma description of Magnetohydrodynamics and outline how this can be encoded using Matrix Product States.</description>

      <title>Full-field-of-view aberration correction for large arrays of focused beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose and implement an aberration correction method for the creation of extended arrays of spots well beyond the isoplanatic region of any optical system. The method relies on an extensive calibration of aberrations in terms of Zernike polynomials over the full accessible field of an optical system. We introduce a modified Gerchberg-Saxton algorithm for generating holographic phase masks creating fully corrected arbitrary arrays of spots. By applying the method to an aspherical lens, and using a liquid-crystal spatial light modulator (SLM), we increase the aberration-free field of view from 50 to 500 $\mu$m, only limited by the largest diffraction angles accessible to the SLM. This opens new perspectives for the generation of large arrays of optical tweezers, especially for neutral atom based quantum processors and simulators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Analog coprocessors for neural networks are an intensively developing field. They provide approximate results of computations for relatively low energy cost and at high speed. We show that a set of ring resonators with Brillouin interaction between photons and phonons, being coupled to a waveguide, can be used to implement matrix-vector multiplication. The input vector is formed by occupancies of the anti-Stokes optical modes pumped via spontaneous Brillouin scattering, i.e, scattering on thermal phonons. Brillouin scattering rates and coupling constants between ring resonators and the waveguide form the matrix. The system allows for parallel computations in frequency band.</description>

      <title>Magneto-optical Kerr effect in pump-probe setups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a general theoretical framework for computing the time-resolved magneto-optical Kerr effect in ultrafast pump-probe setups, formulated within the Dynamical Projective Operatorial Approach (DPOA) and its application to the generalized linear-response theory for pumped systems. Furthermore, we exploit this formalism to express the post-pump optical conductivity and consequently the Kerr rotation in terms of the time-evolved single-particle density matrix (SPDM), providing a transparent and computationally efficient description of photo-excited multi-band systems. This extension, in addition to its lower computational cost, has the advantage of allowing the inclusion of phenomenological damping. We illustrate the formalism using both (i) a two-band tight-binding model, which captures the essential physics of ultrafast spin-charge dynamics and the Kerr rotation, and (ii) weakly spin-polarized germanium, as a realistic playground with a complex band structure. The results demonstrate that, by exploiting DPOA and/or its SPDM extension, one can reliably reproduce both the short-time features under the pump-pulse envelope and the long-time dynamics after excitation, offering a versatile framework for analyzing time-resolved magneto-optical Kerr effect experiments in complex materials. Moreover, this analysis clearly shows that the Kerr rotation can be used to deduce experimentally the relevant n-photon resonances for a given specific material.</description>

      <title>Correlated many-body quantum dynamics of the Peregrine soliton</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the correlated dynamics underlying the formation of the quantum Peregrine soliton, a prototypical rogue-wave excitation, utilizing interaction quenches from repulsive to attractive couplings in an ultracold bosonic gas confined in a one-dimensional box trap. The latter emulates the so-called semi-classical initial conditions and the associated gradient catastrophe scenario facilitating the emergence of a high-density, doubly localized waveform. The ensuing multi-orbital variant of the Peregrine soliton features notable deviations from its mean-field sibling, including a reduced peak amplitude, wider core, absence of the side density dips, and earlier formation times. Moreover, Peregrine soliton generation yields coherence losses, while experiencing two-body bunching within each of its sides which show anti-bunching between each other. Controllable seeding of the Peregrine soliton is also demonstrated by tuning the atom number or the box length, while reducing the latter favors the generation of the time-periodic Kuznetsov-Ma breather. Our results highlight that correlations reshape the morphology of rogue-waves in the genuinely quantum, non-integrable realm, while setting the stage for the emergent field of quantum dispersive hydrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Multi-messenger tracking of coherence loss during bond breaking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coupled electronic and nuclear motions govern chemical reactions, yet disentangling their interplay during bond rupture remains challenging. Here we follow the light-induced fragmentation of Br$_2$ using a coincidence-based multi-messenger approach. A UV pulse prepares the dissociative state, and strong-field ionization probes the evolving system. Coincident measurement of three-dimensional photoion and photoelectron momenta provides real-time access to both the instantaneous internuclear separation and the accompanying reorganization of the electronic structure, allowing us to determine the timescale of bond breaking. We find that electronic rearrangement concludes well before the nuclei reach the bond-breaking distance, revealing a hierarchy imposed by electron-nuclear coupling. Supported by semiclassical modelling, the results show that the stretched Br$_2$ molecule behaves as a two-centre interferometer in which the loss of coherence between atomic centres encodes the coupled evolution of electrons and nuclei. Our work establishes a general framework for imaging ultrafast electron-nuclear dynamics in molecules.</description>

      <title>Quantum Readiness in Latin American High Schools: Curriculum Compatibility and Enabling Conditions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The accelerating global development of quantum technologies strengthens the case for introducing quantum computing concepts before university. Yet in Latin America, there is no consolidated, region wide integration of quantum computing into secondary education, and the feasibility conditions for doing so remain largely unexamined. This paper proposes a qualitative, comparative framework to assess academic readiness for quantum education across six countries - Peru, Bolivia, Chile, Argentina, Brazil, and Colombia - grounded in the relationship between curriculum compatibility and enabling conditions spanning institutional capacity, teacher preparation, infrastructure, and equity. Using official curricula, policy documents, national statistics, and educational reports, we apply structured qualitative coding and a 1-5 ordinal scoring system to generate a cross country diagnosis. The findings reveal substantial regional asymmetries: among the six countries studied, Chile emerges as the most institutionally prepared for progressive quantum education integration, while the remaining countries exhibit varying combinations of curricular gaps and fragmented but promising enabling conditions. Building on this diagnosis, we propose a country sensitive, regionally coordinated roadmap for staged implementation, beginning with teacher development and pilot centers, leveraging open source platforms and local language resources, and scaling toward gradual curricular integration. This work establishes a baseline for future quantitative and mixed method studies evaluating learning outcomes, motivation, and scalable models for quantum education in Latin America.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a quantum field approach to neutrino oscillations, the neutrino is treated as a propagator, while the external initial and final particle states are described by covariant wave packets. For the asymptotic behavior on short and long macroscopic baselines, the wave packet modified neutrino propagator is expressed through asymptotic series in powers of dimensionless Lorentz and rotation invariant variables. In both regimes, leading-order corrections violate the classical inverse-square law and lead to a decrease in the neutrino-induced event rate. The possibility that the so-called reactor antineutrino anomaly can, at least partially, be explained within this approach is discussed.</description>

      <title>Entropy of Schwinger pair production in time-dependent Sauter pulse electric field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate entropy of electron-positron pair production in time-dependent Sauter pulse electric field. Both cases of pair longitudinal momentum only and full momentum consideration are examined. We further examine three types of entropy, one is the usual entanglement entropy $S_{\text{E}}$, the other two extensions are thermal distribution entropy $S_{\text{Th}}$, and that with the chemical potential correction, $S_{\text{Th,CP}}$. For short pulse, $S_{\text{E}}$ is higher than $S_{\text{Th}}$ and vice versa for long pulse. The chemical potential causes the single-particle average thermal distribution entropy $\frac{S_{\text{Th,CP}}}{N}$ to exhibit non-monotonic behavior, similar to the single-particle average entanglement entropy $\frac{S_{\text{E}}}{N}$ in the short-pulse range. In the full momentum case, we calculate the thermal distribution entropy $S_{\text{Th, U}}$ via introducing the Unruh temperature as the local effective temperature. We find that both $S_{\text{Th, U}}$ and $S_{\text{E}}$ saturate asymptotically to the constant while the former has a larger asymptotic value. The results presented in this study reveals that the different entropies have some delicate relationships among them.</description>

      <title>Photoacoustic model for laser-induced acoustic desorption of nanoparticles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Laser-induced acoustic desorption (LIAD) enables loading nanoparticles into optical traps under vacuum for levitated optomechanics experiments. Current LIAD systems rely on empirical optimization using available laboratory lasers rather than systematic theoretical design, resulting in large systems incompatible with portable or space-based applications. We develop a theoretical framework using the photoacoustic wave equation to model acoustic wave generation and propagation in metal substrates, enabling systematic optimization of laser parameters. The model identifies key scaling relationships: surface acceleration scales as $\tau^{-2}$ with pulse duration, while acoustic diffraction sets fundamental limits on optimal spot size $w \gtrsim \sqrt{v\tau d}$. Material figures of merit combine thermal expansion and optical absorption properties, suggesting alternatives to traditional aluminum substrates. The framework validates well against experimental data and demonstrates that compact laser systems with sub-nanosecond pulse durations can achieve performance competitive with existing laboratory-scale implementations despite orders-of-magnitude lower pulse energies. This enables rational design of minimal LIAD systems for practical applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the radial harmonic oscillator problem in the position-dependent mass background of the type $m(\alpha;r) = (1+\alpha r^2)^{-2}$, $\alpha&gt;0$, can be solved by using a point canonical transformation mapping the corresponding Schr\"odinger equation onto that of the P\"oschl-Teller I potential with constant mass. The radial harmonic oscillator problem with position-dependent mass is shown to exhibit a deformed shape invariance property in a deformed supersymmetric framework. The inverse point canonical transformation then provides some exactly-solvable rational extensions of the radial harmonic oscillator with position-dependent mass associated with $X_m$-Jacobi exceptional orthogonal polynomials of type I, II, or III. The extended potentials of type I and II are proved to display deformed shape invariance. The spectrum and wavefunctions of the radial harmonic oscillator potential and its extensions are shown to go over to well-known results when the deforming parameter $\alpha$ goes to zero.</description>

      <title>Landscape Analysis of Excited States Calculation over Quantum Computers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) is one of the most promising algorithms for low-lying eigenstates calculation on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers. Specifically, VQE has achieved great success for ground state calculations of a Hamiltonian. However, excited state calculations arising in quantum chemistry and condensed matter often requires solving more challenging problems than the ground state as these states are generally further away from a mean-field description, and involve less straightforward optimization to avoid the variational collapse to the ground state. Maintaining orthogonality between low-lying eigenstates is a key algorithmic hurdle. In this work, we analyze three VQE models that embed orthogonality constraints through specially designed cost functions, avoiding the need for external enforcement of orthogonality between states. Notably, these formulations possess the desirable property that any local minimum is also a global minimum, helping address optimization difficulties. We conduct rigorous landscape analyses of the models' stationary points and local minimizers, theoretically guaranteeing their favorable properties and providing analytical tools applicable to broader VQE methods. A comprehensive comparison between the three models is also provided, considering their quantum resource requirements and classical optimization complexity.</description>

Abstract: The implications of the root singularity of the vacuum polarization tensor near the first pair creation threshold on blackbody radiation are investigated for magnetic fields above the characteristic scale of quantum electrodynamics. We show that the vacuum birefringence in such a strong background leads to an anisotropic behavior of the Planck radiation law. The thermal spectrum is characterized by a resonance that competes with the Wien maximum, causing a crossover in the low $\gamma$-spectrum of the heat radiation. A light state resembling a many-body condensate with slow motion is linked to the high-temperature phase. This novel state of radiation may coexist with nuclear or quark matter in a neutron star's core, increasing its compactness and influencing its stability.</description>

      <title>Explicit finite-time illustration of improper unitary evolution for the Klein--Gordon field in de Sitter space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is known that quantum field theories in curved spacetime suffer from a number of pathologies, including the inability to relate states on different spatial slices by proper unitary time-evolution operators. In this article, we illustrate this issue by describing the canonical quantisation of a free scalar field in de Sitter space and explicitly demonstrating that the vacuum at a given time slice is unitarily inequivalent to that at any other time. In particular, we find that, if both background and Hamiltonian dynamics are taken into account, this inequivalence holds even for infinitesimally small time steps and not only in the asymptotic time limits.</description>

      <title>Field Quantisations in Schwarzschild Spacetime: Theory versus Low-Energy Experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-relativistic quantum particles in the Earth's gravitational field are successfully described by the Schr\"{o}dinger equation with Newton's gravitational potential. Particularly, quantum mechanics is in agreement with such experiments as free fall and quantum interference induced by gravity. However, quantum mechanics is a low-energy approximation to quantum field theory. The latter is successful by the description of high-energy experiments. Gravity is embedded in quantum field theory through the general-covariance principle. This framework is known in the literature as quantum field theory in curved spacetime, where the concept of a quantum particle is, though, ambiguous. In this article, we study in this framework how a Hawking particle moves in the far-horizon region of Schwarzschild spacetime by computing its propagator. We find this propagator differs from that which follows from the path-integral formalism -- the formalism which adequately describes both free fall and quantum interference induced by gravity.</description>

      <title>Model-Based Real-Time Synthesis of Acousto-Optically Generated Laser-Beam Patterns and Tweezer Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Acousto-optic deflectors (AOD) enable spatiotemporal control of laser beams through diffraction at an ultrasonic grating that is controllable by radio-frequency (rf) waveforms. These devices are a widely used tool for high-bandwidth random-access scanning applications, such as optical tweezers in quantum technology. A single AOD can generate multiple optical tweezers by multitone rf input in one dimension. Two-dimensional (2D) patterns can be realized with two perpendicularly oriented AODs. As the acousto-optical response depends nonlinearly on the applied frequency components, phases, and amplitudes, and in addition experiences dimensional coupling in 2D setups, intensity regulation becomes a unique challenge. Guided by coupled-wave theory and experimental observations, we derive a compute-efficient model which we implement on a graphics processing unit. Only one-time sampling of single-tone laser-power calibration is needed for model parameter determination, allowing for straight-forward integration into optical instruments. We implement and experimentally validate an open-loop diffraction efficiency control system that enables programmable 2D multibeam trajectories with intensity control applied at every time step during digital signal generation, overcoming the limited flexibility, pattern-size constraints, and bandwidth limitations of methods using precalculation and precalibration of a predefined pattern set or closed-loop feedback. The system is capable of stable real-time waveform streaming of arrays with up to 50 x 50 tweezers with minimal time resolution of 1.4 ns (700 MS/s) and a peak latency below 257 microseconds for execution of newly requested patterns. Reactive, real-time 2D multibeam laser patterning and scanning with strict intensity matching will substantially benefit parallelization and increasing data rates in materials processing, microscopy, and optical tweezers.</description>

      <title>Revival Dynamics from Equilibrium States: Scars from Chords in SYK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a novel framework to build quantum many-body scar states in bipartite systems characterized by perfect correlation between the Hamiltonians governing the two sides. By means of a Krylov construction, we build an interaction term which supports a tower of equally-spaced energy eigenstates. This gives rise to finite-time revivals whenever the system is initialized in a purification of a generic equilibrium state. The dynamics is universally characterized, and is largely independent of the specific details of the Hamiltonians defining the individual partitions. By considering the two-sided chord states of the double-scaled SYK model, we find an approximate realization of this framework. We analytically study the revival dynamics, finding rigid motion for wavepackets localized on the spectrum of a single SYK copy. These findings are tested numerically for systems of finite size, showing excellent agreement with the analytical predictions.</description>

      <title>Signatures of real-space geometry, topology, and metric tensor in quantum transport in periodically corrugated spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The motion of a quantum particle constrained to a two-dimensional non-compact Riemannian manifold with non-trivial metric can be described by a flat-space Schroedinger-type equation at the cost of introducing local mass and metric and geometry-induced effective potential with no classical counterpart. For a metric tensor periodically modulated along one dimension, the formation of bands is demonstrated and transport-related quantities are derived. Using S-matrix approach, the quantum conductance along the manifold is calculated and contrasted with conventional quantum transport methods in flat spaces. The topology, e.g. whether the manifold is simply connected, compact or non-compact shows up in global, non-local properties such as the Aharonov-Bohm phase. The results vividly demonstrate emergent phenomena due to the interplay of reduced-dimensionality, particles quantum nature, geometry, and topology.</description>

      <title>Electric field diagnostics in a continuous rf plasma using Rydberg-EIT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a non-invasive spectroscopic technique to measure electric fields in plasma, leveraging large polarizabilities and Stark shifts of Rydberg atoms. Rydberg Stark shifts are measured with high precision using narrow-linewidth lasers via Electromagnetically Induced Transparency (EIT) of rubidium vapor seeded into a continuous, inductively coupled radio-frequency (rf) plasma in a few mTorr of argon gas. Without plasma, the Rydberg-EIT spectra exhibit rf modulation sidebands caused by electric- and magnetic-dipole transitions in the rf drive coil. With the plasma present, the rf modulation sidebands vanish due to screening of the rf drive field from the plasma interior. The lineshapes of the EIT spectra in the plasma reflect the plasma's Holtsmark microfield distribution, allowing us to determine plasma density and collisional line broadening over a range of pressures and rf drive powers. The work is expected to have applications in non-invasive spatio-temporal electric-field diagnostics of low-pressure plasma, plasma sheaths, process plasma and dusty plasma.</description>

      <title>Fighting non-locality with non-locality: microcausality and boundary conditions in QED</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In gauge theories, globally charged observables necessarily depend non-locally on the kinematical fields, with this dependence extending to the asymptotic boundary of spacetime. Despite this, we show that a subset of such observables can be consistently regarded as local to the bulk, in a manner that respects microcausality and leaves locality properties of uncharged observables untouched. A sufficient condition for this is to impose kinematically non-local boundary conditions on the large gauge sector of the theory, and to invoke a relational notion of localisation for observables. This reveals a relatively underappreciated link between boundary conditions, and different notions of microcausality and locality. We develop this point through a detailed case study in scalar QED, describing non-local boundary conditions that allow a large family of observables on a codimension-1 bulk surface to be viewed as local to that surface, despite being dressed by asymptotic Wilson lines. We show that this property continues to hold within a perturbative quantisation of the theory, and we argue that this leads to a consistent local net of algebras that includes these charged observables in bulk algebras. We explain how this setup may be understood in terms of a preferred dynamical reference frame for small gauge transformations appearing in the boundary conditions. Many features of the theory (such as microcausality, the vacuum state, and the net of algebras of observables) depend on the choice of this frame, and we briefly discuss some repercussions of this for algebraic formulations of QFT. While our analysis is performed in QED, we expect our results to carry over qualitatively to more complicated theories including gravity.</description>

      <title>Current fluctuations in open quantum systems: Bridging the gap between quantum continuous measurements and full counting statistics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.04270v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Continuously measured quantum systems are characterized by an output current, in the form of a stochastic and correlated time series which conveys crucial information about the underlying quantum system. The many tools used to describe current fluctuations are scattered across different communities: quantum opticians often use stochastic master equations, while a prevalent approach in condensed matter physics is provided by full counting statistics. These, however, are simply different sides of the same coin. Our goal with this tutorial is to provide a unified toolbox for describing current fluctuations. This not only provides novel insights, by bringing together different fields in physics, but also yields various analytical and numerical tools for computing quantities of interest. We illustrate our results with various pedagogical examples, and connect them with topical fields of research, such as waiting-time statistics, quantum metrology, thermodynamic uncertainty relations, quantum point contacts and Maxwell's demons.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Dynamical Genesis of Quantum Entanglement in Linear Systems: Internal causality breaking in the reduced subsystem evolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09368v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Utilizing the general theory of open quantum systems to investigate the exact dynamical evolution of simple bilinear systems, we discover a mechanism of the dynamical genesis of quantum entanglement. We focus in detail on the exact quantum evolution dynamics of two photonic modes (or any two bosonic modes) coupled to each other through a linear interaction, as the simplest system of open quantum systems that we have investigated in the last two decades. Such a linear coupling alone fails to produce two-mode entanglement. We also start with an initially separable pure state of the two modes. By solving exactly the quantum equation of motion without relying on the probabilistic interpretation, we find that when the initial state of one mode is different from a coherent state (a minimum uncertainty wave packet with equal variance in the conjugate quadratures that corresponds to a well-defined classically "particle"), the causality in the time-evolution of each mode is internally violated. It also leads to the emergence of quantum entanglement between the two modes. The lack of causality is the nature of statistics. We discover that it is the internal violation of causality in the reduced (subsystem) dynamical evolution that results in the emergence of entanglement and statistic probability in quantum mechanics, even though the dynamical evolution of the whole system completely obeys the deterministic Schr\"{o}dinger equation. This conclusion is valid for the quantum dynamics of more complicated composite systems. It may provide the fundamental mechanism of the dynamical genesis for both the entanglement and the statistical probability within the deterministic framework of quantum mechanics, which is the longest-standing problem that has not been fully understood since the birth of quantum mechanics.</description>

Abstract: Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) is widely used in near-term hardware. However, their performances remain limited by the poor trainability and are dependent on random parameter initialization. In this work, we propose a warm start method inspired by imaginary time evolution, allowing for determining initial parameters that prioritize lower energy states in a resource-efficient way. Using classical simulations, we demonstrate that this warm start method significantly improves the success rate and reduces the number of iterations required for the convergence of VQE. The numerical results also indicate that the warm start approach effectively mitigates statistical errors arising from a finite number of measurements, and to a certain extent alleviates the effect of barren plateaus.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01545v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Floquet quantum circuits are able to realise a wide range of non-equilibrium quantum states, exhibiting quantum chaos, topological order and localisation. In this work, we investigate the stability of operator localisation and emergence of chaos in random Floquet-Clifford circuits subjected to unitary perturbations which drive them away from the Clifford limit. We construct a nearest-neighbour Clifford circuit with a brickwork pattern and study the effect of including disordered non-Clifford gates. The perturbations are uniformly sampled from single-qubit unitaries with probability $p$ on each qubit. We show that the interacting model exhibits strong localisation of operators for $0 \le p &lt; 1$ that is characterised by the fragmentation of operator space into disjoint sectors due to the appearance of wall configurations. Such walls give rise to emergent local integrals of motion for the circuit that we construct exactly. We analytically establish the stability of localisation against generic perturbations and calculate the average length of operator spreading tunable by $p$. Although our circuit is not separable across any bi-partition, we further show that the operator localisation leads to an entanglement bottleneck, where initially unentangled states remain weakly entangled across typical fragment boundaries. Finally, we study the spectral form factor (SFF) to characterise the chaotic properties of the operator fragments and spectral fluctuations as a probe of non-ergodicity. In the $p = 1$ model, the emergence of a fragmentation time scale is found before random matrix theory sets in after which the SFF can be approximated by that of the circular unitary ensemble. Our work provides an explicit description of quantum phases in operator dynamics and circuit ergodicity which can be realised on current NISQ devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11201v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spectral gap of local random quantum circuits is a fundamental property that determines how close the moments of the circuit's unitaries match those of a Haar random distribution. When studying spectral gaps, it is common to bound these quantities using tools from statistical mechanics or via quantum information-based inequalities. By focusing on the second moment of one-dimensional unitary circuits where nearest neighboring gates act on sets of qudits (with open and closed boundary conditions), we show that one can exactly compute the associated spectral gaps. Indeed, having access to their functional form allows us to prove several important results, such as the fact that the spectral gap for closed boundary condition is exactly the square of the gap for open boundaries, as well as improve on previously known bounds for approximate design convergence. Finally, we verify our theoretical results by numerically computing the spectral gap for systems of up to 70 qubits, as well as comparing them to gaps of random orthogonal and symplectic circuits.</description>

Abstract: Symmetry postulates play a crucial role in various approaches to reconstruct quantum theory from a few basic principles. Discrete and continuous symmetries are under consideration. The continuous case better matches the physical needs for mathematical models of dynamical processes and is studied here. Applying the representation theory of the orthomodular lattices and a generalized version of Gleason's theorem for Jordan matrix algebras, we show that the continuous symmetry, together with three further requirements, entails that the underlying mathematical structure of a finite-dimensional generalized probabilistic theory becomes a simple Euclidean Jordan algebra. The further requirements are: spectrality, a strong state space and a condition called gbit property.</description>

Abstract: Mobility edges (MEs) are critical boundaries in disordered quantum systems that separate localized from extended states, significantly affecting transport properties and phase transitions. Although MEs are well-understood in single-photon systems, their manifestation in many-body contexts remains an active area of research. In this work, we investigate a one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard chain with a quasiperiodic potential modulating photon-photon interactions, effectively creating a mosaic lattice. We identify MEs for doublon states (i.e, bound photon pairs resulting from strong interactions) within the two-photon subspace. Our analytical solutions and numerical simulations confirm the existence of these MEs, extending single-photon MEs theories to the two-photon regime. Additionally, we analyze the dynamics of two emitters coupled to the waveguide, enabling the emission of supercorrelated photon pairs into the waveguide. Our findings reveal that coupling to extended states results in Markovian dynamics, characterized by exponentially supercorrelated decay, while coupling to localized states gives rise to non-Markovian dynamics, marked by suppressed decay and persistent oscillations. Here, a transition from Markovian to non-Markovian behavior occurs around the MEs of the doublons. Finally, we propose a feasible experimental implementation using superconducting circuits, providing a platform to observe the interplay between interactions and disorder in quantum systems.</description>

Abstract: Giant atoms, which couple to the environment at multiple discrete points, exhibit various nontrivial phenomena in quantum optics due to their nonlocal couplings. In this study, we propose a one-dimensional cross-stitch ladder lattice featuring both a dispersive band and a flat band. By modulating the relative phase between the coupling points, the giant atom selectively interacts with either band. First, we analyze the scenario where the dispersive and flat bands intersect at two points, and the atomic frequency lies within the band. Unlike the small atom, which simultaneously interacts with both bands, a single giant atom with a controllable phase interacts exclusively with the dispersive or flat band. Second, in the bandgap regime, where two atoms interact through bound-state overlaps manifesting as dipole-dipole interactions, we demonstrate that giant atoms enable deterministic long-range hopping and energy exchange with higher fidelity compared to small atoms. These findings provide promising applications in quantum information processing, offering enhanced controllability and selectivity for quantum systems and devices.</description>

      <title>Near-deterministic photon entanglement from a spin qudit in silicon using third quantisation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01096v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unlike other quantum hardware, photonic quantum architectures can produce millions of qubits from a single device. However, controlling photonic qubits remains challenging, even at small scales, due to their weak interactions, making non-deterministic gates in linear optics unavoidable. Nevertheless, a single photon can readily spread over multiple modes and create entanglement within the multiple modes deterministically. Rudolph's concept of third quantization leverages this feature by evolving multiple single-photons into multiple modes, distributing them uniformly and randomly to different parties, and creating multipartite entanglement without interactions between photons or non-deterministic gates. This method requires only classical communication and deterministic entanglement within multi-mode single-photon states and enables universal quantum computing. The multipartite entanglement generated within the third quantization framework is nearly deterministic, where ``deterministic'' is achieved in the asymptotic limit of a large system size. In this work, we propose a near-term experiment using antimony donor in a silicon chip to realize third quantization. Utilizing the eight energy levels of antimony, one can generate two eight-mode single-photon states independently and distribute them to parties. This enables a random multipartite Bell-state experiment, achieving a Bell state with an upper-bound efficiency of 87.5% among 56 random pairs without non-deterministic entangling gates. This approach opens alternative pathways for silicon-based photonic quantum computing.</description>

Abstract: Understanding the energy cost of quantum measurement process and its connection to the measurement performance faces the challenge of modeling the objectification process. The latter, turns the measurement result into an objective fact, available to independent observers, and is responsible for the measurement irreversibility. To address this issue, we propose and analyze a dynamical model of quantum measurement, able to capture nonideal (weak and inefficient) measurements. In this model, the objectification is induced by a contact with a macroscopic reservoir at equilibrium which is responsible for the redundant broadcast of the measurement outcome (producing a Spectrum Broadcast Structure (SBS) state) while inducing decoherence in the pointer basis, in the line of the theory of quantum Darwinism. We analyze the performance of the obtained measurement process by introducing figures of merit to quantify the strength of the measurement and its efficiency. We also derive and a lower bound on the measurement work cost that we can relate to the measurement quality. We take as an illustration the readout of a qubit via its coupling to a harmonic oscillator. We investigate the long sequences of extremely short and weak measurements (a.k.a continuous measurements), to find under which conditions they converge to an ideal (projective) measurement and analyze their work cost. Surprisingly, we find that a sequence converging to projective measurement has a much larger work cost than an equivalent strong measurement obtained from a single intense interaction with the apparatus. We extend this result to a large class of models owing to scaling arguments. Our analysis offers new insights into the trade-offs between measurement strength, energy consumption, and information extraction in quantum measurement protocols.</description>

      <title>Measurement-device-independent Schmidt number certification of all entangled states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13296v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bipartite quantum states with higher Schmidt numbers have been shown to outperform those with lower Schmidt numbers in various quantum information processing tasks, highlighting the operational advantage of entanglement dimensionality. Certifying the Schmidt number of such states is therefore crucial for efficient resource utilisation. Ideally, this certification should rely as little as possible on the certifying devices to ensure robustness against their potential imperfections. Fully device-independent certification via Bell-nonlocal games offers strong robustness but suffers from fundamental limitations: it cannot certify the Schmidt number of all entangled states. We demonstrate that this insufficiency of Bell-nonlocal games is not limited to entangled states that do not exhibit Bell-nonlocality. Specifically, we prove the existence of Bell-nonlocal states whose Schmidt number cannot be certified by any Bell-nonlocal game when the parties are restricted to local projective measurements. To overcome this, we develop a measurement-device-independent certification method based on semiquantum nonlocal games, which assume trusted preparation devices but treat measurement devices as black boxes. We prove that for any bipartite state with Schmidt number exceeding $r$, there exists a semiquantum nonlocal game that can certify its Schmidt number. Finally, we provide an explicit construction of such a semiquantum nonlocal game based on an optimal Schmidt number witness operator.</description>

      <title>Practical Unclonable Encryption with Continuous Variables</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02648v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose the first continuous-variable (CV) unclonable encryption scheme, extending the paradigm of quantum encryption of classical messages (QECM) to CV systems. In our construction, a classical message is first encrypted classically and then encoded using an errorcorrecting code. Each bit of the codeword is mapped to a CV mode by creating a coherent state which is squeezed in the q or p quadrature direction, with a small displacement that encodes the bit. The squeezing directions are part of the encryption key. We prove unclonability in the framework introduced by Broadbent and Lord, via a reduction of the cloning game to a CV monogamy-of-entanglement game. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our scheme can be readily implemented with current technology. By incorporating realistic imperfections such as channel noise and detector inefficiencies, we show that the protocol remains robust under these conditions.</description>

Abstract: Recent work by Vaidman [Phys. Rev. A 86,040101 (2012)] showed that Aharonov-Bohm effect can be explained in terms of local fields, thus effectively restating an old problem of physicality of potentials. In this work, we propose an argument demonstrating the physicality of electromagnetic potential (upon the assumption of locality) based on the causal structure in flux quantization setup. Crucially, we discuss the fundamental difference between the considered setup and the Aharonov-Bohm experiment that allows for avoiding Vaidman's loophole in our scenario.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22604v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) is a novel multi-layer network model recognized for its efficiency in neuromorphic computing, where synapses between neurons are trained linearly. Computations in KAN are performed by generating a polynomial vector from the state vector and layer-wise trained synapses, enabling efficient processing. While KAN can be implemented on quantum computers using block encoding and Quantum Signal Processing, these methods require fault-tolerant quantum devices, making them impractical for current Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) hardware. We propose the Enhanced Variational Quantum Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (EVQKAN) to overcome this limitation, which emulates KAN through variational quantum algorithms. The EVQKAN ansatz employs a tiling technique to emulate layer matrices, leading to significantly higher accuracy compared to conventional Variational Quantum Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (VQKAN) and Quantum Neural Networks (QNN), even with a smaller number of layers. EVQKAN achieves superior performance with a single-layer architecture, whereas QNN and VQKAN typically struggle. Additionally, EVQKAN eliminates the need for Quantum Signal Processing, enhancing its robustness to noise and making it well-suited for practical deployment on NISQ-era quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Double-bracket algorithm for quantum signal processing without post-selection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01077v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum signal processing (QSP), a framework for implementing matrix-valued polynomials, is a fundamental primitive in various quantum algorithms. Despite its versatility, a potentially underappreciated challenge is that all systematic protocols for implementing QSP rely on post-selection. This can impose prohibitive costs for tasks when amplitude amplification cannot sufficiently improve the success probability. For example, in the context of ground-state preparation, this occurs when using a too poor initial state. In this work, we introduce a new formula for implementing QSP transformations of Hermitian matrices, which requires neither auxiliary qubits nor post-selection. Rather, using approximation to the exact unitary synthesis, we leverage the theory of the double-bracket quantum algorithms to provide a new quantum algorithm for QSP, termed Double-Bracket QSP (DB-QSP). The algorithm requires the energy and energetic variance of the state to be measured at each step and has a recursive structure, which leads to circuit depths that can grow super exponentially with the degree of the polynomial. With these strengths and caveats in mind, DB-QSP should be viewed as complementing the established QSP toolkit. In particular, DB-QSP can deterministically implement low-degree polynomials to "warm start" QSP methods involving post-selection.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05567v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Practical distributed quantum computing and error correction require quantum networks with high-qubit-rate, high-fidelity, and low-reconfiguration-latency. Unfortunately, current approaches are limited by fundamental constraints: single-channel entanglement rates remain at the MHz level with millisecond-level reconfiguration, which is insufficient for fault-tolerant distributed quantum computing. Here, we propose a quantum network architecture that leverages reconfigurable quantum interfaces and wavelength-selective switches to overcome bandwidth and latency constraints. By tuning the frequency and temporal modes of photonic qubits across dense wavelength division multiplexing (DWDM) channels, our protocol achieves an entanglement generation rate of up to 183.4 MHz based on our comprehensive modeling of the networked cold atom computing systems. Our architecture enables nanosecond-scale network reconfiguration with low loss, low infidelity, and high dimensionality. Our modeling and simulation are designed for deployable distributed quantum computing and error correction, integrating the quantum interface, network switching, circuit compilation, and execution into a unified framework. The proposed architecture is fully compatible with industry-standard DWDM infrastructure, providing a scalable and cost-effective foundation for distributed quantum computing.</description>

Abstract: Hybrid-quantum classical optimization has emerged as a promising direction for addressing financial decision problems under current quantum hardware constraints. In this work we present a practical end-to-end portfolio optimization pipeline that combines (i) a continuous mean-variance and Sharpe-ratio formulation, (ii) a QUBO/CQM-based discrete asset selection stage solved using D-Wave's hybrid quantum annealing solver, (iii) classical convex optimization for computing optimal asset weights, and (iv) a quarterly rebalancing mechanism. Rather than claiming quantum advantage, our goal is to evaluate the feasibility and integration of these components within a deployable financial workflow. We empirically compare our hybrid pipeline against a fund manager in real time and indexes used in Indian stock market. The results indicate that the proposed framework can construct diversified portfolios and achieve competitive returns. We also report computational considerations and scalability observations drawn from the hybrid solver behaviour. While the experiments are limited to moderate sized portfolios dictated by current annealing hardware and QUBO embedding constraints, the study illustrates how quantum assisted selection and classical allocation can be combined coherently in a real-world setting. This work emphasizes methodological reproducibility and practical applicability, and aims to serve as a step toward larger-scale financial optimization workflows as quantum annealers continue to mature.</description>

Abstract: The measurement processes that are traditionally described within the realm of non-relativistic quantum mechanics are transcribed into the covariant framework of Cartan's space, the four-valued representation space of the restricted conformal group for special relativity. It is assumed at the outset that the non-relativistic quantum measurement mechanisms of state reductions as well as the definition of Born probabilities should remain unaltered when the passage to the covariant framework is worked out. The correlations between observations registered in different spacetime frames, concerning intermediate steps and outcomes of microscopic measurements, are attained through the implementation of the orthochronous proper Poincar\'e subgroup of an appropriate realization of SU(2,2). It appears that the overall work may supply an elementary theoretical background to the construction of relativistic quantum computational gates whilst suggesting that the non-locality feature of the old quantum mechanics should be reconsidered within a relativistic formulation. The important question as to whether quantum computational processes should bear an invariant character is then raised.</description>

Abstract: We analyze the fundamental limits of phase measurement precision, provided by the standard (single- and two-arm) optical interferometers using the Gaussian (squeezed coherent) quantum states of the probing light. We consider two types of the measurements of the output light -- the homodyne measurement and the non-linear threshold measurement that provides the sensitivity saturating the quantum Cramer-Rao bound.
  For all considered cases, we calculate the best sensitivity $\Delta\phi_0$ achievable at some given value of phase and the range $\delta\phi$ around this value within which the sensitivity is close to $\Delta\phi_0$. We show that in all cases, the Heisenberg scaling $\Delta\phi = K/N$ can be reached, where $K\sim1$ is a numerical prefactor and $N$ is the mean photon number. We show also that $\delta\phi$ strongly depends on $K$.</description>

Abstract: Genuine multipartite entanglement (GME) represents the strongest form of entanglement in multipartite systems, providing significant advantages in various quantum information processing tasks. In this work, we propose an experimentally feasible scheme for detecting GME, based on the truncated moments of positive maps. Our method avoids the need for full state tomography, making it scalable for larger systems. We provide illustrative examples of both pure and mixed states to demonstrate the efficacy of our formalism in detecting inequivalent classes of tripartite genuine entanglement. We further demonstrate the detection of quadripartite genuine entanglement, underscoring the effectiveness of our method in identifying entanglement beyond the tripartite case. Finally, we present a proposal for realising these moments in real experiments.</description>

Abstract: The Quantum Internet is key for distributed quantum computing, by interconnecting multiple quantum processors into a virtual quantum computation system. This allows to scale the number of qubits, by overcoming the inherent limitations of noisy-intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. Thus, the Quantum Internet is the foundation for large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computation. Among the distributed architectures, Quantum Data Centers emerge as the most viable in the medium-term, since they integrate multiple quantum processors within a localized network infrastructure, by allowing modular design of quantum networking. We analyze the physical and topological constraints of Quantum Data Centers, by emphasizing the role of entanglement orchestrators in dynamically reconfiguring network topologies through local operations. We examine the major hardware challenge of quantum transduction, essential for interfacing heterogeneous quantum systems. Furthermore, we explore how interconnecting multiple Quantum Data Centers could enable large-scale quantum networks. We discuss the topological constraints of such a scaling and identify open challenges, including entanglement routing and synchronization. The carried analysis positions Quantum Data Centers as both a practical implementation platform and strategic framework for the future Quantum Internet.</description>

      <title>End-to-End Efficient Quantum Thermal and Ground State Preparation Made Simple</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05703v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose new quantum algorithms for thermal and ground state preparation based on system-bath interactions. These algorithms require only forward evolution under a system-bath Hamiltonian in which the bath is a single reusable ancilla qubit, making them especially well-suited for early fault-tolerant quantum devices. By carefully designing the bath and interaction Hamiltonians, we prove that the fixed point of the dynamics accurately approximates the desired quantum state. Furthermore, we establish theoretical guarantees on the mixing time, and thereby providing a rigorous justification for the end-to-end efficiency of system-bath interaction models in thermal and ground state preparation, for several physically relevant systems.</description>

      <title>Expressivity Limits in Quantum Walk-based Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05749v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum algorithms have emerged as a promising tool to solve combinatorial optimization problems. The quantum walk optimization algorithm (QWOA) is one such variational approach that has recently gained attention. In the broader context of variational quantum algorithms (VQAs), understanding the expressivity of the ansatz has proven critical for evaluating their performance. A key method to study this aspect involves analyzing the dimension of the dynamic Lie algebra (DLA). In this work, we derive novel upper bounds on the DLA dimension for QWOA applied to arbitrary optimization problems. Specifically, we show that the DLA dimension scales at most quadratically with the number of distinct eigenvalues of the problem Hamiltonian. As a consequence, our bound guarantees a polynomial DLA dimension with respect to the input size for optimization problems in the class $\mathsf{NPO}\text{-}\mathsf{PB}$. This result, coupled with recently established performance bounds for QWOA, allows us to identify complexity-theoretic conditions under which QWOA must be overparameterized to obtain optimal or approximate solutions for $\mathsf{NPO}\text{-}\mathsf{PB}$ problems.</description>

      <title>Unified quantification of entanglement and magic in information scrambling and their trade-off relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11969v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Entanglement and magic are among the most fundamental properties unique to quantum systems. Each quantity captures a different aspect of non-classical behavior, and each can be regarded as a resource within its own operational setting. However, the interrelation between them has not yet been fully clarified, and whether a more fundamental measure exists remains an open question. Addressing these issues is essential for deepening our understanding of quantumness. In this study, we establish a unified resource theory of information scrambling, consisting of two types: entanglement scrambling and magic scrambling. We introduce a measure that jointly characterizes both types of scrambling. This unified approach reveals a rigorous trade-off relation between entanglement and magic scrambling, as the exact maximum value of the proposed measure can be derived analytically. Furthermore, we quantify the scrambling capability of unitary transformations in terms of their ability to amplify this measure. Our work provides insights into the connection between entanglement and magic that extend beyond the context of information scrambling.</description>

      <title>Quantum Fisher information as a witness of non-Markovianity and criticality in the spin-boson model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16413v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quantum Fisher information, the quantum analogue of the classical Fisher information, is a central quantity in quantum metrology and quantum sensing due to its connection to parameter estimation and fidelity susceptibility. Using numerically exact methods applied to a paradigmatic open quantum system, the spin-boson model, we calculate both static and dynamical quantum Fisher information matrix elements with respect to spin-bath couplings and magnetic field strengths. As the spin-bath interaction increases, we first show that the coupling-coupling matrix elements relative to the ground state of the Hamiltonian are linked to the entanglement growth and signal the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless quantum phase transition through their non-monotonic behavior. We also point out that the static quantum Fisher information exhibits a non-perturbative behavior in the zero-coupling limit, which we justify with an analytic argument. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the time-dependent matrix elements can reveal non-Markovian effects as well as the transition from the coherent to incoherent regime at the Toulouse point, remaining robust under pure dephasing noise. Non-monotonic signatures of the quantum Fisher information matrix reflect changes in quantum resources such as entanglement and coherence, quantify non-Markovian behavior, and enable criticality-enhanced quantum sensing, thereby shedding light on key features of open quantum systems.</description>

Abstract: Simulating open quantum systems is key to understanding non-equilibrium processes, as persistent influence from the environment induces dissipation and can give rise to steady-state phase transitions. A common strategy is to embed the system-environment into a larger unitary framework, but this obscures the intrinsic complexity of the reduced system dynamics. Here, we investigate the computational complexity of simulating open quantum systems, focusing on two physically relevant parameters -- correlation length and mixing time -- and explore whether it can be comparable (or even lower) to that of simulating their closed counterparts. In particular, we study the role of dissipation in simulating open-system dynamics using both quantum and classical methods, where the classical complexity is characterised by the bond dimension and operator entanglement entropy. Our results show that dissipation affects correlation length and mixing time in distinct ways at intermediate and long timescales. Moreover, we observe numerically that in classical tensor network simulations, classical complexity does not decrease with stronger dissipation, revealing a separation between quantum and classical resource scaling.</description>

      <title>Direct measurement of the quantum geometric tensor in pseudo-Hermitian systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17043v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quantum geometric tensor (QGT) fundamentally encodes the geometry and topology of quantum states in both Hermitian and non-Hermitian regimes. While adiabatic perturbation theory links its real part (quantum metric) and imaginary part (Berry curvature) to energy fluctuations and generalized forces, respectively, in Hermitian systems, direct measurement of the QGT, which is defined using both left and right eigenstates of a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, remains challenging. Here we develop two quantum simulation schemes to directly extract all components of the QGT in pseudo-Hermitian systems with real spectra. Each scheme independently determines the complete QGT using generalized expectation values of either the energy fluctuation operator or the generalized force operator with respect to two time-evolved states prepared through distinct nonadiabatic evolutions, thereby establishing two self-contained measurement protocols. We illustrate the validity of these schemes on two $q$-deformed two-band models: one with nontrivial topology and the other with a nonvanishing off-diagonal quantum metric. Numerical simulations demonstrate that, for suitably chosen nonadiabatic ramp velocities, both schemes achieve high-fidelity agreement with theoretical predictions for measuring the QGT in both models and successfully capture the topological phase transition of the first model using Chern numbers calculated from Berry curvatures. For larger velocities, the generalized force scheme yields greater accuracy for the real part of the QGT, while the energy fluctuation scheme better captures its imaginary part. This work establishes a framework for extending dynamical measurement schemes from Hermitian to pseudo-Hermitian systems with real spectra.</description>

      <title>Frame dependence of Spekkens' contextuality for relativistic spin systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17967v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the operational definition of contextuality introduced by Spekkens is, in general, not Lorentz invariant. Specifically, we consider an explicit example with particle states consisting of both spin and momentum, we apply a Lorentz transformation to obtain the states in a new inertial frame, and then trace out the momentum degrees of freedom in both frames. We find that, while an observer in the first inertial frame describes a contextual ontological model with respect to spin states and all possible spin measurements, an observer in the boosted frame describes a non-contextual model with respect to the transformed spin states and all transformed spin measurements. Hence, the Spekkens' notion of contextuality, when restricted to spin degress of freedom only, is a frame-dependent concept. We apply our results to predict a novel relativistic effect concerning the task of discriminating between two quantum states. We show that the probability of success for a moving observer exceeds that of an observer at rest.</description>

Abstract: We show that it is undecidable to determine whether the commuting operator value of a nonlocal game is strictly greater than 1/2. Specifically, there is a computable mapping from Turing machines to /boolean constraint system (BCS) nonlocal games in which the halting property of the machine is encoded as a decision problem for the commuting operator value of the game. As a corollary, there is a BCS game for which the value of the Navascu\'es-Pironio-Ac\'in (NPA) hierarchy does not attain the commuting operator value at any finite level.</description>

      <title>Quantum Mechanics Relative to a Quantum Reference System: a Relative State Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17513v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes an intrinsic or background-independent quantum framework based on entangled state rather than absolute quantum state, it describes a quantum relative state between the under-study quantum system and the quantum measuring apparatus as a quantum reference system, without relying on any external absolute parameter. The paper focuses on a simple example, in which a quantum object's one-dimensional position as an under-study quantum system, and a quantum clock as a quantum reference system or quantum measuring apparatus. The evolution equation of the state of the quantum object's position with respect to the state of the quantum clock is given coming from the Ricci-flat Kaehler-Einstein equation. In a linear and non-relativistic approximation, the framework recovers the equation of the standard quantum mechanics, in which an intrinsic potential related to some "inertial force" is automatically incorporated in the covariant derivative. A physical relative probability interpretation and a geometric non-trivial fiber bundle interpretation of the entangled state in this intrinsic quantum framework are given. Furthermore, some non-inertial effects, such as the "inertial force", coming from the general covariance of the intrinsic quantum framework are also discussed. Compared with the functional integral approach which is more easily to generalize the quantum clock to the quantum spacetime reference frame and study quantum gravity, the relative state approach as a canonical description is more suitable for conceptually demonstrating the connections to the standard formalism and interpretation of the quantum mechanics.</description>

Abstract: The Fermi-Hubbard model is the starting point for the simulation of many strongly correlated materials, including high-temperature superconductors, whose modelling is a key motivation for the construction of quantum simulation and computing devices. However, the detection of superconducting pairing correlations has so far remained out of reach, both because of their off-diagonal character - which makes them inaccessible to local density measurements - and because of the difficulty of preparing superconducting states. Here, we report measurement of significant pairing correlations in three different regimes of Fermi-Hubbard models simulated on Quantinuum's Helios trapped-ion quantum computer. Specifically, we measure non-equilibrium pairing induced by an electromagnetic field in the half-filled square lattice model, d-wave pairing in an approximate ground state of the checkerboard Hubbard model at $1/6$-doping, and s-wave pairing in a bilayer model relevant to nickelate superconductors. These results show that a quantum computer can reliably create and probe physically relevant states with superconducting pairing correlations, opening a path to the exploration of superconductivity with quantum computers.</description>

Abstract: Quantum communication protocols can be designed to detect eavesdropping attacks, something that classical technologies are unable to do since classical information can be replicated in a non-destructive manner. Eavesdropping detection is, therefore, a standard feature in all the proposed quantum secret sharing (QSS) protocols. However, detection is often done by a statistical analysis of the outcome of multiple decoy rounds, and this causes a significant communication overhead.
  In our quest for a QSS protocol that works even in one round, we came across a one-shot secret-sharing framework proposed by Hsu (Phys. Rev. A 2003). The scheme was designed to work over public channels without requiring multiple rounds to detect eavesdropping but it lacked a thorough security analysis. In this work we present a complete characterisation of the correctness and security properties of this framework. Our characterisation allowed us to improve the original protocol to be more resistant towards eavesdropping. However, we prove a couple of impossibility results, including one that dictates that complete security against an eavesdropper is not possible in this framework. Thus, it is not possible to design a perfect QSS using this framework.</description>

Abstract: Negatively charged boron vacancy ($\mathrm{V_B^-}$) in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is the most extensively studied room-temperature quantum spin system in two-dimensional (2D) materials. Nevertheless, the current effective readout of $\mathrm{V_B^-}$ spin states is carried out by systematically optical methods. This limits their exploitation in compact and miniaturized quantum devices, which would otherwise hold substantial promise to address quantum sensing and quantum information tasks. In this study, we demonstrated a photoelectric spin readout technique for $\mathrm{V_B^-}$ spins in hBN. The observed photocurrent signals stem from the spin-dependent ionization dynamics of boron vacancies, mediated by spin-dependent non-radiative transitions to a metastable state. We further extend this electrical detection technique to enable the readout of dynamical decoupling sequences, including the Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) protocols, and of nuclear spins via electron-nuclear double resonance. These results provide a pathway toward on-chip integration and real-field exploitation of quantum functionalities based on 2D material platforms.</description>

      <title>On-Demand Control of Input-State-Dependent Single-Photon Scattering in Multi-Mode Waveguides</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22840v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Precise control of a single photon transport in broadband, multi-mode waveguides is a fundamental challenge for scalable quantum networks. We propose a theoretical scheme for on-demand control of single-photon scattering using a driven $\Lambda$-type emitter coupled to a rectangular waveguide. By employing the Lippmann-Schwinger formalism, we derive the exact analytical scattering matrix and reveal two key interference mechanisms: electromagnetically induced transparency for complete transmission and Fano resonance for complete reflection. We demonstrate that the single-photon scattering is dynamically engineered by the driving field, enabling a switch between complete transmission and dual-frequency complete reflection. Crucially, in the multi-mode regime, we show that the scattering is governed by quantum interference between modes, making it critically dependent on the input photonic state. By preparing the photon in a specific coherent superposition state, the multi-mode interference is harnessed to achieve Fano resonance-mediated complete reflection. Conversely, a single-mode input suppresses complete reflection. This input-state-dependent scattering establishes a general framework for multi-mode quantum photonics, paving the way for broadband dual-frequency filters, multi-mode quantum routers, and on-chip spectrometers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01722v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce folded optimal transport, as a way of extending a cost or distance defined on the extreme boundary of a convex to the whole convex, related to convex extension. This construction broadens the framework of standard optimal transport, found to be the particular case of the convex being a simplex. Relying on Choquet theory and standard optimal transport, we introduce the so-called folded Kantorovich cost and folded Wasserstein distance, and study the metric properties it provides to the convex. We then apply the construction to the quantum setting, and obtain an actual separable quantum Wasserstein distance on the set of density matrices from a distance on the set of pure states, closely related to the semi-distance of Beatty and Stilck-Franca [4], and of which we obtain a variety of properties. We also find that the semiclassical Golse-Paul [16] cost writes as a folded Kantorovich cost. Folded optimal transport therefore provides a unified framework for classical, semiclassical and separable quantum optimal transport.</description>

      <title>Polylogarithmic-Depth Quantum Algorithm for Simulating the Extended Hubbard Model on a Two-Dimensional Lattice Using the Fast Multipole Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03898v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The extended Hubbard model on a two-dimensional lattice captures key physical phenomena, but is challenging to simulate due to the presence of long-range interactions. In this work, we present an efficient quantum algorithm for simulating the time evolution of this model. Our approach, inspired by the fast multipole method, approximates pairwise interactions by interactions between hierarchical levels of coarse-graining boxes. We discuss how to leverage recent advances in two-dimensional neutral atom quantum computing, supporting non-local operations such as long-range gates and shuttling. The resulting circuit depth for a single Trotter step scales polylogarithmically with system size.</description>

      <title>Exponentially accelerated relaxation and quantum Mpemba effect in open quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07561v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the quantum Mpemba effect in the relaxation of open quantum systems whose effective dynamics is described by Davies maps. We present a class of unitary transformations built from permutation matrices that, when applied to the initial state of the system, (i) suppress the slowest decaying modes of the nonunitary dynamics; (ii) maximize its distinguishability from the steady state. The first requirement guarantees exponentially accelerating convergence to the steady state, and the second implies that a quantum system initially farther from equilibrium approaches it more rapidly than one that starts closer. This protocol provides a genuine Mpemba effect, and its numerical simulation requires low computational effort. We prove that, for any initial state, one can always find a permutation matrix that maximizes its distance from equilibrium for a specified information-theoretic distinguishability measure. We illustrate our findings for a two-level system, and also for the nonunitary dynamics of the transverse field Ising chain and XXZ chain, each weakly coupled to a bosonic thermal bath, and demonstrate the quantum Mpemba effect as captured by the Hilbert-Schmidt distance, quantum relative entropy, and trace distance. Our results provide a versatile framework to engineer the genuine quantum Mpemba effect in Markovian open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Generative Adversarial Variational Quantum Kolmogorov-Arnold Network</title>

Abstract: Kolmogorov Arnold Networks is a novel multilayer neuromorphic network that can exhibit higher accuracy than a neural network. It can learn and predict more accurately than neural networks with a smaller number of parameters, and many research groups worldwide have adopted it. As a result, many types of applications have been proposed. This network can be used as a generator solely or with a Generative Adversarial Network; however, KAN has a slower speed of learning than neural networks for the number of parameters. Hence,it has not been researched as a generator. Therefore, we propose a novel Generative Adversarial Network called Generative Adversarial Variational Quantum KAN that uses Variational Quantum KAN as a generator. This method enables efficient learning with significantly fewer parameters by leveraging the computational advantages of quantum circuits and their output distributions. We performed the training and generation task on MNIST and CIFAR10, and revealed that our method can achieve higher accuracy than neural networks and Quantum Generative Adversarial Network with less data.</description>

Abstract: The aim of this letter is to compute the evolution of some expected values, such as the field operators $a^{\pm}$, quadratures and atomic inversion, under SUSY partner Hamiltonians associated to the Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian of quantum optics. This kind of SUSY partners are characterized by having spectra which differ in a finite number of energy levels. We wish to elucidate if the partner connection has any influence on these expected values. In particular, we want also to know in which way the classical and revival times are affected by such SUSY partners.</description>

      <title>Matter-Mediated Entanglement in Classical Gravity: Suppression by Binding Potentials and Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13675v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Aziz and Howl [Nature 646 (2025)] argue that two spatially separated masses can become entangled even when gravity is treated as a classical field, by invoking higher-order "virtual-matter" processes in a QFT description of matter, which is non-LOCC (local operations and classical communication). We point out that the relevant mechanism is not intrinsically field-theoretic, but is essentially a quantum tunneling/evanescent matter channel, which is already captured within ordinary quantum mechanics. More importantly, the microscopic constituents of realistic macroscopic objects are bound and localized by strong potentials, introducing a large internal energy scale that suppresses coherent propagation between distant bodies. Including such binding/localization generically yields an exponential suppression, rendering the matter-mediated contribution negligible at the macroscopic separations relevant to gravitational-entanglement proposals. Consequently, the entanglement identified by AH diagnoses the presence of a coherent matter-exchange channel rather than the classical or quantum nature of gravity, and it does not undermine LOCC-based witness arguments in realistic bound-matter platforms.</description>

      <title>Extreme non-negative Wigner functions</title>

Abstract: Providing an operational characterization of the Wigner-positive states (WPS), i.e., the set of quantum states with non-negative Wigner function, is a longstanding open problem. For pure states, the only WPS are Gaussian states, but the situation is considerably more subtle for mixed states. Here, we approach the problem using convex geometry, reducing the question to the characterization of the extreme points of the set of WPS. We give a constructive method to generate a large class of such extreme WPS, which combines the following steps: (i) we characterize the phase-invariant extreme points of the superset of Wigner-positive quasi-states (WPQS); (ii) we introduce a new quantum map, named Vertigo map, which maps extreme WPQS to extreme WPS while preserving phase invariance; (iii) we identify families of extremality-preserving maps and use them to obtain extreme WPS while relaxing phase invariance. Our construction generates all extreme WPS of low dimension, starting from a specific kind of WPS known as beam-splitter states. Our results build upon new mathematical properties of the set of WPS derived in a companion paper and unveil the remarkable structure of mixed states with non-negative Wigner functions.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial structures in quantum correlation: A new perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15686v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph-theoretic structures play a central role in the description and analysis of quantum systems. In this work, we introduce a new class of quantum states, called $A_\alpha$-graph states, which are constructed from either unweighted or weighted graphs by taking the normalised convex combination of the degree matrix $D$ and the adjacency matrix $A_G$ of a graph $G$. The constructed states are different from the standard graph states arising from stabiliser formalism. Our approach is also different from the approach used by Braunstein et al. This class of states depend on a tunable mixing parameter $\alpha \in (0,1]$. We first establish the conditions under which the associated operator $\rho_\alpha^{A_G}$ is positive semidefinite and hence represents a valid quantum state. We then derive a positive partial transposition (PPT) condition for $A_{\alpha}$-graph states in terms of graph parameters. This PPT condition involves only the Frobenius norm of the adjacency matrix of the graph, the degrees of the vertices and the total number of vertices. For simple graphs, we obtain the range of the parameter $\alpha$ for which the $A_{\alpha}$-graph states represent a class of entangled states. We then develop a graph-theoretic formulation of a moments-based entanglement detection criterion, focusing on the recently proposed $p_3$-PPT criterion, which relies on the second and third moments of the partial transposition. Since the estimation of these moments is experimentally accessible via randomised measurements, swap operations, and machine-learning-based protocols, our approach provides a physically relevant framework for detecting entanglement in structured quantum states derived from graphs. This work bridges graph theory and moments-based entanglement detection, offering a new perspective on the role of combinatorial structures in quantum correlations.</description>

Abstract: Materials that have zero-energy flat band states on the surface may show surface superconductivity. Here we report a theoretical observation that a Hamiltonian describing a thin slab of topological nodal line semimetal, has zero energy eigenstate spanning the entire surface of the Brillouin zone under certain conditions, namely (i) the hopping amplitude of fermions in the direction of thickness is more than that in other directions (ii) the onsite energy should be less than some limiting value determined by the hopping probability. Our claim is substantiated by analytic and numerical approach. We also report new phase transitions in a region of parameter space and indicate that the Hamiltonian can also be realised by stacked layers described by a suitable Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Even-Cycle Detection in the Randomized and Quantum CONGEST Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12018v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that, for every $k\geq 2$, $C_{2k}$-freeness can be decided in $O(n^{1-1/k})$ rounds in the \CONGEST{} model by a randomized Monte-Carlo distributed algorithm with one-sided error probability $1/3$. This matches the best round-complexities of previously known algorithms for $k\in\{2,3,4,5\}$ by Drucker et al. [PODC'14] and Censor-Hillel et al. [DISC'20], but improves the complexities of the known algorithms for $k&gt;5$ by Eden et al. [DISC'19], which were essentially of the form $\tilde O(n^{1-2/k^2})$. Our algorithm uses colored BFS-explorations with threshold, but with an original \emph{global} approach that enables to overcome a recent impossibility result by Fraigniaud et al. [SIROCCO'23] about using colored BFS-exploration with \emph{local} threshold for detecting cycles.
  We also show how to quantize our algorithm for achieving a round-complexity $\tilde O(n^{\frac{1}{2}-\frac{1}{2k}})$ in the quantum setting for deciding $C_{2k}$ freeness. Furthermore, this allows us to improve the known quantum complexities of the simpler problem of detecting cycles of length \emph{at most}~$2k$ by van Apeldoorn and de Vos [PODC'22]. Our quantization is in two steps. First, the congestion of our randomized algorithm is reduced, to the cost of reducing its success probability too. Second, the success probability is boosted using a new quantum framework derived from sequential algorithms, namely Monte-Carlo quantum amplification.</description>

      <title>Impact of Scalar NSI on Spatial and Temporal Correlations in Neutrino Oscillations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17503v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutrino oscillation experiments are gradually approaching an era of precision, where subleading effects can also be tested. One such subleading effect is Non-Standard Interactions (NSI), which can play a crucial role in neutrino oscillations. Various works have typically discussed vector NSI in the context of quantum correlations. Recently, there have been improvements in the bounds on scalar NSI as well. In light of these developments, we aim to examine the impact of scalar NSI on quantum correlation measures. To analyze this impact, we are considering the strongest measure of quantum correlation, i.e., non-locality. Our study will encompass both spatial and temporal non-locality measures.</description>

      <title>An Advanced Hybrid Quantum Tabu Search Approach to Vehicle Routing Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12652v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing (QC) is expected to solve incredibly difficult problems, including finding optimal solutions to combinatorial optimization problems. However, to date, QC alone is still far to demonstrate this capability except on small-sized problems. Hybrid approaches where QC and classical computing work together have shown the most potential for solving real-world scale problems. This work aims to show that we can enhance a classical optimization algorithm with QC so that it can overcome this limitation. We present a new hybrid quantum-classical tabu search (HQTS) algorithm to solve the capacitated vehicle routing problem (CVRP). Based on our prior work, HQTS leverages QC for routing within a classical tabu search framework. The quantum component formulates the traveling salesman problem (TSP) for each route as a QUBO, solved using D-Wave's Advantage system. Experiments investigate the impact of quantum routing frequency and starting solution methods. While different starting solution methods, including quantum-based and classical heuristics methods, it shows minimal overall impact. HQTS achieved optimal or near-optimal solutions for several CVRP problems, outperforming other hybrid CVRP algorithms and significantly reducing the optimality gap compared to preliminary research. The experimental results demonstrate that more frequent quantum routing improves solution quality and runtime. The findings highlight the potential of integrating QC within meta-heuristic frameworks for complex optimization in vehicle routing problems.</description>

      <title>Atomic structure of the PL5 defect in silicon carbide revealed by single-spin spectroscopy and oxygen implantation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07558v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: PL5 and PL6 centers in 4H-SiC are promising for quantum applications due to their superior charge stability and optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) properties at room temperature. However, their atomic structures remain unresolved, with ongoing controversy regarding their potential association with stacking faults. Previous measurements relying on spin ensemble detection were insufficient to draw definitive conclusions. In this work, we conduct correlative imaging of stacking faults and PL5/PL6 at the single-defect level, definitively ruling out any spatial correlation and demonstrating that these centers are not associated with stacking faults. Furthermore, we find that substituting oxygen for nitrogen in ion implantation enhances the yields of PL5 and PL6 by more than $11$-fold and $23$-fold, respectively. Single-spin ODMR spectroscopy of PL5 reveals six distinct orientations, determines the transverse zero-field splitting parameter $E$, and characterizes the hyperfine coupling. Combined with our ab initio calculations, these results provide compelling evidence for the assignment of PL5 as an OV($kh$) defect, consisting of an oxygen atom occupying the C($k$) site as the nearest neighbor to a Si($h$) vacancy. The structural analysis together with the demonstrated defect yield enhancement lays the foundation for fabricating high-sensitivity, high-contrast ensemble quantum sensors in two and three dimensions.</description>

      <title>Krylov Complexity for Open Quantum System: Dissipation and Decoherence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14810v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate Krylov complexity in open quantum systems using Lindblad master equations for bosonic bath models, with particular emphasis on the Caldeira--Leggett model. Krylov complexity is computed from the moments of the two-point function within the standard master equation framework. For the damped harmonic oscillator, the results reveal clear dissipative features in Krylov complexity. In the Caldeira--Leggett model, in the high-temperature limit, we find that Krylov complexity saturates in the full system and reproduces the expected dissipative behavior when the decoherence term is suppressed in the master equation. Conversely, when the dissipative term is suppressed, the contribution from decoherence exhibits the familiar oscillatory dynamics of the coherent system, along with additional novel features. However, Krylov complexity appears insensitive to the onset of decoherence, as no clear distinctive signature is observed. We attribute this to the fact that Krylov complexity is defined in the Krylov basis, which does not coincide with the conventional basis typically used to study decoherence.</description>

      <title>Hadronic scattering in (1+1)D SU(2) lattice gauge theory from tensor networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.00154v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a first real-time study of hadronic scattering in a (1+1)-dimensional SU(2) lattice gauge theory with fundamental fermions using tensor-network techniques. Working in the gaugeless Hamiltonian formulation -- where the gauge field is exactly integrated out and no truncation of the electric flux is required -- we investigate scattering processes across sectors of fixed global baryon number $B = 0, 1, 2$. These correspond respectively to meson-meson, meson-baryon, and baryon-baryon collisions. At strong coupling, the $B = 0$ and $B = 2$ channels exhibit predominantly elastic dynamics closely resembling those of the U(1) Schwinger model. In contrast, the mixed $B = 1$ sector shows qualitatively new behavior: meson and baryon wave packets become entangled during the collision, and depending on their initial kinematics, the slower state becomes spatially delocalized while the faster one propagates ballistically. We characterize these processes through local observables, entanglement entropy, and the information-lattice, which together reveal how correlations build up and relax during the interaction. Our results establish a first benchmark for non-Abelian real-time scattering from first principles and open the path toward quantum-simulation studies of baryon-number dynamics and inelastic processes in gauge theories.</description>

Concentrating on the $\varphi^4$ Landau-Ginzburg model, we use the analytical Vacuum Expectation Values and Form Factors of local operators in the sinh-Gordon theory as the foundation of a variational ansatz. In this way, we obtain controlled estimates of central physical quantities of the $\varphi^4$ theory - such as the finite-volume ground-state energy and the physical mass as a function of the coupling constant. The strengths of the variational methods are leveraged in combination with the Hamiltonian truncation techniques and the LeClair-Mussardo formula, which also allow to probe the accuracy of the variational approximation varying the system size. Within the weak-coupling regime, a detailed numerical analysis reveals the behaviour of the finite-volume spectrum, the ground-state energy, and the elastic part of the scattering matrix, showing how the rigorous machinery of integrable models can serve as a guiding light into the complex landscape of non-integrable quantum field dynamics.</description>

      <title>Vacuum Energy and Topological Mass in Interacting Elko and Scalar Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08750v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a four-dimensional system composed of a mass-dimension-one fermionic field, also known as Elko, interacting with a real scalar field. Our main objective is to analyze the Casimir effects associated with this system, assuming that both the Elko and scalar fields satisfy Dirichlet boundary conditions on two large parallel plates separated by a distance $L$. In this scenario, we calculate the vacuum energy density and its first-order correction in the coupling constants of the theory. Additionally, we consider the mass correction for each field separately, namely the topological mass that arises from the boundary conditions imposed on the fields and which also depends on the coupling constants. To develop this analysis, we use the mathematical formalism known as the effective potential, expressed as a path integral in quantum field theory.</description>

      <title>A sine-square deformation approach to quantum critical points in one-dimensional systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14149v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a method to determine the quantum phase boundaries of one-dimensional systems using sine-square deformation (SSD). Based on the proposition, supported by several exactly solved cases though not proven in full generality, that "if a one-dimensional system is gapless, then the expectation value of any local observable in the ground state of the Hamiltonian with SSD exhibits translational symmetry in the thermodynamic limit," we determine the quantum critical point as the location where a local observable becomes site-independent, identified through finite-size scaling analysis. As case studies, we consider two models: the antiferromagnetic Ising chain in mixed transverse and longitudinal magnetic fields with nearest-neighbor and long-range interactions. We calculate the ground state of these Hamiltonians with SSD using the density-matrix renormalization-group algorithm and evaluate the local transverse magnetization. For the nearest-neighbor model, we show that the quantum critical point can be accurately estimated by our procedure with systems of up to 84 sites, or even smaller, in good agreement with results from the literature. For the long-range model, we find that the phase boundary between the antiferromagnetic and paramagnetic phases is slightly shifted relative to the nearest-neighbor case, leading to a reduced region of antiferromagnetic order. Moreover, we propose an experimental procedure to implement the antiferromagnetic $J_1$-$J_2$ Ising couplings with SSD using Rydberg atom arrays in optical tweezers, which can be achieved within a very good approximation. Because multiple independent scaling conditions naturally emerge, our approach enables precise determination of quantum critical points and possibly even the extraction of additional critical phenomena, such as critical exponents, from relatively small system sizes.</description>

      <title>Characterising the sets of quantum states with non-negative Wigner function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14820v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For Hilbert spaces $\mathcal H\subseteq L^2(\mathbb R)$ we consider the convex sets $\mathcal D_+(\mathcal H)$ of Wigner-positive states (WPS), i.e.~density matrices over $\mathcal H$ with non-negative Wigner function. We investigate the topological structure of these sets, namely concerning closure, compactness, interior and boundary (in a relative topology induced by the trace norm). We also study their geometric structure and construct minimal sets of states that generate $\mathcal D_+(\mathcal H)$ through convex combinations. If $\mathcal H$ is finite-dimensional, the existence of such sets follows from a central result in convex analysis, namely the Krein-Milman theorem. In the infinite-dimensional case $\mathcal H=L^2(\mathbb R)$ this is not so, due to lack of compactness of the set $\mathcal D_+(\mathcal H)$. Nevertheless, we prove that a Krein-Milman theorem holds in this case, which allows us to extend most of the results concerning the sets of generators to the infinite-dimensional setting. Finally, we study the relation between the finite and infinite-dimensional sets of WPS, and prove that the former provide a hierarchy of closed subsets, which are also proper faces of the latter. These results provide a basis for an operational characterisation of the extreme points of the sets of WPS, which we undertake in a companion paper. Our work offers a unified perspective on the topological and geometric properties of the sets of WPS in finite and infinite dimensions, along with explicit constructions of minimal sets of generators.</description>
