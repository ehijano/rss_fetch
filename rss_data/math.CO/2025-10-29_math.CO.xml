      <title>On the average size of $1$-nearly independent vertex sets in graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A $k$-nearly independent vertex subset of a graph $G$ is a set of vertices that induces a subgraph containing exactly $k$ edges. For $k = 0$, this coincides with the classical notion of independent subsets. This paper investigates the average size, $av_1(G)$ of the $1$-nearly independent vertex subsets of both graphs and trees of a given order $n$.
  Let $E_n$ denote the $n$-vertex edgeless graph, so that $av_1(E_n) = 0$. We determine all $n$-vertex graphs $G\neq E_n$ that minimize or maximize $av_1$. Similarly, we identify the trees of order $n$ that achieve the minimum value of $av_1$, and prove that the maximum value lies between $n/2$ and $(n+1)/2$ if $n&gt;8$. Finally, we construct a family of $n$-vertex trees which shows that the bounds are asymptotically sharp.</description>

      <title>An extension of Viennot's shadow to rook placements via orbit harmonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23735v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For fixed positive integers $n,m,r$ with $r \leq \min(n,m)$, let $\mathrm{Mat}_{n \times m}(\mathbb{C})$ be the affine space of $n \times m$ complex matrices with coordinate ring $\mathbb{C}[\mathbf{x}_{n \times m}]$. We define a homogeneous ideal $I_{n,m,r}$, where the graded quotient $\mathbb{C}[\mathbf{x}_{n \times m}]/I_{n,m,r}$ carries an action of the group $\mathfrak{S}_n \times \mathfrak{S}_m$ by independent permutations of rows and columns. This quotient ring is obtained by applying the orbit harmonics method to matrix loci corresponding to all rook placements of size at least $r$. We show that the quotient $\mathbb{C}[\mathbf{x}_{n \times m}]/I_{n,m,r}$ admits a standard monomial basis, which is determined by extending rook placements to an element in $\mathfrak{S}_{n+m-r}$ and applying Viennot's shadow line avatar of the Schensted correspondence. We also determine the graded $\mathfrak{S}_n\times\mathfrak{S}_m$-module structure of $\mathbb{C}[\mathbf{x}_{n \times m}]/I_{n,m,r}$.</description>

      <title>Commuting graphs of completely 0-simple semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to study commuting graphs of completely $0$-simple semigroups, using the characterization of these semigroups as $0$-Rees matrix semigroups over a groups. We establish a method to decide whether the commuting graph of this semigroup construction is connected or not. If it is not connected, we also supply a way to identify the connected components of the commuting graph. We show how to obtain the diameter of the commuting graph (when it is connected) and the diameters of the connected components of the commuting graph (when it is not connected). Moreover, we obtain the clique number and girth of the commuting graph of such a semigroup, as well as two upper bounds (either of which can be the best in different situations) for its chromatic number. We also determine the knit degree of such a semigroup.
  Finally, we use the results regarding the properties of the commuting graph of a $0$-Rees matrix semigroup over a group to determine the set of possible values for the diameter, clique number, girth, chromatic number and knit degree of the commuting graph of a completely $0$-simple semigroup.</description>

      <title>Lattice point enumeration of polytopes associated to integer compositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An $n$-dimensional lattice polytope ${\mathcal Q}_\sigma$ can be associated to any composition $\sigma$ of a positive integer $n$, as a special case of constructions due to Pitman--Stanley and Chapoton. The entries of the $h$-vector of $\sigma$, introduced by Chapoton, enumerate the lattice points in ${\mathcal Q}_\sigma$ by the number of their zero coordinates. Chapoton conjectured that this vector is equal to the $h$-vector of a simplicial polytope. This paper proves that the $h$-vector of $\sigma$ is gamma-positive, hence palindromic and unimodal, and confirms certain other conjectures of Chapoton on the lattice point enumeration of composition polytopes. A combinatorial interpretation of their $h^\ast$-polynomials is deduced.</description>

      <title>New Nonuniform Group Divisible Designs and Mixed Steiner Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers two closely related concepts, mixed Steiner system and nonuniform group divisible design (GDD). The distinction between the two concepts is the minimum Hamming distance, which is required for mixed Steiner systems but not required for nonuniform group divisible $t$-designs. In other words, it means that every mixed Steiner system is a nonuniform GDD, but the converse is not true. A new construction for mixed Steiner systems based on orthogonal arrays and resolvable Steiner systems is presented. Some of the new mixed Steiner systems (also GDDs) depend on the existence of Mersenne primes or Fermat primes. New parameters of nonuniform GDDs derived from large sets of H-designs (which are generalizations of GDDs) are presented, and in particular, many nonuniform group divisible $t$-designs with $t &gt; 3$ are introduced (for which only one family was known before). Some GDDs are with $t &gt; 4$, parameters for which no such design was known before.</description>

      <title>Subgraphs in random graphs with specified degrees and forbidden edges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a uniformly chosen simple (labelled) random graph with given degree sequence $\boldsymbol{d}$ and let $X,Y,L$ be edge-disjoint graphs on the same vertex set as $G$. We investigate the probability that $X \subseteq G$ and that $G \cap Y = \emptyset$ both conditioned on the event $G \cap L = \emptyset$. We improve upon known bounds of these probabilities and extend them to a wider range of degree sequences through a more precise edge switching argument. Notably, a few vertices of linear degree are permitted provided that the subgraph $X$ does not have an edge incident with them. Further, the graph $L$ is permitted to contain many edges (we provide an example where $L$ is a spanning $r$-regular subgraph with $r = o(n)$).
  We provide the same analysis when $G$ is a simple (labelled) bipartite random graph with a given degree sequence $(\boldsymbol{s},\boldsymbol{t})$. Our work extends the results of Gao and Ohapkin (2023) and McKay (1981, 2010).</description>

      <title>Self interest cumulative subtraction games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Subtraction games have a rich literature as normal-play combinatorial games (e.g., Berlekamp, Conway, and Guy, 1982). Recently, the theory has been extended to zero-sum scoring play (Cohensius et al. 2019). Here, we take the approach of cumulative self-interest games, as introduced in a recent framework preprint by Larsson, Meir, and Zick. By adapting standard Pure Subgame Perfect Equilibria (PSPE) from classical game theory, players must declare and commit to acting either ``friendly'' or ``antagonistic'' in case of indifference. Whenever the subtraction set has size two, we establish a tie-breaking rule monotonicity: a friendly player can never benefit by a deterministic deviation to antagonistic play. This type of terminology is new to both ``economic'' and ``combinatorial'' games, but it becomes essential in the self-interest cumulative setting. The main result is an immediate consequence of the tie-breaking rule's monotonicity; in the case of two-action subtraction sets, two antagonistic players are never better off than two friendly players, i.e., their PSPE utilities are never greater. For larger subtraction sets, we conjecture that the main result continues to hold, while tie-breaking monotonicity may fail, and we provide empirical evidence in support of both statements.</description>

      <title>Semi-inducibility of 4-vertex graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a graph $H$ whose edges are coloured blue or red, the $H$-semi-inducibility problem asks for the maximum, over all graphs $G$ of given order $n$, of the number of injections from the vertex set of $H$ into the vertex set of $G$ that send red (resp. blue) edges of $H$ to edges (resp. non-edges) of $G$. We consider all possible 4-vertex non-complete graphs $H$ and essentially resolve all remaining cases except when $H$ is the 3-edge path coloured blue-blue-red in this order (or is equivalent to this case). Some of our proofs are computer-generated, using the flag algebra method of Razborov.</description>

      <title>Random Walks and the Best Meeting Time for Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider random walks on a tree $G=(V,E)$ with stationary distribution $\pi_v = \mathrm{deg}(v)/2|E|$ for $v \in V$. Let the hitting time $H(v,w)$ denote the expected number of steps required for the random walk started at vertex $v$ to reach vertex $w$. We characterize the extremal tree structures for the best meeting time $T_{\mathrm{bestmeet}}(G) = \min_{w \in V} \sum_{v \in V} \pi_v H(v,w)$ for trees of order $n$ with diameter $d$. The best meeting time is maximized by the balanced double broom graph, and it is minimized by the balanced lever graph.</description>

      <title>A model of trees for 5-connected planar triangulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Triangulations of the 5-gon with no separating triangle nor quadrangle, so called 5c-triangulations, are a planar map family closely related to 5-connected planar triangulations. We show that 5c-triangulations are in bijection with 5-regular plane trees satisfying a simple local constraint at inner edges. It yields explicit expressions for the generating functions of rooted 5c-triangulations, and of rooted 5-connected planar triangulations with root-vertex degree 5, these belonging to the same algebraic extension as the generating function of rooted 5-connected planar triangulations computed by Gao, Wanless and Wormald. The bijection also makes it possible to obtain efficient uniform random generation and succinct encoding procedures for 5-connected planar triangulations.</description>

      <title>Kirillov-Reshetikhin Dual Equivalence Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $U$ be a tensor product of highest weight modules of $GL_n(\mathbb C)$ corresponding to multiples of fundamental weights (i.e. rectangles). We consider three ways to stratify $U^{\otimes k}$ into components: using isotypic components of the cyclic action on tensor factors, using a generalization of the charge statistic, and using certain generalizations of Assaf's dual equivalence graphs. We conjecture that all three ways coincide, and we prove that the latter two ways coincide. The Kirillov-Reshetikhin dual equivalence graphs (KR DEGs) we introduce for this purpose are defined on $0$-weight spaces of tensor products of Kirillov-Reshetikhin crystals. They generalize Kazhdan-Lusztig dual equivalence graphs (KL DEGs) that previously appeared in the study of Kazhdan-Lusztig cells in affine type A. While the tensor products of Kirillov-Reshetikhin crystals are connected as affine crystals, the KR DEGs in general are not.</description>

      <title>Edge-statistics beyond $1/e$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For integers $k$ and $\ell$, let $\operatorname{ind}(k, \ell)$ be the maximum proportion of $k$-vertex subsets of a large graph that induce exactly $\ell$ edges. The edge-statistics theorem (conjectured by Alon-Hefetz-Krivelevich-Tyomkyn, and proved by Kwan-Sudakov-Tran, Fox-Sauermann, and Martinsson-Mousset-Noever-Truji\'c) asserts that, for $k \to \infty$ and $0 &lt; \ell &lt;\binom{k}{2}$, one has $\operatorname{ind}(k, \ell) \le 1/e + o(1)$.
  We investigate the ''stability'' of this problem: how can one improve this bound under additional assumptions on $\ell$? In particular, the edge-statistics theorem is tight when $\ell\in \{1,k-1,\binom{k}{2}-(k-1),\binom{k}{2}-1\}$; we show that for all other $\ell$, one can replace $1/e$ with a strictly smaller constant. This extends an analogous result of Ueltzen in the setting of graph inducibility. We also obtain a much stronger (and essentially optimal) upper bound on $\operatorname{ind}(k, \ell)$ when $\ell$ is far from a multiple of $k$, refining and extending previous bounds due to Fox and Sauermann.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the major starting points of discrete optimization is the theorem of Nash-Williams and Tutte on the existence of $k$ disjoint spanning trees of a graph along with its counterpart on the existence of $k$ forests covering all edges of the graph. These elegant results triggered a comprehensive research that gave rise to far-reaching generalizations and found applications at seemingly far-fetched areas. There are well over a thousand papers in the literature, including quite a few brand-new ones. Our first goal is to enlighten some aspects and links of these developments with the hope that the melody finds its way to non-experts. But we hope that experts will also find some novelties in our orchestration.</description>

      <title>The injective norm of CSS quantum error-correcting codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we compute the injective norm - a.k.a. geometric entanglement - of standard basis states of CSS quantum error-correcting codes. The injective norm of a quantum state is a measure of genuine multipartite entanglement. Computing this measure is generically NP-hard. However, it has been computed exactly in condensed-matter theory - notably in the context of topological phases - for the Kitaev code and its extensions, in works by Or\'us and collaborators. We extend these results to all CSS codes and thereby obtain the injective norm for a nontrivial, infinite family of quantum states. In doing so, we uncover an interesting connection to matroid theory and Edmonds' intersection theorem.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study decomposable N^d-indexed persistence modules via higher dimensional partitions. Their barcodes are defined in terms of the extended interior of the corresponding Young diagrams. For two decomposable N^d-indexed persistence modules, we present a necessary and sufficient condition, in terms of the partitions, for their rank invariants to be the same. This generalizes the well-known fact that for an N-indexed persistence module, its barcode and its rank invariant determine each other, i.e., the rank invariant is a complete invariant.</description>

      <title>Discovering Heuristics with Large Language Models (LLMs) for Mixed-Integer Programs: Single-Machine Scheduling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our study contributes to the scheduling and combinatorial optimization literature with new heuristics discovered by leveraging the power of Large Language Models (LLMs). We focus on the single-machine total tardiness (SMTT) problem, which aims to minimize total tardiness by sequencing n jobs on a single processor without preemption, given processing times and due dates. We develop and benchmark two novel LLM-discovered heuristics, the EDD Challenger (EDDC) and MDD Challenger (MDDC), inspired by the well-known Earliest Due Date (EDD) and Modified Due Date (MDD) rules. In contrast to prior studies that employed simpler rule-based heuristics, we evaluate our LLM-discovered algorithms using rigorous criteria, including optimality gaps and solution time derived from a mixed-integer programming (MIP) formulation of SMTT. We compare their performance against state-of-the-art heuristics and exact methods across various job sizes (20, 100, 200, and 500 jobs). For instances with more than 100 jobs, exact methods such as MIP and dynamic programming become computationally intractable. Up to 500 jobs, EDDC improves upon the classic EDD rule and another widely used algorithm in the literature. MDDC consistently outperforms traditional heuristics and remains competitive with exact approaches, particularly on larger and more complex instances. This study shows that human-LLM collaboration can produce scalable, high-performing heuristics for NP-hard constrained combinatorial optimization, even under limited resources when effectively configured.</description>

      <title>Operators on complemented posets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a complemented poset P, we can assign to every element x of P the set x^+ of all its complements. We study properties of the operator ^+ on P, in particular, we are interested in the case when x^+ forms an antichain or when ^+ is involutive or antitone. We apply ^+ to the set Min U(x,y) of all minimal elements of the upper cone U(x,y) of x,y and to the set Max L(x,y) of all maximal elements of the lower cone L(x,y) of x,y. By using ^+ we define four binary operators on P and investigate their properties that are close to adjointness. We present an example of a uniquely complemented poset that is not Boolean. In the last section we study the orthogonality relation induced by complementation. We characterize when two elements of the Dedekind-MacNeille completion of P are orthogonal to each other. Finally, we extend the orthogonality relation from elements to subsets and we prove that two non-empty subsets of P are orthogonal to each other if and only if their convex hulls are orthogonal to each other within the poset of all non-empty convex subsets of P.</description>

      <title>Improved bounds on the cop number when forbidding a minor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.14851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.14851v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Andreae (1986) proved that the cop number of connected $H$-minor-free graphs is bounded for every graph $H$. In particular, the cop number is at most $|E(H-h)|$ if $H-h$ contains no isolated vertex, where $h\in V(H)$. The main result of this paper is an improvement on this bound, which is most significant when $H$ is small or sparse, for instance when $H-h$ can be obtained from another graph by multiple edge subdivisions. Some consequences of this result are improvements on the upper bound for the cop number of $K_{3,t}$-minor-free graphs, $K_{2,t}$-minor-free graphs and linklessly embeddable graphs.</description>

      <title>Longest cycles in vertex-transitive and highly connected graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04618v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present progress on three old conjectures about longest paths and cycles in graphs. The first pair of conjectures, due to Lov\'{a}sz from 1969 and Thomassen from 1978, respectively, states that all connected vertex-transitive graphs contain a Hamiltonian path, and that all sufficiently large such graphs even contain a Hamiltonian cycle. The third conjecture, due to Smith from 1984, states that for $r\ge 2$ in every $r$-connected graph any two longest cycles intersect in at least $r$ vertices. In this paper, we prove a new lemma about the intersection of longest cycles in a graph which can be used to improve the best known bounds towards all the aforementioned conjectures: First, we show that every connected vertex-transitive graph on $n\geq 3$ vertices contains a cycle (and hence path) of length at least $\Omega(n^{13/21})$, improving on $\Omega(n^{3/5})$ from [DeVos, \emph{arXiv:2302:04255}, 2023]. Second, we show that in every $r$-connected graph with $r\geq 2$, any two longest cycles meet in at least $\Omega(r^{5/8})$ vertices, improving on $\Omega(r^{3/5})$ from [Chen, Faudree and Gould, \emph{J. Combin. Theory, Ser.~ B}, 1998]. Our proof combines combinatorial arguments, computer-search and linear programming.</description>

      <title>Solvable and Nilpotent Matroids: Realizability and Irreducible Decomposition of Their Associated Varieties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12784v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the families of solvable and nilpotent matroids, examining their realization spaces, closures, and associated matroid and circuit varieties. We study their realizability, as well as the irreducible decomposition of their associated matroid and circuit varieties. Additionally, we describe a finite generating set for the corresponding ideals, considered up to radical. We establish sufficient conditions for both the realizability of these matroids and the irreducibility of their associated varieties. Specifically, we establish the realizability and irreducibility of matroid varieties associated with nilpotent matroids and prove the irreducibility of matroid varieties arising from certain classes of solvable paving matroids. Additionally, we analyze the defining polynomial equations of these varieties using Grassmann-Cayley algebra and geometric liftability techniques. Furthermore, we provide a complete generating set for the matroid ideals associated with forest configurations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11791v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 2-quasi best match graphs (2-qBMGs) are directed graphs that capture a
  notion of close relatedness in phylogenetics. Here, we investigate the
  undirected underlying graph of a 2-qBMG (un-2qBMG) and show that they
  contain neither a path $P_l$ nor a cycle $C_l$ of length $l\geq 6$ as an
  induced subgraph. This property guarantees the existence of specific
  vertex decompositions with dominating bicliques that provide further
  insights into their structure.</description>

Abstract: We bound the number of permutations with a fixed number $r$ of $321 \ominus p_0$ patterns by a constant times the number of permutations which avoid $321 \ominus p_0$. We use this new upper bound to show that the ordinary generating function for permutations with $r$ copies of $k(k-1)...1$ is not rational for odd $k \geq 3$ and not algebraic for even $k \geq 3$.</description>

      <title>Oriented diameter of graphs with diameter $4$ and given edge girth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23517v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $f(d)$ be the smallest value for which every bridgeless graph $G$ with diameter $d$ admits a strong orientation $\overrightarrow{G}$ such that the diameter of $\overrightarrow{G}$ is at most $f(d)$. Chv\'atal and Thomassen (JCT-B, 1978) obtained general bounds for $f(d)$ and proved that $f(2)=6$. Kwok et al. (JCT-B, 2010) proved that $9\leq f(3)\leq 11$. Wang and Chen (JCT-B, 2022) determined $f(3)=9$. Babu et al. (DAM, 2021) showed $f(4)\leq 21$.
  In this paper, we introduce a new approach to studying $f(d)$ via the edge girth of a bridgeless graph $G$, denoted by $g^*(G)=\max\{l_G(e)\mid e\in E(G)\}$, where $l_G(e)$ is the length of the shortest cycle containing $e$ in $G$. Then we define $F(d,g^*)=\max\{\overrightarrow{{diam}}(G)\mid G\text{ is bridgeless},d(G)=d,g^*(G)=g^*\}$, and show $f(d)=\max\{F(d,g^*)\mid 2\leq g^*\leq 2d+1\}$. As the main result of this paper, we establish $F(4,2)=4$, $F(4,9)=12$, $F(4,3)\le 12$, and $F(4,g^*)\le 13$ for $g^*\in\{6,7,8\}$, and we propose two open problems for further research.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15602v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G=(V,E)$ be a matching-covered graph, denote by $P$ its perfect matching polytope, and by $L$ the integer lattice generated by the integral points in $P$. In this paper, we give short, polyhedral proofs for two difficult results established by Lov\'{a}sz (1987), and by Carvalho, Lucchesi, and Murty (2002) in a series of three papers totaling over 120 pages. More specifically, we prove that $L$ has a lattice basis consisting solely of incidence vectors of some perfect matchings of $G$, $2x\in L$ for all $x\in \mathrm{lin}(P)\cap \mathbb{Z}^E$, and if $G$ has no Petersen brick then $L = \mathrm{lin}(P)\cap \mathbb{Z}^E$. Our proof avoids major technical aspects of the previous proofs, the most important of these being a characterization of the dual lattice, and a `Petersen-brick-sensitive' ear-decomposition result for matching-covered graphs. This is achieved by a novel study of the facial structure of the polytope $P$ and its relationship with the lattice $L$. Along the way, we give a new polyhedral characterization of the Petersen graph.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18602v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathscr{M}$ be a conditional oriented matroid. We define a graded algebra $\widehat{\mathscr{VG}}_\mathscr{M}$ with vector space dimension given by the number of covectors in $\mathscr{M}$ which admits a distinguished filtration indexed by the poset $\mathscr{L}(\mathscr{M})$ of flats of $\mathscr{M}$. The subquotients of this filtration are isomorphic to graded Varchenko-Gelfand rings of contractions of $\mathscr{M}$, so we call $\widehat{\mathscr{VG}}_\mathscr{M}$ the {\em graded big Varchenko-Gelfand ring of $\mathscr{M}$.} We describe a no broken circuit type basis of $\widehat{\mathscr{VG}}_\mathscr{M}$ and study its equivariant structure under the action of $\mathrm{Aut}(\mathscr{M})$. Our key technique is the orbit harmonics deformation which encodes $\widehat{\mathscr{VG}}_\mathscr{M}$ (as well as the classical Varchenko-Gelfand ring) in terms of a locus of points.</description>

      <title>Density Characterization with The Upper Bound of Density of Fibonacci Word</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00886v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the natural density and structural relationships within Fibonacci words, the density of a Fibonacci word is $\operatorname{DF}(F_k)=n/(n+m),$ where $m$ denote the number of zeros in a Fibonacci word and $n$ denote the units digit. Through analysis of these ratios and their convergence to powers of $\varphi$, we illustrate the intrinsic exponential growth rates characteristic of Fibonacci words. By considering the natural density concept for sets of positive integers, it is demonstrated that the density of Fibonacci words approaches unity, correlating with classical results on Fibonacci number distributions as \[ \operatorname{DF}(F_k) &lt;\frac{m(m+1)}{n(2m-n+1)}. \] Furthermore, generating functions and combinatorial formulas for general terms of Fibonacci words are derived, linking polynomial expressions and limit behaviors integral to their combinatorial structure. The study is supplemented by numerical data and graphical visualization, confirming theoretical findings and providing insights into the early transient and asymptotic behavior of Fibonacci word densities.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we prove that the universal and maximal abelian covers of a finite multi-graph have the same eigenvalues. This result strengthens a recent theorem of Li, Magee, Sabri, and Thomas (2025) and answers one of their questions. Our proof builds upon their new characterization of the point spectrum of maximal abelian covers in terms of matching polynomials. It is based on the theory of the matching polynomial and its Gallai-Edmonds decomposition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20167v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that any function $f$ from a finite set $Y$ to itself can be represented linearly. Specifically, we prove the existence of an injective map $j$ from $Y$ into a modular ring $\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z}$ and a constant $a \in \mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z}$ such that $j(f(y)) = a \cdot j(y)$ in $\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z}$ holds for all $y \in Y$. This result is established by analyzing the algebraic properties of the adjugate of the characteristic matrix associated with the function's digraph. The proof is constructive, providing a method for finding the embedding $j$, the modulus $m$, and the linear multiplier $a$.</description>

      <title>An Upper Bound on the Weisfeiler-Leman Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12581v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Weisfeiler-Leman (WL) algorithms form a family of incomplete approaches to the graph isomorphism problem. They recently found various applications in algorithmic group theory and machine learning. In fact, the algorithms form a parameterized family: for each $k \in \mathbb{N}$ there is a corresponding $k$-dimensional algorithm $\texttt{WLk}$. The algorithms become increasingly powerful with increasing dimension, but at the same time the running time increases. The WL-dimension of a graph $G$ is the smallest $k \in \mathbb{N}$ for which $\texttt{WLk}$ correctly decides isomorphism between $G$ and every other graph. In some sense, the WL-dimension measures how difficult it is to test isomorphism of one graph to others using a fairly general class of combinatorial algorithms. Nowadays, it is a standard measure in descriptive complexity theory for the structural complexity of a graph.
  We prove that the WL-dimension of a graph on $n$ vertices is at most $3/20 \cdot n + o(n) = 0.15 \cdot n + o(n)$. Reducing the question to coherent configurations, the proof develops various techniques to analyze their structure. This includes sufficient conditions under which a fiber can be restored uniquely up to isomorphism if it is removed, a recursive proof exploiting a degree reduction and treewidth bounds, as well as an exhaustive analysis of interspaces involving small fibers. As a base case, we also analyze the dimension of coherent configurations with small fiber size and thereby graphs with small color class size.</description>

      <title>The adjacent Hindman's theorem and the $\mathbb Z$-Ramsey's theorem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14558v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the restriction of Ramsey's theorem that arises from considering only translation-invariant colourings of pairs, and show that this has the same strength (both from the viewpoint of Reverse Mathematics and from the viewpoint of Computability Theory) as the {\em Adjacent Hindman's Theorem}, proposed by L. Carlucci (Arch. Math. Log. {\bf 57} (2018), 381--359). We also investigate some higher dimensional versions of both of these statements.</description>

      <title>Induced Minor Models. II. Sufficient conditions for polynomial-time detection of induced minors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00161v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $H$-Induced Minor Containment problem ($H$-IMC) consists in deciding if a fixed graph $H$ is an induced minor of a graph $G$ given as input, that is, whether $H$ can be obtained from $G$ by deleting vertices and contracting edges. Equivalently, the problem asks if there exists an induced minor model of $H$ in $G$, that is, a collection of disjoint subsets of vertices of $G$, each inducing a connected subgraph, such that contracting each subgraph into a single vertex results in $H$.
  It is known that $H$-IMC is NP-complete for several graphs $H$, even when $H$ is a tree. In this work, we investigate which properties of $H$ guarantee the existence of an induced minor model whose structure can be leveraged to solve the problem in polynomial time. This allows us to identify four infinite families of graphs $H$ that enjoy such properties. Moreover, we show that if the input graph $G$ excludes long induced paths, then $H$-IMC is polynomial-time solvable for any fixed graph $H$. As a byproduct of our results, this implies that $H$-IMC is polynomial-time solvable for all graphs $H$ with at most $5$ vertices, except for three open cases.</description>

      <title>Contributions to conjectures on planar graphs: Induced Subgraphs, Treewidth, and Dominating Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10471v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two of the most prominent unresolved conjectures in graph theory, the Albertson-Berman conjecture and the Matheson-Tarjan conjecture, have been extensively studied by many researchers.
  (AB) Every planar graph of order $n$ has an induced forest of order at least $\frac{n}{2}$.
  (MT) Every plane triangulation of sufficiently large order $n$ has a dominating set of cardinality at most $\frac{n}{4}$.
  Although partial progress and weaker bounds are known, both conjectures remain unsolved. To shed further light on them, researchers have explored a variety of related notions and generalizations. In this paper, we clarify relations among several of these notions, most notably connected domination and induced outerplanar subgraphs, and investigate the corresponding open problems. Furthermore, we construct an infinite family of plane triangulations of order $n$ whose connected domination number exceeds $n/3$. This construction gives a negative answer to a question of Bradshaw et al. [SIAM J. Discrete Math. 36 (2022) 1416-1435], who asked whether the maxleaf number of every plane triangulation of order $n$ is at least $2n/3$. We also obtain new results on induced subgraphs with bounded treewidth and induced outerplanar subgraphs.</description>

      <title>A Threshold Phenomenon for the Shortest Lattice Vector Problem in the Infinity Norm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02249v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One important question in the theory of lattices is to detect a shortest vector: given a norm and a lattice, what is the smallest norm attained by a non-zero vector contained in the lattice? We focus on the infinity norm and work with lattices of the form $A\mathbb{Z}^n$, where $A$ has integer entries and is of full column rank. Finding a shortest vector is NP-hard. We show that this task is fixed parameter tractable in the parameter $\Delta$, the largest absolute value of the determinant of a full rank submatrix of $A$. The algorithm is based on a structural result that can be interpreted as a threshold phenomenon: whenever the dimension $n$ exceeds a certain value determined only by $\Delta$, then a shortest lattice vector attains an infinity norm value of one. This threshold phenomenon has several applications. In particular, it reveals that integer optimal solutions lie on faces of the given polyhedron whose dimensions are bounded only in terms of $\Delta$.</description>

      <title>Parameterized Algorithms for Diversity of Networks with Ecological Dependencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09512v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a phylogenetic tree, the phylogenetic diversity of a set A of taxa is the total weight of edges on paths to A. Finding small sets of maximal diversity is crucial for conservation planning, as it indicates where limited resources can be invested most efficiently. In recent years, efficient algorithms have been developed to find sets of taxa that maximize phylogenetic diversity either in a phylogenetic network or in a phylogenetic tree subject to ecological constraints, such as a food web. However, these aspects have mostly been studied independently. Since both factors are biologically important, it seems natural to consider them together. In this paper, we introduce decision problems where, given a phylogenetic network, a food web, and integers k, and D, the task is to find a set of k taxa with phylogenetic diversity of at least D under the maximize all paths measure, while also satisfying viability conditions within the food web. Here, we consider different definitions of viability, which all demand that a "sufficient" number of prey species survive to support surviving predators. We investigate the parameterized complexity of these problems and present several fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) algorithms. Specifically, we provide a complete complexity dichotomy characterizing which combinations of parameters - out of the size constraint k, the acceptable diversity loss D, the scanwidth of the food web, the maximum in-degree in the network, and the network height h - lead to W[1]-hardness and which admit FPT algorithms. Our primary methodological contribution is a novel algorithmic framework for solving phylogenetic diversity problems in networks where dependencies (such as those from a food web) impose an order, using a color coding approach.</description>

      <title>Labeling and folding multi-labeled trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20292v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 1989 Erd\H{o}s and Sz\'ekely showed that there is a bijection between (i) the set of rooted trees with $n+1$ vertices whose leaves are bijectively labeled with the elements of $[\ell]=\{1,2,\dots,\ell\}$ for some $\ell \leq n$, and (ii) the set of partitions of $[n]=\{1,2,\dots,n\}$. They established this via a labeling algorithm based on the anti-lexicographic ordering of non-empty subsets of $[n]$ which extends the labeling of the leaves of a given tree to a labeling of all of the vertices of that tree. In this paper, we generalize their approach by developing a labeling algorithm for multi-labeled trees, that is, rooted trees whose leaves are labeled by positive integers but in which distinct leaves may have the same label. In particular, we show that certain orderings of the set of all finite, non-empty multisets of positive integers can be used to characterize partitions of a multiset that arise from labelings of multi-labeled trees. As an application, we show that the recently introduced class of labelable phylogenetic networks is precisely the class of phylogenetic networks that are stable relative to the so-called folding process on multi-labeled trees. We also give a bijection between the labelable phylogenetic networks with leaf-set $[n]$ and certain partitions of multisets.</description>
