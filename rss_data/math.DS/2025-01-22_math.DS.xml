      <title>On the dimension theory of Okamoto's function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the dimension theory of the one parameter family of Okamoto's function. We compute the Hausdorff, box-counting and Assouad dimensions of the graph for a typical choice of parameter. Furthermore, we study the dimension of the level sets. We give an upper bound on the dimension of every level set and we show that for a typical choice of parameters this value is attained for Lebesgue almost every level sets.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Fuchsian flows and the coupled vortex equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide an alternative construction of the quasi-Fuchsian flows introduced by Ghys in \cite{Ghys-92}. Our approach is based on the coupled vortex equations that allows to see these flows as thermostats on the unit tangent bundle of the Blaschke metric uniquely determined by a conformal class and a holomorphic quadratic differential. We also give formulas for the marked length spectrum of a quasi-Fuchsian flow.</description>

      <title>On the speed of convergence of the pressure function at zero temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove here that the pressure function cannot converge to the limit entropy at zero temperature faster than some exponential rate. Furthermore, we characterize this limit rate via an expression involving the Peierls barriers between the irreducible components of the Aubry set. This extends and completes results from [8] and [7]. In the first one, an exact exponential speed of convergence was proved, under the assumption that the Aubry set is a subshift of finite type. In the later one, a rate was given but without interpretation in term of Thermodynamical quantities of the system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the ergodic optimization problem over a real analytic expanding circle map. We show that in both the topological and the measure-theoretical senses, a typical $C^r$ performance function has a unique maximizing measure and the unique maximizing measure is supported on a periodic orbit, for $r=1,2,\cdots,\infty,\omega$.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions for unique codings of fat Sierpinski gasket with multiple digits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given an integer $M\ge 1$ and $\beta\in(1, M+1)$, let $S_{\beta, M}$ be the fat Sierpinski gasket in $\mathbb R^2$ generated by the iterated function system $\left\{f_d(x)=\frac{x+d}{\beta}: d\in\Omega_M\right\}$, where $\Omega_M=\{(i,j)\in\mathbb Z_{\ge 0}^2: i+j\le M\}$. Then each $x\in S_{\beta, M}$ may represent as a series $x=\sum_{i=1}^\infty\frac{d_i}{\beta^i}=:\Pi_\beta((d_i))$, and the infinite sequence $(d_i)\in\Omega_M^{\mathbb N}$ is called a \emph{coding} of $x$. Since $\beta&lt;M+1$, a point in $S_{\beta, M}$ may have multiple codings. Let $U_{\beta, M}$ be the set of $x\in S_{\beta, M}$ having a unique coding, that is \[ U_{\beta, M}=\left\{x\in S_{\beta, M}: \#\Pi_\beta^{-1}(x)=1\right\}. \] When $M=1$, Kong and Li [2020, Nonlinearity] described two critical bases for the phase transitions of the intrinsic univoque set $\widetilde U_{\beta, 1}$, which is a subset of $U_{\beta, 1}$. In this paper we consider $M\ge 2$, and characterize the two critical bases $\beta_G(M)$ and $\beta_c(M)$ for the phase transitions of $U_{\beta, M}$: (i) if $\beta\in(1, \beta_G(M)]$, then $U_{\beta, M}$ is finite; (ii) if $\beta\in(\beta_G(M), \beta_c(M))$ then $U_{\beta, M}$ is countably infinite; (iii) if $\beta=\beta_c(M)$ then $U_{\beta, M}$ is uncountable and has zero Hausdorff dimension; (iv) if $\beta&gt;\beta_c(M)$ then $U_{\beta, M}$ has positive Hausdorff dimension. Our results can also be applied to the intrinsic univoque set $\widetilde{U}_{\beta, M}$. Moreover, we show that the first critical base $\beta_G(M)$ is a perron number, while the second critical base $\beta_c(M)$ is a transcendental number.</description>

      <title>On the Dimension of Pullback Attractors in Recurrent Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are high-dimensional state space models capable of learning functions on sequence data. Recently, it has been conjectured that reservoir computers, a particular class of RNNs, trained on observations of a dynamical systems can be interpreted as embeddings. This result has been established for the case of linear reservoir systems. In this work, we use a nonautonomous dynamical systems approach to establish an upper bound for the fractal dimension of the subset of reservoir state space approximated during training and prediction phase. We prove that when the input sequences comes from an Nin-dimensional invertible dynamical system, the fractal dimension of this set is bounded above by Nin. The result obtained here are useful in dimensionality reduction of computation in RNNs as well as estimating fractal dimensions of dynamical systems from limited observations of their time series. It is also a step towards understanding embedding properties of reservoir computers.</description>

      <title>Various notions of topological transitivity in non-autonomous and generic dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider two types of dynamical systems namely non-autonomous discrete dynamical systems(NDDS) and generic dynamical systems(GDS). In both of them, we study various notions of transitivity. We give many equivalent conditions for each of these notions and present the implications among these in NDDS and GDS. For a given NDDS, we associate a GDS and discuss whether if the given NDDS has a particular variation of transitivity then the associated GDS also has such a variation and vice versa.</description>

      <title>A threshold for Poisson behavior of non-stationary product measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\gamma_{n}= O (\log^{-c}n)$ and let $\nu$ be the infinite product measure whose $n$-th marginal is Bernoulli$(1/2+\gamma_{n})$. We show that $c=1/2$ is the threshold, above which $\nu$-almost every point is simply Poisson generic in the sense of Peres-Weiss, and below which this can fail. This provides a range in which $\nu$ is singular with respect to the uniform product measure, but $\nu$-almost every point is simply Poisson generic.</description>

Abstract: Let $A$ be a $2\times 2$ integral matrix with an eigenvalue of modulus strictly less than 1. Let $T$ be the natural endomorphism on the torus $\mathbb{T}^2=\mathbb{R}^2/\mathbb{Z}^2$, induced by $A$. Given $\tau&gt;0$, let
  \[
  R_\tau =\{\, x\in \mathbb{T}^2 : T^nx\in B(x,e^{-n\tau})~\mathrm{infinitely ~many}~n\in\mathbb{N} \,\}.
  \]
  We calculated the Hausdorff dimension of $R_\tau$, and also prove that $R_\tau$ has a large intersection property.</description>

      <title>Effective Exponential Drifts on Strata of Abelian Differentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of $SL_{2}(\mathbb{R})$ on the stratum of translation surfaces $\mathcal{H}(2)$. In particular, we prove that an orbit of the upper triangular subgroup of $SL_{2}(\mathbb{R})$ has a discretized dimension of almost $1$ in a direction transverse to the $SL_{2}(\mathbb{R})$-orbit.
  The proof proceeds via an effective closing lemma, and the Margulis function technique, which serves as an effective version of the exponential drift on $\mathcal{H}(2)$. The idea is based on the use of McMullen's classification theorem, together with Lindenstrauss-Mohammadi-Wang's effective equidistribution theorems in homogeneous dynamics.</description>

      <title>Computation of Lyapunov exponents of matrix products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For $m$ given square matrices $A_0, A_1, \cdots, A_{m-1}$ ($m\ge 2$), one of which is assumed to be of rank $1$, and for a given sequence $(\omega_n)$ in $\{0,1, \cdots, m-1\}^\mathbb{N}$, the following limit, if it exists, $$L(\omega):=\lim_{n\to \infty} \frac 1n \log \|A_{\omega_0} A_{\omega_2}\cdots A_{\omega_{n-1}}\|$$ defines the Lyapunov exponent of the sequence of matrices $(A_{\omega_n})_{n\ge 0}$. It is proved that the Lyapunov exponent $L(\omega)$ has a closed-form expression under certain conditions. One special case arises when $A_j$'s are non-negative and $\omega$ is generic with respect to some shift-invariant measure; a second special case occurs when $A_j$'s (for $1\le j&lt;m$) are invertible and $\omega$ is a typical point with respect to some shift-ergodic measure. Substitutive sequences and characteristic sequences of $\mathcal{B}$-free integers are considered as examples. An application is presented for the computation of multifractal spectrum of weighted Birkhoff averages.</description>

      <title>Topological Transitivity of Nonautonomous Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the concept of topological transitivity in nonautonomous dynamical systems, which are defined as sequences of continuous maps from a compact metric space to itself.
  It investigates various conditions (including intersection of any pair of open sets and existence of a dense orbit) that could be taken as definitions of the topological transitivity of a nonautonomous system, and addresses their relation both in the case of a general compact metric space and in the case where, in addition, the space has no isolated point.
  This provides the necessary basis for further investigation of transitivity of nonautonomous dynamical systems.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the equilibrium configurations for generalized Frenkel-Kontorova models subjected to almost-periodic media. By contrast with the spirit of the KAM theory, our approach consists in establishing the other perturbation theory for fully chaotic systems far away from the integrable, which is called "anti-integrable" limits. More precisely, we show that for large enough potentials, there exists a locally unique equilibrium with any prescribed rotation number/vector/plane, which is hyperbolic. The assumptions are general enough to satisfy both short-range and long-range Frenkel-Kontorova models and their multidimensional analogues.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study Random Dynamical Systems (RDSs) of homeomorphisms on the circle without a finite orbit. We characterize the topological dynamics of the associated semigroup by identifying the existence of invariant sets which are finite unions of intervals. We describe the accumulation points of the average orbit of the transfer operator. For each ergodic stationary measure, we demonstrate interesting properties of its weight function on the circle. Relationships between the minimal sets of an RDS and its inverse RDS are also established.</description>

      <title>Outer billiards of symplectically self-polar convex bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that $C^1$-smooth strictly convex Radon norms in $\mathbb{R}^2$ can be characterized by the property that the outer billiard map, which corresponds to the unit ball of the norm, has an invariant curve consisting of 4-periodic orbits. In higher dimensions, Radon norms are necessarily Euclidean. However, we show in this paper that the property of existence of an invariant curve of 4-periodic orbits allows a higher-dimensional extension to the class of symplectically self-polar convex bodies. Moreover, this class of convex bodies provides the first non-trivial examples of invariant hypersurfaces for outer billiard map. This is in contrast with conventional Birkhoff billiards in higher dimensions, where it was proved by Berger and Gruber that only ellipsoids have caustics. It is not known, however, if non-trivial invariant hypersurfaces can exist for higher-dimensional Birkhoff billiards.</description>

      <title>Generalized TCP-RED dynamical model for Internet congestion control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adaptive management of traffic congestion in the Internet is a complex problem that can gain useful insights from a dynamical approach. In this paper we propose and analyze a one-dimensional, discrete-time nonlinear model for Internet congestion control at the routers. Specifically, the states correspond to the average queue sizes of the incoming data packets and the dynamical core consists of a monotone or unimodal mapping with a unique fixed point. This model generalizes a previous one in that additional control parameters are introduced via the data packet drop probability with the objective of enhancing stability. To make the analysis more challenging, the original model was shown to exhibit the usual features of low-dimensional chaos with respect to several system and control parameters, e.g., positive Lyapunov exponents and Feigenbaum-like bifurcation diagrams. We concentrate first on the theoretical aspects that may promote the unique stationary state of the system to a global attractor, which in our case amounts to global stability. In a second step, those theoretical results are translated into stability domains for robust setting of the new control parameters in practical applications. Numerical simulations confirm that the new parameters make it possible to extend the stability domains, in comparison with previous results. Therefore, the present work may lead to an adaptive congestion control algorithm with a more stable performance than other algorithms currently in use.</description>

      <title>The Forestry of Adversarial Totient Iterations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a closed-form expression for $\varphi(1+\varphi(2+\varphi(3+...+\varphi(n)$, where $\varphi$ is Euler's totient function. More generally, for an integer sequence $A=\{a_j\}$ we study the value of $A^\varphi(n)=\varphi(a_1+\varphi(a_2+\varphi(a_3+...+\varphi(a_n)$ when $A$ is the perfect squares or the perfect cubes. We show $A^\varphi(n)$ is bounded for all sequences considered. We also present the Arboreal Algorithm which can sometimes determine a closed form of $A^\varphi(n)$ using tree-like structures.</description>

      <title>A dynamical systems approach to WKB-methods: The eigenvalue problem for a single well potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we revisit the eigenvalue problem of the one-dimensional Schr{\"o}dinger equation for smooth single well potentials. In particular, we provide a new interpretation of the Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization formula. A novel aspect of our results, which are based on recent work of the authors on the turning point problem based upon dynamical systems methods, is that we cover all eigenvalues $E\in [0,\mathcal O(1)]$ and show that the Bohr-Sommerfeld quantitization formula approximates all of these eigenvalues (in a sense that is made precise). At the same time, we provide rigorous smoothness statements of the eigenvalues as functions of $\epsilon$. We find that whereas the small eigenvalues $E=\mathcal O(\epsilon)$ are smooth functions of $\epsilon$, the large ones $E=\mathcal O(1)$ are smooth functions of $n\epsilon \in[c_1,c_2],\,0&lt;c_1&lt;c_2&lt;\infty$, and $0\le \epsilon^{1/3}\ll 1$; here $n\in \mathbb N_0$ is the index of the eigenvalues.</description>

      <title>Changing the ranking in eigenvector centrality of a weighted graph by small perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we consider eigenvector centrality for the nodes of a graph and study the robustness (and stability) of this popular centrality measure. For a given weighted graph $\G$ (both directed and undirected), we consider the associated weighted adiacency matrix $A$, which by definition is a non-negative matrix. Eigenvector centrality consists of ranking the elements of the graph according to the corresponding entries of the Perron eigenvector of $A$, which is associated with the positive eigenvalue with largest modulus.
  An indicator of the robustness of eigenvector centrality consists in looking for a nearby perturbed graph $\widetilde{\G}$, with the same structure as $\G$ (i.e., with the same vertices and edges), but with a weighted adiacency matrix $\widetilde A$ such that the highest $m$ entries ($m \ge 2$) of the Perron eigenvector of $\widetilde A$ coalesce, making the ranking at the highest level ambiguous. To compute a solution to this matrix nearness problem, a nested iterative algorithm is proposed that makes use of a constrained gradient system of matrix differential equations (possibly on a low-rank manifold) in the inner iteration and a one-dimensional optimization of the perturbation size in the outer iteration.
  The proposed algorithm produces the {\em optimal} perturbation (i.e., the one with smallest Frobenius norm) of the graph, which causes the looked-for coalescence, which is a measure of the sensitivity of the graph. The methodology is formulated in terms of graphs but applies to any nonnegative matrix, with potential applications in fields like population models, consensus dynamics, economics, etc.</description>

      <title>Poncelet pairs of a circle and parabolas from a confocal family and Painlev\'e VI equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study pairs of conics $(\mathcal{D},\mathcal{P})$, called \textit{$n$-Poncelet pairs}, such that an $n$-gon, called an \textit{$n$-Poncelet polygon}, can be inscribed into $\mathcal{D}$ and circumscribed about $\mathcal{P}$. Here $\mathcal{D}$ is a circle and $\mathcal{P}$ is a parabola from a confocal pencil $\mathcal{F}$ with the focus $F$. We prove that the circle contains $F$ if and only if every parabola $\mathcal{P}\in\mathcal{F}$ forms a $3$-Poncelet pair with the circle. We prove that the center of $\mathcal{D}$ coincides with $F$ if and only if every parabola $\mathcal{P}\in \mathcal{F}$ forms a $4$-Poncelet pair with the circle. We refer to such property, observed for $n=3$ and $n=4$, as \textit{$n$-isoperiodicity}. We prove that $\mathcal{F}$ is not $n$-isoperiodic with any circle $\mathcal{D}$ for $n$ different from $3$ and $4$. Using isoperiodicity, we construct explicit algebraic solutions to Painlev\'e VI equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explicitly express the local Maslov index by a Maslov index in finite dimensional case without symplectic reduction. Then we calculate the Maslov index for the path of pairs of Lagrangian subspaces in triangular form. In particular, we get the Maslov-type index of a given symplectic path in triangle form. As applications, we calculate the splitting numbers of the symplectic matrix in triangle form and dependence of iteration theory on triangular frames. We study the continuity of families of bounded linear relations and families of bounded linear operators acting on closed linear subspaces as technique preparations.</description>

      <title>Homoclinic orbits, Reeb chords and nice Birkhoff sections for Reeb flows in 3D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that for a $C^\infty$-generic contact form defining a given co-oriented contact structure on a closed $3$-manifold, every hyperbolic periodic Reeb orbit admits a transverse homoclinic connection in each of the branches of its stable and unstable manifolds. We exploit this result to prove that for a $C^\infty$-generic contact form defining a given co-oriented contact structure, given any finite collection $\Gamma$ of periodic Reeb orbits and any Legendrian link $L$, there exists a global surface of section (embedded Birkhoff section) for the Reeb flow that contains $\Gamma$ in its boundary, and that contains in its interior a Legendrian link that is Legendrian isotopic to $L$ by a $C^0$-small isotopy. Finally we prove that if the Reeb vector field admits a $\partial$-strong Birkhoff section then every Legendrian knot has infinitely many geometrically distinct Reeb chords, except possibly when the ambient manifold is a lens space or the sphere and the Reeb flow has exactly two periodic orbits. In particular, $C^\infty$-generically on the contact form there are infinitely many geometrically distinct Reeb chords for every Legendrian knot. In the case of geodesic flows, every Legendrian knot has infinitely many disjoint chords, without any further assumptions.</description>

      <title>A trajectorial approach to the gradient flow of McKean-Vlasov SDEs with mobility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish the gradient flow representation of diffusion with mobility $b$ with respect to the modified Wasserstein quasi-metric $W_h$, where $h(r)=rb(r)$. The appropriate selection of the free energy functional depends on the specific form of the generalized entropy. Different from the JKO scheme, we derive the trajectorial version of the relative entropy dissipation identity for the McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equation (SDE) with Nemytskii-type coefficients, utilizing techniques from stochastic analysis. Based on this, we demonstrate that the trajectorial average of the solution process to the McKean-Vlasov SDE, with respect to the underlying measure, corresponds to the rate of dissipation of the free energy. As an application, we present the energy dissipation of the Fermi-Dirac-Fokker-Planck equation, a model widely used in physics and biology to describe saturation effects. Inspired by numerical simulations, we propose two questions on condensation phenomena and non-exponential convergence rate.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the existence of periodic waves for the perturbed generalized defocusing mKdV equation using the theory of geometric singular perturbation. By Abelian integral and involution operation, we prove that the limit wave speed c_0(h) is monotonic with respect to energy h,and the lower bound of the limit wave speed is found. These works extend the main result of Chen et al. (2018) to the generalized case. Some numerical simulations are conducted to verify the correctness of the theoretical analysis.</description>

      <title>Some examples of affine isometries of Banach spaces arising from 1-D dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a large family of examples of affine isometries of the Banach spaces $C^0 (S^1)$, $L^1 (S^1)$ and $L^2 (S^1 \times S^1)$ that are fixed-point-free despite being recurrent (in particular, they have zero drift). These come from natural cocycles on the group of circle diffeomorphisms, namely the logarithmic, affine and (a variation of the) Schwarzian derivative. Quite interestingly, they arise from diffeomorphisms that are generic in an appropriate context. We also show how to promote these examples in order to obtain families of commuting isometries satisfying the same properties.</description>

      <title>Characterization of Invariance, Periodic Solutions and Optimization of Dynamic Financial Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cascading failures, such as bankruptcies and defaults, pose a serious threat for the resilience of the global financial system. Indeed, because of the complex investment and cross-holding relations within the system, failures can occur as a result of the propagation of a financial collapse from one organization to another. While this problem has been studied in depth from a static angle, namely, when the system is at an equilibrium, we take a different perspective and study the corresponding dynamical system. The contribution of this paper is threefold. First, we carry out a systematic analysis of the regions of attraction and invariance of the system orthants, defined by the positive and negative values of the organizations' equity. Second, we investigate periodic solutions and show through a counterexample that there could exist periodic solutions of period greater than 2. Finally, we study the problem of finding the smallest cash injection that would bring the system to the maximal invariant region of the positive orthant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1701.01910v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we will study the statistical behaviors of orbits. Firstly, we will show that for a dynamical systems have the shadowing property or almost specification property, the set of nonrecurrent points has full topological entropy. After that, we introduce a criteria for classification of dynamical orbits in order to study the complexity theory of dynamical systems. The criteria is to use upper and lower natural density, upper and lower Banach density to divide different statistical future of dynamical orbits into 56 cases, 28 cases for recurrent orbits and 28 cases for nonrecurrent orbits. We will show the existence of 50 cases and for topologically transitive topologically expanding or topologically transitive topologically Anosov dynamical systems, we will prove that 35 classes, including all the 28 cases for nonrecurrent orbits, can carry full topological entropy. Besides, we will prove that 9 cases can be observable in some differential dynamical systems. Finally, we will apply our results to $\b{eta}-$shifts, $C^{1+{\alpha}}$ surface diffeomorphisms and Ma$\~n\'$e diffeomorphisms.</description>

      <title>A Girsanov approach to slow parameterizing manifolds in the presence of noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.08598</link>
      <description>arXiv:1903.08598v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work investigates a three-dimensional slow-fast stochastic system with quadratic nonlinearity and additive noise, inspired by fluid dynamics. The deterministic counterpart exhibits a periodic orbit and a slow manifold. We demonstrate that, under specific parameter regimes, this deterministic slow manifold can serve as an approximate parameterization of the fast variable by the slow variables within the stochastic system.
  Building upon this parameterization, we derive a two-dimensional reduced model, a stochastic Hopf normal form, that captures the essential dynamics of the original system. Both the original and the reduced systems possess ergodic invariant measures, characterizing their long-term behavior.
  We quantify the discrepancy between the original system and its slow approximation by deriving error estimates involving the Wasserstein distance between the marginals of these invariant measures along the radial component. These error bounds are shown to be controlled by a parameterization defect, which measures the quality of the fast-slow variable parameterization.
  A key technical innovation lies in the application of Girsanov's theorem to obtain these error estimates in the presence of oscillatory instabilities. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to regimes exhibiting an "inverted" timescale separation, where the variable to be parameterized evolves on a slower timescale than the resolved variables. To address these more challenging scenarios, we introduce path-dependent coefficients in the parameterizing manifold, enabling the derivation of robust error bounds for the corresponding reduced model. Numerical simulations complement our theoretical findings, providing insights into the model's behavior and exploring parameter regimes beyond the scope of our analytical results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2106.12512v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a numerical condition for right-handedness of a dynamically convex Reeb flow on the $3$-sphere. Our condition is stated in terms of an asymptotic ratio between the amount of rotation of the linearised flow and the linking number of trajectories with a periodic orbit that spans a disk-like global surface of section. As an application, we find an explicit constant $\delta_* &lt; 0.7225$ such that if a Riemannian metric on the $2$-sphere is $\delta$-pinched with $\delta &gt; \delta_*$, then its geodesic flow lifts to a right-handed flow on the $3$-sphere. In particular, all finite non-empty collections of periodic orbits of such a geodesic flow bind open books whose pages are global surfaces of section.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we prove that for topologically mixing metric Anosov flows their equilibrium states corresponding to H\"older potentials satisfy a strong rigidity property: they are determined only by their disintegrations on (strong) stable or unstable leaves.
  As a consequence we deduce: the corresponding horocyclic foliations of such systems are uniquely quasi-ergodic, provided that the corresponding Jacobian is H\"older, without any restriction on the dimension of the invariant distributions. This gives another proof of a result of Babillott-Ledrappier.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.03297v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a proper geodesically complete CAT(-1) space equipped with a discrete non-elementary action, and a bounded continuous potential with the Bowen property, we construct weighted quasi-conformal Patterson densities and use them to build a Gibbs measure on the space of geodesic lines. Our construction yields a Gibbs measure with local product structure for any potential in this class, which includes bounded H\"older continuous potentials. Furthermore, if the Gibbs measure is finite, then we prove that it is the unique equilibrium state. In contrast to previous results in this direction, we do not require any condition that the potential must take the same value on two geodesic lines which share a common segment.</description>

      <title>Analysis of tidal flows through the Strait of Gibraltar using Dynamic Mode Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01377v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Strait of Gibraltar is a region characterized by intricate oceanic sub-mesoscale features, influenced by topography, tidal forces, instabilities, and nonlinear hydraulic processes, all governed by the nonlinear equations of fluid motion. In this study, we aim to uncover the underlying physics of these phenomena within 3D MIT general circulation model simulations, including waves, eddies, and gyres. To achieve this, we employ Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) to break down simulation snapshots into Koopman modes, with distinct exponential growth/decay rates and oscillation frequencies. Our objectives encompass evaluating DMD's efficacy in capturing known features, unveiling new elements, ranking modes, and exploring order reduction. We also introduce modifications to enhance DMD's robustness, numerical accuracy, and robustness of eigenvalues. DMD analysis yields a comprehensive understanding of flow patterns, internal wave formation, and the dynamics of the Strait of Gibraltar, its meandering behaviors, and the formation of a secondary gyre, notably the Western Alboran Gyre, as well as the propagation of Kelvin and coastal-trapped waves along the African coast. In doing so, it significantly advances our comprehension of intricate oceanographic phenomena and underscores the immense utility of DMD as an analytical tool for such complex datasets, suggesting that DMD could serve as a valuable addition to the toolkit of oceanographers.</description>

      <title>Invariant measures for stochastic Burgers equation in unbounded domains with space-time white noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15349v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the stochastic damped Burgers equation with multiplicative space-time white noise defined on the entire real line. We prove the existence and uniqueness of a mild solution of the stochastic damped Burgers equation in the weighted space and establish that the solution is bounded in probability. Furthermore, by using the Krylov-Bogolioubov theorem, we obtain the existence of invariant measures.</description>

      <title>Critical axis of Ruelle resonances for Anosov flow with a potential</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04948v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We combine methods from microlocal analysis and dimension theory to study resonances with largest real part for an Anosov flow with smooth real valued potential. We show that the resonant states are closely related to special systems of measures supported on the stable manifolds introduced by Climenhaga. As a result, we relate the presence of the resonances on the critical axis to mixing properties of the flow with respect to certain equilibrium measures and show that these equilibrium measures can be reconstructed from the spectral theory of the Anosov flow.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00520v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we further develop the thermodynamic formalism of affine iterated function systems with countably many transformations by showing the existence and extending earlier characterisations of the equilibrium states of finite affine iterated function systems to the countably infinite case. As an application, under mild conditions, we prove that the affinity dimension of a countable affine iterated function system is equal to the supremum of the affinity dimensions of its finite subsystems. We deduce corollaries concerning the Hausdorff dimension of countably generated self-affine sets in dimensions $1$, $2$, and $3$ satisfying mild deterministic assumptions and in arbitrary dimension with generic translations.</description>

      <title>Formulating human risk response in epidemic models: exogenous vs endogenous approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15535v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent pandemic emphasized the need to consider the role of human behavior in shaping epidemic dynamics. In particular, it is necessary to extend beyond the classical epidemiological structures to fully capture the interplay between the spread of disease and how people respond. Here, we focus on the challenge of incorporating change in human behavior in the form of "risk response" into compartmental epidemiological models, where humans adapt their actions in response to their perceived risk of becoming infected. The review examines 37 papers containing over 40 compartmental models, categorizing them into two fundamentally distinct classes: exogenous and endogenous approaches to modeling risk response. While in exogenous approaches, human behavior is often included using different fixed parameter values for certain time periods, endogenous approaches seek for a mechanism internal to the model to explain changes in human behavior as a function of the state of disease. We further discuss two different formulations within endogenous models as implicit versus explicit representation of information diffusion. This analysis provides insights for modelers in selecting an appropriate framework for epidemic modeling.</description>

      <title>Conformal measures of (anti)holomorphic correspondences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01361v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the existence and properties of conformal measures on limit sets of (anti)holomorphic correspondences. We show that if the critical exponent satisfies $1\leq \delta_{\operatorname{crit}}(x) &lt;+\infty,$ the correspondence $F$ is (relatively) hyperbolic on the limit set $\Lambda_+(x)$, and $\Lambda_+(x)$ is minimal, then $\Lambda_+(x)$ admits a non-atomic conformal measure for $F$ and the Hausdorff dimension of $\Lambda_+(x)$ is strictly less than 2. As a special case, this shows that for a parameter $a$ in the interior of a hyperbolic component of the modular Mandelbrot set, the limit set of the Bullett--Penrose correspondence $F_a$ has a non-atomic conformal measure and its Hausdorff dimension is strictly less than 2. The same results hold for the LLMM correspondences, under some extra assumptions on its defining function $f$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19393v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For an invariant probability measure for the Gauss map, almost all numbers are Diophantine if the log of the partial quotent function is integrable. We show that with respect to a ``continued fraction mixing'' measure for the Gauss map with the log of the partial quotent function non-integrable, almost all numbers are Liouville. We also exhibit Gauss-invariant, ergodic measures with arbitrary irrationality exponent. The proofs are via the ``extravagance'' of positive, stationary, stochastic processes. In addition, we prove a Khinchin-type theorem for Diophantine approximation with respect to ``weak Renyi measures'' which are ``doubling at $0$''.</description>

      <title>Invariant graphs and dynamics of a family of continuous piecewise linear planar maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01052v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the family of piecewise linear maps $$F_{a,b}(x,y)=\left(|x| - y + a, x - |y| + b\right),$$ where $(a,b)\in \mathbb{R}^2$. This family belongs to a wider one that has deserved some interest in the recent years as it provides a framework for generalized Lozi-type maps. Among our results, we prove that for $a\ge 0$ all the orbits are eventually periodic and moreover that there are at most three different periodic behaviors formed by at most seven points. For $a&lt;0$ we prove that for each $b\in\mathbb{R}$ there exists a compact graph $\Gamma,$ which is invariant under the map $F$, such that for each $(x,y)\in \mathbb{R}^2$ there exists $n\in\mathbb{N}$ (that may depend on $x$) such that $F_{a,b}^n(x,y)\in \Gamma.$ We give explicitly all these invariant graphs and we characterize the dynamics of the map restricted to the corresponding graph for all $(a,b)\in\mathbb{R}^2$ obtaining, among other results, a full characterization of when $F_{a,b}|_{\Gamma}$ has positive or zero entropy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2203.12128v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a closed Riemannian manifold $M$ of negative curvature and dimension at least 3 with marked length spectrum sufficiently close (multiplicatively) to that of a locally symmetric space $N$. Using the methods of Hamenst\"adt, we show the volumes of $M$ and $N$ are approximately equal. We then show the Besson-Courtois-Gallot map $F: M \to N$ is a diffeomorphism with derivative bounds close to 1 and depending on the ratio of the two marked length spectrum functions. Thus, we refine the results of Hamenst\"adt and Besson-Courtois-Gallot, which show $M$ and $N$ are isometric if their marked length spectra are equal. We also prove a similar result for compact negatively curved surfaces using the methods of Otal together with a version of the Gromov compactness theorem due to Pugh.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2206.10749v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper continues the study of link spectral invariants on compact surfaces, introduced in our previous work and shown to satisfy a Weyl law in which they asymptotically recover the Calabi invariant. Here we study their subleading asymptotics on surfaces of genus zero. We show the subleading asymptotics are bounded for smooth time-dependent Hamiltonians, and recover the Ruelle invariant for autonomous disc maps with finitely many critical values. We deduce that the Calabi homomorphism admits infinitely many extensions to the group of compactly supported area-preserving homeomorphisms, and that the kernel of the Calabi homomorphism on the group of hameomorphisms is not simple.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.03659v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal G_n$ denote the space of $n$-generated marked groups. We prove that, for every $n\ge 2$, there exist $2^{\aleph_0}$ non-atomic, $Out(F_n)$-invariant, mixing probability measures on $\mathcal G_n$. On the other hand, there are non-empty closed subsets of $\mathcal G_n$ that admit no $Out(F_n)$-invariant probability measure. Acylindrical hyperbolicity of the group $Aut(F_n)$ plays a crucial role in the proof of both results. We also discuss model theoretic implications of the existence of $Out(F_n)$-invariant, ergodic probability measures on $\mathcal G_n$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.15101v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The marked length spectrum (MLS) of a closed negatively curved manifold $(M, g)$ is known to determine the metric $g$ under various circumstances. We show that in these cases, (approximate) values of the MLS on a sufficiently large finite set approximately determine the metric. Our approach is to recover the hypotheses of our main theorems in arXiv:2203.12128, namely multiplicative closeness of the MLS functions on the entire set of closed geodesics of $M$. We use mainly dynamical tools and arguments, but take great care to show the constants involved depend only on concrete geometric information about the given Riemannian metrics, such as the dimension, sectional curvature bounds, and injectivity radii.</description>

Abstract: n this article, we define orbit data for birational maps of $\mathbf{P}^2(\mathbb{C})$ and show that this data uniquely determines the dynamical degree by providing minimal polynomials for dynamical degrees in terms of orbit data. Leveraging this relationship, we recursively identify all Salem and Pisot numbers that appear in the Weyl spectrum of the union of the Coxeter groups $W_n$ associated with $E_n$ and the set of all dynamical degrees of birational maps of $\mathbf{P}^2(\mathbb{C})$. Furthermore, we demonstrate that all accumulation points of Pisot numbers less than or equal to 2 are present in the Weyl spectrum.</description>

      <title>A rigorous integrator and global existence for higher-dimensional semilinear parabolic PDEs via semigroup theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00406v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a general constructive method to compute solutions of initial value problems of semilinear parabolic partial differential equations on hyper-rectangular domains via semigroup theory and computer-assisted proofs. Once a numerical candidate for the solution is obtained via a finite dimensional projection, Chebyshev series expansions are used to solve the linearized equations about the approximation from which a solution map operator is constructed. Using the solution operator (which exists from semigroup theory), we define an infinite dimensional contraction operator whose unique fixed point together with its rigorous bounds provide the local inclusion of the solution. Applying this technique for multiple time steps leads to constructive proofs of existence of solutions over long time intervals. As applications, we study the 3D/2D Swift-Hohenberg, where we combine our method with explicit constructions of trapping regions to prove global existence of solutions of initial value problems converging asymptotically to nontrivial equilibria. A second application consists of the 2D Ohta-Kawasaki equation, providing a framework for handling derivatives in nonlinear terms.</description>

      <title>Front propagation in hybrid reaction-diffusion epidemic models with spatial heterogeneity. Part I: Spreading speed and asymptotic behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07501v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a two-species reaction-diffusion system in one space dimension that is derived from an epidemiological model in a spatially periodic environment with two types of pathogens: the wild type and the mutant. The system is of a hybrid nature, partly cooperative and partly competitive, but neither of these entirely. As a result, the comparison principle does not hold for the whole system. We study spreading properties of solution fronts when the infection is localized initially. We show that there is a well-defined spreading speed both in the right and left directions and that it can be computed from the linearized equation at the leading edge of the propagation front. Next we study the case where the coefficients are spatially homogeneous and show that, when spreading occurs, every solution to the Cauchy problem converges to the unique positive stationary solution as $t\to\infty$. Finally we consider the case of rapidly oscillating coefficients, that is, when the spatial period of the coefficients, denoted by $\varepsilon$, is very small. We show that there exists a unique positive stationary solution, and that every positive solution to the Cauchy problem converges to this stationary solution as $t\to\infty$. We then discuss the homogenization limit as $\varepsilon\to 0$.</description>

Abstract: A holomorphic pre-foliation $\mathscr{F}=\mathcal{C}\boxtimes\mathcal{F}$ on $\mathbb{P}^{2}_{\mathbb{C}}$ is the data of a reduced complex projective curve $\mathcal{C}$ of $\mathbb{P}^{2}_{\mathbb{C}}$ and a holomorphic foliation $\mathcal{F}$ on $\mathbb{P}^{2}_{\mathbb{C}}$. When the foliation $\mathcal{F}$ is convex (resp. reduced convex) and the curve $\mathcal{C}$ is invariant by $\mathcal{F}$, we say that the pre-foliation $\mathscr{F}=\mathcal{C}\boxtimes\mathcal{F}$ is convex (resp. reduced convex). We prove that the dual web of a reduced convex pre-foliation on $\mathbb{P}^{2}_{\mathbb{C}}$ is flat. This generalizes our previous result obtained in the case where the associated curve consists only of invariant lines.</description>

Abstract: We prove a dynamical variant of the Tits alternative for the group of almost automorphisms of a locally finite tree $\mathcal{T}$: a group of almost automorphisms of $\mathcal{T}$ either contains a nonabelian free group playing ping-pong on the boundary $\partial \mathcal{T}$, or the action of the group on $\partial \mathcal{T}$ preserves a probability measure. This generalises to all groups of tree almost automorphisms a result of S. Hurtado and E. Militon for Thompson's group $V$, with a hopefully simpler proof.</description>
