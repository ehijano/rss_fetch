      <title>The VoicePrivacy 2024 Challenge Evaluation Plan</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The task of the challenge is to develop a voice anonymization system for speech data which conceals the speaker's voice identity while protecting linguistic content and emotional states. The organizers provide development and evaluation datasets and evaluation scripts, as well as baseline anonymization systems and a list of training resources formed on the basis of the participants' requests. Participants apply their developed anonymization systems, run evaluation scripts and submit evaluation results and anonymized speech data to the organizers. Results will be presented at a workshop held in conjunction with Interspeech 2024 to which all participants are invited to present their challenge systems and to submit additional workshop papers.</description>

      <title>CLaM-TTS: Improving Neural Codec Language Model for Zero-Shot Text-to-Speech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the emergence of neural audio codecs, which encode multiple streams of discrete tokens from audio, large language models have recently gained attention as a promising approach for zero-shot Text-to-Speech (TTS) synthesis. Despite the ongoing rush towards scaling paradigms, audio tokenization ironically amplifies the scalability challenge, stemming from its long sequence length and the complexity of modelling the multiple sequences. To mitigate these issues, we present CLaM-TTS that employs a probabilistic residual vector quantization to (1) achieve superior compression in the token length, and (2) allow a language model to generate multiple tokens at once, thereby eliminating the need for cascaded modeling to handle the number of token streams. Our experimental results demonstrate that CLaM-TTS is better than or comparable to state-of-the-art neural codec-based TTS models regarding naturalness, intelligibility, speaker similarity, and inference speed. In addition, we examine the impact of the pretraining extent of the language models and their text tokenization strategies on performances.</description>

      <title>SMITIN: Self-Monitored Inference-Time INtervention for Generative Music Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Self-Monitored Inference-Time INtervention (SMITIN), an approach for controlling an autoregressive generative music transformer using classifier probes. These simple logistic regression probes are trained on the output of each attention head in the transformer using a small dataset of audio examples both exhibiting and missing a specific musical trait (e.g., the presence/absence of drums, or real/synthetic music). We then steer the attention heads in the probe direction, ensuring the generative model output captures the desired musical trait. Additionally, we monitor the probe output to avoid adding an excessive amount of intervention into the autoregressive generation, which could lead to temporally incoherent music. We validate our results objectively and subjectively for both audio continuation and text-to-music applications, demonstrating the ability to add controls to large generative models for which retraining or even fine-tuning is impractical for most musicians.
  Audio samples of the proposed intervention approach are available on our demo page http://tinyurl.com/smitin .</description>

      <title>A Computational Analysis of Lyric Similarity Perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In musical compositions that include vocals, lyrics significantly contribute to artistic expression. Consequently, previous studies have introduced the concept of a recommendation system that suggests lyrics similar to a user's favorites or personalized preferences, aiding in the discovery of lyrics among millions of tracks. However, many of these systems do not fully consider human perceptions of lyric similarity, primarily due to limited research in this area. To bridge this gap, we conducted a comparative analysis of computational methods for modeling lyric similarity with human perception. Results indicated that computational models based on similarities between embeddings from pre-trained BERT-based models, the audio from which the lyrics are derived, and phonetic components are indicative of perceptual lyric similarity. This finding underscores the importance of semantic, stylistic, and phonetic similarities in human perception about lyric similarity. We anticipate that our findings will enhance the development of similarity-based lyric recommendation systems by offering pseudo-labels for neural network development and introducing objective evaluation metrics.</description>

      <title>PhonologyBench: Evaluating Phonological Skills of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phonology, the study of speech's structure and pronunciation rules, is a critical yet often overlooked component in Large Language Model (LLM) research. LLMs are widely used in various downstream applications that leverage phonology such as educational tools and poetry generation. Moreover, LLMs can potentially learn imperfect associations between orthographic and phonological forms from the training data. Thus, it is imperative to benchmark the phonological skills of LLMs. To this end, we present PhonologyBench, a novel benchmark consisting of three diagnostic tasks designed to explicitly test the phonological skills of LLMs in English: grapheme-to-phoneme conversion, syllable counting, and rhyme word generation. Despite having no access to speech data, LLMs showcased notable performance on the PhonologyBench tasks. However, we observe a significant gap of 17% and 45% on Rhyme Word Generation and Syllable counting, respectively, when compared to humans. Our findings underscore the importance of studying LLM performance on phonological tasks that inadvertently impact real-world applications. Furthermore, we encourage researchers to choose LLMs that perform well on the phonological task that is closely related to the downstream application since we find that no single model consistently outperforms the others on all the tasks.</description>

      <title>Leveraging the Interplay Between Syntactic and Acoustic Cues for Optimizing Korean TTS Pause Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contemporary neural speech synthesis models have indeed demonstrated remarkable proficiency in synthetic speech generation as they have attained a level of quality comparable to that of human-produced speech. Nevertheless, it is important to note that these achievements have predominantly been verified within the context of high-resource languages such as English. Furthermore, the Tacotron and FastSpeech variants show substantial pausing errors when applied to the Korean language, which affects speech perception and naturalness. In order to address the aforementioned issues, we propose a novel framework that incorporates comprehensive modeling of both syntactic and acoustic cues that are associated with pausing patterns. Remarkably, our framework possesses the capability to consistently generate natural speech even for considerably more extended and intricate out-of-domain (OOD) sentences, despite its training on short audio clips. Architectural design choices are validated through comparisons with baseline models and ablation studies using subjective and objective metrics, thus confirming model performance.</description>

      <title>ART: The Alternating Reading Task Corpus for Speech Entrainment and Imitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Alternating Reading Task (ART) Corpus, a collection of dyadic sentence reading for studying the entrainment and imitation behaviour in speech communication. The ART corpus features three experimental conditions - solo reading, alternating reading, and deliberate imitation - as well as three sub-corpora encompassing French-, Italian-, and Slovak-accented English. This design allows systematic investigation of speech entrainment in a controlled and less-spontaneous setting. Alongside detailed transcriptions, it includes English proficiency scores, demographics, and in-experiment questionnaires for probing linguistic, personal and interpersonal influences on entrainment. Our presentation covers its design, collection, annotation processes, initial analysis, and future research prospects.</description>

      <title>UniverSLU: Universal Spoken Language Understanding for Diverse Tasks with Natural Language Instructions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02973v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies leverage large language models with multi-tasking capabilities, using natural language prompts to guide the model's behavior and surpassing performance of task-specific models. Motivated by this, we ask: can we build a single model that jointly performs various spoken language understanding (SLU) tasks? We start by adapting a pre-trained automatic speech recognition model to additional tasks using single-token task specifiers. We enhance this approach through instruction tuning, i.e., finetuning by describing the task using natural language instructions followed by the list of label options. Our approach can generalize to new task descriptions for the seen tasks during inference, thereby enhancing its user-friendliness. We demonstrate the efficacy of our single multi-task learning model "UniverSLU" for 12 speech classification and sequence generation task types spanning 17 datasets and 9 languages. On most tasks, UniverSLU achieves competitive performance and often even surpasses task-specific models. Additionally, we assess the zero-shot capabilities, finding that the model generalizes to new datasets and languages for seen task types.</description>

      <title>SonicVisionLM: Playing Sound with Vision Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04394v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There has been a growing interest in the task of generating sound for silent videos, primarily because of its practicality in streamlining video post-production. However, existing methods for video-sound generation attempt to directly create sound from visual representations, which can be challenging due to the difficulty of aligning visual representations with audio representations. In this paper, we present SonicVisionLM, a novel framework aimed at generating a wide range of sound effects by leveraging vision-language models(VLMs). Instead of generating audio directly from video, we use the capabilities of powerful VLMs. When provided with a silent video, our approach first identifies events within the video using a VLM to suggest possible sounds that match the video content. This shift in approach transforms the challenging task of aligning image and audio into more well-studied sub-problems of aligning image-to-text and text-to-audio through the popular diffusion models. To improve the quality of audio recommendations with LLMs, we have collected an extensive dataset that maps text descriptions to specific sound effects and developed a time-controlled audio adapter. Our approach surpasses current state-of-the-art methods for converting video to audio, enhancing synchronization with the visuals, and improving alignment between audio and video components.

      <title>Multi-Level Attention Aggregation for Language-Agnostic Speaker Replication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04111v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the task of language-agnostic speaker replication, a novel endeavor that seeks to replicate a speaker's voice irrespective of the language they are speaking. Towards this end, we introduce a multi-level attention aggregation approach that systematically probes and amplifies various speaker-specific attributes in a hierarchical manner. Through rigorous evaluations across a wide range of scenarios including seen and unseen speakers conversing in seen and unseen lingua, we establish that our proposed model is able to achieve substantial speaker similarity, and is able to generalize to out-of-domain (OOD) cases.</description>

      <title>Encoding of lexical tone in self-supervised models of spoken language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16865v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interpretability research has shown that self-supervised Spoken Language Models (SLMs) encode a wide variety of features in human speech from the acoustic, phonetic, phonological, syntactic and semantic levels, to speaker characteristics. The bulk of prior research on representations of phonology has focused on segmental features such as phonemes; the encoding of suprasegmental phonology (such as tone and stress patterns) in SLMs is not yet well understood. Tone is a suprasegmental feature that is present in more than half of the world's languages. This paper aims to analyze the tone encoding capabilities of SLMs, using Mandarin and Vietnamese as case studies. We show that SLMs encode lexical tone to a significant degree even when they are trained on data from non-tonal languages. We further find that SLMs behave similarly to native and non-native human participants in tone and consonant perception studies, but they do not follow the same developmental trajectory.</description>
