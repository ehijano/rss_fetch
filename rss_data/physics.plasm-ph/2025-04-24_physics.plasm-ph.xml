      <title>Turbulent heating in collisionless low-beta plasmas: imbalance, Landau damping, and electron-ion energy partition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An understanding of how turbulent energy is partitioned between ions and electrons in weakly collisional plasmas is crucial for modelling many astrophysical systems. Using theory and simulations of a four-dimensional reduced model of low-beta gyrokinetics (the `Kinetic Reduced Electron Heating Model'), we investigate the dependence of collisionless heating processes on plasma beta and imbalance (normalised cross-helicity). These parameters are important because they control the helicity barrier, the formation of which divides the parameter space into two distinct regimes with remarkably different properties. In the first, at lower beta and/or imbalance, the absence of a helicity barrier allows the cascade of injected power to proceed to small (perpendicular) scales, but its slow cascade rate makes it susceptible to significant electron Landau damping, in some cases leading to a marked steepening of the magnetic spectra on scales above the ion Larmor radius. In the second, at higher beta and/or imbalance, the helicity barrier halts the cascade, confining electron Landau damping to scales above the steep `transition-range' spectral break, resulting in dominant ion heating. We formulate quantitative models of these processes that compare well to simulations in each regime, and combine them with results of previous studies to construct a simple formula for the electron-ion heating ratio as a function of beta and imbalance. This model predicts a `winner takes all' picture of low-beta plasma heating, where a small change in the fluctuations' properties at large scales (the imbalance) can cause a sudden switch between electron and ion heating.</description>

      <title>Simulating X-point radiator turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coupling a high-performance burning plasma core to a detached boundary solution is critical for realizing magnetic confinement fusion power. Predictive simulations of the edge and scrape-off layer are therefore essential and must self-consistently account for turbulence and the interplay between the plasma, neutral gas, and impurities. We present results on controlled full detachment in ASDEX Upgrade with an X-point radiator (XPR), obtained with the edge turbulence code GRILLIX. Two simulations with dense nitrogen radiation fronts, located 5 and 12 cm above the X-point (accounting for 80% of the input heating power), are discussed. In validations against density, temperature, and bolometry measurements, the simulations show good agreement and reproduce the detached divertor conditions observed in the experiment. Neutral gas is critical for achieving detachment and modulating the height of the XPR front, in agreement with previous SOLPS-ITER transport modeling and analytical power balance studies. In addition, the front structure is highly dynamic due to turbulence, consisting of ionizing and radiative mantles surrounding intermittent cold spots of recombining plasma. Near the detachment front, density and temperature fluctuation amplitudes exceed the background by more than 400%, compared to 40% in an attached reference case. In detached conditions, we observe an inward shift of the radial electric field well at the OMP, along with the breaking of poloidal symmetry in the electrostatic potential. The latter induces strong radial flows around the XPR, which may explain the ELM suppression observed in the H-mode XPR regime.</description>

      <title>Modeling of Experimentally Observed Two-Dimensional Precursor Solitons in a Dusty Plasma by the forced Kadomtsev-Petviashvili Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compare model solutions of a forced Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (fKP) equation with experimental observations of dust acoustic precursor solitons excited by a supersonically moving charged cylindrical object in a dusty plasma medium. The fKP equation is derived from a three-fluid-Poisson model of the dusty plasma using the reductive perturbation technique and numerically solved for parameters close to the experimental investigations of cylindrical precursor solitons. The fKP model solutions show excellent agreement with the experimental results in reproducing the prominent geometric features of the two-dimensional solitons and closely matching the quantitative values of their velocities, amplitudes, and temporal evolutions. Our findings suggest that the fKP equation can serve as a very realistic model to investigate the dynamics of precursor solitons and can be usefully employed in practical applications such as space debris detection and tracking techniques that are based on observing/predicting nonlinear plasma excitations induced by the debris in the ionosphere.</description>

      <title>Magnetorotational instability in a solar mean-field dynamo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the question whether the magneto-rotational instability (MRI) can operate in the near-surface shear layer (NSSL) of the Sun and how it affects the interaction with the dynamo process. Using hydromagnetic mean-field simulations of $\alpha\Omega$-type dynamos in rotating shearing-periodic boxes, we show that for negative shear, the MRI can operate above a certain critical shear parameter. This parameter scales inversely with the equipartition magnetic field strength above which $\alpha$ quenching set in. Like the usual $\Omega$ effect, the MRI produces toroidal magnetic field, but in our Cartesian cases it is found to reduce the resulting magnetic field strength and thus to suppress the dynamo process. In view of the application to the solar NSSL, we conclude that the turbulent magnetic diffusivity may be too large for the MRI to be excited and that therefore only the standard $\Omega$ effect is expected to operate.</description>

      <title>Velocity modulations in view of the elliptical approach at Wendelstein 7-X</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19507v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The estimation of the poloidal velocity of the turbulence and the poloidal mean flow velocity are important quantities for the study of sheared flows on turbulence and transport. The estimation depends on the underlying model of the turbulence. Beside the propagation time of the turbulence, its decay with the fading time must be considered. For the description of the propagation, the elliptical approach is applied, which takes into account the propagation and fading time of the turbulence. The model has been applied successfully in experimental fluid dynamics and is confirmed by direct numerical simulations, also.
  In this paper, the elliptical approach is applied in the analysis of density fluctuations, measured by poloidal correlation reflectometry at two different fusion devices, TEXTOR and W7-X. For the latter, it is demonstrated that the elliptical approach is necessary for a correct description of the turbulence propagation. In addition, the velocity modulations are investigated, which in principle can be either generated by an oscillation of the propagation time of density fluctuations and/or an oscillation of the fading of the turbulence. An example for low frequency velocity oscillations in W7-X will be given in the paper, showing a relation between turbulence properties and small oscillations on the measured diamagnetic plasma energy.</description>
