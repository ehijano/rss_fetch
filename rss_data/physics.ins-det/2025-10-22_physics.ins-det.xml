      <title>A fiber integrated N-V diamond magnetometer compatible with commercial endoscopic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nitrogen-vacancy (N-V) center in diamond provides a robust, solid-state platform for magnetic field measurements at room temperature. To harness its potential in inspecting inaccessible regions, here we present a compact endoscopic configuration of an N-V diamond-based magnetometer. The endoscopic magnetometer was developed by integrating a large-core optical fiber with a bulk N-V diamond for laser excitation and photoluminescence (PL) collection. The diamond and fiber were specially shaped to enhance PL collection through the fiber. Additionally, a 3D-printed endoscope head was employed to facilitate alignment of the bias magnetic field along the N-V axis. A magnetic field sensitivity of approximately 3 nT/Hz$^{1/2}$ was achieved by using cw-magnetometry measurements. The endoscope diameter was restricted to 10 mm to match the dimensions of most commercial endoscopes. The magnetic field non-uniformity caused by the small separation between the diamond and the magnet in the endoscope head limited the overall sensitivity. It could be further improved to 0.85 nT/Hz$^{1/2}$ by using a magnet placed at a sufficient distance outside the endoscope head. Our endoscopic design is mechanically stable and provides additional opportunities for integrating other functionalities into the probe head as needed.</description>

      <title>The beam test facility at Jefferson Lab for the precise energy measurement of future calorimeter concepts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In experimental nuclear physics (NP), high-precision electromagnetic calorimetry typically requires a good energy resolution and linear photosensor response on the level of (1-2)% over a full dynamic range of the detector. The beam of secondary leptons at the Jefferson Lab experimental complex, provided by the Hall D pair spectrometer (PS), is an optimal facility for studies aiming to understand the impact of light collection and signal processing on calorimetry energy resolution under real experimental conditions. The light emission and collection processes depend on radiator component quality and type, while signal processing depends on photosensor type and front-end electronics design. Various calorimeter tower components and detector assemblies for current and future NP experiments were tested within the lepton momentum range of (3-6) GeV/c using PS. The energy resolution of the PS itself is estimated to be better than approximately 0.6%.</description>

      <title>A machine learning approach to automation and uncertainty evaluation for self-validating thermocouples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermocouples are in widespread use in industry, but they are particularly susceptible to calibration drift in harsh environments. Self-validating thermocouples aim to address this issue by using a miniature phase-change cell (fixed-point) in close proximity to the measurement junction (tip) of the thermocouple. The fixed point is a crucible containing an ingot of metal with a known melting temperature. When the process temperature being monitored passes through the melting temperature of the ingot, the thermocouple output exhibits a "plateau" during melting. Since the melting temperature of the ingot is known, the thermocouple can be recalibrated in situ. Identifying the melting plateau to determine the onset of melting is reasonably well established but requires manual intervention involving zooming in on the region around the actual melting temperature, a process which can depend on the shape of the melting plateau. For the first time, we present a novel machine learning approach to recognize and identify the characteristic shape of the melting plateau and once identified, to quantity the point at which melting begins, along with its associated uncertainty. This removes the need for human intervention in locating and characterizing the melting point. Results from test data provided by CCPI Europe show 100% accuracy of melting plateau detection. They also show a cross-validated R2 of 0.99 on predictions of calibration drift.</description>

      <title>Space charge and ion transport in aerosol neutralization: Toward a concentration-dependent alternative to the $N_it$ product</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we quantify how charged particle concentration affects the neutralization rate of aerosol particles, focusing on the role of ion dynamics shaped by internal electric fields arising from net space charge. Conventional neutralizer performance is typically evaluated using the $N_it$ product, which assumes quasi-neutral conditions and neglects electric fields from small charge imbalances. We demonstrate that internal electric fields become increasingly important at high aerosol concentrations and significantly influence neutralization dynamics. We develop a coupled ion--aerosol transport model in a two-dimensional axisymmetric geometry that includes ion generation, convection, diffusion, recombination, attachment to aerosols, and wall loss, with self-consistent electric fields obtained from the Poisson equation. Results show that even small net charges generate electric fields that enhance ion drift and accelerate neutralization, effects not captured by traditional $N_it$-based approaches. Using a neutralization time metric, we find that neutralization becomes slower with increasing aerosol number concentration $N_p$, higher initial particle charge $q_0$, and smaller particle diameter $d_p$ when space charge is absent. When space charge is included, the influence of $q_0$ and $d_p$ diminishes, while $N_p$ becomes the dominant factor governing neutralization behavior. Accordingly, we propose a concentration-dependent analytical expression for mean charge relaxation that captures coupled ion--aerosol transport and space charge effects. The modeling framework presented here is applicable to laboratory instruments, industrial processes, and atmospheric environments where electrostatic interactions govern aerosol behavior.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the scintillation resolution in liquid xenon and its impact for future segmented calorimeters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.07625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.07625v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on a new measurement of the energy resolution that can be attained in liquid xenon when recording only the scintillation light. Our setup is optimized to maximize light collection, and uses state-of-the-art, high-PDE, VUV-sensitive silicon photomultipliers. We find a value of 3.7 $\pm$ 0.4% $\sigma$ at 511 keV, once saturation effects are corrected for, a result close to the Poissonian resolution that we expect in our setup (2.8 $\pm$ 0.4% $\sigma$ at 511 keV). Our results in the intrinsic resolution (2.3 $\pm$ 0.8 % $\sigma$) are compatible, within errors, at 511 keV, with those found by theoretical estimations which have been standing for the last twenty years, 1.8% $\sigma$. Our work opens new possibilities for apparatus based on liquid xenon and using scintillation only. In particular it suggests that modular scintillation detectors using liquid xenon can be very competitive as building blocks in segmented calorimeters, with applications to Positron Emission Tomography technology.</description>

      <title>Proof-of-Principle Experiment on a Displacement-Noise-Free Neutron Interferometer for Gravitational Wave Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17146v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The displacement-noise-free interferometer (DFI) is designed to eliminate all displacement-induced noise while retaining sensitivity to gravitational wave (GW) signals. Ground-based DFIs suffer from physical arm-length limitations, resulting in poor sensitivity at frequencies below 1 kHz. To address this, previous research introduced a neutron-based DFI, which replaces laser light with neutrons and achieves exceptional sensitivity down to a few hertz. In this study, we conducted a proof-of-principle experiment using a pulsed neutron source at the Japan Proton Accelerator Research Complex (J- PARC). Despite practical constraints that led to deviations from the ideal experimental design, we optimized the setup and developed a novel analysis method that successfully cancels displacement noise while preserving simulated GW signals. This work presents the first successful demonstration of a neutron DFI and a neutron interferometer for GW detection.</description>

      <title>Readout electronics for low occupancy High-Pressure Gas TPCs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17425v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: HPgTPCs have benefits such as low energy threshold, magnetisability, and 4$\pi$ acceptance, making them ideal for neutrino experiments such as DUNE. We present the design of an FPGA-based solution optimised for ND-GAr, which is part of the Phase-II more capable near detector for DUNE. These electronics reduce the cost significantly compared to using collider readout electronics which are typically designed for much higher occupancy and therefore, for example, need much larger numbers of FPGAs and power per channel. We demonstrate the performance of our electronics with the TOAD at Fermilab in the US at a range of pressures and gas mixtures up to 4.5barA, reading out ~10000 channels from a multi-wire proportional chamber. The operation took place between April and July of 2024. We measure the noise characteristics of the system to be sufficiently low and we identify sources of noise that can be further mitigated in the next iteration. We also note that the cooling scheme used in the test requires improvement before full-scale deployment. Despite these necessary improvements, we show that the system can fulfil the needs of a HPgTPC for a fraction of the price of collider readout electronics.</description>

      <title>Controlling the recovery time of the superconducting nanowire single-photon detector with a voltage-controlled cryogenic tunable resistor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11832v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPD), owing to their unique performance, are currently the standard detector in most demanding single-photon experiments. One important metric for any single-photon detector is the deadtime (or recovery time), defined as the minimum temporal separation between consecutive detection events. In SNSPDs, the recovery time is more subtle, as the detection efficiency does not abruptly drop to zero when the temporal separation between detection events gets smaller, instead, it increases gradually as the SNSPD current recovers. SNSPD's recovery time is dominated by its kinetic inductance, the readout impedance, and the degree of saturation of internal efficiency. Decreasing the kinetic inductance or increasing the readout impedance can accelerate the recovery process. Significant reduction of the SNSPD recovery time, by, for example, adding a series resistor in the readout circuitry, is possible but can lead to detector latching which hinders further detector operation or enforces underbiasing and hence a reduction in detection efficiency. Previous research has demonstrated passive resistive networks for the reduction of recovery time that rely on trial and error to find the appropriate resistance values. Here we show, using a novel, cryogenically compatible, and tunable resistor technology, one can find the optimized impedance values, delivering fast SNSPD recovery time, while maintaining maximum internal detection efficiency. Here we show an increase of more than 2 folds in both maximum achievable detection rates and the achievable detection efficiency at high photon fluxes, demonstrating detection rates as high as 120 Mcps with no loss of internal detection efficiency.</description>

      <title>Unlocking New Frontiers: The Versatile Potential of the Brazilian Multipurpose Reactor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10657v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The multipurpose nature of nuclear research reactors has been investigated. This class of reactors has gained momentum within the international community, given the multiple benefits of nuclear technology in medicine, agriculture, industry, and the development of new materials, being characterized by the simultaneous use of several applications. In this context, Brazil has recently joined the group of countries with multipurpose reactor projects. The Brazilian Multipurpose Reactor (RMB) will be Brazil's new neutron source, with a thermal power of $30$ $MW$, with a core flux on the order of $\phi=4\times 10^{14}$ $n/cm^{2}s$ and a power density of $312.5$ $W/cm^3$, ensuring the production of radioisotopes, material and fuel irradiation testing, and neutron beam applications. In this work, the demand for neutron fluxes in different irradiation targets is investigated by Monte Carlo simulations under a perturbation caused by a highly neutron-absorbing material, the Gadolinium-157 (Gd-157) isotope. The results show that Molybdenum-99 (Mo-99) production is not affected by the Gd-157 target, and the minimum proposed thermal neutron flux for the reactor's activity ($\phi_{min}=5.1\times 10^{12}$ $n/cm^{2}s$) is guaranteed even at maximum operational capacity. The potential production of Terbium (Tb) isotopes for nuclear medicine applications in the RMB is briefly discussed.</description>
