      <title>Sharp Bohr-Rogosinski radii for Schwarz functions and Euler operators in C^n</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the investigation of multidimensional analogues of refined Bohr-type inequalities for bounded holomorphic mappings on the unit polydisc $\mathbb{D}^n$. We establish a sharp extension of the classical Bohr inequality, proving that the Bohr radius remains $R_n = 1/(3n)$ for the family of holomorphic functions bounded by unity in the multivariate setting. Further, we provide a definitive resolution to the Bohr-Rogosinski phenomenon in several complex variables by determining sharp radii for functional power series involving the class of Schwarz functions $\omega_{n,m}\in\mathcal{B}_{n,m}$ and the local modulus $|f(z)|$. By employing the radial (Euler) derivative operator $Df(z) = \sum_{k=1}^{n} z_k \frac{\partial f(z)}{\partial z_k}$, we obtain refined growth estimates for derivatives that generalize well-known univariate results to $\mathbb{C}^n$. Finally, a multidimensional version of the area-based Bohr inequality is established. The optimality of the obtained constants is rigorously verified, demonstrating that all established radii are sharp.</description>

      <title>Complex Analysis and Riemann Surfaces: A Graduate Path to Algebraic Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: These lecture notes present a computation driven pathway from classical complex analysis to the theory of compact Riemann surfaces and their connections to algebraic geometry. The exposition follows a compute first then abstract philosophy, in which analytic and geometric structures are introduced through explicit calculations and local models before being organized into conceptual frameworks.
  The notes begin with the foundations of complex analysis, including holomorphic functions, Cauchy theory, power series, residues, and contour integration, with an emphasis on hands on techniques such as Laurent expansions, residue calculus, and branch cut methods. These analytic tools are then used to construct Riemann surfaces explicitly via branched coverings and gluing constructions, which serve as recurring test cases throughout the text.
  Differential forms, Stokes theorem, curvature, and the Gauss Bonnet theorem provide the geometric bridge to Hodge theory, culminating in a detailed and self contained treatment of the Hodge Weyl theorem on compact Riemann surfaces, including weak formulations, regularity, and concrete examples. The algebraic geometric core develops holomorphic line bundles, divisors, the Picard group, and sheaves, followed by Cech and sheaf cohomology, the exponential sequence, and de Rham and Dolbeault theories, all treated with explicit computations.
  The Riemann Roch theorem is presented with full proofs and applications, leading to the construction of the Jacobian, Abel Jacobi theory, theta functions, and the correspondence between Riemann surfaces, algebraic curves, and Galois coverings. Originating from collaborative study groups associated with the Enjoying Math community, these notes are intended for graduate students seeking a concrete and unified route from complex analysis to algebraic geometry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In previous works, the second author defined directional Robin constants associated to a compact, nonpolar subset $K$ of an algebraic curve $A$ in $\mathbb{C}^N$ and related these to a natural class of Chebyshev constants for $K$. We define a second class of Chebyshev constants for $K$; relate these two classes; and utilize each of them to define two families of extremal-like functions which can be used to recover the Siciak-Zaharjuta extremal function for $K$.</description>

      <title>Rigidity of the escaping set of polynomial automorphisms of $\mathbb{C}^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $H$ be a polynomial automorphism of $\mathbb{C}^2$ of positive entropy and degree $d \ge 2$. We prove that the escaping set $U^+$ (or equivalently, the non-escaping set $K^+$), of $H$ is rigid under the action of holomorphic automorphisms of $\mathbb{C}^2$. Specifically, every holomorphic automorphism of $\mathbb{C}^2$ that preserves $U^+$ takes the form $L \circ H^s$ where $s \in \mathbb{Z}$ and $L$ belongs to a finite cyclic group of affine maps that preserve the escaping set.
  Second, note that the sub-level sets $\{G^+ &lt; c\}$, $c &gt; 0$, of the Greens function $G^+$ associated with the map $H$ are canonical examples of Short $\mathbb{C}^2$s. As a consequence of the above theorem, we show that the holomorphic automorphisms of these Short $\mathbb{C}^2$s are affine automorphisms of $\mathbb{C}^2$ preserving the escaping set $U^+$. Hence, the automorphism group of these Short $\mathbb{C}^2$s are the same for every $c&gt;0$ and is a finite cyclic group.</description>

      <title>Moment Summation Methods and Non-Homogeneous Carleman Classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the classical theorems of F. Nevanlinna and Beurling by characterizing the image of various spaces of smooth functions under the generalized Laplace transform. To achieve this, we introduce and analyze novel non-homogeneous Carleman classes, which generalize the traditional homogeneous definitions. This characterization allows us to derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the applicability of moment summation methods within a given class of functions. Furthermore, we establish an extension of \'{E}calle's concept of quasianalytic continuation and apply these results to the theory of multi-summability and Euler-type differential equations.</description>

      <title>Coupled continuity equations for constant scalar curvature K\"ahler metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by a parabolic system of Li-Yuan-Zhang and the continuity equation of La Nave-Tian, we study a system of elliptic equations for a K\"ahler metric $\omega$ and a closed $(1, 1)$-form $\alpha$. Assuming a uniform estimate for $\omega$, we prove higher order estimates and smooth convergence to a cscK metric coupled to a harmonic $(1, 1)$-form. A simplification of the system is used to recover existence results for K\"ahler-Einstein metrics when $c_1(X) &lt; 0$. On Riemann surfaces with genus at least $2$, we show smooth convergence to the unique K\"ahler-Einstein metric from a large class of initial data.</description>

      <title>Explicit complex time integrators for stiff problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most numerical methods for time integration use real-valued time steps. Complex time steps, however, can provide an additional degree of freedom, as we can select the magnitude of the time step in both the real and imaginary directions. We show that specific paths in the complex time plane lead to expanded stability regions, providing clear computational advantages for complex-valued systems. In particular, we highlight the Schr\"odinger equation, for which complex time integrators can be uniquely optimal. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these benefits extend to certain classes of real-valued stiff systems by coupling complex time steps with the Projective Integration method.</description>

      <title>Uniformizable foliated projective structures along singular foliations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04626v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider holomorphic foliations by curves on compact complex manifolds, for which we investigate the existence of projective structures along the leaves varying holomorphically (foliated projective structures), that satisfy particular uniformizability properties. Our results show that the singularities of the foliation impose severe restrictions for the existence of such structures. A foliated projective structure separates the singularities of a foliation into parabolic and non-parabolic ones. For a strongly uniformizable foliated projective structure on a compact K\"ahler manifold, the existence of a single non-degenerate, non-parabolic singularity implies that the foliation is completely integrable. We establish an index theorem that imposes strong cohomological restrictions on the foliations having only non-degenerate singularities that support foliated projective structures making all of them parabolic. As an application of our results, we prove that, on a projective space of any dimension, a foliation by curves of degree at least two, with only non-degenerate singularities, does not admit a strongly uniformizable foliated projective structure.</description>

      <title>Characterizations of harmonic quasiregular mappings in function spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01017v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study conjugate-type phenomena for complex-valued harmonic quasiregular mappings in the unit disk across three function space families: $Q(n,p,\alpha)$, $F(p,q,s)$, and the non-derivative $M(p,q,s)$. For a harmonic $K$-quasiregular mapping $f=u+iv$, we first show that if the real part $u$ belongs to $Q_h(1,p,\alpha)$ (with $\alpha&gt;-1$ and $\alpha+1&lt;p&lt;\alpha+2$), the imaginary part $v$ lies in the same space with a $K$-dependent quantitative bound. An analogous stability result is established for the harmonic $F$-scale, with sharp $K$-dependence. These results are extended to harmonic $(K, K')$-quasiregular mappings, yielding explicit estimates with an additional inhomogeneous term involving $K'$. Finally, for normalized harmonic quasiconformal mappings, %$f\in\mathcal S_H(K)$, we derive membership criteria in the harmonic $M$- and $F$-scales, and obtain corresponding conclusions for their natural derivatives, with parameter ranges governed by the order $\alpha_K$ of the family of harmonic quasiconformal mappings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12599v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend Tsuji's iterative construction of complete K\"ahler--Einstein metrics with negative scalar curvature to noncompact K\"ahler manifolds with bounded geometry, using Berndtsson's method from the compact setting. Consequently, given a holomorphic surjective map $p:X\to Y$, where $X$ is a weakly pseudoconvex K\"ahler manifold and $Y$ is a complex manifold, and where the smooth fibers admit K\"ahler--Einstein metrics with negative scalar curvature and bounded geometry, we show that the fiberwise K\"ahler--Einstein metrics induce a semipositively curved metric on the relative canonical bundle $K_{X/Y}$. Moreover, our approach also applies to the plurisubharmonic variation of cusp K\"ahler--Einstein metrics.</description>

      <title>Additive processes on the real line and Loewner chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18742v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates additive processes with respect to several different independences in non-commutative probability in terms of the convolution hemigroups of the distributions of the increments of the processes. In particular, we focus on the relation of monotone convolution hemigroups and chordal Loewner chains, a special kind of family of conformal mappings. Generalizing the celebrated Loewner differential equation, we introduce the concept of ``generator'' for a class of Loewner chains. The locally uniform convergence of Loewner chains is then equivalent to a suitable convergence of generators. Using generators, we define homeomorphisms between the aforementioned class of chordal Loewner chains, the set of monotone convolution hemigroups with finite second moment, and the set of classical convolution hemigroups on the real line with finite second moment. Moreover, we define similar homeomorphisms between classical, free, and boolean convolution hemigroups on the real line, but without any assumptions on the moments.</description>

      <title>From Complex-Analytic Models to Sparse Domination: A Dyadic Approach of Hypersingular Operators via Bourgain's Interpolation Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24972v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the work of Cheng--Fang--Wang--Yu on the hypersingular Bergman projection, we develop a real-variable and dyadic framework for hypersingular operators in regimes where strong-type estimates fail at the critical line. The main new input is a hypersingular sparse domination principle combined with Bourgain's interpolation method, which provides a flexible mechanism to establish critical-line (and endpoint) estimates.
  In the unit disc setting with $1&lt;t&lt;3/2$, we obtain a full characterization of the $(p,q)$ mapping theory for the dyadic hypersingular maximal operator $\mathcal M_t^{\mathcal D}$, in particular including estimates on the critical line $1/q-1/p=2t-2$ and a weighted endpoint criterion in the radial setting. We also prove endpoint estimates for the hypersingular Bergman projection \[ K_{2t}f(z)=\int_{\mathbb D}\frac{f(w)}{(1-z\overline w)^{2t}}\,dA(w), \] including a restricted weak-type bound at $(p,q)=\bigl(\tfrac{1}{3-2t},1\bigr)$. Finally, we introduce a class of hypersingular cousin of sparse operators in $\mathbb R^n$ associated with \emph{graded} sparse families, quantified by the sparseness $\eta$ and a new structural parameter (the \emph{degree}) $K_{\mathcal S}$, and we characterize the corresponding strong/weak/restricted weak-type regimes in terms of $(n,t,\eta,K_{\mathcal S})$.
  Our real-variable perspective addresses to an inquiry raised by Cheng--Fang--Wang--Yu on developing effective real-analytic tools in the hypersingular regime for $K_{2t}$, and it also provides a new route toward the critical-line analysis of Forelli--Rudin type operators and related hypersingular operators in both real and complex settings.</description>
