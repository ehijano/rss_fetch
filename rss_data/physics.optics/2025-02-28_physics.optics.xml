      <title>Nonlinear dynamics and self-healing properties of elliptical Airy beams in Kerr media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By numerically solving the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation, we theoretically study the nonlinear propagation dynamics and self-healing properties of elliptical Airy beams (EABs) propagating in water under Kerr nonlinearity. Compared to linear propagation, EABs exhibit extended propagation distances and enhanced stability in nonlinear media. Furthermore, particular emphasis is placed on the impact of Kerr nonlinearity strength on the propagation and self-healing properties of EABs. By varying the input power, it is found that EABs within a moderate power range can propagate longer distances while maintaining higher intensity and exhibit improved robustness after being blocked, indicating better self-healing performance. Based on this analysis, we propose an optimal input power for EABs through a quantitative analysis of the impact of Kerr nonlinearity, enabling them to achieve the greatest propagation distance and maintain the highest stability. Our work provides a comprehensive theoretical understanding of the nonlinear propagation dynamics and self-healing properties of EABs, with their superior characteristics potentially applicable to long-distance laser transmission.</description>

      <title>Observing the influence of second-harmonic tangential surface source in gold plasmonic nanostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of the second harmonic generation (SHG) from plasmonic structures remains a subject of debate. Here, we investigate SHG from gold plasmonic nanostructures by scanning nanostructures at the single-particle level to acquire two-dimensional (2D) SHG maps which are qualitatively and quantitatively compared with numerically simulated SHG maps. This approach allows us to discriminate the role played by the surface and bulk contributions to SHG. Our findings reveal that the tangential surface source contribution, often neglected in the literature, plays a dominant role and is affected by surface roughness. This is evident when comparing the SHG maps obtained from identically sized gold nanoparticles that are fabricated using physical and chemical techniques. Additionally, the normal surface source is not found to significantly impact SHG in these configurations.</description>

      <title>Influence of the laser pulse duration in high-order harmonic generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-order harmonic generation (HHG) in gases is inherently inefficient, prompting ongoing efforts to enhance the output of coherent table-top XUV sources. In this study, we investigate the influence of the laser pulse duration on HHG using a compact post-compression method featuring a bulk multi-pass cell. This setup enables tunable Fourier-limited pulse durations as short as 42 fs. We examine the HHG yield as a function of the laser intensity for pulse durations ranging from 42 fs to 180 fs while maintaining identical focusing conditions and generating medium. Our findings reveal that, for a given intensity, there exists an optimum pulse duration -- not necessarily the shortest -- that maximizes conversion efficiency. This optimum pulse duration increases as the intensity decreases. The experimental results are corroborated by numerical simulations, which show the dependence of HHG yield on the duration and peak intensity of the driving laser and underscore the importance of the interplay between light-matter interaction and phase-matching in the nonlinear medium. Our conclusion allows us to understand why HHG could be demonstrated in 1988 with pulses as long as 40 ps pulses and intensities of only a few $10^{13}$ W/cm${^2}$.</description>

      <title>Continuous Phase-Shifting Holography Utilizing a Moving Diffraction Grating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fabrication of optical coherence tomography (OCT) fiber probes in cardiology involves sequentially splicing and cleaving multiple fibers to form a lens. During this process, the splice location-normally invisible under standard illumination-must be identified with micron-level accuracy. This paper presents an approach for splice detection using digital lensless microscopy, which is well-suited for deployment within the restricted space constraints typically found in fiber-fabrication setups. The optical setup incorporates a movable Ronchi grating that simultaneously acts as a beam splitter and a phase modulator. This design enables spatial separation of the reference and object beams while preserving the inherent stability of common-path interferometry. The acquired hologram set is processed using the continuous phase-shifting technique, which is known for its robustness against phase-shifting errors. The theoretical foundations for recording such holograms have been developed, and the conditions under which background noise and the conjugate order are suppressed have been identified. Experiments demonstrated the acquisition of high-contrast quantitative phase images of fiber splices with a spatial resolution down to 1 $\mu m$.</description>

      <title>Robust Geometrical Dimensions in Uniform Directional Couplers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated photonics, a scalable platform for optical networks, sensors, and circuits, has experienced exponential growth. Over the past decade, these platforms have been increasingly harnessed for the emerging field of quantum integrated photonics. However, fabrication tolerances, such as waveguide width, wafer height variations, and sensitivity to temperature changes, significantly impact their robustness and performance. In this work, we identify and analyze stationary geometrical dimensions of directional couplers that enhance tolerance to such variations. Through theoretical predictions and experimental validation, we investigate the behavior of these robust dimensions under changes in refractive index, waveguide height, wavelength, and inter-waveguide distance. We experimentally demonstrate the efficiency of these stationary geometrical dimensions in a single-coupler design and subsequently utilize them to fabricate a quantum two-photon controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate. The CNOT gate achieves an improved mean fidelity, as compared to a CNOT gate fabricated at a different arbitrary design point. This discovery highlights the potential of stationary geometrical dimensions for robust, high-performance photonic circuits and paves the way for new, resilient configurations in quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Maximum chirality in planar metasurfaces induced by strong coupling of quasi-bound states in the continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving intrinsic optical chirality requires breaking all mirror symmetries of an object, and maximum chirality, which allows interaction with only one helicity of light, is particularly promising for applications such as chiral sensing, emission, and lasing. Traditionally, designing maximum chirality in dielectric metasurfaces has relied on precise engineering of vertical symmetry breaking, which presents significant fabrication challenges. Motivated by recent efforts towards enhanced chiral responses in planar structures, we demonstrate that maximum chirality can be achieved in a planar dielectric metasurface through controlled in-plane asymmetries. Specifically, the introduced perturbation induces strong coupling between two accidentally degenerate quasi-bound states in the continuum (QBICs) with orthogonal polarization states, which results in mode splitting into symmetric and antisymmetric modes, each exhibiting opposite circular dichroism (CD) responses. This behavior is quantitatively confirmed using quasinormal mode perturbation theory, by which we also identify a pair of exceptional points (EPs) at the transition between weak and strong coupling regimes. This work expands the existing approaches to maximum chirality in planar structures and aims to inspire future innovations in metasurface design.</description>

      <title>Optics of Plasmon-Exciton Nanostructures: Theoretical Models and Physical Phenomena in Metal/J-aggregate Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review the studies of a wide range of optical phenomena resulting from near-field coupling between excitons and localized surface plasmon-polaritons in hybrid nanostructures. Modern physical approaches and theoretical models reported here for the description of light absorption, scattering, and extinction spectra are appropriate for interpreting physical effects in nanosystems containing metals and various excitonic materials, such as molecular aggregates of organic dyes or inorganic quantum-confined semiconductor structures. Using the example of hybrid nanosystems composed of a metal core and an outer shell of dye J-aggregate, we perform a theoretical analysis of the optical spectra behavior in the regimes of weak, strong, and ultrastrong plasmon--exciton coupling. We consider resonance and antiresonance phenomena induced by the coupling of an exciton with dipole and multipole plasmons, including a pronounced dip in light absorption, as well as the spectral band replication effect of plexcitonic nanoparticles and their dimers. We discuss the significant roles of the size-dependent permittivity of the metal core, the effects of anisotropy and chirality of the excitonic J-aggregate shell, and the influence of an intermediate passive layer on the formation of the optical spectra of bilayer, trilayer, and multilayer nanoparticles. The review outlines the experimental and theoretical results for hybrid nanosystems of various geometrical shapes, sizes, and compositions, broadens our understanding of the physical phenomena caused by the plasmon--exciton coupling, and represents the current state of research in the optics of metalorganic nanostructures.</description>

      <title>Silicon photonic modulator circuit with programmable intensity and phase modulation response</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electro-optical modulators are essential components in optical communication systems. They encode an electrical waveform onto an optical carrier. However, their performance is often limited by inherent electro-optic processes and imperfections in existing integrated designs, which limit their adaptability to diverse applications. This paper presents a circuit-level programmable modulator design that addresses these challenges. The proposed modulator can generate both intensity and phase modulation, optimizing performance without altering the underlying design or constraining platform limitations. We explain and demonstrate the principle with both carrier depletion-based modulators and SiGe electro-absorption modulators on a silicon photonic platform. Experiments demonstrate precise control and optimization capabilities surpassing those of traditional modulator designs, marking a significant leap forward in adaptability and performance enhancement across intensity, phase, and modulation linearity, enabled by programmable photonics. In combination with on-chip monitors, our circuit can be self-calibrating. This programmable modulator circuit concept can be applied to modulators in different platforms, incorporating existing phase shifter designs, and act as a drop-in replacement in more complex circuits. It has the potential to be widely used in optical communication, LiDAR, microwave photonics, and other systems, meeting the increasing demands of various applications.</description>

      <title>Creating multi-beam interference from two-beam interference with assistant of harmonics generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linear optics-based multi-beam interference (MBI), like the Fabry-Perot interferometer, plays an important role in precision optical metrology applications such as laser stabilization in optical clocks, precision spectroscopy, and gravitational wave detection. Here, we propose and experimentally verify a nonlinear optics-based MBI principle with the assistance of cascading and recycling harmonics generation of two-beam interference. By cascading and recycling the harmonics processes, in combining with optical power amplification (OPA) to compensate for power losses arising from limited nonlinear conversion efficiency, a total 16th harmonic is achieved, and the observed interference fringes gradually evolve from a sinusoidal curve to a Lorentz-like curve. In principle, there is no limitation on the number of cascading and recycling nonlinear processes with the assistance of OPAs and sharp interference fringes, analogous to those in a high-finesse cavity, can be obtained. The nonlinear optics-based MBI mechanism revealed here will find promising applications in precision optical metrology.</description>

      <title>Optimizing confidence in negative-partial-transpose-based entanglement criteria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A key requirement of any separable quantum state is that its density matrix has a positive partial transpose. For continuous bipartite quantum states, violation of this condition may be tested via the hierarchy of negative-partial-transpose (NPT) based entanglement criteria introduced by Shchukin and Vogel [Phys. Rev. Lett. 95, 230502 (2005)]. However, a procedure for selecting the optimal NPT-based criterion is currently lacking. Here, we develop a framework to select the optimal criterion by determining the level of confidence of criteria within the Shchukin and Vogel hierarchy for finite measurement number, environmental noise, and the optimal allocation of measurement resources. To demonstrate the utility of our approach, we apply our statistical framework to prominent example Gaussian and non-Gaussian states, including the two-mode squeezed vacuum state, the quanta-subtracted two-mode squeezed vacuum state, and the two-mode Schr\"odinger-cat state. Beyond bipartite inseparability tests, our framework can be applied to any Hermitian matrix constructed of observable moments and thus can be utilized for a wide variety of other nonclassicality criteria and multi-mode entanglement tests.</description>

      <title>Investigation of Non-Radiative Relaxation Dynamics Under Pulsed Excitation Using Photon Absorption Remote Sensing: A Proof-of-Principle Study in Mechanical Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mechanical properties of micro-scale bio-entities are fundamental for understanding their functions and pathological states. However, current methods for assessing elastic properties at single-particle level such as Brillouin and atomic force microscopies exhibit intrinsic limitations, including being often slow, having poor resolution, or involving complicated and invasive setups. In this study, we explore Photon Absorption Remote Sensing (PARS) microscopy as a unique solution for mechanical sensing of single micro-objects. PARS uses probe beam scattering/reflectivity measurements to capture non-radiative relaxation process following the absorption of a pulse of light by a micro-object. In particular, we demonstrate that, when operating at GHz-range bandwidth, PARS can trace the sub-nanosecond dynamics of non-radiative relaxation in individual micro-objects, capturing both photoacoustic (PA) pressure propagation and thermal diffusion. This GHz-range measurement, in conjunction with a developed descriptive model, enables the experimental extraction of a minimally distorted PA temporal profile. The PA temporal profile contain information on the ratio between the absorbing object's sound speed and its characteristic diameter, offering a new dimension in PARS microscopy. This enables the assessment of the object's elastic properties, deduced from its speed of sound. Additionally, it offers the potential for sizing objects with known sound speeds. The proof of principle experiments was conducted using spherical polystyrene absorbers, ranging in size from 1 to 10 micrometers with known properties, embedded in a Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) matrix. This technique expands the scope of PARS imaging, opening new perspectives for clinical applications in mechanobiology by demonstrating its potential for mechanical imaging.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microplastics are an emerging threat for reef-building corals. However, the understanding of microplastic uptake into coral tissue and the long-term integration of microplastic into the coral skeleton remains limited due to the invasiveness of state-of-the-art methods for monitoring and localizing microplastic. Here, we exploit optical resonances to turn microplastics into microscopic laser particles. Their characteristic emission allows to track of microplastics in vivo and to perform simultaneous sensing of the microenvironment, shedding light on the internalization and transport pathways of single microplastic particles in corals.</description>

      <title>Visible Light Spectroscopy of Liquid Solutes from Femto- to Attoliter Volumes inside a Single Nanofluidic Channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: UV-Vis spectroscopy is a workhorse in analytical chemistry that finds application in life science, organic synthesis and energy technologies like photocatalysis. In its traditional implementation with cuvettes, it requires sample volumes in the milliliter range. Here, we show how Nanofluidic Scattering Spectroscopy, NSS, which measures visible light scattered from a single nanochannel in a spectrally resolved way, can reduce this sample volume to the attoliter range for solute concentrations in the mM regime, which corresponds to as few as 105 probed molecules. The connection of the nanochannel to a microfluidic in-and outlet system enables such measurements in continuous flow conditions, and the integrated online optical reference system ensures their long-term stability. On the examples of the non-absorbing solutes NaCl and H2O2, and the dyes Brilliant Blue, Allura Red and Fluorescein, we demonstrate that spectral fingerprints can be obtained with good accuracy and that solute concentrations inside the nanochannel can be determined based on NSS-spectra. Furthermore, by applying a reverse Kramers-Kronig transformation to NSS-spectra, we show that the molar extinction coefficient of the dye solutes can be extracted with excellent agreement with the literature values. These results thus advertise NSS as a versatile tool for the spectroscopic analysis of solutes in situations where nanoscopic sample volumes, as well as continuous flow measurements, are critical, e.g., in single particle catalysis or nanoscale flow cytometry.</description>

The evolution of their spatio-temporal dynamics is of particular interest. In the present work, the spatio-temporal evolution of ultrashort Laguerre Gauss (LG) vortex with power exponential spectrum, also called power exponential (PE) pulse is numerically explored, in dispersive and nonlinear media. The evolution of space-time non-separable ultrashort vortex pulse is specifically addressed. The study reveals the asymmetric spatio-temporal evolution and splitting in the spatio-temporal plane. Compression at the trailing edge of the pulse is observed with increase in the strength of the nonlinearity. The study further reveals that the temporal, spectral, and chirp evolution patterns of the pulse vary uniquely across different spatial regions and these variations depend upon the strength of nonlinearity and propagation distance. In weak nonlinear regime, a redshift in the spectrum is observed as one moves radially outward from the bright caustic of the ultrashort LG vortex, while a blueshifted spectrum emerges as one approaches the phase singularity. Interestingly, as the pulse furthers in the medium, nonlinearity induced spectral shift is witnessed and with stronger nonlinearity, a complex spectral evolution is observed.</description>

      <title>Nanometer-resolution 3D Tomographic and Vectorial Near-field Imaging in Dielectric Optical Resonators</title>

Abstract: All-dielectric optical nano-resonators, exhibiting exotic near-field distributions upon excitations, have emerged as low-loss, versatile and highly adaptable components in nanophotonic structures for manipulating electromagnetic waves and enhancing light-matter interactions. However, achieving experimental full three-dimensional characterization of near-fields within dielectric nano-resonators poses significant challenges. Here, we develop a novel technique using high-order sideband generation to image near-field wave patterns inside dielectric optical nano-resonators. By exploiting the phase-sensitivity of various harmonic orders that enables the detection of near-field distributions at distinct depths, we achieve three-dimensional tomographic and near-field imaging with nanometer resolution inside a micrometer-thick silicon anapole resonator. Furthermore, our method offers high-contrast polarization sensitivity and phase-resolving capability, providing comprehensive vectorial near-field information. Our approach can potentially be applied to diverse dielectric metamaterials, and becomes a valuable tool for comprehensive characterization of near-field wave phenomena within dielectric materials.</description>

      <title>Quadratic magneto-optical Kerr effect spectroscopy: Polarization variation method for investigation of magnetic and magneto-optical anisotropies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20205v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a method for a precise determination of magnetic anisotropy and anisotropy of quadratic magneto-optical response of thin films of ferromagnetic and ferrimagnetic materials. The method is based on measurements of a magneto-optical response for light close to the normal incidence on the sample with a fixed position. The measurement is performed for a set of orientations of an external magnetic field and a series of incident light linear polarizations beyond the standard s and p orientations. Based on the symmetry of the signal, we are able to separate the part of magneto-optical response that is even with respect to magnetization and, in turn, to exclude all non-magnetic contributions which come from imperfections of the experimental setup or from the sample itself. It is, therefore, possible to study the sample placed inside a cryostat: the polarization changes due to cryostat windows and possible strain-induced optical anisotropy of the sample are removed by the applied data processing. Thanks to this, we can perform measurements on low or elevated temperatures (from 15 to 800 K in our case), making it possible to study the behavior of magnetic materials in different magnetic phases and/or close to phase transitions. The applicability of this experimental technique was tested by measuring the low-temperature response of two samples of ferromagnetic semiconductor (Ga,Mn)As with a different Mn content at several wavelengths, which enabled us to deduce the magnetic and quadratic magneto-optical anisotropies in this material. In particular, we observed that the anisotropy of quadratic magneto-optical coefficients in (Ga,Mn)As is much weaker than that reported previously for other magnetic material systems.</description>

      <title>Edge-guided inverse design of digital metamaterial-based mode multiplexers for high-capacity multi-dimensional interconnect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07572v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The escalating demands of compute-intensive applications urgently necessitate the adoption of optical interconnect technologies to overcome bottlenecks in scaling computing systems. This requires fully exploiting the inherent parallelism of light across scalable dimensions for data loading. Here we experimentally demonstrate a synergy of wavelength- and mode- multiplexing combined with high-order modulation formats to achieve multi-tens-of-terabits-per-second optical interconnects using foundry-compatible silicon photonic circuits. Implementing an edge-guided analog-and-digital optimization method that integrates high efficiency with fabrication robustness, we achieve the inverse design of mode multiplexers based on digital metamaterial waveguides. Furthermore, we employ a packaged five-mode multiplexing chip, achieving a single-wavelength interconnect capacity of 1.62 Tbit s-1 and a record-setting multi-dimensional interconnect capacity of 38.2 Tbit s-1 across 5 modes and 88 wavelength channels, with high-order formats up to 8-ary pulse-amplitude-modulation (PAM). This study highlights the transformative potential of optical interconnect technologies to surmount the constraints of electronic links, thus setting the stage for next-generation datacenter and optical compute interconnects.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast quantum light uncertainty dynamics in real time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08881v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Advancements in quantum optics and squeezed light generation have transformed various domains of quantum science and technology. However, real-time quantum dynamics remain an underexplored frontier. Here, we extend quantum optics into the ultrafast regime, providing direct experimental evidence that quantum uncertainty is not a static constraint but evolves dynamically with the system state and interactions. Using ultrafast squeezed light generated via a four-wave mixing nonlinear process, we observe the temporal dynamics of amplitude uncertainty, demonstrating that quantum uncertainty is a controllable and tunable physical quantity. This offers new insights into fundamental quantum mechanics in real-time. Additionally, we demonstrate control over the quantum state of light by switching between amplitude and phase squeezing. Our ability to generate and manipulate ultrafast squeezed light waveforms with attosecond resolution unlocks exciting possibilities for quantum technologies, including petahertz scale secure quantum communication, quantum computing, and ultrafast spectroscopy. We also introduce an ultrafast quantum encryption protocol leveraging squeezed light for secure digital communication at unprecedented speeds. This work paves the way for exploring quantum uncertainty dynamics and establishes the foundation for the emerging field of ultrafast quantum science.</description>

      <title>Ultimate Sensitivity in X-ray Diffraction: Angular Moments vs. Shot Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17977v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The sensitivity of x-ray diffraction experiments towards Bragg peak parameters constitutes a crucial performance attribute of experimental setups. Frequently, diffraction peaks are characterized by model-free angular moment analysis, which offers a greater versatility compared to traditional model-based peak fitting. Here, we have determined the ultimate sensitivity of angular moments for diffraction data that is limited by photon shot noise. We report experimentally achieved sensitivities of the first moment below $1/1000$th of a detector pixel and below $1\mu$rad. We have demonstrated the validity of our theoretical predictions by an excellent agreement with experimental results from three different setups. The provided formulas for the uncertainties of angular moments allow for the rapid determination of experimentally achieved sensitivities from single diffraction frames.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01550v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The advanced multijunction solar cell (MJSC) has emerged as a frontrunner in photovoltaic literature due to its superior photoconversion efficiency (PCE) owing to its complex fabrication procedure and high costs. This article aims to systematically review the advancements of III-V MJSCs by focusing on computational modelling and experimental fabrication methodologies. In addition, it addresses the technical barriers that have hindered the progression of MJSC technology while also evaluating the current status and prospects of these cells. The findings indicate that III-V MJSCs hold significant promise for space applications. However, advancements in materials science, growth techniques, and structural optimization are crucial for reducing fabrication costs to make these cells more viable for terrestrial use. In this context, alternatives such as perovskite/Si or perovskite/chalcogenide tandem solar cells emerge as viable options. By synthesizing insights from a thorough analysis of recent literature, this review serves as a valuable resource for researchers, industry practitioners, and newcomers seeking to deepen their understanding of the research methodologies, growth techniques, and the associated challenges and opportunities within the realm of MJSCs.</description>

      <title>Electrically Tunable Interband Collective Excitations in Biased Bilayer and Trilayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03139v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Collective excitations of charged particles under the influence of an electromagnetic field give rise to a rich variety of hybrid light-matter quasiparticles with unique properties. In metals, intraband collective response manifested by negative permittivity leads to plasmon-polaritons with extreme field confinement, wavelength squeezing, and potentially low propagation losses. In contrast, photons in semiconductors commonly couple to interband collective response in the form of exciton polaritons, which give rise to completely different polaritonic properties, described by a superposition of the photon and exciton and an anti-crossing of the eigenstates. In this work, we identify the existence of plasmon-like collective excitations originating from the interband excitonic response of biased bilayer and trilayer graphene, in the form of graphene-exciton-polaritons (GEPs). We find that GEPs possess electrically tunable polaritonic properties and discover that such excitations follow a universal dispersion law for all surface polaritons in 2D excitonic systems. Accounting for nonlocal corrections to the excitonic response, we find that the GEPs exhibit confinement factors that can exceed those of graphene plasmons, and with moderate losses. These predictions of plasmon-like interband collective excitations in biased graphene systems open up new research avenues for tunable polaritonic phenomena based on excitonic systems, and the ability to control and manipulate such phenomena at the atomic scale.</description>

      <title>Methods for the study of light propagation in LArTPCs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19363v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Liquid Argon Time Projection Chambers (LArTPCs) are widely used in particle physics experiments. They use light and charge released in events to reconstruct and analyze them. Light information collected by the Photon Detection System (PDS) is used mainly to determine the initial time stamp, $t_0$, and to support determining the total energy of the event. For these purposes, it is important to simulate and predict the propagation of light inside the detector. There are several approaches to this, and this work discusses some of the options.</description>
