      <title>Global Optimality in Multi-Flyby Asteroid Trajectory Optimization: Theory and Application Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing optimal trajectories for multi-flyby asteroid missions is scientifically critical but technically challenging due to nonlinear dynamics, intermediate constraints, and numerous local optima. This paper establishes a method that approaches global optimality for multi-flyby trajectory optimization under a given sequence. The original optimal control problem with interior-point equality constraints is transformed into a multi-stage decision formulation. This reformulation enables direct application of dynamic programming in lower dimensions, and follows Bellman's principle of optimality. Moreover, the method provides a quantifiable bound on global optima errors introduced by discretization and approximation assumptions, thus ensuring a measure of confidence in the obtained solution. The method accommodates both impulsive and low-thrust maneuver schemes in rendezvous and flyby scenarios. Several computational techniques are introduced to enhance efficiency, including a specialized solution for bi-impulse cases and an adaptive step refinement strategy. The proposed method is validated through three problems: 1) an impulsive variant of the fourth Global Trajectory Optimization competition problem (GTOC4), 2) the GTOC11 problem, and 3) the original low-thrust GTOC4 problem. Each case demonstrates improvements in fuel consumption over the best-known trajectories. These results give evidence of the generality and effectiveness of the proposed method in global trajectory optimization.</description>

      <title>A Comparative Study of Optimal Control and Neural Networks in Asteroid Rendezvous Mission Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a comparative study of the applicability and accuracy of optimal control methods and neural network-based estimators in the context of porkchop plots for preliminary asteroid rendezvous mission design. The scenario considered involves a deep-space CubeSat equipped with a low-thrust engine, departing from Earth and rendezvousing with a near-Earth asteroid within a three-year launch window. A low-thrust trajectory optimization model is formulated, incorporating variable specific impulse, maximum thrust, and path constraints. The optimal control problem is efficiently solved using Sequential Convex Programming (SCP) combined with a solution continuation strategy. The neural network framework consists of two models: one predicts the minimum fuel consumption ($\Delta v$), while the other estimates the minimum flight time ($\Delta t$) which is used to assess transfer feasibility. Case results demonstrate that, in simplified scenarios without path constraints, the neural network approach achieves low relative errors across most of the design space and successfully captures the main structural features of the porkchop plots. In cases where the SCP-based continuation method fails due to the presence of multiple local optima, the neural network still provides smooth and globally consistent predictions, significantly improving the efficiency of early-stage asteroid candidate screening. However, the deformation of the feasible region caused by path constraints leads to noticeable discrepancies in certain boundary regions, thereby limiting the applicability of the network in detailed mission design phases. Overall, the integration of neural networks with porkchop plot analysis offers a effective decision-making tool for mission designers and planetary scientists, with significant potential for engineering applications.</description>

      <title>Quantum Hamiltonian Descent based Augmented Lagrangian Method for Constrained Nonconvex Nonlinear Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear programming (NLP) plays a critical role in domains such as power energy systems, chemical engineering, communication networks, and financial engineering. However, solving large-scale, nonconvex NLP problems remains a significant challenge due to the complexity of the solution landscape and the presence of nonlinear nonconvex constraints. In this paper, we develop a Quantum Hamiltonian Descent based Augmented Lagrange Method (QHD-ALM) framework to address largescale, constrained nonconvex NLP problems. The augmented Lagrange method (ALM) can convert a constrained NLP to an unconstrained NLP, which can be solved by using Quantum Hamiltonian Descent (QHD). To run the QHD on a classical machine, we propose to use the Simulated Bifurcation algorithm as the engine to simulate the dynamic process. We apply our algorithm to a Power-to-Hydrogen System, and the simulation results verify the effectiveness of our algorithm.</description>

      <title>On Relatively Smooth Optimization over Riemannian Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study optimization over Riemannian embedded submanifolds, where the objective function is relatively smooth in the ambient Euclidean space. Such problems have broad applications but are still largely unexplored. We introduce two Riemannian first-order methods, namely the retraction-based and projection-based Riemannian Bregman gradient methods, by incorporating the Bregman distance into the update steps. The retraction-based method can handle nonsmooth optimization; at each iteration, the update direction is generated by solving a convex optimization subproblem constrained to the tangent space. We show that when the reference function is of the quartic form $h(x) = \frac{1}{4}\|x\|^4 + \frac{1}{2}\|x\|^2$, the constraint subproblem admits a closed-form solution. The projection-based approach can be applied to smooth Riemannian optimization, which solves an unconstrained subproblem in the ambient Euclidean space. Both methods are shown to achieve an iteration complexity of $\mathcal{O}(1/\epsilon^2)$ for finding an $\epsilon$-approximate Riemannian stationary point. When the manifold is compact, we further develop stochastic variants and establish a sample complexity of $\mathcal{O}(1/\epsilon^4)$. Numerical experiments on the nonlinear eigenvalue problem and low-rank quadratic sensing problem demonstrate the advantages of the proposed methods.</description>

      <title>Complete Integral of Primer-Vector Equations for Transfers in a Central Gravitational Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper demonstrates the existence of a complete integral for the system of differential equations of Lawden's primer-vector, which is used in the optimization of space transfers in a central gravitational field. The derived complete integral has been shown to significantly reduce the order of the differential system for the primer-vector from sixth to second, thereby simplifying the optimization problem into a boundary value problem with four parameters. The presence of a complete integral enables the exclusion of the transversality conditions, which introduce significant complexity to the boundary value problem. The problem of transfer optimization is considerably simplified due to the existence of the full integral and generating solutions. The analysis reveals that, depending on the given constraints, there are six types of optimization problems, each corresponding to a specific boundary value problem.</description>

      <title>Electricity Price-Aware Scheduling of Data Center Cooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data centers are becoming a major consumer of electricity on the grid, with cooling accounting for about 40\% of that energy. As electricity prices vary throughout the day and year, there is a need for cooling strategies that adapt to these fluctuations to reduce data center cooling costs. In this paper, we present a model for electricity price-aware cooling scheduling using a Markov Decision Process(MDP) framework to reliably estimate the cooling system operational costs and facilitate investment-phase decision-making. We utilize Quantile Fourier Regression (QFR) fits to classify electricity prices into different regimes while capturing both daily and seasonal patterns. We simulate 14 years of operation using historical electricity price and outdoor temperature data, and compare our model against heuristic baselines. The results demonstrate that our approach consistently achieves lower cooling costs. This model is useful for grid operators interested in demand response programs and data center investors looking to make investment decisions.</description>

      <title>Robust stabilization of hyperbolic PDE-ODE systems via Neural Operator-approximated gain kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the mean square exponential stabilization problem for a class of coupled PDE-ODE systems with Markov jump parameters. The considered system consists of multiple coupled hyperbolic PDEs and a finite-dimensional ODE, where all system parameters evolve according to a homogeneous continuous-time Markov process. The control design is based on a backstepping approach. To address the computational complexity of solving kernel equations, a DeepONet framework is proposed to learn the mapping from system parameters to the backstepping kernels. By employing Lyapunov-based analysis, we further prove that the controller obtained from the neural operator ensures stability of the closed-loop stochastic system. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves more than two orders of magnitude speedup compared to traditional numerical solvers, while maintaining high accuracy and ensuring robust closed-loop stability under stochastic switching.</description>

      <title>Lazifying point insertion algorithms in spaces of measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Greedy point insertion algorithms have emerged as an attractive tool for the solution of minimization problems over the space of Radon measures. Conceptually, these methods can be split into two phases: first, the computation of a new candidate point via maximizing a continuous function over the spatial domain, and second, updating the weights and/or support points of all Dirac-Deltas forming the iterate. Under additional structural assumptions on the problem, full resolution of the subproblems in both steps guarantees an asymptotic linear rate of convergence for pure coefficient updates, or finite step convergence, if, in addition, the position of all Dirac-Deltas is optimized. In the present paper, we lazify point insertion algorithms and allow for the inexact solution of both subproblems based on computable error measures, while provably retaining improved theoretical convergence guarantees. As a specific example, we present a new method with a quadratic rate of convergence based on Newton steps for the weight-position pairs, which we globalize by point-insertion as well as clustering steps.</description>

      <title>Feedback Optimization of Dynamical Systems in Time-Varying Environments: An Internal Model Principle Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Feedback optimization has emerged as a promising approach for regulating dynamical systems to optimal steady states that are implicitly defined by underlying optimization problems. Despite their effectiveness, existing methods face two key limitations: (i) reliable performance is restricted to time-invariant or slowly varying settings, and (ii) convergence rates are limited by the need for the controller to operate orders of magnitude slower than the plant. These limitations can be traced back to the reliance of existing techniques on numerical optimization algorithms. In this paper, we propose a novel perspective on the design of feedback optimization algorithms, by framing these objectives as an output regulation problem. We place particular emphasis on time-varying optimization problems, and show that an algorithm can track time-varying optimizers if and only if it incorporates a model of the temporal variability inherent to the optimization - a requirement that we term the internal model principle of feedback optimization. Building on this insight, we introduce a new design methodology that couples output-feedback stabilization with a control component that drives the system toward the critical points of the optimization problem. This framework enables feedback optimization algorithms to overcome the classical limitations of slow tracking and poor adaptability to time variations.</description>

      <title>Neural Approximators for Low-Thrust Trajectory Transfer Cost and Reachability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In trajectory design, fuel consumption and trajectory reachability are two key performance indicators for low-thrust missions. This paper proposes general-purpose pretrained neural networks to predict these metrics. The contributions of this paper are as follows: Firstly, based on the confirmation of the Scaling Law applicable to low-thrust trajectory approximation, the largest dataset is constructed using the proposed homotopy ray method, which aligns with mission-design-oriented data requirements. Secondly, the data are transformed into a self-similar space, enabling the neural network to adapt to arbitrary semi-major axes, inclinations, and central bodies. This extends the applicability beyond existing studies and can generalize across diverse mission scenarios without retraining. Thirdly, to the best of our knowledge, this work presents the current most general and accurate low-thrust trajectory approximator, with implementations available in C++, Python, and MATLAB. The resulting neural network achieves a relative error of 0.78% in predicting velocity increments and 0.63% in minimum transfer time estimation. The models have also been validated on a third-party dataset, multi-flyby mission design problem, and mission analysis scenario, demonstrating their generalization capability, predictive accuracy, and computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Filtering and 1/3 Power Law for Optimal Time Discretisation in Numerical Integration of Stochastic Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the numerical integration of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) which govern diffusion processes driven by a standard Wiener process. With the latter being replaced by a sequence of increments at discrete moments of time, we revisit a filtering point of view on the approximate strong solution of the SDE as an estimate of the hidden system state whose conditional probability distribution is updated using a Bayesian approach and Brownian bridges over the intermediate time intervals. For a class of multivariable linear SDEs, where the numerical solution is organised as a Kalman filter, we investigate the fine-grid asymptotic behaviour of terminal and integral mean-square error functionals when the time discretisation is specified by a sufficiently smooth monotonic transformation of a uniform grid. This leads to constrained optimisation problems over the time discretisation profile, and their solutions reveal a 1/3 power law for the asymptotically optimal grid density functions. As a one-dimensional example, the results are illustrated for the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process.</description>

      <title>An integer programming approach for quick-commerce assortment planning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02553v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the challenge of assortment planning in the context of quick-commerce, a rapidly-growing business model that aims to deliver time-sensitive products. In order to achieve quick delivery to satisfy the immediate demands of online customers in close proximity, personalized online assortments need to be included in brick-and-mortar store offerings. With the presence of this physical linkage requirement and distinct multinomial logit choice models for online consumer segments, the firm seeks to maximize overall revenue by selecting an optimal assortment of products for local stores and by tailoring a personalized assortment for each online consumer segment. We employ an integer programming approach to solve this NP-hard problem to global optimality. In particular, we derive convex hull results to represent the consumer choice of each online segment under a general class of operational constraints, and to characterize the relation between assortment decisions and choice probabilities of products. Our convex hull results, coupled with a modified choice probability ordered separation algorithm, yield formulations that provide a significant computational advantage over existing methods. Finally, we illustrate how our convex hull results can be used to address other assortment optimization problems.</description>

      <title>The Pivoting Framework: Frank-Wolfe Algorithms with Active Set Size Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11760v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose the pivoting meta algorithm (PM) to enhance optimization algorithms that generate iterates as convex combinations of vertices of a feasible region $C\subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$, including Frank-Wolfe (FW) variants. PM guarantees that the active set (the set of vertices in the convex combination) of the modified algorithm remains as small as $\mathrm{dim}(C)+1$ as stipulated by Carath\'eodory's theorem. PM achieves this by reformulating the active set expansion task into an equivalent linear program, which can be efficiently solved using a single pivot step akin to the primal simplex algorithm; the convergence rate of the original algorithms are maintained. Furthermore, we establish the connection between PM and active set identification, in particular showing under mild assumptions that PM applied to the away-step Frank-Wolfe algorithm or the blended pairwise Frank-Wolfe algorithm bounds the active set size by the dimension of the optimal face plus $1$. We provide numerical experiments to illustrate practicality and efficacy on active set size reduction.</description>

      <title>Lyapunov Analysis For Monotonically Forward-Backward Accelerated Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13527v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nesterov's accelerated gradient method (NAG) achieves faster convergence than gradient descent for convex optimization but lacks monotonicity in function values. To address this, Beck and Teboulle [2009b] proposed a monotonic variant, M-NAG, and extended it to the proximal setting as M-FISTA for composite problems such as Lasso. However, establishing the linear convergence of M-NAG and M-FISTA under strong convexity remains an open problem. In this paper, we analyze M-NAG via the implicit-velocity phase representation and show that an additional assumption, either the position update or the phase-coupling relation, is necessary to fully recover the NAG iterates. The essence of M-NAG lies in controlling an auxiliary sequence to enforce non-increase. We further demonstrate that the M-NAG update alone is sufficient to construct a Lyapunov function guaranteeing linear convergence, without relying on full NAG iterates. By modifying the mixed sequence to incorporate forward-indexed gradients, we develop a new Lyapunov function that removes the kinetic energy term, enabling a direct extension to M-NAG. The required starting index depends only on the momentum parameter and not on problem constants. Finally, leveraging newly developed proximal inequalities, we extend our results to M-FISTA, establishing its linear convergence and deepening the theoretical understanding of monotonic accelerated methods.</description>

      <title>On stability of the Scholtes regularization for mathematical programs with complementarity constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07383v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For mathematical programs with complementarity constraints (MPCC), we study the stability properties of their Scholtes regularization. Our goal is to relate nondegenerate C-stationary points of MPCC with nondegenerate Karush-Kuhn-Tucker points of the Scholtes regularization up to their topological type. As it is standard in the framework of Morse theory, the topological types are captured by the C-index and the quadratic index, respectively. It turns out that a change of the topological type for the approximating Karush-Kuhn-Tucker points of the Scholtes regularization and their limiting C-stationary point is possible. In particular, a minimizer of MPCC with zero C-index might be approximated by saddle points of the Scholtes regularization with nonzero quadratic index. In order to bypass this index shift phenomenon, an additional generic condition for nondegenerate C-stationary points of MPCC is identified. It says that non-biactive multipliers under consideration should not vanish. Then, we uniquely trace nondegenerate Karush-Kuhn-Tucker points of the Scholtes regularization and successively maintain the topological type of their limiting C-stationary point. The main technical issue here is to relate the first-order information of the defining functions, which enters the biactive part of the C-index, with the second-order information, which enters the quadratic index of the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker points.</description>

Abstract: Frank-Wolfe (FW) algorithms have emerged as an essential class of methods for constrained optimization, especially on large-scale problems. In this paper, we summarize the algorithmic design choices and progress made in the last years of the development of FrankWolfe.jl, a Julia package gathering high-performance implementations of state-of-the-art FW variants. We review key use cases of the library in the recent literature, which match its original dual purpose: first, becoming the de-facto toolbox for practitioners applying FW methods to their problem, and second, offering a modular ecosystem to algorithm designers who experiment with their own variants and implementations of algorithmic blocks. Finally, we demonstrate the performance of several FW variants on important problem classes in several experiments, which we curated in a separate repository for continuous benchmarking.</description>

      <title>A Minimax Optimal Controller for Positive Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01180v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an explicit solution to the discrete-time Bellman equation for minimax optimal control of positive systems under unconstrained disturbances. The primary contribution of our result relies on deducing a bound for the disturbance penalty, which characterizes the existence of a finite solution to the problem class. Moreover, this constraint on the disturbance penalty reveals that, in scenarios where a solution is feasible, the problem converges to its equivalent minimization problem in the absence of disturbances.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05941v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of determining self-sustained oscillations in discrete-time linear time-invariant relay feedback systems. Concretely, we are interested in predicting when such a system admits unimodal oscillations, i.e., when the output has a single-peaked period. Under the assumption that the linear system is stable and has an impulse response that is strictly monotonically decreasing on its infinite support, we take a novel approach in using the framework of total positivity to address our main question. It is shown that unimodal self-oscillations can only exist if the number of positive and negative elements in a period coincides. Based on this result, we derive conditions for the existence of such oscillations, determine bounds on their periods, and address the question of uniqueness.</description>

      <title>Simulating Fokker-Planck equations via mean field control of score-based normalizing flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05723v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Fokker-Planck (FP) equation governs the evolution of densities for stochastic dynamics of physical systems, such as the Langevin dynamics and the Lorenz system. This work simulates FP equations through a mean field control (MFC) problem. We first formulate the FP equation as a continuity equation, where the velocity field consists of the drift function and the score function, i.e., the gradient of the logarithm of the density function. Next, we design a MFC problem that matches the velocity fields in a continuity equation with the ones in the FP equation. The score functions along deterministic trajectories are computed efficiently through the score-based normalizing flow, which only rely on the derivatives of the parameterized velocity fields. A convergence analysis is conducted for our algorithm on the FP equation of Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes. Numerical results, including Langevin dynamics, underdamped Langevin dynamics, and various chaotic systems, validate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness of an optical flow based optimal control formulation for image registration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10188v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider image registration as an optimal control problem using an optical flow formulation, i.e., we discuss an optimization problem that is governed by a linear hyperbolic transport equation. Requiring Lipschitz continuity of the vector fields that parametrize the transformation leads to an optimization problem in a non-reflexive Banach space. We introduce relaxations of the optimization problem involving smoothed maximum and minimum functions and appropriate Orlicz spaces. To derive well-posedness results for the relaxed optimization problem, we revisit and establish new existence and uniqueness results for the linear hyperbolic transport equations. We further discuss limit considerations with respect to the relaxation parameter and discretizations.</description>

      <title>Nonconvex Optimization Framework for Group-Sparse Feedback Linear-Quadratic Optimal Control: Penalty Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18114v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper develops a unified nonconvex optimization framework for the design of group-sparse feedback controllers in infinite-horizon linear-quadratic (LQ) problems. We address two prominent extensions of the classical LQ problem: the distributed LQ problem with fixed communication topology (DFT-LQ) and the sparse feedback LQ problem (SF-LQ), both of which are motivated by the need for scalable and structure-aware control in large-scale systems. Unlike existing approaches that rely on convex relaxations or are limited to block-diagonal structures, we directly formulate the controller synthesis as a finite-dimensional nonconvex optimization problem with group $\ell_0$-norm regularization, capturing general sparsity patterns. We establish a connection between DFT-LQ and SF-LQ problems, showing that both can be addressed within our unified framework. Furthermore, we propose a penalty-based proximal alternating linearized minimization (PALM) algorithm and provide a rigorous convergence analysis under mild assumptions, overcoming the lack of coercivity in the objective function. The proposed method admits efficient solvers for all subproblems and guarantees global convergence to critical points. Our results fill a key gap in the literature by enabling the direct design of group-sparse feedback gains with theoretical guarantees, without resorting to convex surrogates or restrictive structural assumptions.</description>

      <title>Nonconvex Optimization Framework for Group-Sparse Feedback Linear-Quadratic Optimal Control: Non-Penalty Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19895v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work is a companion paper of [8], where the distributed linear-quadratic problem with fixed communication topology (DFT-LQ) and the sparse feedback LQ problem (SF-LQ) are formulated into a nonsmooth and nonconvex optimization problem with affine constraints. Moreover, a penalty approach is considered in \cite{feng-part1}, and the PALM (proximal alternating linearized minimization) algorithm is studied with convergence and complexity analysis. In this paper, we aim to address the inherent drawbacks of the penalty approach, such as the challenge of tuning the penalty parameter and the risk of introducing spurious stationary points. Specifically, we first reformulate the SF-LQ problem and the DFT-LQ problem from an epi-composition function perspective, aiming to solve the constrained problem directly. Then, from a theoretical viewpoint, we revisit the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) and establish its convergence to the set of cluster points under certain assumptions. When these assumptions do not hold, we can effectively utilize alternative approaches combining subgradient descent with Difference-of-Convex relaxation methods. In summary, our results enable the direct design of group-sparse feedback gains with theoretical guarantees, without resorting to convex surrogates, restrictive structural assumptions, or penalty formulations that incorporate constraints into the cost function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22277v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents a parallel variant of the algorithm introduced in [Acceleration of block coordinate descent methods with identification strategies Comput. Optim. Appl. 72(3):609--640, 2019] to minimize the sum of a partially separable smooth convex function and a possibly non-smooth block-separable convex function under simple constraints. It achieves better efficiency by using a strategy to identify the nonzero coordinates that allows the computational effort to be focused on using a nonuniform probability distribution in the selection of the blocks. Parallelization is achieved by extending the theoretical results from Richt\'arik and Tak\'a\v{c} [Parallel coordinate descent methods for big data optimization, Math. Prog. Ser. A 156:433--484, 2016]. We present convergence results and comparative numerical experiments on regularized regression problems using both synthetic and real data.</description>

      <title>Topological feature selection for time series data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.17494v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use tools from applied topology for feature selection on time series data. We develop a method for scoring the variables in a multivariate time series that reflects their contributions to the topological features of the corresponding point cloud. Our approach produces a piecewise-linear Lipschitz gradient path in the standard geometric simplex that starts at the barycenter, which weights the variables equally, and ends at the score. Adding Gaussian perturbations to the input data and taking expectations results in a mean gradient path that satisfies a strong law of large numbers and central limit theorem. Our theory is motivated by the analysis of the neuronal activities of the nematode C. elegans, and our method selects an informative subset of the neurons that optimizes the coordinated dynamics.</description>

      <title>Balancing Optimality and Diversity: Human-Centered Decision Making through Generative Curation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11535v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Operational decisions in healthcare, logistics, and public policy increasingly involve algorithms that recommend candidate solutions, such as treatment plans, delivery routes, or policy options, while leaving the final choice to human decision-makers. For instance, school districts use algorithms to design bus routes, but administrators make the final call given community feedback. In these settings, decision quality depends not on a single algorithmic ``optimum'', but on whether the portfolio of recommendations contains at least one option the human ultimately deems desirable. We propose generative curation, a framework that optimally generates recommendation sets when desirability depends on both observable objectives and unobserved qualitative considerations. Instead of a fixed solution, generative curation learns a distribution over solutions designed to maximize the expected desirability of the best option within a manageable portfolio. Our analysis identifies a trade-off between quantitative quality and qualitative diversity, formalized through a novel diversity metric derived from the reformulated objective. We implement the framework using a generative neural network and a sequential optimization method, and show in synthetic and real-world studies that it consistently reduces expected regret compared to existing benchmarks. Our framework provides decision-makers with a principled way to design algorithms that complement, rather than replace, human judgment. By generating portfolios of diverse yet high-quality options, decision-support tools can better accommodate unmodeled factors such as stakeholder preferences, political feasibility, or community acceptance. More broadly, the framework enables organizations to operationalize human-centered decision-making at scale, ensuring that algorithmic recommendations remain useful even when objectives are incomplete or evolving.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16866v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In real-world scenarios, risk-averse learning is valuable for mitigating potential adverse outcomes. However, the delayed feedback makes it challenging to assess and manage risk effectively. In this paper, we investigate risk-averse learning using Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) as risk measure, while incorporating feedback with random but bounded delays. We develop two risk-averse learning algorithms that rely on one-point and two-point zeroth-order optimization approaches, respectively. The dynamic regrets of the algorithms are analyzed in terms of the cumulative delay and the number of total samplings. In the absence of delay, the regret bounds match the established bounds of zeroth-order stochastic gradient methods for risk-averse learning. Furthermore, the two-point risk-averse learning outperforms the one-point algorithm by achieving a smaller regret bound. We provide numerical experiments on a dynamic pricing problem to demonstrate the performance of the algorithms.</description>

      <title>A First-order Generative Bilevel Optimization Framework for Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08808v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models, which iteratively denoise data samples to synthesize high-quality outputs, have achieved empirical success across domains. However, optimizing these models for downstream tasks often involves nested bilevel structures, such as tuning hyperparameters for fine-tuning tasks or noise schedules in training dynamics, where traditional bilevel methods fail due to the infinite-dimensional probability space and prohibitive sampling costs. We formalize this challenge as a generative bilevel optimization problem and address two key scenarios: (1) fine-tuning pre-trained models via an inference-only lower-level solver paired with a sample-efficient gradient estimator for the upper level, and (2) training diffusion model from scratch with noise schedule optimization by reparameterizing the lower-level problem and designing a computationally tractable gradient estimator. Our first-order bilevel framework overcomes the incompatibility of conventional bilevel methods with diffusion processes, offering theoretical grounding and computational practicality. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing fine-tuning and hyperparameter search baselines.</description>

      <title>Model-Based Soft Maximization of Suitable Metrics of Long-Term Human Power</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00159v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Power is a key concept in AI safety: power-seeking as an instrumental goal, sudden or gradual disempowerment of humans, power balance in human-AI interaction and international AI governance. At the same time, power as the ability to pursue diverse goals is essential for wellbeing.
  This paper explores the idea of promoting both safety and wellbeing by forcing AI agents explicitly to empower humans and to manage the power balance between humans and AI agents in a desirable way. Using a principled, partially axiomatic approach, we design a parametrizable and decomposable objective function that represents an inequality- and risk-averse long-term aggregate of human power. It takes into account humans' bounded rationality and social norms, and, crucially, considers a wide variety of possible human goals.
  We derive algorithms for computing that metric by backward induction or approximating it via a form of multi-agent reinforcement learning from a given world model. We exemplify the consequences of (softly) maximizing this metric in a variety of paradigmatic situations and describe what instrumental sub-goals it will likely imply. Our cautious assessment is that softly maximizing suitable aggregate metrics of human power might constitute a beneficial objective for agentic AI systems that is safer than direct utility-based objectives.</description>
