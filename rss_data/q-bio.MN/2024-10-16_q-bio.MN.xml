      <title>Noise-robust chemical reaction networks training artificial neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial neural networks (NNs) can be implemented using chemical reaction networks (CRNs), where the concentrations of species act as inputs and outputs. In such biochemical computing, noise-robust computing is crucial due to the intrinsic and extrinsic noise present in chemical reactions. Previously suggested CRNs for feed-forward networks often utilized the rectified linear unit (ReLU) or discrete activation functions. However, one concern in this case is the discontinuities of the derivatives of those non-smooth functions, which can cause significant noise disruption during backpropagation. In this study, we propose a CRN that performs both feed-forward and training processes using smooth activation functions to avoid discontinuities in the backpropagation. All reactions occur in a single pot, and the reactions for training are bimolecular. Our case studies on XOR, Iris, MNIST datasets, and a non-linear regression model demonstrate that computation via the CRN (i) maintains accuracy despite noise in the reaction rates and the concentration of species and (ii) is insensitive to the choice of the running time and the magnitude of the noise in comparison to NNs with a non-smooth activation function. This work presents a noise-robust CRN for full NN computation, including backpropagation, paving the way for more stable and efficient biochemical computing systems.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic versus extrinsic cellular decision making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A cell routinely responds to one of many competing environmental cues. Does the cell have an intrinsic preference for that cue, or does that cue have the highest extrinsic information content? We introduce a theoretical framework to answer this fundamental question. We derive extrinsic detection limits for four types of directional cues -- external and self-generated chemical gradients, fluid flow, and contact inhibition of locomotion -- and thus predict extrinsic decision boundaries when these cues compete as pairs. Comparing the boundaries to published data from cell migration experiments quantitatively determines the degree to which cell decisions are intrinsic vs. extrinsic, revealing the extent of cells' autonomy and providing interpretation of their response networks.</description>
