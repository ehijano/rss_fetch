      <title>Symmetry-enforced Fermi surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We identify a symmetry that enforces every symmetric model to have a Fermi surface. These symmetry-enforced Fermi surfaces are realizations of a powerful form of symmetry-enforced gaplessness. The symmetry we construct exists in quantum lattice fermion models on a $d$-dimensional Bravais lattice, and is generated by the onsite U(1) fermion number symmetry and non-onsite Majorana translation symmetry. The resulting symmetry group is a non-compact Lie group closely related to the Onsager algebra. For a symmetry-enforced Fermi surface $\cal{F}$, we show that this UV symmetry group always includes the subgroup of the ersatz Fermi liquid L$_{\cal{F}}$U(1) symmetry group formed by even functions ${f(\mathbf{k})\in\mathrm{U}(1)}$ with ${\mathbf{k}\in \cal{F}}$. Furthermore, we comment on the topology of these symmetry-enforced Fermi surfaces, proving they generically exhibit at least two non-contractible components (i.e., open orbits).</description>

      <title>Nucleon to Roper transition amplitudes and electromagnetic form factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The second excitation of the nucleon, the Roper, has properties differentiated from other low-lying nucleon resonances. Their properties challenge our understanding of the structure of the baryons in terms of the degrees of freedom from QCD. In the present work we discuss the properties of the Roper resonance and the nucleon to Roper electromagnetic transition, based on the quark degrees of freedom, that are expected to dominate for large square momentum transfer $Q^2$. We also discuss the analytic structure of the transition amplitudes in the low-$Q^2$ region, and how the contributions of baryon-meson states can help to describe the low and intermediate $Q^2$ data, and the nature of the Roper.</description>

      <title>Pion physics with dressed quark-gluon vertices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, a theoretical framework was set up in [1], which allows for the symmetry-preserving inclusion of full quark-gluon vertices in the description of the meson dynamics. In the present work, we develop a special truncation within this approach, which leads to a tractable set of functional equations that satisfy the fundamental chiral Ward-Takahashi identities. Specifically, the truncation allows us to simplify considerably the quark-gluon Schwinger-Dyson equation, without significant loss of quantitative accuracy. Importantly, this implies a substantial reduction of complexity of the renormalized Bethe-Salpeter equation: it is composed by a pair of one-loop diagrams that contain the full quark-gluon vertex, and a single two-loop diagram that is instrumental for the masslessness of the pion in the chiral limit. A detailed numerical analysis reveals that the incorporation of the aforementioned two-loop diagram is instrumental for the corresponding eigenvalue to reach unity. The key relation between the quark mass function and the pion wave function is shown to be satisfied to within the numerical precision of the loop integrals, which is at the level of about one percent or better. The field-theoretic ingredients required for the extension of this analysis beyond the chiral limit are briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Precise study of triply charmed baryons $\Omega_{ccc}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12729v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the most precise results for the ground state mass of the triply-charmed spin-$3/2$ baryon using lattice quantum chromodynamics. The calculations are performed on six $N_f=2+1+1$ Highly Improved Staggered Quark (HISQ) lattice ensembles generated by the MILC collaboration. Two different lattice setups are employed: in the first one, a fully dynamical calculation with HISQ action is performed, while in the second calculation, an overlap action is utilized for the valence charm quark dynamics. Following the continuum extrapolation of our results, obtained at five different lattice spacings, two different volumes, and two different actions, our prediction for the mass of the lowest triply charmed spin-3/2 baryon, $\Omega_{ccc} (3/2^{+})$, is $4793 (5) \left(^{+11}_{-8}\right)$ MeV. This is the most precise determination to date, fully addressing the systematic uncertainties. We also predict the $\Omega_{ccc} (3/2^{-})$ mass to be $5094 (12) \left(^{+19}_{-17}\right)$ MeV.</description>

      <title>The color force acting on a quark in the pion and nucleon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09019v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the Operator Product Expansion (OPE) of hard scattering amplitudes, the twist-3 operators describe local colored Lorentz forces acting on a quark, thereby providing a measure of the strength of the gluon fields. Its value is directly accessible from the nucleon twist-3 polarized $g_2$-parton distribution function. In the semiclassical (instanton-based) QCD vacuum models, the leading non-perturbative contribution stems from correlated instanton-anti-instanton pairs, or molecules. We analyze the magnitude of the color force on a 'struck' quark in light hadrons (pion and nucleon), in the context of the instanton liquid model (ILM). We derive explicitly the pertinent form factors associated to the color Lorenz force, and show that they are intimately related to the pertinent hadronic gravitational and transversity form factors. Using the ILM enhanced by molecules, we detail the ensuing colored force distribution in the transverse plane for luminal pions and nucleons. The results for the nucleons are in good agreement with those reported recently from a lattice collaboration.</description>
