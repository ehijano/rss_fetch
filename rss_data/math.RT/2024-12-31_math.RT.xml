      <title>Harish-Chandra's admissibility theorem and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article is a record of the lecture at the centennial conference for Harish-Chandra. The admissibility theorem of Harish-Chandra concerns the restrictions of irreducible representations to maximal compact subgroups. In this article, we begin with a brief explanation of two directions for generalizing his pioneering work to {\it{non-compact}} reductive subgroups: one emphasizes discrete decomposability with the finite multiplicity property, while the other focuses on finite/uniformly bounded multiplicity properties. We discuss how the recent representation-theoretic developments in these directions collectively offer a powerful method for the new spectral analysis of standard locally symmetric spaces, extending beyond the classical Riemannian setting.</description>

      <title>Relative Langlands duality for $\mathfrak{osp}(2n + 1|2n)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish an $S$-duality converse to the one studied by the 1st, 2nd and 4th authors; this is also a case of a twisted version of the relative Langlands duality of Ben Zvi, Sakellaridis and Venkatesh.. Namely, we prove that the $S$-dual of $\text{SO}(2n+1)\times \text{Sp}(2n)$ acting on the tensor product of their tautological representations is the symplectic mirabolic space $\text{Sp}(2n)\times\text{Sp}(2n)$ acting on the product $T^* \text{Sp}(2n)$ and the tautological representations of $\text{Sp}(2n)$. (Note that due to the anomaly, the dual of the second factor $\text{Sp}(2n)$ is the metaplectic dual, i.e. $\text{Sp}(2n)$). We also formulate the corresponding global conjecture, which describes explicitly the categorical theta-correspondence on the Langlands dual side.</description>

      <title>Drinfeld centralizers and Rouquier complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Drinfeld centralizer of a monoidal category $\mathcal{A}$ in a bimodule category $\mathcal{M}$ is the category $\mathcal{Z}(\mathcal{A},\mathcal{M})$ of objects in $\mathcal{M}$ for which the left and right actions by objects of $\mathcal{A}$ coincide, naturally. In this paper we study the interplay between Drinfeld centralizers of $\mathcal{A}$ and its homotopy category $\mathcal{K}^b(\mathcal{A})$, culminating with our ``lifting lemma,'' which provides a sufficient condition for an object of $\mathcal{Z}(\mathcal{A}, \mathcal{K}^b(\mathcal{M}))$ to lift to an object of $\mathcal{Z}(\mathcal{K}^b(\mathcal{A}), \mathcal{K}^b(\mathcal{M}))$.
  The central application of this lifting lemma is a proof of some folklore facts about conjugation by Rouquier complexes in the Hecke category: the centrality of the full twist, and related properties of half twists and Coxeter braids.
  We also prove stronger, homotopy coherent versions of these statements, stated using the notion of the $A_{\infty}$-Drinfeld centralizer, which we believe is new.</description>

      <title>Hilbert series of quasi-invariant polynomials in characteristics $p\leq n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the Hilbert series of the space of $n=3$ variable quasi-invariant polynomials in characteristic $2$ and $3,$ capturing the dimension of the homogeneous components of the space, and explicitly describe the generators in the characteristic $2$ case. In doing so we extend the work of the first author in 2023 on quasi-invariant polynomials in characteristic $p&gt;n$ and prove that a sufficient condition found by Ren-Xu in 2020 on when the Hilbert series differs between characteristic $0$ and $p$ is also necessary for $n=3,p=2,3$. This is the first description of quasi-invariant polynomials in the case where the space forms a modular representation over the symmetric group, bringing us closer to describing the quasi-invariant polynomials in all characteristics and numbers of variables.</description>

      <title>Biquadratic spaces of length two</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A tensor space is a vector space equipped with a finite collection of multilinear forms. The length of a tensor space is its length as a representation of its symmetry group. Infinite dimension tensor spaces of finite length are special, highly symmetrical objects. We classify the (universal) biquadratic spaces of length two; there are seven families of them. As a corollary, we establish some cases of the linear analog of the Ryll-Nardzewski theorem. We view this work as a first attempt to classify highly symmetrical tensor spaces.</description>

      <title>On Minimal Polynomials of Elements in Symmetric and Alternating Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $ (\rho, V) $ be an irreducible representation of the symmetric group $ S_n$ (or the alternating group $ A_n$), and let $ g $ be a permutation on $n$ letters with each of its cycle lengths divides the length of its largest cycle. We describe completely the minimal polynomial of $\rho(g)$, showing that, in most cases, it equals $x^{o(g)} - 1 $, with a few explicit exceptions. As a by-product, we obtain a new proof (using only combinatorics and representation theory) of a theorem of Swanson that gives a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a standard Young tableau of a given shape and major index $r \ \text{mod} \ n$, for all $r$. Thereby, we give a new proof of a celebrated result of Klyachko on Lie elements in a tensor algebra, and of a conjecture of Sundaram on the existence of an invariant vector for $n$-cycles. We also show that for elements $g$ in $S_n$ or $A_n$ of even order, in most cases, $\rho(g)$ has eigenvalue $-1$, with a few explicit exceptions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $q$ be an odd prime power, and $G=\text{Sp}(2n,q)$ the finite symplectic group. We give an expression for the total Stiefel-Whitney Classes (SWCs) for orthogonal representations $\pi$ of $G$, in terms of character values of $\pi$ at elements of order $2$. We give "universal formulas'' for the fourth and eighth SWCs. For $n=2$, we compute the subring of the mod $2$ cohomology generated by the SWCs $w_k(\pi)$.</description>

      <title>Wreath products and the non-coprime $k(GV)$ problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G = X \wr H$ be the wreath product of a nontrivial finite group $X$ with $k$ conjugacy classes and a transitive permutation group $H$ of degree $n$ acting on the set of $n$ direct factors of $X^n$. If $H$ is semiprimitive, then $k(G) \leq k^n$ for every sufficiently large $n$ or $k$. This result solves a case of the non-coprime $k(GV)$ problem and provides an affirmative answer to a question of Garzoni and Gill for semiprimitive permutation groups. The proof does not require the classification of finite simple groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Circuit algebras, used in the study of finite-type knot invariants, are a symmetric analogue of Jones's planar algebras. This work, the first of a pair of papers comprising a detailed study of circuit algebra combinatorics, provides three equivalent descriptions of circuit algebras: in terms of operads of wiring diagrams, modular operads and categories of Brauer diagrams. As an application, circuit algebra characterisations of algebras over the orthogonal and symplectic groups are given.</description>

      <title>Braiding on type A Soergel bimodules: semistrictness and naturality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider categories of Soergel bimodules for the symmetric groups S_n in their gl(n)-realizations for all n and assemble them into a locally linear monoidal bicategory. Chain complexes of Soergel bimodules likewise form a locally dg-monoidal bicategory which can be equipped with the structure of a braiding, whose data includes the Rouquier complexes of shuffle braids. The braiding, together with a uniqueness result, was established in an infinity-categorical setting in recent work with Yu Leon Liu, Aaron Mazel-Gee and David Reutter.
  In the present article, we construct this braiding explicitly and describe its requisite coherent naturality structure in a concrete dg-model for the morphism categories. To this end, we first assemble the Elias-Khovanov-Williamson diagrammatic Hecke categories as well as categories of chain complexes thereover into locally linear semistrict monoidal 2-categories. Along the way, we prove strictness results for certain standard categorical constructions, which may be of independent interest. In a second step, we provide explicit (higher) homotopies for the naturality of the braiding with respect to generating morphisms of the Elias-Khovanov-Williamson diagrammatic calculus. Rather surprisingly, we observe hereby that higher homotopies appear already for height move relations of generating morphisms. Finally, we extend the homotopy-coherent naturality data for the braiding to all chain complexes using cohomology-vanishing arguments.</description>

      <title>Deformations of ideals in Lie algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper develops the deformation theory of Lie ideals. It shows that the smooth deformations of an ideal $\mathfrak i$ in a Lie algebra $\mathfrak g$ differentiate to cohomology classes in the cohomology of $\mathfrak g$ with values in its adjoint representation on $\operatorname{Hom}(\mathfrak i, \mathfrak g/\mathfrak i)$. The cohomology associated with the ideal $\mathfrak i$ in $\mathfrak g$ is compared with other Lie algebra cohomologies defined by $\mathfrak i$, such as the cohomology defined by $\mathfrak i$ as a Lie subalgebra of $\mathfrak g$ (Richardson, 1969), and the cohomology defined by the Lie algebra morphism $\mathfrak g \to \mathfrak g/\mathfrak i$.
  After a choice of complement of the ideal $\mathfrak i$ in the Lie algebra $\mathfrak g$, its deformation complex is enriched to the differential graded Lie algebra that controls its deformations, in the sense that its Maurer-Cartan elements are in one-to-one correspondence with the (small) deformations of the ideal. Furthermore, the $L_{\infty}$-algebra that simultaneously controls the deformations of $\mathfrak{i}$ and of the ambient Lie bracket is identified.
  Under appropriate assumptions on the low degrees of the deformation cohomology of a given Lie ideal, the (topological) rigidity and stability of ideals are studied, as well as obstructions to deformations of ideals of Lie algebras.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lusztig $q$-weight multiplicities extend the Kostka-Foulkes polynomials to a broader range of Lie types. In this work, we investigate these multiplicities through the framework of Kirillov-Reshetikhin crystals. Specifically, for type $C$ with dominant weights and type $B$ with dominant spin weights, we present a combinatorial formula for Lusztig $q$-weight multiplicities in terms of energy functions of Kirillov-Reshetikhin crystals, generalizing the charge statistic on semistandard Young tableaux for type $A$. Additionally, we introduce level-restricted $q$-weight multiplicities for nonexceptional types, and prove positivity by providing their combinatorial formulas.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the coherent cohomology of the structure sheaf of complex periplectic Grassmannians. In particular, we show that it can be decomposed as a tensor product of the singular cohomology ring of a Grassmannian for either the symplectic or orthogonal group together with a semisimple representation of the periplectic Lie supergroup. The restriction of the latter to its even subgroup has an explicit multiplicity-free description in terms of Schur functors and is closely related to syzygies of (skew-)symmetric determinantal ideals. We develop tools for studying splitting rings for Coxeter groups of types BC and D, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a simple algebraic group and $\mathcal O$ a nilpotent orbit in $\mathfrak g$. Let ${\mathbf{CS}}(\mathcal O)$ denote the affine cone over the secant variety of $\overline{\mathbb P\mathcal O}\subset \mathbb P\mathfrak g$. Using the theory of doubled actions of $G$, we describe ${\mathbf{CS}}(\mathcal O)$ for all $\mathcal O$. We compute $\dim{\mathbf{CS}}(\mathcal O)$ using the complexity and rank of the $G$-variety $\mathcal O$ and show that there is an abelian subalgebra $\mathfrak t_{\mathcal O}\subset\mathfrak g$ such that ${\mathbf{CS}}(\mathcal O)$ is the closure of $G{\cdot}\mathfrak t_\mathcal O$. Another observation is that ${\mathbf{CS}}(\mathcal O)$ coincide with the closure of the image of the moment map associated with the cotangent bundle of $\mathcal O$. We also compute the complexity and rank for all nilpotent orbits.</description>

      <title>Positivity in Weighted Flag Varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the torus-equivariant cohomology of weighted flag varieties, and prove a positivity property in the equivariant cohomology and Chow groups of weighted flag varieties, analogous to the non-weighted positivity proved in [Graham 2001]. Our result strengthens and generalizes the positivity proved for weighted Grassmannians by [Abe-Matsumura 2015]. The positivity property is expressed in terms of weighted roots, which are used to describe weights of torus equivariant curves in weighted flag varieties. This provides a geometric interpretation of the parameters used in [Abe-Matsumura 2015]. We approach weighted flag varieties from a uniform Lie-theoretic point of view, providing a more general definition than has appeared previously, and prove other general results about weighted flag varieties in this setting, including a Borel presentation of the equivariant cohomology. In addition, we generalize some results obtained for weighted Grassmannians or more generally type $A$ ([Abe-Matsumura 2015], [Azam-Nazir-Qureshi 2020]); in particular, we obtain a weighted Chevalley formula, descriptions of restrictions to fixed points, the GKM description of the cohomology, and a weighted Chevalley formula.</description>

      <title>Tensor structure on the module category of the triplet superalgebra $\mathcal{{SW}}(m)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the tensor structure on the category of modules of the $N=1$ triplet vertex operator superalgebra $\mathcal{SW}(m)$ introduced by Adamovi\'{c} and Milas. Based on the theory of vertex tensor supercategories, we determine the structure of fusion products between the simple and projective $\mathcal{SW}(m)$-modules and show that the tensor supercategory on $\mathcal{SW}(m)$-mod is rigid. Technically, explicit solutions of a fourth-order Fuchsian differential equation are important to show the rigidity of $\mathcal{SW}(m)$-modules. We construct solutions of this Fuchsian differential equation using the theory of the Dotsenko-Fateev integrals developed by Sussman.</description>

      <title>Oscillator Calculus on Coadjoint Orbits and Index Theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider quantum mechanical systems of spin chain type, with finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces and $\mathcal{N}=2$ or $\mathcal{N}=4$ supersymmetry, described in $\mathcal{N}=2$ superspace in terms of nonlinear chiral multiplets. We prove that they are natural truncations of 1D sigma models, whose target spaces are $\mathsf{SU}(n)$ (co)adjoint orbits. As a first application, we compute the Witten indices of these finite-dimensional models showing that they reproduce the Dolbeault and de Rham indices of the target space. The problem of finding the exact spectra of generalized Laplace operators on such orbits is shown to be equivalent to the diagonalization of spin chain Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>Random Fibonacci Words via Clone Schur Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate positivity and probabilistic properties arising from the Young-Fibonacci lattice $\mathbb{YF}$, a 1-differential poset on binary words composed of 1's and 2's (known as Fibonacci words). Building on Okada's theory of clone Schur functions (Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 346 (1994), 549-568), we introduce clone coherent measures on $\mathbb{YF}$ which give rise to random Fibonacci words of increasing length. Unlike coherent systems associated to classical Schur functions on the Young lattice of integer partitions, clone coherent measures are generally not extremal on $\mathbb{YF}$.
  Our first main result is a complete characterization of Fibonacci positive specializations - parameter sequences which yield positive clone Schur functions on $\mathbb{YF}$. We connect Fibonacci positivity with total positivity of tridiagonal matrices, Stieltjes moment sequences, and orthogonal polynomials in one variable from the ($q$-)Askey scheme.
  Our second family of results concerns the asymptotic behavior of random Fibonacci words derived from various Fibonacci positive specializations. We analyze several limiting regimes for specific examples, revealing stick-breaking-like processes (connected to GEM distributions), dependent stick-breaking processes of a new type, or discrete limits tied to the Martin boundary of the Young-Fibonacci lattice. Our stick-breaking-like scaling limits significantly extend the result of Gnedin-Kerov (Math. Proc. Camb. Philos. Soc. 129 (2000), no. 3, 433-446) on asymptotics of the Plancherel measure on $\mathbb{YF}$.
  We also establish Cauchy-like identities for clone Schur functions (with the right-hand side given by a quadridiagonal determinant), and construct and analyze models of random permutations and involutions based on Fibonacci positive specializations and a version of the Robinson-Schensted correspondence for $\mathbb{YF}$.</description>

      <title>The Many Colours of Amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the colour-dependence of scattering amplitudes in Yang-Mills theory with arbitrary (but fixed) gauge group and various representations of charged matter. When the rank of the gauge theory is taken arbitrarily large compared to the number of particles involved in an amplitude, it is well known that the number of independent colour-structure tensors grows factorially with multiplicity; however, for any fixed gauge group, this number grows at most exponentially with multiplicity. We review how this counting arises in representation theory and survey its implications for a wide variety of specific gauge groups with various representations of charged matter, uncovering several surprising structures along the way.</description>

      <title>Invariant derivations and trace bounds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.03101v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: About 20 years ago, J-P.~Serre announced a bound on the trace of elements of compact Lie groups under the adjoint representation together with related results, provided indications of his proofs, and invited a better proof. This note provides a new, general method for proving such bounds; uses that method to derive Serre's bounds; gives a second proof of Serre's announced results that (we learned) closely follows his original argument; and provides lower bounds for traces of other representations of compact Lie groups and for Brauer characters of finite groups.</description>

      <title>Bijection between positive clusters and projectively signed exceptional sequences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.05997v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 2017, Igusa and Todorov gave a bijection between signed exceptional sequences and ordered partial clusters. In this paper, we show that every term in an exceptional sequence is either relatively projective or relatively injective or both and we refine this bijection to one between projectively signed exceptional sequences and ordered partial positive clusters. We also give a characterization of relatively projective/injective objects in terms of supports of the objects in the exceptional sequence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04030v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show in this paper that in the context of graded Lie algebras, all cuspidal character sheaves arise from a nearby-cycle construction followed by a Fourier--Sato transform in a very specific manner. Combined with results of the last two named authors, this completes the classification of cuspidal character sheaves for Vinberg's type I graded classical Lie algebras.</description>

      <title>Duality via convolution of W-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.01843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.01843v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Feigin-Frenkel duality is the isomorphism between the principal $\mathcal{W}$-algebras of a simple Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ and its Langlands dual Lie algebra ${}^L\mathfrak{g}$. A generalization of this duality to a larger family of $\mathcal{W}$-algebras called hook-type was recently conjectured by Gaiotto and Rap\v{c}\'ak and proved by the first two authors. It says that the affine cosets of two different hook-type $\mathcal{W}$-algebras are isomorphic. A natural question is whether the duality between affine cosets can be enhanced to a duality between the full $\mathcal{W}$-algebras. There is a convolution operation that maps a hook-type $\mathcal{W}$-algebra $\mathcal{W}$ to a certain relative semi-infinite cohomology of $\mathcal{W}$ tensored with a suitable kernel VOA. The first two authors conjectured previously that this cohomology is isomorphic to the Feigin-Frenkel dual hook-type $\mathcal{W}$-algebra. Our main result is a proof of this conjecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03021v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we relate a well-known in symplectic geometry compactification of the space of symmetric bilinear forms considered as a chart of the Lagrangian Grassmannian to the specific compactifications of the space of electrical networks in the disc obtained in \cite{L}, \cite{CGS} and \cite{BGKT}. In particular, we state an explicit connection between these works and describe some of the combinatorics developed there in the language of symplectic geometry. We also show that the combinatorics of the concordance vectors forces the uniqueness of the symplectic form, such that corresponding points of the Grassmannian are isotropic. We define a notion of Lagrangian concordance which provides a construction of the compactification of the space of electrical networks in the positive part of the Lagrangian Grassmannian bypassing the construction from \cite{L}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05946v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper surveys some recent results, concerning the intrinsicness of natural subcategories of weakly approximable triangulated categories. We also review the results about uniqueness of enhancements of triangulated categories, with the aim of showing the fruitful interplay. In particular, we show how this leads to a vast generalization of a result by Rickard about derived invariance for schemes and rings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16557v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper concerns the Kac-Paljutkin type Hopf algebra $H_{2n^2}$ and its grading Artin-Schelter regular $H_{2n^2}$-module algebra $A$ of dimension $2$. It is described that all PBW-deformations of the smash product $A \sharp H_{2n^2},$ and all PBW-deformations of $A^! \sharp\, H_{2n^2}$ under the conditions that the Koszul dual of $A$ is an $H_{2n^2}$-module algebra. Also, the nontrivial PBW-deformations of $(A \otimes^c A^{\mathrm{op}}_c) \sharp\, H_{2n^2}$ are explored, where $A \otimes^c A^{\mathrm{op}}_c$ is the associated braided tensor product algebra.</description>
