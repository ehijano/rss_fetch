      <title>The Host Galaxies of Fast Radio Bursts Track a Combination of Stellar Mass and Star Formation, Similar to Type Ia Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a new statistical framework for studying the host galaxies of astrophysical sources that accounts for both redshift evolution and the multi-variate nature of host-galaxy properties. These aspects are critical when dealing with sources that span a wide range of redshifts, and/or with unknown redshift-dependent selection effects. We apply our method to a sample of Fast Radio Burst (FRB) host-galaxies as a means of probing the uncertain progenitor(s) of these events. Using our method we are able to rule out that FRBs track star-formation rate (SFR), as would be expected if FRBs are associated exclusively with young neutron stars born via core-collapse supernovae (SNe). Furthermore, we robustly rule out a recently proposed model whereby FRBs track SFR only above a certain metallicity threshold. Motivated by the fact that at least one FRB has been localized to a globular cluster (GC), we also investigate the hypothesis that that all FRBs occur in GCs and rule out this scenario explicitly for the first time. Alternatively, we find that a `mixed' model whereby FRBs track a linear combination of both SFR and stellar-mass best explains the data. The preferred parameters of such a mixed model are remarkably similar to those inferred for Type Ia SNe, and implies a possible connection between the progenitors of these different transients.</description>

      <title>Disk-jet coupling across the spectral transition in supermassive black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accretion flows in both stellar and supermassive black holes show a distinct spectral transition. This is seen directly in binaries and changing look AGN, and also in a recent sample of eROSITA X-ray selected, unobscured AGN where the stacked spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for a single black hole mass bin (log $M/M_{\odot} =8-8.5$) clearly show the UV bright disk appearing as the luminosity increases. In binaries, this transition is associated with a change in radio jet, from coupling to the X-ray hot flow with $L_R \propto L_X^{0.7}$ (Fundamental Plane relation), to collapsing when the X-ray hot flow collapses into a disc. We explore the radio behaviour across the transition in our AGN sample by stacking VLASS images. We significantly detect weak radio emission even after subtracting the contribution from star formation in the host galaxy. The residual radio emission remains relatively constant across the transition, despite the mean mass accretion rate changing by a factor 6 and UV flux changing by a factor 100. However, the X-rays change by only a factor 2, giving a constant radio to X-ray flux ratio as predicted by the 'fundamental plane'. We show that this is consistent with these AGN having the same compact radio jet coupling to the X-ray hot flow (not the disc) as in the binaries. The most significant difference is the persistence of the coronal X-rays across the spectral transition in AGN, whereas in binaries the coronal X-rays can be very weak in the disc dominated state.</description>

      <title>Investigating the spectral nature of gigahertz-peaked spectra pulsar candidates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the measurements of low radio frequency spectra of fourteen gigahertz-peaked spectra (GPS) pulsar candidates, between 300~MHz and 700~MHz, using the upgraded Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope. Combining newly collected measurements with archival results the spectral nature of each pulsar was examined using four different physical models: simple power law, broken power law, low-frequency turn-over power law and free-free thermal absorption. Based on this analysis, we confirm the GPS nature of five pulsars, three of them being new detections. In addition, one pulsar can be classified as having a broken power law spectrum, and we found the typical power law spectra in four other cases. In the remaining four pulsars the spectra showed tendencies of low frequency turn-over that require further investigations at lower frequency ranges. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of wideband measurements at low frequencies, below 1 GHz, in characterizing the spectral nature in pulsars. Our results also underline the need for more systematic theoretical studies to refine existing models and better interpret pulsar emission properties.</description>

      <title>The population of tidal disruption events discovered with eROSITA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a systematic study of X-ray-selected canonical tidal disruption events (TDEs) discovered in the western Galactic hemisphere of the first two eROSITA all-sky surveys (eRASS1 and eRASS2) performed between Dec 2019 and Dec 2020. We compiled a TDE sample from the catalog of eROSITA's extragalactic transients and variables eRO-ExTra, which includes X-ray sources with a variability significance and fractional amplitude over four between eRASS1 and eRASS2, not associated with known AGNs. Each X-ray source is associated with an optical counterpart from the Legacy Survey DR10. Canonical TDEs were selected based on their X-ray light-curve properties (single flare or decline), soft X-ray spectra ($\Gamma&gt;3$), and the absence of archival X-ray variability and AGN signatures in their host photometry and spectroscopy. The sample includes 31 X-ray-selected TDE candidates with redshifts of $0.02&lt; z&lt;0.34$ and luminosities of $5.7 \times 10^{41}&lt;L_X&lt;5.3 \times 10^{44}$ erg/s in the 0.2-6.0 keV rest frame, of which 30 are canonical TDEs and one is an off-nuclear TDE candidate. The derived X-ray luminosity function is best fit by a double power law with a luminosity break at $10^{44}$ erg/s, corresponding to the Eddington-limiting prediction. This corresponds to a TDE volumetric rate of $ (2.3^{+1.2}_{-0.9})\times10^{-7}\,Mpc^{-3} yr^{-1}$ ($\approx1.2\times 10^{-5}$ events per galaxy per year). TDE host galaxies show a green-valley overdensity. In addition, 20%, 30%, and 15% of the sample exhibit flares in the optical, mid-infrared (mid-IR), or radio bands, respectively. We discuss the differences between X-ray, optical, and mid-IR TDE populations and the origins of multiwavelength flares in the context of the obscuring envelope and stream-stream collision models. Finally, we highlight TDE subpopulations that are not included in the canonical sample and should be explored in the future.</description>

      <title>A systematic analysis of the radio properties of 22 X-ray selected tidal disruption event candidates with the Australia Telescope Compact Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic analysis of the radio properties of an X-ray selected sample of tidal disruption event (TDE) candidates discovered by the eROSITA telescope. We find radio sources coincident with half of the transient events (11 TDEs), with 8 radio sources showing statistically significant variability over a 6-month period. We model the radio spectra of 6 sources with sufficiently bright radio emission and find the sources show radio spectra consistent with optically thin synchrotron emission and radio outflow minimum radii of $10^{16}$--$10^{17}$ cm, velocities 0.01--0.05 c, and energies $10^{48}$--$10^{51}$ erg. On comparison with the radio properties of an optically-selected TDE sample at similar late times, we find no significant difference in the radio luminosity range or radio detection rate. We find a tentative positive trend with peak radio and X-ray luminosity, but require further observations to determine if this is real or due to observational bias due to the large range in distances of the events. Interestingly, none of the X-ray selected events show late rising radio emission, compared to 45% of radio-detected sources of an optically-selected sample that showed late rising radio emission. We propose that this may indicate that many TDEs launch radio outflows at or near peak X-ray luminosity, which can be significantly delayed from peak optical luminosity. This study presents the first systematic analysis of the radio properties of an X-ray selected sample of TDEs, and gives insight into the possible link between the physical processes that power X-ray and radio emission in TDEs.</description>

      <title>Hadronic emission from the environment of the Crab Pulsar Wind Nebula by re-accelerated particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The observation of peta-electronvolt (PeV) $\gamma$-ray photons from the Crab Nebula by LHAASO has revitalised the possibility of a secondary population of hadrons producing the highest energy emission through neutral pion decay. Despite previous studies modelling this population, the origin of such high-energy hadronic particles remains unclear. We consider possible acceleration scenarios for multi PeV particles in the Crab Nebula environment, including one in which high-energy protons produced at the supernova remnant's outer shock diffuse into the pulsar wind nebula. Particles which reach the Crab Pulsar's wind termination shock can be accelerated to the required energies, and subsequently interact with the dense filaments surrounding the nebula. We perform particle transport simulations of this scenario, including the effects of the expansion of the pulsar wind nebula into the surrounding supernova ejecta. We find that this results in PeV photons being produced over the lifetime of the Crab system, without over-estimating the flux at lower energies or exceeding the energy budget of the Crab Pulsar. This results in a reasonable match to the LHAASO data at the highest energies. We also present predictions for the resulting all-flavour neutrino flux, finding it to be approximately an order of magnitude below the sensitivity of current generation instruments.</description>

      <title>Pushchino multibeam pulsar search VI. Method of pulsar timing using bad timed data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A method for pulsar timing based on monitoring data from the 3-th diagramm of the Large Phased Array (LPA LPI) radio telescope is proposed. In our observations, recorders with quartz clock generators were used as local clocks. Such recorders initially had an accuracy and hardware reference to the UTC time scale insufficient for pulsar timing. We have developed a method for referencing such clocks to the UTC based on observations of known pulsars used as intermediate reference clocks. This allowed us to improve dramatically the accuracy of determining the Time of Arrivals (TOA) of pulsars' pulses.
  We applied this method to the results of our observations of 24 second period pulsars over a time interval of 10 years. It was shown that the accuracy of the pulsar period, its first derivative ($P$ and $\dot P$) and their coordinates in right ascension and declination ($\alpha, \delta$) allow us to predict the pulsar phase within $\pm 0.5 P$ during several years. The accuracy of determining the coordinates by right ascension and declination was typically better than $10^{\prime \prime}$ with an angular resolution of the radio telescope of about $30^\prime$. That makes it possible to use these parameters for timing using radio telescopes with narrow beam patterns. The accuracy of the calculated period was typically better than $10^{-8}$~s.</description>

      <title>Dependence of post-merger properties on the thermal heating efficiency in neutron star mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We systematically perform numerical-relativity simulations for equal-mass binary neutron star mergers for the models varying the thermal index $\Gamma_{\rm th}$ with 3 different equations of state (EOSs) of the neutron stars (NSs), which are consistent with current multi-messenger observational data and state-of-the-art theoretical calculations, and 2 different binary total mass ($m_0=2.7\ \text{and}\ 2.9~M_\odot$). By varying the value of $\Gamma_{\rm th}$ within the hybrid EOS framework, we investigate the thermal effects on the merger dynamics, gravitational waves (GWs), and the dynamical mass ejection process. We find that the choice of the constant $\Gamma_{\rm th}$ can change the outcome of the remnant for specific EOSs and $m_0$. We also show that the dynamical ejecta mass is affected by the $\Gamma_{\rm th}$ value in a different way for different EOSs: for a stiff EOS the ejecta mass is high when $\Gamma_{\rm th}$ is small, while for softer EOSs the largest ejecta is achieved when $\Gamma_{\rm th} = 1.3$--$1.4$. While the inspiral motion does not depend on the $\Gamma_{\rm th}$, the post merger phase evolution is highly affected by that. We show that the dominant peak frequency $f_2$ of the post merger GW spectrum monotonically decreases as the $\Gamma_{\rm th}$ increases. We find that the universal relations between NS macroscopic properties and post-merger GW frequencies are subject to non-negligible thermal uncertainties, which can obscure the universal relation between the tidal deformability and $f_2$.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic mapping between multiparticle production variables and the depth of maximum in proton-induced extensive air showers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interaction of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays with air nuclei triggers extensive air showers that reach their maximal energy deposition at the atmospheric depth $X_{\max}$. The distribution of this shower observable encodes information about the proton-air cross-section via fluctuations of the primary interaction point, $X_1$, and hadron production through $\Delta X_{\max} \equiv X_{\max} - X_1$.
  We introduce new multiparticle production variables, $\alpha_{\textrm{had}}$, $\zeta_{\textrm{had}}$, and $\zeta_{\mathrm{EM}}$, built from the energy spectra of secondaries in the primary interaction. Their linear combination, $\xi$, predicts over $50 \%$ of the fluctuations in $\Delta X_{\max}$. Moreover, we build a probabilistic mapping based on the causal connection between $\xi$ and $\Delta X_{\max}$ that enables model-independent predictions of $X_{\max}$ moments with biases below $3\,\mathrm{g\,cm^{-2}}$. Therefore, measurements of the distribution of $X_{\max}$ allow a data-driven probing of secondary hadron spectra from the cosmic-ray-air interaction, in proton-induced showers.
  The distributions of the new multiparticle production variables can be measured in rapidity regions accessible to current accelerators and are strongly dependent on the hadronic interaction model in the kinematic regions exclusive to ultra-high-energy cosmic rays.</description>

      <title>Hidden Twin Star Solutions from an Agnostic Speed-of-Sound Model: Confronting XTE J1814--338's Extreme Compactness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The twin star configuration, where two neutron stars share the same mass but exhibit different radii, arises from a strong first-order phase transition within the stellar interior. In widely used equation of state (EoS) meta-models, such as the Polytrope (PP) and Speed-of-Sound (CS) models, this first-order phase transition behavior can be naturally mimicked by tuning some model parameters. Here, we systematically explore the under-explored parameter space within one of a widely adopted CS model that leads to twin stars via a strong first-order phase transition. Within this twin-star subspace, we perform a comprehensive Bayesian analysis that integrates mass--radius (MR) constraints from X-ray observations of rotation-powered millisecond pulsars. The resultant twin star branch, situated within the 1--1.2 $M_{\odot}$ mass range and approximately 7 km in radius, surprisingly coincides with the MR ranges proposed for the recent anomaly in the Accreting Millisecond X-ray Pulsars XTE J1814--338 (J1814), suggesting a hybrid twin star configuration. Moreover, incorporating the J1814 observation as an additional constraint yields an extreme phase transition pressure $P_{\text{trans}} = 108.9_{-4.85}^{+6.46}$ MeV/fm$^3$, a transition density of $\varepsilon_{\text{trans}}/\varepsilon_0 = 4.847_{-0.134}^{+0.271}$(where $\varepsilon_0$ is the nuclear saturation energy density) and an energy density jump $\Delta \varepsilon = 558.7_{-278.7}^{+303.6}$ MeV/fm$^3$, corresponding to $\Delta \varepsilon/\varepsilon_0 = 3.716_{-1.854}^{+2.020}$. Notably, to satisfy all astrophysical constraints, the speed of sound inside of the hybrid twin star core is driven toward the speed of light ($c_s^2/c^2 &gt; 0.9$), indicating the potential presence of strongly interacting, exotic matter in this core region.</description>

      <title>Constraints on diffuse X-ray Emission from the TeV halo Candidate HESS J1813-126</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extended regions of very high energy $\gamma$-ray emission associated with middle-aged pulsars have been found by $\gamma$-ray observatories. These regions, called TeV halos or pulsar halos, are thought to be created when energetic electrons from a pulsar or pulsar wind nebula transport into interstellar medium and undergo inverse Compton scattering with the cosmic microwave background radiation. The same electrons are expected to emit synchrotron emission in the X-ray band in the interstellar magnetic field. HESS J1813-126 is a pulsar halo candidate from which TeV $\gamma$-ray emission with extension 0.21\degr and a hard $E^{-2}$ spectrum is observed. We searched for the synchrotron component of this pulsar halo with Swift-XRT. In particular, we observed two fields within the region covered by HESS J1813-126 for 35 ksec each and a region nearby as a background reference for 10 ksec. We find no evidence for excess X-ray emission from the two observations near HESS J1813-126 and place an upper limit differential flux of $4.32\times 10^{-4}\, \rm keV^{-1}\, cm^{-2}\,s^{-1} $ and $5.38\times 10^{-4}\, \rm keV^{-1}\, cm^{-2}\,s^{-1} $ at 1 keV assuming an $E^{-2}$ power law spectrum. The non-detection implies that the magnetic field inside the halo is not significantly enhanced compared to the average Galactic magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Don't torque like that. Measuring compact object magnetic fields with analytic torque models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Changes of the rotational period observed in various magnetized accreting sources are generally attributed to the interaction between the in-falling plasma and the large-scale magnetic field of the accretor. A number of models have been proposed to link these changes to the mass accretion rate, based on different assumptions on the relevant physical processes and system parameters. For X-ray binaries with neutron stars, with the help of precise measurements of the spin periods provided by current instrumentation, these models render a way to infer such parameters as the strength of the dipolar field and a distance to the system. Often, the obtained magnetic field strength values contradict those from other methods used to obtain magnetic field estimates.
  Aims. We want to compare the results of several of the proposed accretion models. To this end an example application of these models to data is performed.
  Methods. We reformulate the set of disk accretion torque models in a way that their parametrization are directly comparable. The application of the reformulated models is discussed and demonstrated using Fermi/GBM and Swift/BAT monitoring data covering several X-ray outbursts of the accreting pulsar 4U 0115+63.
  Results. We find that most of the models under consideration are able to describe the observations to a high degree of accuracy and with little indication for one model being preferred over the others. Yet, derived parameters from those models show a large spread. Specifically the magnetic field strength ranges over one order of magnitude for the different models. This indicates that the results are heavily influenced by systematic uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Counting Little Red Dots at $z&lt;4$ with Ground-based Surveys and Spectroscopic Follow-up</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Little red dots (LRDs) are a population of red, compact objects discovered by JWST at $z&gt;4$. At $4&lt;z&lt;8$, they are roughly 100 times more abundant than UV-selected quasars. However, their number density is uncertain at $z&lt;4$ due to the small sky coverage and limited blue wavelength coverage of JWST. We present our ground-based search for LRDs at $2\lesssim z\lesssim4$, combining ultra-deep Hyper Suprime-Cam photometry and various (near-)infrared surveys within a total area of $\sim3.1\,\mathrm{deg^{2}}$. We find that for LRDs with $M_{5500}&lt;-22.5$, their number density declines from $\sim10^{-4.5}\,\mathrm{cMpc^{-3}}$ at $z&gt;4$ to $\sim10^{-5.3}\,\mathrm{cMpc^{-3}}$ at $2.7&lt;z&lt;3.7$ and $\sim10^{-5.7}\,\mathrm{cMpc^{-3}}$ at $1.7&lt;z&lt;2.7$. We also present the Magellan/FIRE spectrum of our first followed-up candidate, DEEP23-z2LRD1 at $z_\mathrm{spec}=2.26$, as a proof of concept for our sample selection. Similar to high-redshift LRDs, the spectrum of DEEP23-z2LRD1 exhibits broad H$\alpha$ emission with $\mathrm{FWHM}\approx2400\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$ and with nearly symmetric narrow H$\alpha$ absorption. Additionally, DEEP23-z2LRD1 has extremely narrow [OIII] lines with $\mathrm{FWHM}\approx140\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$, suggesting the presence of an accreting black hole in a low-mass host galaxy. Limited by the angular resolution of ground-based surveys, we emphasize that spectroscopic follow-ups are required to characterize the contamination fraction of this sample and pin down LRD number density at $z&lt;4$.</description>

      <title>In the grip of the disk: dragging the companion through an AGN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active galactic nuclei (AGN) have been proposed as environments that can facilitate the capture of extreme-mass-ratio binaries and accelerate their inspiral beyond the rate expected from gravitational wave emission alone. In this work, we explore binaries shortly after capture, focusing on the evolution of the binary parameters when the system is still far from merger. We find that repeated interactions with the AGN disk typically reduce both the inclination and semi-major axis of the orbit. The evolution of the eccentricity is more intricate, exhibiting phases of growth and decay. Nevertheless, as the binary gradually aligns with the disk plane, the system tends to circularize. Interestingly, we also identify scenarios where initially highly eccentric, nearly counter-rotating orbits can undergo a rapid transition to co-rotation while maintaining a constant eccentricity. These dynamical effects could have significant implications for the modeling and interpretation of LISA sources.</description>

      <title>How much spin wandering can continuous gravitational wave search algorithms handle?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The canonical signal model in continuous gravitational wave searches is deterministic, and stable over the long integration times needed to separate a putative signal from the noise, e.g. with a matched filter. However, there exist plausible physical mechanisms that give rise to "spin-wandering", i.e. small stochastic variations in the frequency of the gravitational wave. Stochastic variations degrade the sensitivity of matched filters which assume a deterministic frequency evolution. Suites of synthetic spin-wandering injections are performed to infer the loss in sensitivity depth $D_{\rm SW}$ when compared to the depth for a canonical signal $D_{\rm det}$. For a fiducial spin-wandering signal that wanders by $\lesssim5 \times 10^{-6}\,$Hz per day, the depth ratio is $D_{\rm det} / D_{\rm SW}=4.39^{+0.23}_{-0.27}$, $1.51^{+0.02}_{-0.03}$, $1.75^{+0.04}_{-0.04}$, and $1.07^{+0.01}_{-0.02}$ for the coherent $F$-statistic, semi-coherent $F$-statistic, CrossCorr, and HMM-Viterbi algorithms respectively. Increasing the coherence time of the semi-coherent algorithms does not necessarily increase their sensitivity to spin-wandering signals.</description>

      <title>Multi-MeV electrons observed by CRRES during solar cycle 22</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Combined Release and Radiation Effects Satellite (CRRES) observed the response of the Van Allen radiation belts to peak solar activity within solar cycle 22. This study analyses the occurrence and loss timescales of relativistic electrons within the CRRES High Energy Electron Fluxometer (HEEF) dataset, including during several large geomagnetic storms that flooded the slot region with multi-MeV electrons and which allow the first definitive multi-MeV lifetimes to be calculated in this region. The HEEF loss timescales are otherwise broadly in agreement with those from later solar cycles but differences include longer-lasting sub-MeV electrons near the inner region of the outer belt and faster decaying multi-MeV electrons near geosynchronous orbit. These differences are associated with higher levels of geomagnetic activity, a phenomenon that enables the spread in the results to be parameterised accordingly. The timescales generally appear well-bounded by Kp-dependent theoretical predictions but the variability within the spread is however not always well-ordered by geomagnetic activity. This reveals the limits of pitch-angle diffusion in accounting for the decay of elevated electron fluxes following geomagnetic storms.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Neutrino Reconstruction in Water-Cherenkov Air Shower Arrays Using Multi-Photosensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, the potential of water Cherenkov detectors equipped with multi-PMT modules for precision neutrino direction reconstruction is demonstrated. By analyzing signal time traces with transformer-based models, significant improvements in angular resolution are achieved compared to previous designs with larger PMTs. These detectors enable the reconstruction of neutrino directions with resolutions of approximately $10$ degrees in azimuth and $7$ degrees in zenith for high-signal events. This design reduces saturation effects and enhances directional sensitivity, particularly for high-energy neutrinos. The results highlight the potential of WCD arrays as complementary tools for neutrino astronomy, particularly in the context of multimessenger observations of transient astrophysical sources. The nearly continuous operation and wide field of view of these detectors further enhance their suitability for real-time monitoring and alert generation.</description>

      <title>The Potential of Coordinated Gravitational-Wave Followup for Improving Kilonova Detection Prospects: Lessons from GW190425</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17558v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The discovery of a kilonova associated with the GW170817 binary neutron star merger had far-reaching implications for our understanding of several open questions in physics and astrophysics. Unfortunately, since then, only one robust binary neutron star merger was detected through gravitational waves, GW190425, and no electromagnetic counterpart was identified for it following an uncoordinated search. In order to estimate the potential difference that coordinated followup could make for future events, we analyze all reported electromagnetic followup observations of GW190425. We find that even for a large gravitational-wave localization uncertainty, such as this one, most of the 90% probability region can be covered within hours with a coordinated search, given the observational resources expended in this case by the community. However, more than 5 days after the GW190425 merger, its uncoordinated search covered only 50% of the probability, with some areas observed over 100 times, and some never observed. According to some models, the GW190425 kilonova could have been detected, despite the larger distance and higher component masses compared to GW170817. These results emphasize that coordinated followup of gravitational-wave events can, in principle, significantly improve both the chances of finding electromagnetic counterparts, and the time it takes to do so, compared to uncoordinated searches.</description>

      <title>Constraining the Generalized Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (GTOV) equation with Bayesian analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10425v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we constrain the values of the parameters of the Generalized Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (GTOV) equation through Bayesian inference. We use the mass and radius data from the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) for PSR J0740$+$6620 and PSR J0030$+$0451, as well as the mass, radius, and dimensionless tidal deformability from the gravitational wave (GW) events GW190814 and GW170817. We use two distinct parameterizations of the extended non-linear Walecka model (eNLW) with and without hyperons. The GTOV employed for the study contains additional free parameters with different physical motivations. Two possible scenarios are considered in our analysis: conservative and speculative. In the first case, we take into account the most reliable neutron star (NS) data from NICER and the GW170817 event. In the second case, we consider the possibility that the compact object with a mass of $2.54 M_{\odot}$ in the GW190814 event is an NS. Our findings show significant improvements in the physical quantities analyzed, leading to better agreement with the observational data compared to the results obtained using the TOV equation.</description>

      <title>Discovery of Quasi-periodic Eruptions in the Tidal Disruption Event and Extreme Coronal Line Emitter AT2022upj: implications for the QPE/TDE fraction and a connection to ECLEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19013v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) are recurring soft X-ray transients emerging from the vicinity of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in nearby, low-mass galaxy nuclei; about ten QPE hosts have been identified thus far. Here we report the \textit{NICER} discovery of QPEs in the optically-selected Tidal Disruption Event (TDE) and Extreme Coronal Line Emitter (ECLE) AT2022upj, exhibiting a large spread in recurrence times from 0.5-3.5 days, durations from 0.3-1 days, peak luminosities from $10^{42.5-43.0}$ erg s$^{-1}$, and erratic flare profiles. A wealth of evidence now links at least some QPEs to the newly-formed accretion flows emerging from TDEs; AT2022upj is the third QPE reported in an optically discovered TDE. Marginalizing over the uncertain distributions of QPE peak luminosity, recurrence time, delay after TDE peak, and lifetime, we use the burgeoning sample to make a Bayesian estimate that the fraction of optical TDEs resulting in QPEs within 5 years post-disruption is $9^{+9}_{-5}$\%. Along with AT2019qiz, AT2022upj also marks the second of the three optical TDE+X-ray QPEs showing coronal line emission, suggesting ECLEs may represent a subset of TDEs particularly efficient at forming QPEs and/or that sustained QPE X-ray emission contributes to coronal line emission in some galaxy nuclei.</description>

      <title>Fast Radio Bursts as probes of the late-time universe: a new insight on the Hubble tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01974v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are bright radio transient events, a subset of which have been localized to their host galaxies. Their high dispersion measures offer valuable insights into the ionized plasma along their line of sight, enabling them to serve as probes of cosmological parameters. One of the major challenges in contemporary cosmology is the Hubble tension -- an unresolved discrepancy between two independent methods of determining the Universe's expansion rate, yielding differing values for the Hubble constant. In this study, we analyze a sample of 64 extragalactic, localized FRBs observed by various telescopes, employing Bayesian analysis with distinct likelihood functions. Our findings suggest that FRBs serve as tracers of the Hubble constant in the late-time Universe. Notably, our results exhibit smaller error bars compared to previous studies, and the derived Hubble constant with 1$\sigma$ error bars no longer overlap with those obtained from early-Universe measurements. These results underscore the continuing tension between early- and late-time measurements of the Hubble constant.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional simulations of accretion disks in pre-CE systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02933v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Before a binary system enters into a common envelope (CE) phase, accretion from the primary star onto the companion star through Roche Lobe overflow (RLOF) will lead to the formation of an accretion disk, which may generate jets. Accretion before and during the CE may alter the outcome of the interaction. Previous studies have considered different aspects of this physical mechanism. Here we study the properties of an accretion disk formed via 3D hydrodynamic simulations of the RLOF mass transfer between a 7 M$_\odot$, red supergiant star and a 1.4 M$_\odot$, neutron star companion. We simulate only the volume around the companion for improved resolution. We use a 1D implicit MESA simulation of the evolution of the system during 30,000 years between the on-set of the RLOF and the CE to guide the binary parameters and the mass-transfer rate, while we simulate only 21 years of the last part of the RLOF in 3D using an ideal gas isothermal equation of state. We expect that a pre-CE disk under these parameters will have a mass of $\sim 5\times 10^{-3}$ M$_\odot$ and a radius of $\sim$40 R$_\odot$ with a scale height of $\sim$5 R$_\odot$. The temperature profile of the disk is shallower than that predicted by the formalism of Shakura and Sunyaev, but more reasonable cooling physics would need to be included. We stress test these results with respect to a number of physical and numerical parameters, as well as simulation choices, and we expect them to be reasonable within a factor of a few for the mass and 15% for the radius. We also contextualize our results within those presented in the literature, in particular with respect to the dimensionality of simulations and the adiabatic index. We discuss the measured accretion rate in the context of the Shakura and Sunyaev formalism and debate the viscous mechanisms at play, finishing with a list of prospects for future work.</description>
