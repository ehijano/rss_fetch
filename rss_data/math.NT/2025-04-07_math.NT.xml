      <title>Best versus uniform Diophantine approximatio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $0&lt;m&lt;n$ be integers, and let $K_w$ denote the completion of a number field $K$ at a non-trivial place $w$. For each non-zero $\textbf{u}\in K_w^n$, let $\omega_{m-1}(\textbf{u})$ denote the exponent of best approximation to $\textbf{u}$ by vector subspaces of $K_w^n$ of dimension $m$ defined over $K$, and let $\widehat{\omega}_{m-1}(\textbf{u})$ denote the corresponding exponent of uniform approximation. Finally, let $S_{m,n}$ denote the set of all pairs $(\widehat{\omega}_{m-1}(\textbf{u}),\omega_{m-1}(\textbf{u}))$ where $\textbf{u}$ runs through all points of $K_w^n$ with linearly independent coordinates over $K$. In this paper we use parametric geometry of numbers to study this spectrum $S_{m,n}$, noting at first that it is independent of the choice of $K$ and $w$. We may thus assume that $K=\mathbb{Q}$ and $K_w=\mathbb{R}$. In this context, Schmidt and Summerer proposed conjectural descriptions for $S_{1,n}$ and $S_{n-1,n}$ which were confirmed by Marnat and Moshchevitin for each $n\ge 2$. We give an alternative proof of their result based on the PhD thesis of the first author, highlighting the duality between the two spectra. In his thesis, the first author generalized the conjecture to any pair $(m,n)$ and proved it to be true also for $S_{2,4}$. We present this as well, but show that this natural conjecture fails for $S_{3,5}$. Moreover, the part of $S_{3,5}$ that we succeed to compute here suggests a complicated boundary for that set, possibly not semialgebraic. We also give a qualitative description of $S_{m,n}$ for a general pair $(m,n)$.</description>

      <title>On the torsion growth in quadratic number fields for elliptic curves defined over the rationals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given an elliptic curve defined over the field of rational numbers, it is known how its torsion subgroup may grow when we make a base change to a quadratic number field. In this paper we consider the inverse question: if we have the elliptic curve defined over the rationals and we know how the torsion subgroup grows, what can we say about the field? Our main result gives an explicit relationship between the primes dividing the conductor of the curve and the conductor of the extension as a first approach to a better understanding of this problem.</description>

      <title>A P-adic class formula for Anderson t-modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03430v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $P$ be a monic prime of $\mathbb F_q[\theta]$, we define the $P$-adic $L$-series associated with Anderson $t$-modules and prove a $P$-adic class formula \`a la Taelman linking a $P$-adic regulator, the class module and a local factor at $P$. Next, we extend this result to the multi-variable setting \`a la Pellarin. Finally, we give some applications to Drinfeld modules defined over $\mathbb F_q[\theta]$ itself.</description>

      <title>On a theorem of Erd\H{o}s and Loxton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $a(n)$ be the number of partitions of $n$ of the form $a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_k$ where $a_{i + 1}$ is a proper divisor of $a_i$ for all $i &lt; k$. Erd{\H o}s and Loxton showed that the sum of $a(n)$ over all $n \leq x$ is asymptotic to a constant multiple of $x^\rho$ where $s = \rho \approx 1.73$ is the unique solution to the equation $\zeta(s) = 2$ satisfying $s &gt; 1$. In this note, we provide tight bounds on the value of this constant, though we do not find an exact formula for it. In addition, we write an explicit upper bound for $a(n)$.</description>

      <title>Sums of squares of integers except for a fixed one</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study a sum of squares of integers except for a fixed one. For any nonnegative integer $n$, we find the minimum number of squares of integers except for $n$ whose sums represent all positive integers that are represented by a sum of squares except for it. This problem could be considered as a generalization of Dubouis's result for the case when $n=0$.</description>

      <title>On the maximal volume of empty convex bodies amidst multivariate dilates of a lacunary integer sequence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let \((a_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}\) be a lacunary sequence of integers satisfying the Hadamard gap condition. For any fixed dimension $d \geq 1$, we establish asymptotic upper bounds for the maximal gap in the set of dilates \(\{\boldsymbol{\alpha} a_n \}_{n \leq N}\) modulo 1 as $N \to \infty$, for Lebesgue--almost all dilation vectors $\boldsymbol{\alpha} \in [0,1]^d$. More precisely, we prove that for any lacunary \((a_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}\) and Lebesgue--almost all $\boldsymbol{\alpha}$, every convex set in $[0,1]^d$ of volume at least $(\log N)^{2+\varepsilon}/N$ must contain an element of the set \(\{\boldsymbol{\alpha} a_n \}_{n \leq N}\) mod 1, for all sufficiently large $N$. We also establish a generalized version of this result, where the $d$-dimensional Lebesgue measure is replaced by a general measure satisfying a certain Fourier decay condition. Our result is optimal up to logarithmic factors, and recovers as a special case a recent result for dimension $d=1$.</description>

      <title>Norm relations and computational problems in number fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.12332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2002.12332v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a finite group $G$, we introduce a generalization of norm relations in the group algebra $\mathbb Q[G]$. We give necessary and sufficient criteria for the existence of such relations and apply them to obtain relations between the arithmetic invariants of the subfields of a normal extension of algebraic number fields with Galois group $G$. On the algorithmic side this leads to subfield based algorithms for computing rings of integers, $S$-unit groups and class groups. For the $S$-unit group computation this yields a polynomial time reduction to the corresponding problem in subfields. We compute class groups of large number fields under GRH, and new unconditional values of class numbers of cyclotomic fields.</description>

      <title>On Multiplicatively Badly Approximable Vectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.04523v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\langle x\rangle$ denote the distance from $x\in\mathbb{R}$ to the set of integers $\mathbb{Z}$. The Littlewood Conjecture states that for all pairs $(\alpha,\beta)\in\mathbb{R}^{2}$ the product $q\langle q\alpha\rangle\langle q\beta\rangle$ attains values arbitrarily close to $0$ as $q\in\mathbb{N}$ tends to infinity. Badziahin showed that if a factor $\log q\cdot \log\log q$ is added to the product, the same statement becomes false. In this paper, we generalise Badziahin's result to vectors $\boldsymbol{\alpha}\in\mathbb{R}^{d}$, replacing the function $\log q\cdot \log\log q$ by $(\log q)^{d-1}\cdot\log\log q$ for any $d\geq 2$, and thereby obtaining a new proof in the case $d=2$. Our approach is based on a new version of the well-known Dani Correspondence between Diophantine approximation and dynamics on the space of lattices, especially adapted to the study of products of rational approximations. We believe that this correspondence is of independent interest.</description>

      <title>2-Elongated Plane Partitions and Powers of 7: The Localization Method Applied to a Genus 1 Congruence Family</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.15594v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over the last century, a large variety of infinite congruence families have been discovered and studied, exhibiting a great variety with respect to their difficulty. Major complicating factors arise from the topology of the associated modular curve: classical techniques are sufficient when the associated curve has cusp count 2 and genus 0. Recent work has led to new techniques that have proven useful when the associated curve has cusp count greater than 2 and genus 0. We show here that these techniques may be adapted in the case of positive genus. In particular, we examine a congruence family over the 2-elongated plane partition diamond counting function $d_2(n)$ by powers of 7, for which the associated modular curve has cusp count 4 and genus 1. We compare our method with other techniques for proving genus 1 congruence families, and conjecture a second congruence family by powers of 7, which may be amenable to similar techniques.</description>

We generalize results due to Meng Fai Lim proving Kida's formula and integrality results for characteristic elements of signed Selmer groups along the cyclotomic $\mathbb{Z}_p$-extension of weakly ramified base fields $K/\mathbb{Q}_p$.</description>

      <title>Singularity, weighted uniform approximation, intersections and rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15607v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A classical argument was introduced by Khintchine in 1926 in order to exhibit the existence of totally irrational singular linear forms in two variables. This argument was subsequently revisited and extended by many authors. For instance, in 1959 Jarnik used it to show that for $n \geq 2$ and for any non-increasing positive $f$ there are totally irrational matrices $A \in M_{m,n}({\mathbb R})$ such that for all large enough $t$ there are $\mathbf{p} \in {\mathbb Z}^m, \mathbf{q} \in {\mathbb Z}^n \smallsetminus \{0\}$ with $$\|\mathbf{q}\| \leq t \ \text{ and } \ \|A \mathbf{q} - \mathbf{p}\| \leq f(t).$$ We denote the collection of such matrices by $\mathrm{UA}^*_{m,n}(f)$. We adapt Khintchine's argument to show that the sets $\mathrm{UA}^*_{m,n}(f)$, and their weighted analogues $\mathrm{UA}^*_{m,n}(f, \mathbf{w})$, intersect many manifolds and fractals, and have strong intersection properties. For example, we show that:
  When $n \geq 2$, the set $\bigcap_{\mathbf{w}} \mathrm{UA}^*(f, \mathbf{w}) $, where the intersection is over all weights $\mathbf{w}$, is nonempty, and moreover intesects many manifolds and fractals;
  For $n \geq 2$, there are vectors in ${\mathbb R}^n$ which are simultaneously $k$-singular for every $k$, in the sense of Yu;
  when $n \geq 3$, $\mathrm{UA}^*_{1,n}(f) + \mathrm{UA}^*_{1,n}(f) = {\mathbb R}^n$.
  We also obtain new bounds on the rate of singularity which can be attained by column vectors in analytic submanifolds of dimension at least 2 in ${\mathbb R}^n$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15785v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a unified construction of perfectoid towers from specific prisms which covers all the previous constructions of (p-torsion-free) perfectoid towers. By virtue of the construction, perfectoid towers can be systematically constructed for a large class of rings with Frobenius lift. Especially, any Frobenius lifting of a reduced $\mathbb{F}_p$-algebra has a perfectoid tower.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05421v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that Frobenius eigenvalues of $\ell$-adic cohomology and $\ell$-adic intersection cohomology of rigid spaces over $p$-adic local fields are algebraic integers and we give bounds for their $p$-adic valuations. As an application, we deduce bounds for their weights, proving conjectures of Bhatt, Hansen, and Zavyalov. We also give examples of monodromy-pure perverse sheaves on projective curves with non monodromy-pure cohomology, answering a question of Hansen and Zavyalov.</description>
