      <title>Amicable Heronian Parallelograms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A convex polygon is Heronian if its side lengths and its area are integers. Two polygons are amicable if the area of one is equal to the perimeter of the other, and vice versa. We show that there are infinitely many pairs of amicable Heronian parallelograms, and we give necessary and sufficient conditions for a Heronian parallelogram to be part of an amicable pair.</description>

      <title>SL($n$) contravariant tensor valuations of small orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A complete classification of \(\mathrm{SL}(n)\) contravariant, \(p\)-order tensor valuations on convex polytopes in \( \mathbb{R}^n \) for \( n \geq p \) is established without imposing additional assumptions, particularly omitting any symmetry requirements on the tensors. Beyond recovering known symmetric tensor valuations, our classification reveals asymmetric counterparts associated with the cross tensor and the Levi-Civita tensor. Additionally, some Minkowski type relations for these asymmetric tensor valuations are obtained, extending the classical Minkowski relation of surface area measures.</description>

      <title>Metric pairs and tuples in theory and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present theoretical properties of the space of metric pairs equipped with the Gromov--Hausdorff distance. First, we establish the classical metric separability and the geometric geodesicity of this space. Second, we prove an Arzel\`a--Ascoli-type theorem for metric pairs. Third, extending a result by Cassorla, we show that the set of pairs consisting of a $2$-dimensional compact Riemannian manifold and a $2$-dimensional submanifold with boundary that can be isometrically embedded in $\mathbb{R}^3$ is dense in the space of compact metric pairs. Finally, to broaden the scope of potential applications, we describe scenarios where the Gromov--Hausdorff distance between metric pairs or tuples naturally arises.</description>

      <title>Minkowski-Weyl theorem and Gordan's lemma up to symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate equivariant analogues of the Minkowski--Weyl theorem and Gordan's lemma in an infinite-dimensional setting, where cones and monoids are invariant under the action of the infinite symmetric group. Building upon the framework developed earlier, we extend the theory beyond the nonnegative case. Our main contributions include a local equivariant Minkowski--Weyl theorem, local-global principles for equivariant finite generation and stabilization of symmetric cones, and a full proof of the equivariant Gordan's lemma. We also classify non-pointed symmetric cones and non-positive symmetric normal monoids, addressing new challenges in the general setting.</description>

      <title>A local isoperimetric inequality for balls with nonpositive curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that small perturbations of the metric of a ball in Euclidean n-space to metrics with nonpositive curvature do not reduce the isoperimetric ratio. Furthermore, the isoperimetric ratio is preserved only if the perturbation corresponds to a homothety of the ball. These results establish a sharp local version of the Cartan-Hadamard conjecture.</description>

      <title>On the Structure of Frames and Equiangular Lines over Finite Fields and their Connections to Design Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper concerns frames and equiangular lines over finite fields. We find a necessary and sufficient condition for systems of equiangular lines over finite fields to be equiangular tight frames (ETFs). As is the case over subfields of $\mathbb{C}$, it is necessary for the Welch bound to be saturated, but there is an additional condition required involving sums of triple products. We also prove that similar to the case over $\mathbb{C}$, collections of vectors are similar to a regular simplex essentially when the triple products of their scalar products satisfy a certain property. Finally, we investigate switching equivalence classes of frames and systems of lines focusing on systems of equiangular lines in finite orthogonal geometries with maximal incoherent sets, drawing connections to combinatorial design theory.</description>

      <title>On singularity of $p$-energy measures on metric measure spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For $p\in(1,+\infty)$, we prove that for a $p$-energy on a metric measure space, under the volume doubling condition, the conjunction of the Poincar\'e inequality and the cutoff Sobolev inequality both with $p$-walk dimension strictly larger than $p$ implies the singularity of the associated $p$-energy measure with respect to the underlying measure. We also prove that under the slow volume regular condition, the conjunction of the Poincar\'e inequality and the cutoff Sobolev inequality is equivalent to the resistance estimate. As a direct corollary, on a large family of fractals and metric measure spaces, including the Sierpi\'nski gasket and the Sierpi\'nski carpet, we obtain the singularity of the $p$-energy measure with respect to the underlying measure for all $p$ strictly great than the Ahlfors regular conformal dimension.</description>

      <title>On the $m$th order $p$-affine capacity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $M_{n, m}(\mathbb{R})$ denote the space of $n\times m$ real matrices, and $\mathcal{K}_o^{n,m}$ be the set of convex bodies in $M_{n, m}(\mathbb{R})$ containing the origin. We develop a theory for the $m$th order $p$-affine capacity $C_{p,Q}(\cdot)$ for $p\in[1,n)$ and $Q\in\mathcal{K}_{o}^{1,m}$. Several equivalent definitions for the $m$th order $p$-affine capacity will be provided, and some of its fundamental properties will be proved, including for example, translation invariance and affine invariance. We also establish several inequalities related to the $m$th order $p$-affine capacity, including those comparing to the $p$-variational capacity, the volume, the $m$th order $p$-integral affine surface area, as well as the $L_p$ surface area.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we solve the even capillary $L_p$-Minkowski problem for the range $-n &lt; p &lt; 1$ and $\theta \in (0,\frac{\pi}{2})$. Our approach is based on an iterative scheme that builds on the solution to the capillary Minkowski problem (i.e., the case $p = 1$) and leverages the monotonicity of a class of functionals under a family of capillary curvature image operators. These operators are constructed so that their fixed points, whenever they exist, correspond precisely to solutions of the capillary $L_p$-Minkowski problem.</description>

      <title>Measure contraction property, curvature exponent and geodesic dimension of sub-Finsler $\ell^p$-Heisenberg groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.16722v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We initiate the study of synthetic curvature-dimension bounds in sub-Finsler geometry. More specifically, we investigate the measure contraction property $\mathsf{MCP}(K, N)$, and the geodesic dimension on the Heisenberg group equipped with an $\ell^p$-sub-Finsler norm. We show that for $p\in(2,\infty]$, the $\ell^p$-Heisenberg group fails to satisfy any of the measure contraction properties. On the other hand, if $p\in(1,2)$, then it satisfies the measure contraction property $\mathsf{MCP}(K, N)$ if and only if $K \leq 0$ and $N \geq N_p$, where the curvature exponent $N_p$ is strictly greater than $2q+1$ ($q$ being the H\"older conjugate of $p$). We also prove that the geodesic dimension of the $\ell^p$-Heisenberg group is $\min(2q+2,5)$ for $p\in[1,\infty)$. As a consequence, we provide the first example of a metric measure space where there is a gap between the curvature exponent and the geodesic dimension.</description>

      <title>Vietoris-Rips Complexes of Split-Decomposable Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15655v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Split-metric decompositions are an important tool in the theory of phylogenetics, particularly because of the link between the tight span and the class of totally decomposable spaces, a generalization of metric trees whose decomposition does not have a ``prime'' component. Their close relationship with trees makes totally decomposable spaces attractive in the search for spaces whose persistent homology can be computed efficiently. We study the subclass of circular decomposable spaces, finite metrics that resemble subsets of $\mathbb{S}^1$ and can be recognized in quadratic time. We give an $O(n^2)$ characterization of the circular decomposable spaces whose Vietoris-Rips complexes are cyclic for all distance parameters, and compute their homotopy type using well-known results on $\mathbb{S}^1$. We extend this result to a recursive formula that computes the homology of certain circular decomposable spaces that fail the previous characterization. Going beyond totally decomposable spaces, we identify an $O(n^3)$ decomposition of $\mathrm{VR}_r(X)$ in terms of the blocks of the tight span of $X$, and use it to induce a direct-sum decomposition of the homology of $\mathrm{VR}_r(X)$.</description>

      <title>Radii of Euclidean sections of $\ell_p$-balls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15118v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The celebrated Dvoretzky theorem asserts that every $N$-dimensional convex body admits central sections of dimension $d = \Omega(\log N)$, which is nearly spherical. For many instances of convex bodies, typically unit balls with respect to some norm, much better lower bounds on $d$ have been obtained, with most research focusing on such lower bounds and on the degree of approximation of the section by a $d$-dimensional Euclidean ball. In this note we concentrate on another parameter, namely the radius of the approximating ball. We focus on the case of the unit ball of the space $\ell_1^N$ (the so-called cross-polytope), which is relevant to various questions of interest in theoretical computer science. We will also survey other instances where similar questions for other normed spaces (most often $\ell_p$-spaces or their non-commutative analogues) were found relevant to problems in various areas of mathematics and its applications, and state some open problems. Finally, in view of the computer science ramifications, we will comment on the algorithmic aspects of finding nearly spherical sections.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09200v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study the class of so called `ball-bodies' in ${\mathbb R}^n$, given by intersections of translates of Euclidean unit balls (or, equivalently, summand of the Euclidean ball). We study the class along with the natural duality operator defined on it. The class is naturally linked to many interesting problems in convex geometry, including bodies of constant width and the Knesser-Poulsen conjecture. We discuss old and new inequalities of isoperimetric type and of Santal\'{o} type, in this class. We study the boundary structure of bodies in the class, Carath\'eodory type theorem and curvature relations. We discuss various symmetrizations with relation to this class, and make some first steps regarding problems for bodies of constant width.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04118v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, a notion of the free product $X \ast Y$ of two metric spaces $X$ and $Y$ has been introduced by T. Fukaya and T. Matsuka. In this paper, we study coarse geometric permanence properties of the free product $X \ast Y$. We show that if $X$ and $Y$ satisfy any of the following conditions, then $X \ast Y$ also satisfies that condition: (1) they are coarsely embeddable into a Hilbert space or a uniformly convex Banach space; (2) they have Yu's Property A; (3) they are hyperbolic spaces. These generalize the corresponding results for discrete groups to the case of metric spaces.</description>
