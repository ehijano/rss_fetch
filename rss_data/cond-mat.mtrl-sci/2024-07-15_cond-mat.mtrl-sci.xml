      <title>Machine Learning Based Prediction of Proton Conductivity in Metal-Organic Frameworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have demonstrated their potential as solid-state electrolytes in proton exchange membrane fuel cells. However, the number of MOFs reported to exhibit proton conductivity remains limited, and the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are not fully elucidated, complicating the design of proton-conductive MOFs. In response, we developed a comprehensive database of proton-conductive MOFs and applied machine learning techniques to predict their proton conductivity. Our approach included the construction of both descriptor-based and transformer-based models. Notably, the transformer-based transfer learning (Freeze) model performed the best with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.91, suggesting that the proton conductivity of MOFs can be estimated within one order of magnitude using this model. Additionally, we employed feature importance and principal component analysis to explore the factors influencing proton conductivity. The insights gained from our database and machine learning model are expected to facilitate the targeted design of proton-conductive MOFs.</description>

      <title>Fast ion diffraction of protons on NaCl, the discovery of GIFAD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grazing incidence fast atom diffraction (GIFAD or FAD) has become a technique to track the surface topology of crystal surface at the atomic scale. The paper retraces the events that led to the discovery of unexpected quantum behavior of keV atoms during the thesis of Patrick Rousseau in Orsay and Andreas Schueller in Berlin. In Orsay, it started by diffraction spots whereas in Berlin supernumerary rainbows were first identified at keV. Though the discovery was not anticipated, it did not take place by accident, everything was in place several years before, waiting only for an interest in neutral projectiles with a touch of curiosity.</description>

      <title>Numerical Investigation of Optimal Buffer Layer and Performance Evaluation on CdTe Solar Cell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the critical role of buffer layers in enhancing the efficiency of thin-film CdTe solar cells. We explore non-toxic buffer materials, specifically ZnSe, ZnMgO, 3C-SiC, and WS2, as potential replacements for the traditional Cd-based CdS buffer layer. Our analysis includes a thorough evaluation of the electrical and optical performance of these buffer materials in conjunction with CdTe absorbers. We optimize the thickness of both the buffer and absorber layers to achieve the best performance. Additionally, we examine the impact of defect density variations in the buffer materials and their corresponding temperature effects. Among the tested materials, ZnSe and ZnMgO demonstrate the highest potential, achieving power conversion efficiencies of 20.74% and 20.73%, respectively.</description>

      <title>Structural Features of Quasicrystalline Nanoparticles With Seventh-Order Rotational Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we present atomic models of nanoparticles exhibiting seventh-order rotational symmetry. We established that the point group symmetry of these objects corresponds to the dihedral group D7v. To gain a deeper understanding of their structure, we performed calculations of the pair radial distribution function of the atoms. This data, along with the diffraction patterns derived from dual quasicrystals, indicates that quasicrystals have a distinct and pronounced diffraction pattern, confirming their crystalline nature and atomic-level orderliness. Furthermore, analysis of the spatial arrangement of atoms from the center to the periphery revealed that the atomic density within these nanoparticles is inhomogeneous. Specifically, there is a noticeable decrease in atomic density as one moves from the center of the crystal towards its periphery.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Electron Dynamics Simulations through Machine Learned Time Propagators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) is a widely used method to investigate electron dynamics under various external perturbations such as laser fields. In this work, we present a novel approach to accelerate real time TDDFT based electron dynamics simulations using autoregressive neural operators as time-propagators for the electron density. By leveraging physics-informed constraints and high-resolution training data, our model achieves superior accuracy and computational speed compared to traditional numerical solvers. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on a class of one-dimensional diatomic molecules. This method has potential in enabling real-time, on-the-fly modeling of laser-irradiated molecules and materials with varying experimental parameters.</description>

      <title>On Exchange-Correlation Energy in DFT Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the considerable importance of material properties in modern condensed matter physics research, and using techniques of the $N_{e}$ -electron systems in terms of the electron density $n_{\sigma e}\left( r\right) $ needed to obtain the ground-state energy $E_{e}$ in Density Functional Theory scenarios, we approach the Exchange-Correlation energy $ E_{xc}\left[ n_{\sigma e}(r)\right] $ by considering the interelectronic position corrections $\Delta r_{x}^{\uparrow \uparrow ,\uparrow \downarrow }=\lambda _{x}\left\vert \delta r^{\uparrow \uparrow }-\delta r^{\uparrow \downarrow }\right\vert $ and $\Delta r_{c}^{e_{i}e_{j\neq i}}=\lambda _{c}\left\vert r-r^{\prime }\right\vert ^{-\left( N_{e}-1\right) ^{-1}}$ corresponding to the spin and the Coulomb correlation effects, respectively, through the electron-electron potential energy. Exploiting such corrections, we get approximate expressions for the exchange $E_{x}\left[ n_{\sigma e} \right] $ and the correlation $E_{c}\left[ n_{\sigma e}\right] $ functional energies which could be interpreted in terms of magnetic and electric dipole potential energies associated with the charge density $n_{\sigma e}\left( r\right) $ described by inverse-square potential behaviors. Based on these arguments, we expect that such obtained Exchange-Correlation functional energy could be considered in the Local Density Approximation functional as an extension to frame such interelectronic effects.</description>

      <title>Accelerating High-Throughput Phonon Calculations via Machine Learning Universal Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phonons play a critical role in determining various material properties, but conventional methods for phonon calculations are computationally intensive, limiting their broad applicability. In this study, we present an approach to accelerate high-throughput harmonic phonon calculations using machine learning universal potentials. We train a state-of-the-art machine learning interatomic potential, based on multi-atomic cluster expansion (MACE), on a comprehensive dataset of 2,738 crystal structures with 77 elements, totaling 15,670 supercell structures, computed using high-fidelity density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Our approach significantly reduces the number of required supercells for phonon calculations while maintaining high accuracy in predicting harmonic phonon properties across diverse materials. The trained model is validated against phonon calculations for a held-out subset of 384 materials, achieving a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.18 THz for vibrational frequencies from full phonon dispersions, 2.19 meV/atom for Helmholtz vibrational free energies at 300K, as well as a classification accuracy of 86.2% for dynamical stability of materials. A thermodynamic analysis of polymorphic stability in 126 systems demonstrates good agreement with DFT results at 300 K and 1000 K. In addition, the diverse and extensive high-quality DFT dataset curated in this study serves as a valuable resource for researchers to train and improve other machine learning interatomic potential models.</description>

      <title>Ferroelectric AlBN Films by Molecular Beam Epitaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the properties of molecular beam epitaxy deposited AlBN thin films on a recently developed epitaxial nitride metal electrode Nb2N. While a control AlN thin film exhibits standard capacitive behavior, distinct ferroelectric switching is observed in the AlBN films with increasing Boron mole fraction. The measured remnant polarization Pr of 15 uC/cm2 and coercive field Ec of 1.45 MV/cm in these films are smaller than those recently reported on films deposited by sputtering, due to incomplete wake-up, limited by current leakage. Because AlBN preserves the ultrawide energy bandgap of AlN compared to other nitride hi-K dielectrics and ferroelectrics, and it can be epitaxially integrated with GaN and AlN semiconductors, its development will enable several opportunities for unique electronic, photonic, and memory devices.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of piezoelectric properties in a narrow cerium doping range of $\text{Ba}_{1-x}\text{Ca}_{x}\text{Ti}_{1-y}\text{Zr}_{y}\text{O}_{3}$ evidenced by high throughput experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lead-free materials based on the $\text{(Ba,Ca)(Zr,Ti)O}_{3}$ (BCZT) system exhibit excellent electromechanical properties that can be strongly modified by small amounts of dopants. Here, we use a high throughput strategy to unravel the influence of aliovalent doping with Ce on dielectric and piezoelectric properties of BCTZ. We synthesize and characterize a single BCTZ thin film with a composition gradient from undoped to 0.2 mol % cerium doping. The cerium doping increases the piezoelectric coefficient from $42.3\pm 2.9 \text{pm V}^{-1}$ (undoped) to $63\pm 2.4 \text{pm V}^{-1}$ for 0.06 Ce-mol\%, and then decreases to $38.4 \pm 1.3 \text{pm V}^{-1}$ for the maximum amount of cerium (0.2 mol %). An investigation of sub-coercive field non-linearities reveal that these variations are not only induced by changes in dynamics and densities of domain walls. The results highlight the advantage of high throughput techniques to identify ideal compositions for applications, without synthesizing a high number of samples with unavoidable sample-to-sample variations.</description>

      <title>Interatomic spin-orbit coupling in atomic orbital-based tight-binding models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interatomic hopping mediated by spin-orbit coupling (SOC) entangles spin, orbital and sublattice degrees of freedom of electrons, leading to the emergence of intriguing phenomena such as novel topological insulators and exotic spin-dependent transport including chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS). Despite these effects, a comprehensive microscopic formalism to describe the spin-dependent hopping remains insufficiently established. In this study, we systematically investigate SOC hopping by analytically deriving the hopping integrals within a two-center approximation based on atomic orbitals. Introducing independent parameters, or extended Slater-Koster symbols, that characterize SOC hopping, we explicitly determine the form of the hopping for $s$, $p$ and $d$ orbitals in the arbitrary hopping directions. Our formalism is then implemented in tight-binding models on several lattices. Furthermore, we examine the effect of SOC on band dispersion by employing a multipole decomposition for the SOC Hamiltonian, providing a fundamental understanding of SOC-induced phenomena. In particular, we derive an explicit expression for the SOC Hamiltonian that causes unique spin splitting in chiral systems by considering a triangular helical chain. Most importantly, the obtained SOC Hamiltonian does not contain a term that has the symmetry of electric toroidal monopole $G_0$ but rather an electric toroidal quadrupole $G_u$, which is the origin of chirality in this case.</description>

      <title>MX precipitate behavior in an irradiated advanced Fe-9Cr steel: Self-ion irradiation effects on phase stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reduced activation ferritic/martensitic (RAFM) steels are the leading candidate structural materials for first-wall and blanket components in fusion reactors. This work is the first in a series to provide a systematic roadmap of MX precipitate stability in RAFM steels under various ion irradiation conditions. Here, the MX-TiC precipitate behavior in an advanced Fe-9Cr RAFM steel is assessed under self-ion irradiation to damage levels ranging from 1 to 100 displacements per atom (dpa) at temperatures ranging from 300-600{\deg}C to isolate the effects of temperature and damage level on precipitate stability. The pre-existing MX-TiC precipitates are shown to exhibit temperature-dominated responses, including coarsening above 400{\deg}C at damage levels of 15 dpa, while damage levels studied at 50 dpa and higher showed dissolution across all temperature ranges studied. The effects of ballistic dissolution and diffusion on precipitate behavior are outlined as a function of precipitate characteristics (number density, size, and 25 volume fraction) and irradiation parameters with the use of the recoil resolution model of precipitate stability. This work provides critical insights into MX-TiC stability to high dose in-order to further optimize advanced steels with improved radiation resistance.</description>

      <title>Toward a first-principles theory of rare-earth ions in crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Density functional theory (DFT), including its extensions designed to treat strongly correlated localized electron systems such as DFT+$U$ and DFT+dynamical mean field theory, has proven exceedingly useful in studying the magnetic properties of solids. However, materials with rare earths ($R$) have remained a notable exception. The most vital rare-earth magnetic properties, such as magnetocrystalline anisotropy (MA), have been notoriously elusive due to the ubiquitous self-interaction error present in nearly all available DFT flavors. In this work, we show explicitly how the orbital dependence of self-interaction error may contradict Hund's rules and plague MA calculations, and how analyzing DFT metastable states that respect Hund's rules can alleviate the problem. We systematically investigate and discuss several rare-earth-containing families, $R$Co$_5$, $R_2$Fe$_{14}$B, $R$Fe$_{12}$, and $R$Mn$_6$Sn$_6$, to benchmark the MA calculations in DFT+$U$. For all compounds we investigated, we found that our methodology reproduces the magnetic easy-axis, easy-plane, and non-trivial easy-cone anisotropies in full agreement with low-temperature experimental measurements. Besides the fully-numerical ab initio approach, we further illustrate an efficient semi-analytical perturbation method that treats the crystal field as a perturbation in the limit of large spin-orbit coupling. This approach evaluates the rare-earth anisotropy by assessing the dependence of crystal-field energy on spin-quantization axis rotation using $4f$ crystal-field levels obtained from non-spin-orbit calculations. Our analytical method provides a quantitative microscopic understanding of the factors that control MA and can be used for predicting new high-MA materials.</description>

      <title>Electrical Steel: An investigation into the brittleness of the Fe-Si alloy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we'll hunt for ordered crystal structures that may be stable, and that would explain the brittleness of electrical steel. I.e we wish to find crystals with negative formation energy, if it turns out that these structures are very anisotropic that would be an indication of brittleness (as a ductile material will generally be homogeneous). We'll do this by exploiting the advantage that ab initio simulations (done using Quantum ESPRESSO (opEn-Source Package for Research in Electronic Structure, Simulation, and Optimization) give full control over defining the crystal: We'll tell exactly where we want to have every atom, and with DFT we'll calculate the internal energy that corresponds to such a crystal. The whole project is open source on github and as we haven't found the answer yet, everyone who is interested is welcome to contribute.</description>

      <title>The inadequacy of the $\rho$-T curve for phase transitions in the presence of magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $\rho(T)$ curve is traditionally employed to discern metallic, semiconductor, and insulating behaviors in materials, with any deviations often interpreted as indicative of phase transitions. However, does this interpretation hold under the influence of a magnetic field? Our research addresses this critical question by reevaluating the $\rho(T)$ curve in the presence of magnetic field. We uncover that metal-insulator shifts and reentrant metallic states may not indicate true phase transitions but rather originate from the scaling behavior of magnetoresistance, influenced by magnetic field and temperature through a power-law dependence. Employing advanced first-principles calculations and the Boltzmann method, we analyzed the magnetoresistance of SiP$_2$ and NbP across a range of conditions, successfully explaining not only the reentrant behavior observed in experiments but also resolving the discrepancies in magnetoresistance behavior reported by different research groups. These findings challenge the conventional use of the $\rho(T)$ curve as a straightforward indicator of phase transitions under magnetic conditions, highlighting the essential need to exclude typical magnetoresistance effects due to the Lorentz force before confirming such transitions. This novel insight reshapes our understanding of complex material properties in magnetic fields and sets a new precedent for the interpretation of transport phenomena in condensed matter physics.</description>

      <title>Information-entropy-driven generation of material-agnostic datasets for machine-learning interatomic potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In contrast to their empirical counterparts, machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIAPs) promise to deliver near-quantum accuracy over broad regions of configuration space. However, due to their generic functional forms and extreme flexibility, they can catastrophically fail to capture the properties of novel, out-of-sample configurations, making the quality of the training set a determining factor, especially when investigating materials under extreme conditions. In the present study, we propose a novel automated dataset generation method based on the maximization of the information entropy of the feature distribution, aiming at an extremely broad coverage of the configuration space in a way that is agnostic to the properties of specific target materials. The ability of the dataset to capture unique material properties is demonstrated on a range of unary materials, including elements with the fcc (Al), bcc (W), hcp (Be, Re and Os), and graphite (C) ground states. MLIAPs trained to this dataset are shown to be accurate over a broad range of application-relevant metrics, as well as extremely robust over very broad swaths of configurations space, even without dataset fine-tuning or hyper-parameter optimization, making the approach extremely attractive to rapidly and autonomously develop general-purpose MLIAPs suitable for simulations in extreme conditions.</description>

      <title>Second-order topological insulator in Bilayer borophene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the novel topological states, the higher-order topological insulators have attracted great attentions in the past years. However, their realizations in realistic materials, in particular in two dimensional systems, remains the big challenge due to the lack of adequate candidates. Here, based on the first-principle calculation and tight-binding model simulations, we identify the currently \emph{existing} bilayer $\alpha_{5}$-phase borophenes as the two-dimensional second-order topological insulators, protected by the $C_{2}$-rotational symmetry. The formation of interlayer B-B covalent bonds, stabilizing the bilayer borophenes and opening the large direct bulk gaps ($\sim 0.55-0.62$ eV) at Fermi level, plays the key roles. The second-order topology is characterized by the bulk quantized quadrupole momentum. Our results enriches the candidates for the second-order topological insulators, and also provide a way to study topological states in borophenes.</description>

      <title>Predicting doping strategies for ternary nickel-cobalt-manganese cathode materials to enhance battery performance using graph neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exceptional electrochemical performance of lithium-ion batteries has spurred considerable interest in advanced battery technologies, particularly those utilizing ternary nickel-cobalt-manganese (NCM) cathode materials, which are renowned for their robust electrochemical performance and structural stability. Building upon this research, investigators have explored doping additional elements into NCM cathode materials to further enhance their electrochemical performance and structural integrity. However, the multitude of doping strategies available for NCM battery systems presents a challenge in determining the most effective approach. In this study, we elucidate the potential of ternary NCM systems as cathode materials for lithium-ion batteries. We compile a comprehensive database of lithium-ion batteries employing NCM systems from various sources of prior research and develop a corresponding data-driven model utilizing graph neural networks to predict optimal doping strategies. Our aim is to provide insights into the NCM-based battery systems for both fundamental understanding and practical applications.</description>

      <title>Crosslinking degree variations enable programming and controlling soft fracture via sideways cracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large deformations of soft materials are customarily associated with strong constitutive and geometrical nonlinearities that originate new modes of fracture. Some isotropic materials can develop strong fracture anisotropy, which manifests as modifications of the crack path. Sideways cracking occurs when the crack deviates to propagate in the loading direction, rather than perpendicular to it. This fracture mode results from higher resistance to propagation perpendicular to the principal stretch direction. It has been demonstrated that such fracture anisotropy is related to the microstructural stretch of the polymer chains, also known as strain crystallization mechanisms. However, the precise variation of the fracture behavior with the degree of crosslinking is not fully understood. Leveraging experiments and computational simulations, here we show that the tendency of a crack to propagate sideways in the two component Elastosil P7670 increases with the degree of crosslinking. We explore the mixing ratio for the synthesis of the elastomer that establishes the transition from forward to sideways fracturing. To assist the investigations, we construct a novel phase-field model for fracture where the critical energy release rate is directly related to the crosslinking degree. Our results demonstrate that fracture anisotropy can be programmed during the synthesis of the polymer. Then, we propose a roadmap with composite soft structures with low- and high-crosslinked phases that allow for control over fracture, arresting and/or directing the fracture. By extending our computational framework as a virtual testbed, we capture the fracture performance of the composite samples and enable predictions based on more intricate composite unit cells. Overall, our work offers promising avenues for enhancing the fracture toughness of soft polymers.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Nanoscale Phase Decomposition in Laser Ablation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Femtosecond laser ablation is a process that bears both fundamental physics interest and has wide industrial applications. For decades, the lack of probes on the relevant time and length scales has prevented access to the highly nonequilibrium phase decomposition processes triggered by laser excitation. Enabled by the unprecedented intense femtosecond X-ray pulses delivered by an X-ray free electron laser, we report here results of time-resolved small angle scattering measurements on the dynamics of nanoscale phase decomposition in thin gold films upon femtosecond laser-induced ablation. By analyzing the features imprinted onto the small angle diffraction patterns, the transient heterogeneous density distributions within the ablation plume as obtained from molecular dynamics simulations get direct experimental confirmation.</description>

      <title>Interplay of altermagnetism and pressure in hexagonal and orthorhombic MnTe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alternative magnetic materials or ``altermagnets", characterized by their non-relativistic, momentum-dependent spin-split states, represent a cutting-edge advancement in the field of magnetism, offering promising avenues for spintronic applications. Among these materials, hexagonal MnTe has emerged as a standout material candidate for its substantial spin-splitting. In this study, employing first-principles electronic structure calculations and spin group symmetry analysis, we delve into the interplay of altermagnetism and pressure in two main phases of MnTe. Our relativistic calculations demonstrate the presence of tunable anomalous Hall effect (AHE) in hexagonal MnTe. In addition, our results underscore the pivotal role of pressure as a tuning parameter for the alternative magnetic traits in the system. Furthermore, we identify another phase of MnTe with orthorhombic structure, namely $\gamma$-MnTe, hosting altermagnetic characteristics. We study, in detail, its response in AHE and spin-spliting due to magnetization and pressure variations, respectively. Our study highlights the substantial impact of pressure on the properties of alternative magnetic materials, particularly emphasizing the pronounced tuning effect observed in the hexagonal and orthorhombic MnTe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Humanity has long sought inspiration from nature to innovate materials and devices. As science advances, nature-inspired materials are becoming part of our lives. Animate materials, characterized by their activity, adaptability, and autonomy, emulate properties of living systems. While only biological materials fully embody these principles, artificial versions are advancing rapidly, promising transformative impacts across various sectors. This roadmap presents authoritative perspectives on animate materials across different disciplines and scales, highlighting their interdisciplinary nature and potential applications in diverse fields including nanotechnology, robotics and the built environment. It underscores the need for concerted efforts to address shared challenges such as complexity management, scalability, evolvability, interdisciplinary collaboration, and ethical and environmental considerations. The framework defined by classifying materials based on their level of animacy can guide this emerging field encouraging cooperation and responsible development. By unravelling the mysteries of living matter and leveraging its principles, we can design materials and systems that will transform our world in a more sustainable manner.</description>

      <title>Automated high-resolution backscattered-electron imaging at macroscopic scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) has been widely utilized in the field of materials science due to its significant advantages, such as large depth of field, wide field of view, and excellent stereoscopic imaging. However, at high magnification, the limited imaging range in SEM cannot cover all the possible inhomogeneous microstructures. In this research, we propose a novel approach for generating high-resolution SEM images across multiple scales, enabling a single image to capture physical dimensions at the centimeter level while preserving submicron-level details. We adopted the SEM imaging on the AlCoCrFeNi2.1 eutectic high entropy alloy (EHEA) as an example. SEM videos and image stitching are combined to fulfill this goal, and the video-extracted low-definition (LD) images are clarified by a well-trained denoising model. Furthermore, we segment the macroscopic image of the EHEA, and area of various microstructures are distinguished. Combining the segmentation results and hardness experiments, we found that the hardness is positively correlated with the content of body-centered cubic (BCC) phase, negatively correlated with the lamella width, and the relationship with the proportion of lamellar structures was not significant. Our work provides a feasible solution to generate macroscopic images based on SEMs for further analysis of the correlations between the microstructures and spatial distribution, and can be widely applied to other types of microscope.</description>

      <title>From Structural Stability to Electronic Flexibility: Unveiling Strain-induced Effects in a MoS$_2$/Perylene Orange Hybrid System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study delves into the interaction between a monolayer of molybdenum disulfide (MoS$_2$) and a single Perylene Orange (PO) molecule, representative of inorganic and organic semiconductor materials, respectively. Investigation of the amalgamation of these materials under mechanical strains reveals significant alterations in the electronic properties of the MoS$_2$/PO interface. Tensile strain induces a reduction in the bandgap, while compressive strain initially engenders an increase, followed by a subsequent decrease. Notably, MoS$_2$ undergoes a transition from a direct to an indirect bandgap under both stretching and compression conditions. These alterations stem from shifts in the density of states and band structure adjustments resulting from lattice deformations induced by applied strain. Remarkably, under specific compression conditions, the MoS$_2$/PO system manifests a transition between type II and type I band alignments. The detailed analysis of a range of strain magnitudes yields profound insights into the behavior of MoS$_2$ and MoS$_2$/PO systems under mechanical strain, with potential implications for nano- and optoelectronics applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological magnetism has sparked an unprecedented age in quantum technologies. Marked by twisted spin structures with exotic dynamical modes, topological magnets have motivated a new generation of spintronic devices which transcend the limits of conventional semiconductor-based electronics. While existing material probes have biased studies and device conceptualizations for thin samples in two dimensions, advancements in three-dimensional probing techniques using beams of neutrons, are transforming our understanding of topological and emergent physics to reimagine spintronic devices. Here, we review recent neutron scattering breakthroughs which harness quantum degrees of freedom to enable three-dimensional topological investigations of quantum materials. We discuss applications of structured and tomographic neutron scattering techniques to topological magnets, with particular emphasis on magnetic skyrmion systems and their inspired three-dimensional logic device infrastructures through novel multi-bit encoding and control schemes. SANS-based dynamic visualizations and coherent manipulations of three-dimensional topological qubits are proposed using electric field controls of depth-dependant helicities and spin-orbit tuning of the neutron beam. Together, these investigations uncover a new world of three-dimensional topological physics which enhances spintronic devices through a novel set of structures, dynamics, and controls, unique to three-dimensional systems.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic Response Theory with Relativistic Corrections: Selfconsistency and Validity of Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Schr\"odinger-Pauli equation (SP-eq) derived from weakly relativistic approximation (WRA) of Dirac eq, combined with Electromagnetic (EM) field Lagrangian for variational principle, is expected to give a new level of EM response theory. A complete process of this formulation within the second order WRA is given, with explicit forms of charge and current densities, $\rho , \vec{J}$, and electric and magnetic polarizations, $\vec{P}$, $\vec{M}$ containing correction terms. They fulfill, not only the continuity equation, but also the relations $\nabla \cdot \vec{P}=-\rho, \ \partial \vec{P}/\partial t + c \nabla \times \vec{M} = \vec{J}$, known in the classical EM theory for the corresponding macroscopic variables. This theory should be able to describe all the EM responses within the second order WRA, and the least necessary variables are ${\phi, \vec{A}, \rho, \vec{J}}$ (six independent components). From this viewpoint, there emerges a problem about the use of "spin current" popularly discussed in spintronics, because it does not belong to the group of least necessary variables.</description>

      <title>The Drude weight of a flatband metal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flatband systems form a new class of materials with seemingly contradictory properties that challenge our understanding of their transport phenomenology. On the one hand, the large density of states at the chemical potential suggests a metallic behavior. On the other hand, all states have a vanishing velocity that essentially prevents transport. Furthermore, electronic correlation effects are intrinsically strong as the interaction energy scale naturally exceeds the narrow or vanishing bandwidth. In this work, we determine the conductivity of flatband systems by investigating their Drude weight, thereby avoiding issues associated with a particular choice of relaxation broadening. Our study is a controlled analytic treatment performed at temperatures above the bandwidth and the interaction strength and below the bandgap, a new distinctive transport regime for flat bands. We find that the Drude weight has geometric contributions that are unique to a perfectly flat band and are beyond the commonly studied quantum metric and Berry curvature. We expect that these novel contributions are essential in determining flatband response functions and shed new light on the stability of flatband systems.</description>

      <title>Role of symmetry in the correlated orientational disorder phase of entropic crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Correlated orientational disordered phase is a thermodynamic phase with the constituent particles following some conserved laws or correlation despite the orientational disorder present in the system. Polyhedral particles in the presence of hard interaction serve the purpose of studying the orientational disorder in entropy driven self-assembly. We report the computational evidence of the role of symmetry of both particle and self-assembled crystal in the single-component system of anisotropic polyhedra in the correlated orientational disordered phase. The point groups of the particle and crystal structure appear to make a direct correspondence with the existence of multiple unique orientations of the system satisfying all the orientational conserved quantities towards the correlation. As a signature of correlation, the system exhibits orientationally frozen state at sufficiently higher packing fractions and discrete orientational hopping of the particles are observed at comparatively lower density solids. This symmetry relationship appears to control all the aspects of orientational correlation in the crystalline solids which might be useful to draw fundamental insights about the disordered crystalline solids with orientational correlation as well as designing the disorder in the crystals.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the first version of GPU4PySCF, a module that provides GPU acceleration of methods in PySCF. As a core functionality, this provides a GPU implementation of two-electron repulsion integrals (ERIs) for contracted basis sets comprising up to g functions using Rys quadrature. As an illustration of how this can accelerate a quantum chemistry workflow, we describe how to use the ERIs efficiently in the integral-direct Hartree-Fock Fock build and nuclear gradient construction. Benchmark calculations show a significant speedup of two orders of magnitude with respect to the multi-threaded CPU Hartree-Fock code of PySCF, and performance comparable to other GPU-accelerated quantum chemical packages including GAMESS and QUICK on a single NVIDIA A100 GPU.</description>

      <title>Buffer-less Gallium Nitride High Electron Mobility Heterostructures on Silicon</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thick metamorphic buffers are perceived to be indispensable for the heteroepitaxial integration of III-V semiconductors on silicon substrates with large thermal expansion and lattice mismatches. However, III-nitride buffers in conventional GaN-on-Si high electron mobility transistor (HEMT) heterostructures impose a substantial thermal resistance, throttling heat extraction, which reduces device efficiency and lifetime. Herein, bypassing the buffer, we demonstrate the direct growth of GaN after the AlN nucleation layer on silicon by metal-organic vapor phase epitaxy (MOVPE). By varying reactor pressure, we modulate the growth stress in the submicron epilayers and realise threading dislocation densities similar to that in thick buffered structures. We achieve a GaN-to-substrate thermal resistance of (11(+/-)4) ((m^2)K(GW^-1)), an order of magnitude reduction over conventional designs on silicon and one of the lowest on any non-native substrate. AlGaN/AlN/GaN heterojunctions on this platform show a characteristic 2D electron gas (2DEG), the room-temperature Hall-effect mobility of which, at over 2000 (cm^2/(V-s)), rivals the best-reported values. The low-temperature magnetoresistance of this 2DEG shows clear Shubnikov-de-Haas oscillations, a quantum lifetime &gt; 0.180 ps, and tell-tale signatures of spin-splitting. These results may establish a new paradigm for nitride HEMTs, potentially accelerating applications from energy-efficient transistors to fundamental investigations on electron dynamics in this 2D wide-bandgap system.</description>

      <title>Lattice-guided growth of dense arrays of aligned transition metal dichalcogenide nanoribbons with high catalytic reactivity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) exhibit unique properties and potential applications when reduced to one-dimensional (1D) nanoribbons (NRs), owing to quantum confinement and high edge densities. However, effective growth methods for self-aligned TMD NRs are still lacking. We demonstrate a versatile approach for the lattice-guided growth of dense, aligned TMD NR arrays via chemical vapor deposition (CVD) on anisotropic sapphire substrates, without the need for tailored surface steps. This method enables the synthesis of NRs with widths below 10 nm, with their longitudinal axis parallel to the zigzag direction. The growth is influenced by both the substrate and CVD temperature, indicating the role of anisotropic precursor diffusion and substrate interaction. The 1D nature of the NRs was asserted by the observation of Coulomb blockade at low temperature. Pronounced catalytic activity was observed at the edges of the NRs, indicating their promise for efficient catalysis.</description>

Abstract: Quantum magnets based on honeycomb lattices with low-coordination number offer a viable ground to realize exotic emergent quantum excitations and phenomena arising from the interplay between competing magnetic interactions, spin correlations, and spatial anisotropy. However, unlike their low-spin analogues, high-spin honeycomb lattice antiferromagnets have remained comparatively less explored in the context of capturing the classical analogs of quantum phenomena. Herein, we report the crystal structure, magnetic susceptibility, specific heat, and electron spin resonance (ESR), complemented by ab initio density functional theory (DFT) calculations on polycrystalline samples of FeP3SiO11 wherein the Fe3+ ions decorate a nearly-perfect S = 5/2 honeycomb lattice without any site disorder among constituent atoms. Above 150 K, an antiferromagnetic Weiss temperature of - 12 K is observed consistent with DFT calculations, which suggest the presence of strong intra-planar nearest-neighbor and weaker inter-planar further nearest-neighbor exchange interactions. An anomaly at TN = 3.5 K in specific heat and magnetic susceptibility reveals the presence of a long-range ordered ground state in zero field. Above TN, ESR evidences short-range spin correlations and unsaturated magnetic entropy, while below TN unconventional excitations are seen via power-law specific heat. A spin-flop transition is observed in an applied field of Hc1 = 0.2 T. At higher applied fields, TN is gradually suppressed down to zero at Hc2 = 5.6 T with a 2D critical exponent 0.255. Above Hc2, a broad maximum in specific heat due to gapped magnon excitations indicates the emergence of an interesting nearly-polarized state dressed by a disordered state in the honeycomb lattice antiferromagnet FeP3SiO11.</description>

      <title>Non-Bloch band theory for time-modulated discrete mechanical systems</title>

Abstract: This study establishes a non-Bloch band theory for time-modulated discrete mechanical systems. We consider simple mass-spring chains whose stiffness is periodically modulated in time. Using the temporal Floquet theory, the system is characterized by linear algebraic equations in terms of Fourier coefficients. This allows us to employ a standard linear eigenvalue analysis. Unlike non-modulated linear systems, the time modulation makes the coefficient matrix non-Hermitian, which gives rise to, for example, parametric resonance, non-reciprocal wave transmission, and non-Hermitian skin effects. In particular, we study finite-length chains consisting of spatially periodic mass-spring units and show that the standard Bloch band theory is not valid for estimating their eigenvalue distribution. To remedy this, we propose a non-Bloch band theory based on a generalized Brillouin zone. The proposed theory is verified by some numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Inferior interfacial superconductivity in 1 UC FeSe/SrVO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ with screened interfacial electron-phonon coupling</title>

Abstract: Monolayer FeSe/TiO$_x$ and FeSe/FeO$_x$ interfaces exhibit significant superconductivity enhancement compared to bulk FeSe, with interfacial electron-phonon coupling (EPC) playing a crucial role. However, the reduced dimensionality in monolayer FeSe, which may drive superconducting fluctuations, complicates the understanding of the enhancement mechanisms. Here we construct a new superconducting interface: monolayer FeSe/SrVO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$, in which the itinerant electrons of highly metallic SrVO$_3$ films can screen all the high-energy Fuchs-Kliewer phonons, including those of SrTiO$_3$, making it the first FeSe/oxide system with screened interfacial EPC while maintaining the monolayer FeSe thickness. Despite comparable doping levels, the heavily electron-doped monolayer FeSe/SrVO$_3$ exhibits a lower pairing temperature ($T_\mathrm{g}$ $\sim$ 48 K) than FeSe/SrTiO$_3$ and FeSe/LaFeO$_3$. Our findings disentangle the contributions of interfacial EPC from dimensionality on enhancing $T_\mathrm{g}$ in FeSe/oxide interfaces, underscoring the importance of interfacial EPC in $T_\mathrm{g}$ enhancement. This FeSe/VO$_x$ interface also provides a platform for studying the interfacial superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Abnormal planar Hall effect in quasi-1D Kondo chain CeCo$_2$Ga$_8$ and its implications for hybridization dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The process how heavy-electron state is established in Kondo-lattice compounds remains an unsolved issue. Recent angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and ultrafast optical spectroscopy imply an intermediate regime with hybridization fluctuations prior to the establishment of Kondo coherence, which appears at odds with traditional transport measurements. Extensive experimental works are highly demanded to both reconcile this dichotomy and delineate the intrinsic features in this special regime. Here, on the example of quasi-one-dimensional Kondo lattice compound CeCo$_2$Ga$_8$, we investigated angular dependent magnetotransport properties by planar Hall effect and planar anisotropic magnetoresistance measurements. Upon cooling from $T_K^{on}$ (an onset of incoherent Kondo scattering ) to below $T^*$ (where coherent $c$-$f$ hybridization comes into play), the two-fold symmetrical pattern of planar Hall effect changes sign gradually (i.e. $180^\circ$ phase shift); most strikingly, as a crossover, additional oscillations appear and persist until the heavy-electron state is stabilized below $T^*$. These results provide new insights for the regime of hybridization dynamics which might be deemed as a precursor state of the heavy-electron state.</description>

      <title>Measuring kinetic inductance and superfluid stiffness of two-dimensional superconductors using high-quality transmission-line resonators</title>

Abstract: The discovery of van der Waals superconductors in recent years has generated a lot of excitement for their potentially novel pairing mechanisms. However, their typical atomic-scale thickness and micrometer-scale lateral dimensions impose severe challenges to investigations of pairing symmetry by conventional methods. In this report we demonstrate a new technique that employs high-quality-factor superconducting resonators to measure the kinetic inductance -- up to a part per million -- and loss of a van der Waals superconductor. We analyze the equivalent circuit model to extract the kinetic inductance, superfluid stiffness, penetration depth, and ratio of imaginary and real parts of the complex conductivity. We validate the technique by measuring aluminum and finding excellent agreement in both the zero-temperature superconducting gap as well as the complex conductivity data when compared with BCS theory. We then demonstrate the utility of the technique by measuring the kinetic inductance of multi-layered niobium diselenide and discuss the limits to the accuracy of our technique when the transition temperature of the sample, NbSe$_2$ at 7.06 K, approaches our Nb probe resonator at 8.59 K. Our method will be useful for practitioners in the growing fields of superconducting physics, materials science, and quantum sensing, as a means of characterizing superconducting circuit components and studying pairing mechanisms of the novel superconducting states which arise in layered 2D materials and heterostructures.</description>

      <title>AtomAgents: Alloy design and discovery through physics-aware multi-modal multi-agent artificial intelligence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The design of alloys is a multi-scale problem that requires a holistic approach that involves retrieving relevant knowledge, applying advanced computational methods, conducting experimental validations, and analyzing the results, a process that is typically reserved for human experts. Machine learning (ML) can help accelerate this process, for instance, through the use of deep surrogate models that connect structural features to material properties, or vice versa. However, existing data-driven models often target specific material objectives, offering limited flexibility to integrate out-of-domain knowledge and cannot adapt to new, unforeseen challenges. Here, we overcome these limitations by leveraging the distinct capabilities of multiple AI agents that collaborate autonomously within a dynamic environment to solve complex materials design tasks. The proposed physics-aware generative AI platform, AtomAgents, synergizes the intelligence of large language models (LLM) the dynamic collaboration among AI agents with expertise in various domains, including knowledge retrieval, multi-modal data integration, physics-based simulations, and comprehensive results analysis across modalities that includes numerical data and images of physical simulation results. The concerted effort of the multi-agent system allows for addressing complex materials design problems, as demonstrated by examples that include autonomously designing metallic alloys with enhanced properties compared to their pure counterparts. Our results enable accurate prediction of key characteristics across alloys and highlight the crucial role of solid solution alloying to steer the development of advanced metallic alloys. Our framework enhances the efficiency of complex multi-objective design tasks and opens new avenues in fields such as biomedical materials engineering, renewable energy, and environmental sustainability.</description>

Abstract: We develop meanfield approximation and numerical quadrature schemes for the evaluation of Angular-Dependent interatomic Potentials (ADPs) for magnesium and magnesium hydrides at finite temperature (thermalization) and arbitrary atomic molar fractions (mixing) within a non-equilibrium statistical mechanical framework and derive local equilibrium relations. We numerically verify and experimentally validate the accuracy and fidelity of the resulting thermalized/mixed ADPs (TADPs) by means of selected numerical tests including free entropy, heat capacity, thermal expansion, molar volumes, equation of state and elastic constants. We show that the local equilibrium properties predicted by TADPs agree closely with those computed directly from ADP by means of Molecular Dynamics (MD).</description>

      <title>Anomalous resistivity upturn in Co intercalated TaS$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intercalation of magnetic atoms into the van der Waals gaps of layered transition metal dichalcogenides offers an excellent platform to produce exotic physical properties. Here, we report a detailed study of magnetic and electrical transport properties of Co$_{0.28}$TaS$_2$. The temperature dependent resistivity measurements display anomalous upturn below 11 K, which persists in presence of magnetic field even up to 14 T. In the low temperature region, the resistivity upturn exhibits a unique $T^{1/2}$ scaling behavior, which remains unchanged when an external magnetic field is applied. The $T^{1/2}$ dependence of resistivity upturn is the hallmark of non-Fermi liquid state in orbital two-channel Kondo effect(2CK). This anomalous resistivity upturn in Co$_{0.28}$TaS$_2$ can be attributed to the orbital two-channel Kondo mechanism.</description>

Abstract: We present a new theory for partitioning simulations of periodic and solid-state systems into physically sound atomic contributions at the level of Kohn-Sham density functional theory. Our theory is based on spatially localized linear combinations of crystalline Gaussian-type orbitals and, as such, capable of exposing local features within periodic electronic structures in a more intuitive and robust manner than alternatives based on the spatial distribution of atomic basis functions alone. Early decomposed cohesive energies of both molecular polymers and different crystalline polymorphs demonstrate how the atomic properties yielded by our theory convincingly align with the expected charge polarization in these systems, also whenever partial charges and Madelung energies may lend themselves somewhat ambiguous to interpretation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultrasonic processing of solidifying metals in additive manufacturing can provide grain refinement and advantageous mechanical properties. However, the specific physical mechanisms of microstructural refinement relevant to laser-based additive manufacturing have not been directly observed because of sub-millimeter length scales and rapid solidification rates associated with melt pools. Here, high-speed synchrotron X-ray imaging is used to observe the effect of ultrasonic vibration directly on melt pool dynamics and solidification of Al6061 alloy. The high temporal and spatial resolution enabled direct observation of cavitation effects driven by a 20.2 kHz ultrasonic source. We utilized multiphysics simulations to validate the postulated connection between ultrasonic treatment and solidification. The X-ray results show a decrease in melt pool and keyhole depth fluctuations during melting and promotion of pore migration toward the melt pool surface with applied sonication. Additionally, the simulation results reveal increased localized melt pool flow velocity, cooling rates, and thermal gradients with applied sonication. This work shows how ultrasonic treatment can impact melt pools and its potential for improving part quality.</description>

Abstract: Thin Si-doped Al-rich (Al&gt;0.85) regrown Al(Ga)N layers were deposited on AlN on Sapphire template using metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) techniques. The optimization of the deposition conditions such as temperature, V/III ratio, deposition rate, and Si concentration resulted in a high charge carrier concentration (&gt;$10^{15}/cm^{3}$) in the Si-doped Al-rich Al(Ga)N films. A pulsed deposition condition was employed to achieve a controllable Al composition greater than 95% and to prevent unintended Ga incorporation in the AlGaN material deposited using the close-coupled showerhead reactor. Also, the effect of unintentional Si incorporation on free charge carrier concentration at the regrowth interface was observed by varying the thickness of the regrown Al(Ga)N layer. A maximum charge carrier concentration of $4.8\times 10^{16}/cm^3$ and $7.5\times 10^{15}/cm^3$ were achieved for Al0.97Ga0.03N and AlN films with thickness &lt;300 nm compared to previously reported n-Al(Ga)N films with thickness $\ge$400 nm deposited using MOCVD technique.</description>

Abstract: Homogenization is a technique for the analysis of complex materials by replacing them with equivalent homogeneous materials that exhibit similar properties. By constructing a three-dimensional (3D) porous material model and employing homogenization technique, effective properties of the hydrogel pore structure were calculated. It is found that the microstructure of hyperelastic materials has considerable influence on their macroscopic mechanical properties, pores with a radius of up to 65 microns at a small strain can significantly reinforce material structure and improve its fatigue resistance. This work highlights the potential of engineering pore structures for the enhancement of mchanical properties and durability of hydrogels.</description>

Abstract: The Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) is one of the most promising and widely used algorithms for exploiting the capabilities of current Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. However, VQE algorithms suffer from a plethora of issues, such as barren plateaus, local minima, quantum hardware noise, and limited qubit connectivity, thus posing challenges for their successful deployment on hardware and simulators. In this work, we propose a VQE optimization strategy that builds upon recent advances in the literature, and exhibits very shallow circuit depths when applied to the specific system of interest, namely a model Hamiltonian representing a cuprate superconductor. These features make our approach a favorable candidate for generating good ground state approximations on current NISQ devices. Our findings illustrate the potential of VQE algorithmic development for leveraging the full capabilities of NISQ devices.</description>

      <title>Encoded probabilistic imaginary-time evolution on a trapped-ion quantum computer for ground and excited states of spin qubits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we employed a quantum computer to solve a low-energy effective Hamiltonian for spin defects in diamond (so-called NV centre) and wurtzite-type aluminium nitride, which are anticipated to be qubits. The probabilistic imaginary-time evolution (PITE) method, designed for use in a fault-tolerant quantum computer (FTQC) era, was employed to calculate the ground and excited states of the spin singlet state, as represented by the effective Hamiltonian. It is difficult to compute the spin singlet state correctly using density functional theory (DFT), which should be described by multiple Slater determinants. To mitigate the effects of quantum errors inherent in current quantum computers, we implemented a $[[ n+2,n,2 ]]$ quantum error detection (QED) code called the Iceberg code. Despite the inevitable destruction of the encoded state resulting from the measurement of the ancilla qubit at each PITE step, we were able to successfully re-encode and recover the logical success state. In the implementation of the PITE, it was observed that the effective Hamiltonian comprises large components of the diagonal part and a relatively small non-diagonal part, which is frequently the case with quantum chemistry calculations. An efficient implementation of Hamiltonian simulations, in which the diagonal components dominate, was developed on a quantum computer based on the second-order Trotter-Suzuki decomposition. This is the first instance of an encoded PITE circuit being executed on a trapped-ion quantum computer. Our results demonstrate that QED effectively reduces quantum errors and that we successfully obtained both the ground and excited states of the spin singlet state. Our demonstration clearly manifests that Zr$_{\rm Al}$V$_{\rm N}$, Ti$_{\rm Al}$V$_{\rm N}$, and Hf$_{\rm Al}$V$_{\rm N}$ defects have a high potential as spin qubits for quantum sensors.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Density Functional Theory on Lane Formation in Electric-Field-Driven Ionic Mixtures: Flow-Kernel-Based Formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulation and experimental studies have demonstrated non-equilibrium ordering in driven colloidal suspensions: with increasing driving force, a uniform colloidal mixture transforms into a locally demixed state characterized by the lane formation or the emergence of strongly anisotropic stripe-like domains. Theoretically, we have found that a linear stability analysis of density dynamics can explain the non-equilibrium ordering by adding a non-trivial advection term. This advection arises from fluctuating flows due to non-Coulombic interactions associated with oppositely driven migrations. Recent studies based on the dynamical density functional theory (DFT) without multiplicative noise have introduced the flow kernel for providing a general description of the fluctuating velocity. Here, we assess and extend the above deterministic DFT by treating electric-field-driven binary ionic mixtures as the primitive model. First, we develop the stochastic DFT with multiplicative noise for the laning phenomena. The stochastic DFT considering the fluctuating flows allows us to determine correlation functions in a steady state. In particular, asymptotic analysis on the stationary charge-charge correlation function reveals that the above dispersion relation for linear stability analysis is equivalent to the pole equation for determining the oscillatory wavelength of charge--charge correlations. Next, the appearance of stripe-like domains is demonstrated not only by using the pole equation but also by performing the 2D inverse Fourier transform of the charge--charge correlation function without the premise of anisotropic homogeneity in the electric field direction.</description>

      <title>X-ray diffraction reveals the consequences of strong deformation in thin smectic films: dilation and chevron formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Smectic liquid crystals can be viewed as model systems for lamellar structures for which there has been extensive theoretical development. We demonstrate that a nonlinear energy description is required with respect to the usual Landau-de Gennes elasticity in order to explain the observed layer spacing of highly curved smectic layers. Using X-ray diffraction we have quantitatively determined the dilation of bent layers distorted by antagonistic anchoring (as high as 1.8% of dilation for the most bent smectic layers) and accurately described it by the minimal nonlinear expression for energy. We observe a 1{\deg} tilt of planar layers that are connected to the curved layers. This value is consistent with simple energetic calculations, demonstrating how the bending energy impacts the overall structure of a thin distorted smectic film. Finally, we show that combined X-ray measurements and theoretical modeling allow for the quantitative determination of the number of curved smectic layers and of the resulting thickness of the dilated region with unprecedented precision.</description>

      <title>Interlayer and moir\'e excitons in atomically thin double layers: from individual quantum emitters to degenerate ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interlayer excitons (IXs), composed of electron and hole states localized in different layers, excel in bilayers composed of atomically thin van der Waals materials such as semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) due to drastically enlarged exciton binding energies, exciting spin-valley properties, elongated lifetimes, and large permanent dipoles. The latter allows modification by electric fields and the study of thermalized bosonic quasiparticles, from the single particle level to interacting degenerate dense ensembles. Additionally, the freedom to combine bilayers of different van der Waals materials without lattice or relative twist angle constraints leads to layer hybridized and moir\'e excitons which can be widely engineered. This review covers fundamental aspects of IXs including correlation phenomena as well as the consequence of moir\'e superlattices with a strong focus on TMD homo- and hetero-bilayers.</description>

      <title>Magnetic and nematic order of Bose-Fermi mixtures in moir\'e superlattices of 2D semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the magnetic orders in a mixture of Boson (exciton) and Fermion (electron or hole) trapped in transition-metal dichalcogenides moir\'e superlattices. A sizable antiferromagnetic exchange interaction is found between a carrier and an interlayer exciton trapped at different high symmetry points of the moir\'e supercell. This interaction at a distance much shorter than the carrier-carrier separation dominates the magnetic order in the Bose-Fermi mixture, where the carrier sublattice develops ferromagnetism opposite to that in the exciton sublattice. We demonstrate the possibility of increasing the Curie temperature of moir\'e carriers through electrical tuning of the exciton density in the ground state. In a trilayer moir\'e system with a p-n-p type band alignment, the exciton-carrier interplay can establish a layered antiferromagnetism for holes confined in the two outer layers. We further reveal a spontaneous nematic order in the Bose-Fermi mixture, arising from the interference between the Coulomb interaction and p-wave interlayer tunneling dictated by the stacking registry.</description>

      <title>Super-luminal Synthetic Motion with a Space-Time Optical Metasurface</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interaction of light with superluminally moving matter entails unconventional phenomena, from Fresnel drag to Hawking radiation and to light amplification. While relativity makes these effects inaccessible using objects in motion, synthetic motion - enabled via space-time modulated internal degrees of freedom - is free from these constraints. Here we observe synthetic velocity of a reflectivity modulation travelling on an Indium-Tin-Oxide (ITO) interface, generated by ultrafast laser illumination at multiple positions and times. The interaction of the moving reflectivity modulation with a probe light beam acts as a non-separable spatio-temporal transformation that diffracts the light, changing its frequency and momentum content. The recorded frequency-momentum diffraction pattern is defined by the velocity of the diffracted probe wave relative to the modulation. Our experiments open a path towards mimicking relativistic mechanics and developing programmable spatio-temporal transformations of light.</description>

      <title>Rotationally Invariant Latent Distances for Uncertainty Estimation of Relaxed Energy Predictions by Graph Neural Network Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been shown to be astonishingly capable models for molecular property prediction, particularly as surrogates for expensive density functional theory calculations of relaxed energy for novel material discovery. However, one limitation of GNNs in this context is the lack of useful uncertainty prediction methods, as this is critical to the material discovery pipeline. In this work, we show that uncertainty quantification for relaxed energy calculations is more complex than uncertainty quantification for other kinds of molecular property prediction, due to the effect that structure optimizations have on the error distribution. We propose that distribution-free techniques are more useful tools for assessing calibration, recalibrating, and developing uncertainty prediction methods for GNNs performing relaxed energy calculations. We also develop a relaxed energy task for evaluating uncertainty methods for equivariant GNNs, based on distribution-free recalibration and using the Open Catalyst Project dataset. We benchmark a set of popular uncertainty prediction methods on this task, and show that latent distance methods, with our novel improvements, are the most well-calibrated and economical approach for relaxed energy calculations. Finally, we demonstrate that our latent space distance method produces results which align with our expectations on a clustering example, and on specific equation of state and adsorbate coverage examples from outside the training dataset.</description>

      <title>Engineering Efficient Light Sources for Silicon Photonics: III-V Nano-heterostructures Monolithically Grown on Silicon</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The demand for advanced photonics technology is increasing rapidly, fueled by the necessity for high-performance and cost-effective optical information processing systems extending into the quantum domain. Silicon, benefiting from its mature fabrication processes, stands as an ideal platform. However, its inherent indirect bandgap leads to inefficient light emission. To overcome this drawback, the integration of III-V materials has proven essential. These materials are recognized for their efficient light emission and superior bandgap engineering capabilities, making them indispensable in photonics and beyond. Here, we present the monolithic integration of small-volume III-V nano-heterostructures with silicon via selective area epitaxy in the pyramidal openings etched in (100)-oriented silicon substrate. The precise positioning of the nano-heterostructures is achieved using electron beam lithography. Our atomic resolution imaging and chemical analysis confirm the epitaxial nature of InP growth, revealing well-defined heterointerfaces. Each structure incorporates an InAsP quantum dot-like active medium. Optical characterization and eight-band kp calculations demonstrate energy level quantization in three spatial dimensions. The heterostructures can be engineered to cover the entire telecom wavelength range. Consequently, these InAsP/InP nano-heterostructures could serve as a gain medium for silicon-based hybrid nano-lases and nanoLED as well as quantum light sources in the telecom wavelength range.</description>

      <title>Modeling Defect-Level Switching for Highly-Nonlinear and Hysteretic Electronic Devices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.04108v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Previously, we demonstrated hysteretic and persistent changes of resistivity in two-terminal electronic devices based on charge trapping and detrapping at immobile metastable defects [H. Yin, A. Kumar, J.M. LeBeau, and R. Jaramillo, Phys. Rev. Applied 15, 014014 (2021)]; we termed these devices as defect-level switching (DLS) devices. DLS devices feature all-electronic resistive switching and thus are volatile because of the voltage-time dilemma. However, the dynamics of volatile resistive switches may be valuable for emerging applications such as selectors in crosspoint memory, and neuromorphic computing concepts. To design memory and computing circuits using these volatile resistive switches, accurate modeling is essential. In this work we develop an accurate and analytical model to describe the switching physics in DLS devices, based on the established theories of point defect metastability in Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS) and II-VI semiconductors. The analytical nature of our model allows for time-efficient simulations of dynamic behavior of DLS devices. We model the time durations of SET and RESET programming pulses, which can be exponentially shortened with respect to the pulse amplitude. We also demonstrate the concept of inverse design: given desired resistance states, the width and amplitude of the programming signal can be chosen accordingly.</description>

Abstract: Kagome lattices have an inherent two-dimensional nature. Despite previous realizations in the monolayer limit, their abilities to drive emergent electronic states such as correlated insulators have remained unobserved. Here, we report the experimental realization of a new structural phase of monolayer Mo33Te56, characterized by its virtually global uniformity as a mirror-twin boundary loop superlattice embedded in an H-MoTe2 monolayer. Through a combination of scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) and theoretical calculations, we unveil a kagome geometry along with multiple associated sets of kagome flat bands. Crucially, the partial filling of these kagome bands induces ferromagnetism as revealed by spin-polarized STM, and leads to a correlated insulating state exhibiting a hard gap as large as 15 meV. Our findings represent a major advance in kagome materials, offering a framework with clearer band structures and more intrinsic two-dimensional properties for exploring flat-band physics.</description>

      <title>Identifying Crystal Structures Beyond Known Prototypes from X-ray Powder Diffraction Spectra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.16454v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The large amount of powder diffraction data for which the corresponding crystal structures have not yet been identified suggests the existence of numerous undiscovered, physically relevant crystal structure prototypes. In this paper, we present a scheme to resolve powder diffraction data into crystal structures with precise atomic coordinates by screening the space of all possible atomic arrangements, i.e., structural prototypes, including those not previously observed, using a pre-trained machine learning (ML) model. This involves (i) enumerating all possible symmetry-confined ways in which a given composition can be accommodated in a given spacegroup, (ii) ranking the element-assigned prototype representations using energies predicted using the Wren ML model [Sci.Adv.8, eabn4117 (2022)], (iii) assigning and perturbing atoms along the degree of freedom allowed by the Wyckoff positions to match the experimental diffraction data (iv) validating the thermodynamic stability of the material using density-functional theory (DFT). An advantage of the presented method is that it does not rely on a database of previously observed prototypes and is, therefore capable of finding crystal structures with entirely new symmetric arrangements of atoms. We demonstrate the workflow on unidentified XRD spectra from the ICDD database and identify a number of stable structures, where a majority turns out to be derivable from known prototypes. However, at least two are found not to be part of our prior structural data sets.</description>

      <title>Dismai-Bench: Benchmarking and designing generative models using disordered materials and interfaces</title>

Abstract: Generative models have received significant attention in recent years for materials science applications, particularly in the area of inverse design for materials discovery. However, these models are usually assessed based on newly generated, unverified materials, which provide a narrow evaluation of a model's performance. Also, current efforts for inorganic materials have predominantly focused on small crystals, even though the capability to generate large disordered structures would significantly expand the applicability of generative modeling. In this work, we present the Disordered Materials &amp; Interfaces Benchmark (Dismai-Bench), a generative model benchmark that uses datasets of disordered alloys, interfaces, and amorphous silicon (256-264 atoms per structure). Models are trained on each dataset independently, and evaluated through direct structural comparisons between training and generated structures. Benchmarking was performed on two graph diffusion models and two (coordinate-based) U-Net diffusion models. The graph models were found to significantly outperform the U-Net models due to the higher expressive power of graphs. While noise in the less expressive models can assist in discovering materials by facilitating exploration beyond the training distribution, these models face significant challenges when confronted with more complex structures. To further demonstrate the benefits of this benchmarking in the development process of a generative model, we considered the case of developing a point-cloud-based generative adversarial network (GAN) to generate low-energy disordered interfaces. We show that the best performing architecture, CryinGAN, outperforms the U-Net models, and is competitive against the graph models despite its lack of invariances and weaker expressive power. This work provides a new framework and insights to guide the development of future generative models.</description>

Abstract: Polymeric carbon nitrides (PCNs) exhibit intriguing optical properties and exceptional performance in (photo)catalysis, optoelectronics, and energy storage. Nevertheless, the intricate phenomena involving light absorption extending to the visible range, long-lived excitons, photo-charging, and photochemical processes observed in PCN derivatives remain poorly understood. Our theoretical investigation elucidates the origin of distinct dark and bright excitons, their stability and lifetimes, and their correlation with the microstructural attributes of PCNs. Furthermore, we identify the decisive role of dark excitons in catalytic reactivity, which underlies the differences in the photocatalytic performance of different PCN derivatives.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02414v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interatomic potentials are essential to go beyond ab initio size limitations, but simulation results depend sensitively on potential parameters. Forward propagation of parameter variation is key for uncertainty quantification, whilst backpropagation has found application for emerging inverse problems such as fine-tuning or targeted design. Here, the implicit derivative of functions defined as a fixed point is used to Taylor expand the energy and structure of atomic minima in potential parameters, evaluating terms via automatic differentiation, dense linear algebra or a novel sparse operator approach. The latter allows efficient forward and backpropagation through relaxed structures of arbitrarily large systems. The implicit expansion accurately predicts lattice distortion and defect formation energies and volumes with classical and machine-learning potentials, enabling high-dimensional uncertainty propagation without prohibitive overhead. We then show how the implicit derivative can be used to solve challenging inverse problems, minimizing an implicit loss to fine-tune potentials and stabilize solute-induced structural rearrangements at dislocations in tungsten.</description>

      <title>Modeling of Hot-Carrier Degradation driven by silicon-hydrogen bond dissociation in SPADs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07105v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A novel approach for modeling Dark Count Rate (DCR) drift in Single-Photon Avalanche Diodes (SPADs) is proposed based on Hot-Carrier Degradation (HCD) inducing silicon-hydrogen bond dissociation at the Si/SiO2 interface. The energy and the quantity of hot-carriers are modeled by the interplay of carrier energy distribution and current density. The carrier energy distribution, achieved by a Full-Band Monte-Carlo simulation considering the band structure and the scattering mechanisms, establishes a crucial link to the degradation of the top SPAD interface, primarily influenced by hot electrons due to their broader energy spread. The current density is determined by analyzing the generation rates of carriers under dark and photo conditions, along with the multiplication rate, through a combination of experimental data and modeling techniques. Subsequently,these hot carriers are correlated with the distribution of bond dissociation energy, which is modeled by the disorder-induced local variations among the Si-H bond energy at the Si/SiO2 interface. The impact-ionization probability between hot carriers and Si-H bonds is then calculated by differentiating their energies, thereby determining the degradation kinetics. This enables the capture of the rise in dark current density with stress duration by the increasing number of defects, which in turn affects the modeling of degradation rate. For the first time, a direct correlation between the dark current and DCR, along with their drift over stress time, has been established, relying on the carrier generation rate originating from these defects together with the position-dependent breakdown probability Pt.This physic-based model allows to predict DCR for unprecedented long-term stress measurement time up to 10e6s, covering a whole set of characterization and stress conditions for SPAD devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07859v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ferroelectric nitrides have emerged as promising semiconductor materials for modern electronics. However, their domain structures and associated properties are basically unknown, despite their potential to result in optimized or new phenomena. Density functional theory calculations are performed to investigate the effect of epitaxial strain on multidomains of (Al,Sc)N nitride systems and to compare it with the monodomain case. The multidomain systems are predicted to have five strain-induced regions, to be denoted as Regions I to V, respectively. Each of these regions is associated with rather different values or behaviors of physical properties such as axial ratio, polarizations, internal parameters, bond lengths, etc. Of particular interest is the prediction of bent domains under compressive strain extending beyond $-$5.5%, which indicates that domain walls may play a key role in the mechanical failure properties of these systems. Interestingly, such bending induces the creation of a finite in-plane polarization (in addition to out-of-plane dipoles) due to geometric and symmetry considerations. Strikingly too, the bent domains have lower energy than the wurtzite monodomains and have atomically sharp boundaries. Our findings may pave the way for domain wall engineering in ferroelectric nitrides.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.12478v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The current state of the art for determining thermoelectric properties is limited to the investigation of electrons or phonons without including the inherent electron-phonon coupling that is in all materials. This gives rise to limitations in accurately calculating base material properties that are in good agreement with experimental data. Steepest-entropy-ascent quantum thermodynamics is a general non-equilibrium thermodynamic ensemble framework that provides a general equation of motion for non-equilibrium system state evolution. This framework utilizes the electron and phonon density of states as input to compute material properties, while taking into account the electron-phonon coupling. It is able to span across multiple spatial and temporal scales in a single analysis. Any system's thermoelectric properties can, therefore, be attained provided the accurately determined density of states is available.</description>

Abstract: We present Cephalo, a series of multimodal vision large language models (V-LLMs) designed for materials science applications, integrating visual and linguistic data for enhanced understanding. A key innovation of Cephalo is its advanced dataset generation method. Cephalo is trained on integrated image and text data from thousands of scientific papers and science-focused Wikipedia data demonstrates can interpret complex visual scenes, generate precise language descriptions, and answer queries about images effectively. The combination of a vision encoder with an autoregressive transformer supports multimodal natural language understanding, which can be coupled with other generative methods to create an image-to-text-to-3D pipeline. To develop more capable models from smaller ones, we report both mixture-of-expert methods and model merging. We examine the models in diverse use cases that incorporate biological materials, fracture and engineering analysis, protein biophysics, and bio-inspired design based on insect behavior. Generative applications include bio-inspired designs, including pollen-inspired architected materials, as well as the synthesis of bio-inspired material microstructures from a photograph of a solar eclipse. Additional model fine-tuning with a series of molecular dynamics results demonstrate Cephalo's enhanced capabilities to accurately predict statistical features of stress and atomic energy distributions, as well as crack dynamics and damage in materials.</description>
