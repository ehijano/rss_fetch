      <title>Radiation hardness of open Fabry-Perot microcavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-finesse microcavities offer a platform for compact, high-precision sensing by employing high-reflectivity, low-loss mirrors to create effective optical path lengths that are orders of magnitude larger than the device geometry. Here, we investigate the radiation hardness of Fabry-Perot microcavities formed from dielectric mirrors deposited on the tips of optical fibers. The microcavities are irradiated under both conventional (~0.1 Gy/s) and ultrahigh (FLASH, ~20 Gy/s) radiotherapy dose rates. Within our measurement sensitivity of ~40 ppm loss, we observe no degradation in the mirror absorption after irradiation with over 300 Gy accumulated dose. This result highlights the excellent radiation hardness of the dielectric mirrors forming the cavities, enabling new optics-based, real-time, in-vivo, tissue-equivalent radiation dosimeters with ~10 micron spatial resolution (our motivation), as well as other applications in high-radiation environments.</description>

      <title>Explanations of MTF discrepancy in grating-based X-ray differential phase contrast CT imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a multi-contrast X-ray computed tomography (CT) imaging system, the grating-based Talbot-Lau interferometer is able to generate the absorption contrast and differential phase contrast (DPC) images concurrently. However, experiments found that the absorption CT (ACT) images have better spatial resolution, i.e., higher modulation transfer function (MTF), than the differential phase contrast CT (DPCT) images. Until now, the root cause of such observed discrepancy has not been rigorously investigated. Through physical experiments, this study revealed that the phase grating in the Talbot-Lau interferometer induces direct superposition of paired split absorption signals and inverse superposition of paired split phase signals via diffraction. Further simulation experiments demonstrated that this splitting leads to a reduction in MTF in both ACT and DPCT images, with distinct superposition mechanisms contributing to the lower MTF in DPCT. Besides, such MTF discrepancy may also be affected in a minor extent by object composition, sample size, beam spectra and detector pixel size. Based on this study, the spatial resolution could be optimized when designing a grating-based DPC imaging system.</description>

      <title>Image Reconstruction with B0 Inhomogeneity using an Interpretable Deep Unrolled Network on an Open-bore MRI-Linac</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: MRI-Linac systems require fast image reconstruction with high geometric fidelity to localize and track tumours for radiotherapy treatments. However, B0 field inhomogeneity distortions and slow MR acquisition potentially limit the quality of the image guidance and tumour treatments. In this study, we develop an interpretable unrolled network, referred to as RebinNet, to reconstruct distortion-free images from B0 inhomogeneity-corrupted k-space for fast MRI-guided radiotherapy applications. RebinNet includes convolutional neural network (CNN) blocks to perform image regularizations and nonuniform fast Fourier Transform (NUFFT) modules to incorporate B0 inhomogeneity information. The RebinNet was trained on a publicly available MR dataset from eleven healthy volunteers for both fully sampled and subsampled acquisitions. Grid phantom and human brain images acquired from an open-bore 1T MRI-Linac scanner were used to evaluate the performance of the proposed network. The RebinNet was compared with the conventional regularization algorithm and our recently developed UnUNet method in terms of root mean squared error (RMSE), structural similarity (SSIM), residual distortions, and computation time. Imaging results demonstrated that the RebinNet reconstructed images with lowest RMSE (&lt;0.05) and highest SSIM (&gt;0.92) at four-time acceleration for simulated brain images. The RebinNet could better preserve structural details and substantially improve the computational efficiency (ten-fold faster) compared to the conventional regularization methods, and had better generalization ability than the UnUNet method. The proposed RebinNet can achieve rapid image reconstruction and overcome the B0 inhomogeneity distortions simultaneously, which would facilitate accurate and fast image guidance in radiotherapy treatments.</description>

      <title>Multi-Branch Generative Models for Multichannel Imaging with an Application to PET/CT Joint Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a proof-of-concept approach for learned synergistic reconstruction of medical images using multi-branch generative models. Leveraging variational autoencoders (VAEs) and generative adversarial networks (GANs), our models learn from pairs of images simultaneously, enabling effective denoising and reconstruction. Synergistic image reconstruction is achieved by incorporating the trained models in a regularizer that evaluates the distance between the images and the model, in a similar fashion to multichannel dictionary learning (DiL). We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on both Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST) and positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) datasets, showcasing improved image quality and information sharing between modalities. Despite challenges such as patch decomposition and model limitations, our results underscore the potential of generative models for enhancing medical imaging reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Analytical Model for Calculating Gain Pattern of Antennas Implanted in Large Host Bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04722v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a method for the fast and accurate estimation of the gain pattern and maximum gain of an implanted antenna including the effect of the host body, under the assumption that the latter is electrically large. The estimation procedure is based on the radiation of an elementary dipole source placed in a planar body model. The derivation of closed-form expressions is based on spherical wave analysis and the Green's functions for layered media. The validity of this approximation for practical cases is shown on different implanted antennas, where the results are compared to full wave simulations and measurements.</description>

      <title>Individualizing Glioma Radiotherapy Planning by Optimization of Data and Physics-Informed Discrete Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05063v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Brain tumor growth is unique to each glioma patient and extends beyond what is visible in imaging scans, infiltrating surrounding brain tissue. Understanding these hidden patient-specific progressions is essential for effective therapies. Current treatment plans for brain tumors, such as radiotherapy, typically involve delineating a uniform margin around the visible tumor on pre-treatment scans to target this invisible tumor growth. This "one size fits all" approach is derived from population studies and often fails to account for the nuances of individual patient conditions. We present the GliODIL framework, which infers the full spatial distribution of tumor cell concentration from available multi-modal imaging, leveraging a Fisher-Kolmogorov type physics model to describe tumor growth. This is achieved through the newly introduced method of Optimizing the Discrete Loss (ODIL), where both data and physics-based constraints are softly assimilated into the solution. Our test dataset comprises 152 glioblastoma patients with pre-treatment imaging and post-treatment follow-ups for tumor recurrence monitoring. By blending data-driven techniques with physics-based constraints, GliODIL enhances recurrence prediction in radiotherapy planning, challenging traditional uniform margins and strict adherence to the Fisher-Kolmogorov partial differential equation (PDE) model, which is adapted for complex cases.</description>

      <title>Spectral CT Two-step and One-step Material Decomposition using Diffusion Posterior Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10183v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel approach to spectral computed tomography (CT) material decomposition that uses the recent advances in generative diffusion models (DMs) for inverse problems. Spectral CT and more particularly photon-counting CT (PCCT) can perform transmission measurements at different energy levels which can be used for material decomposition. It is an ill-posed inverse problem and therefore requires regularization. DMs are a class of generative model that can be used to solve inverse problems via diffusion posterior sampling (DPS). In this paper we adapt DPS for material decomposition in a PCCT setting. We propose two approaches, namely Two-step Diffusion Posterior Sampling (TDPS) and One-step Diffusion Posterior Sampling (ODPS). Early results from an experiment with simulated low-dose PCCT suggest that DPSs have the potential to outperform state-of-the-art model-based iterative reconstruction (MBIR). Moreover, our results indicate that TDPS produces material images with better peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) than images produced with ODPS with similar structural similarity (SSIM).</description>

      <title>A quantitative assessment of Geant4 for predicting the yield and distribution of positron-emitting fragments in ion beam therapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03499v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Purpose: To compare the accuracy with which different hadronic inelastic physics models across ten Geant4 Monte Carlo simulation toolkit versions can predict positron-emitting fragments produced along the beam path during carbon and oxygen ion therapy.
  Materials and Methods: Phantoms of polyethylene, gelatin or poly(methyl methacrylate) were irradiated with monoenergetic carbon and oxygen ion beams. Post-irradiation, 4D PET images were acquired and parent $^{11}$C, $^{10}$C and $^{15}$O radionuclides contributions in each voxel were determined from the extracted time activity curves. Experiments were simulated in Geant4 Monte Carlo versions 10-11.1, with three different fragmentation models: binary ion cascade (BIC), quantum molecular dynamics (QMD) and the Liege intranuclear cascade (INCL++) - 30 combinations. Total/parent isotope positron annihilation yields were compared between simulations and experiments using normalised mean squared error and Pearson cross-correlation coefficient. Depth of maximum/distal 50\% peak position yield were also compared.
  Results: Performance varied considerably across versions and models, with no one best predicting all positron-emitting fragments. BIC in Geant4 10.2 provided the best overall agreement with experimental results in the largest number of test cases. QMD consistently provided the best estimates of both the depth of peak positron yield (10.4 and 10.6) and the distal 50\%-of-peak point (10.2), while BIC also performed well and INCL generally performed the worst across most Geant4 versions. Conclusions: Best spatial prediction of annihilation yield and positron-emitting fragment production during carbon and oxygen ion therapy was found to be 10.2.p03 with BIC or QMD. These version/model combinations are recommended for future heavy ion therapy research.</description>

      <title>Low-Dose CT Reconstruction Using Dataset-free Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11186v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low-Dose computer tomography (LDCT) is an ideal alternative to reduce radiation risk in clinical applications. Although supervised-deep-learning-based reconstruction methods have demonstrated superior performance compared to conventional model-driven reconstruction algorithms, they require collecting massive pairs of low-dose and norm-dose CT images for neural network training, which limits their practical application in LDCT imaging. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised and training data-free learning reconstruction method for LDCT imaging that avoids the requirement for training data. The proposed method is a post-processing technique that aims to enhance the initial low-quality reconstruction results, and it reconstructs the high-quality images by neural work training that minimizes the $\ell_1$-norm distance between the CT measurements and their corresponding simulated sinogram data, as well as the total variation (TV) value of the reconstructed image. Moreover, the proposed method does not require to set the weights for both the data fidelity term and the plenty term. Experimental results on the AAPM challenge data and LoDoPab-CT data demonstrate that the proposed method is able to effectively suppress the noise and preserve the tiny structures. Also, these results demonstrate the rapid convergence and low computational cost of the proposed method. The source code is available at \url{https://github.com/linfengyu77/IRLDCT}.</description>
