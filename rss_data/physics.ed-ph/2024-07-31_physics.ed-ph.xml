      <title>Advancing quantum technology workforce: industry insights into qualification and training needs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transition of second-generation quantum technologies from a research topic to a topic of industrial relevance has led to a growing number of quantum companies and companies that are exploring quantum technologies. Examples would include a start-up building a quantum key distribution device, a large company working on integrating a quantum sensing core into a product, or a company providing quantum computing consultancy. They all face different challenges and needs in terms of building their quantum workforce and training in quantum concepts, technologies and how to derive value from them.
  With the study documented in this paper, we aim to identify these needs and provide a picture of the industry's requirements in terms of workforce development and (external) training and materials. We discuss, for example, the shortage of engineers and jobs relevant to the quantum industry, the challenge of getting people interested in quantum, and the need for training at different levels and in different formats - from awareness raising and self-learning materials to university courses in quantum systems engineering. The findings are based on 34 semi-structured interviews with industry representatives and a follow-up questionnaire to validate some of the issues raised in the interviews. These results have influenced activities in EU projects, including an update of the European Competence Framework for Quantum Technologies.</description>

      <title>Bias in physics peer recognition does not explain gaps in perceived recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19921v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gaining recognition as a physics person by peers is an important contributor to undergraduate students' physics identity and their success in physics courses. Previous research has separately demonstrated that women perceive less recognition from peers than men in their physics courses (perceived recognition) and that women receive fewer nominations from their peers as strong in their physics course than men (received recognition). The relationship between perceived and received peer recognition for men and women, however, is not well understood. Here we test three plausible models for this relationship. We conduct a large-scale, quantitative study of over 1,700 students enrolled in introductory physics courses at eight institutions in the United States. We directly compare student gender, perceived recognition, and received recognition, controlling for other student demographics and course-level variability. Results show with high precision that, for students receiving the same amount of recognition, and having the same race or ethnicity, academic year, and major, women report significantly lower perceived recognition than men. These findings offer important implications for testable instructional interventions.</description>
