      <title>Modeling the time evolution of a camphor rotor perturbed by a stationary camphor source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06236v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A self-propelled motion resulting from the dissipation of camphor molecules on the water surface has been attracting scientific attention for more than 200 years. A generally accepted description of the phenomenon includes equations for the object motion coupled with the hydrodynamics of Marangoni flows and the time evolution of camphor surface concentration. The solution of such equations is a numerically complex problem. In recent publications, an alternative approach based on Hamiltonian including the potential term representing Marangoni interactions has been applied to simulate the time evolution of camphor rotors. Such a model represents a significant numerical simplification if compared to the standard description. Here, we comment on the applicability of Hamiltonian approach by applying it to a single camphor rotor perturbed by a camphor disk fixed on the water surface. We demonstrate that in such a case, the approach leads to the results qualitatively different from the experimental ones. Therefore, we doubt in its applicability to describe the time evolution of interacting camphor rotors. We also show that the approximation of the Marangoni forces by a potential gives more realistic results if used together with the equation of motion that includes the hydrodynamic friction. Still, a better agreement with experiments can be obtained by considering an additional equation for the time evolution of camphor surface concentration.</description>

      <title>Soft Electromechanical Elastomers Impervious to Instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Soft dielectric elastomers that can exhibit extremely large deformations under the action of an electric field enable applications such as soft robotics, biomedical devices, energy harvesting among others. A key impediment in the use of dielectric elastomers is failure through instability mechanisms or dielectric breakdown. In this work, using a group-theory based approach, we provide a closed-form solution to the bifurcation problem of a paradigmatical elastomer actuator and discover an interesting result: at a critical electric field, the elastomer becomes impervious to Treloar-Kearsley instability. This limit is reached prior to the typical dielectric breakdown threshold. Our results thus establish a regime of electrical and mechanical loads where the dielectric elastomer is invulnerable to all common failure modes.</description>

      <title>Defects in vibrated monolayers of equilateral triangular prisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present experimental results in which a quasimonolayer of grains, shaped as equilateral triangular prisms, is vertically vibrated within circular and square confining cavities. The system exhibits a fluid phase characterized by sixfold orientational order. However, the specific geometries of the cavities frustrate this order, leading to the excitation of topological defects that adhere to topological principles. We analyze the distribution of topological charges of these defects and their evolution as a function of the container geometry. In particular, we find that in the circular cavity, both the number and charge of defects remain constant in the steady-state regime, with only defects of charge $+1$ being excited. In contrast, within the square cavity, with the same topology as the circular cavity, some defects become pinned to the corners of the cavity, developing charges of $+1$ or $+2$. Additionally, free defects with charges of $\pm 1$ can be excited. Notably, dynamic events occur, such as the fusion of two defects or the creation of two defects from a single one. These events are governed by the conservation of total charge within the cavity and give rise to various system configurations, with rapid transitions between them. The observed dynamic fluctuations in topological charge are remarkable, influenced by both particle shape and cavity geometry. This system of vertically vibrated (dissipative) granular monolayers presents a unique and simple platform for studying topological phenomena, with potential implications for topological effects in equilibrium-oriented fluids.</description>

      <title>Phase field model for viscous inclusions in anisotropic networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growth of viscous two-dimensional lipid domains in contact with a viscoelastic actin network was recently shown to exhibit unusual lipid domain ripening due to the geometry and anisotropy of the actin network [Arnold &amp; Takatori. Langmuir. 40, 26570-26578 (2024)]. In this work, we interpret previous experimental results on lipid membrane-actin composites with a theoretical model that combines the Cahn-Hilliard and Landau-de Gennes liquid crystal theory. In our model, we incorporate fiber-like characteristics of actin filaments and bundles through a nematic order parameter, and elastic anisotropy through cubic nematic gradients. Numerical simulations qualitatively agree with experimental observations, by reproducing the competition between the thermodynamic forces that coarsen lipid domains versus the elastic forces generated by the surrounding actin network that resist domain coarsening. We observe a significant decrease in the growth of domain sizes in the range of $R(t) \sim t^{0.05-0.25}$ for different actin network stiffness, in sharp contrast to the $\sim t^{1/3}$ scaling for diffusive growth of domains in the absence of the actin network. Our findings may serve as a foundation for future developments in modeling elastic ripening in complex systems.</description>

      <title>Transient size segregation of binary granular mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transient size segregation of a bi-disperse granular mixture flowing over a periodic chute is studied using DEM simulations and theory. A recently developed particle force-based size segregation model has been shown to successfully predict the steady state behavior of binary granular mixtures [1]. This promising model is used to predict the time-dependent segregation of different size binary mixtures in this work. A one dimensional continuum model is developed to solve the convection-diffusion equation by incorporating a mixture segregation model along with rheological model. The inter-coupling of segregation with rheology is accounted to predict evolution of species concentration. We also investigate the effect of different initial configurations (Large near base (LNB), Small near base (SNB) and well-mixed) on the transient evolution of the flow and segregation. The particle force-based segregation model is able to predict the evolution of the concentration profile for all three initial configurations for smallest size ratio of 1.25. Significant deviations, however, are observable for larger size ratios, suggesting the need to account for the evolution of the velocity field in the model.</description>

      <title>Self-organization of active rod suspensions on fluid membranes and thin viscous films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many biological processes involve transport and organization of inclusions in thin fluid interfaces. A key aspect of these assemblies is the active dissipative stresses applied from the inclusions to the fluid interface, resulting in long-range active interfacial flows. We study the effect of these active flows on the self-organization of rod-like inclusions in the interface. Specifically, we consider a dilute suspension of Brownian rods of length $L$, embedded in a thin fluid interface of 2D viscosity $\eta_m$ and surrounded on both sides with 3D fluid domains of viscosity $\eta_f$. The momentum transfer from the interfacial flows to the surrounding fluids occurs over length $\ell_0=\eta_m/\eta_f$, known as Saffman-Delbr\"uck length. We use zeroth, first and second moments of Smoluchowski equation to obtain the conservation equations for concentration, polar order and nematic order fields, and use linear stability analysis and continuum simulations to study the dynamic variations of these fields as a function of $L/\ell_0$, the ratio of active to thermal stresses, and the dimensionless self-propulsion velocity of the embedded particles. We find that at sufficiently large activities, the suspensions of active extensile stress (pusher) with no directed motion undergo a finite wavelength nematic ordering, with the length of the ordered domains decreasing with increasing $L/\ell_0$. The ordering transition is hindered with further increases in $L/\ell_0$. In contrast, the suspensions with active contractile stress (puller) remain uniform with variations of activity. We notice that the self-propulsion velocity results in significant concentration fluctuations and changes in the size of the order domains that depend on $L/\ell_0$. Our research highlights the role of hydrodynamic interactions in the self-organization of active inclusions on biological interfaces.</description>

      <title>Buckling of residually stressed cylindrical tubes under compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We evaluate the loss of stability of axially compressed slender and thick-walled tubes subject to a residual stress distribution. The nonlinear theory of elasticity, when used to analyze the underlying deformation, shows that the residual stress induces preferred directions in the reference configuration. The incremental theory, given in Stroh form, is used to derive an exact bifurcation condition. The critical stretch and the associated critical buckling mode are identified for axisymmetric and asymmetric increments in the deformation. Mode transitions are illustrated as the tube slenderness varies. For slender tubes, Euler buckling is energetically favorable, and the effect of residual stress is negligible. However, for short and thick-walled tubes where barreling mode is dominant, the residual stress significantly affects the buckling behavior and may eliminate barreling instability. We show that, depending on its magnitude and direction, residual stress can either accelerate or delay instability. Phase diagrams for various modes are obtained and provide insight into pattern selection across different tube geometries.</description>

      <title>Interplay between timescales governs the residual activity of a harmonically bound active Brownian particle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active microparticles in confining potentials manifest complex and intriguing dynamical phenomena, as their activity competes with confinement. The steady-state position distributions of harmonically bound active Brownian particles (HBABPs) exhibit a crossover from Boltzmann-like to bimodal, commonly recognized as passive to active transition, upon variation of the activity and the confinement strength. By studying optically trapped phoretically active Janus colloids, along with simulations and analytical calculations of HBABPs, we provide a comprehensive dynamical description emphasizing the resultant velocity to examine this understanding. Our results establish that the crossover is instead from active to passive-like, and is governed solely by the interplay between the persistence time $\tau_{\rm R}$, and the equilibration time in harmonic potential $\tau_k$. When $\tau_{\rm R} &lt; \tau_k$, despite a Boltzmann-like position distribution, the HBABP retains a substantial resultant or residual active velocity, denoting an activity-dominated regime. In contrast, at $\tau_{\rm R} &gt; \tau_k$, the restoring force fully counterbalances propulsion at a radial distance, where the HBABP exhibits harmonically bound Brownian particle (HBBP)-like dynamics, and the position distribution becomes bimodal. We further provide a quantitative measure of the residual activity, which decreases monotonically with $\tau_{\rm R} / \tau_k$, eventually converging to a nominal value corresponding to HBBP as $\tau_{\rm R} / \tau_k$ exceeds 1, corroborating our conclusions.</description>

      <title>Inverse Bauschinger Effect in Active Ultrastable Glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Memory effects in amorphous materials have been widely studied because of their possible widespread future applications. We show here that ultrastable glasses can exhibit a transient reversible memory effect when subjected to both a local driving force via Run-and-tumble active particles and global shear. We investigate the system's response across different yielding regimes by selectively switching the shear direction at different strains. We analyze how changes in shear direction influence yielding, post-yield behavior, and structural evolution in active amorphous solids. Our model active system exhibits an enhanced anisotropic response, displaying both conventional and inverse Bauschinger effects, depending on the deformation history. The results indicate that activity-induced shear band networks create structural memory, enabling the system to heal upon shear reversal due to the transient nature of this phenomenon. Additionally, we observe that shear softening under cyclic loading produces an irreversible, stable, and less branched network structure with increasing cycles. These findings provide novel insights into how activity and shear collectively contribute to mechanical response, including memory formation in ultrastable disordered systems.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the impact of competing interactions on non-equilibrium colloidal gelation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Competing interactions stabilize exotic mesoscopic structures, yet the microscopic mechanisms by which they influence non-equilibrium processes leading to disordered states remain largely unexplored, despite their critical role in self-assembly across a range of nanomaterials and biological systems. Here, we numerically investigate the structural evolution in charged colloidal model systems, where short-range attractions and long-range repulsions compete. We reveal that these two interaction scales drive sequential ordering within clusters, from tetrahedra motifs to linear aggregates with chiral order. This process disrupts early-stage percolated networks, resulting in reentrant behavior -- a dynamic transition from disordered cluster to network to chiral rigid cluster. On the other hand, the cluster-elastic network boundary in the final state is governed by isostatic percolation, which slows structural rearrangements, preserves branching points, and sustains a long-lived network. The resulting structure consist of rigid Bernal spiral-like branches connected through flexible branching points lacking order. These insights advance our microscopic understanding of out-of-equilibrium ordering driven by competing interactions, particularly phenomena like temporally delayed frustration reflecting different length scales of competing interactions. The mechanisms identified here may play a crucial role in mesoscale self-organization across soft materials, from nanoparticle assemblies to biological gels and cytoskeletal networks. Understanding how competing interactions regulate structure and dynamics could guide the design of adaptive materials with tunable mechanical properties and offer new perspectives on biological processes such as cytoplasmic organization and cellular scaffolding.</description>

      <title>Viscous flow model of ion-induced pattern formation: consistency between theory and experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is known that ion-irradiation can lead surfaces to spontaneously develop patterns with characteristic length scales on the order of only a few nanometers. Pattern formation typically occurs only for irradiation angles beyond a critical angle, which varies with projectile, target, and irradiation energy. To date, there is no completely unifying physical theory. However, since predictions of the critical angle can be extracted from linear stability analysis of a given model, the ability to explain critical angle selection is a simple but important test of model validity. In this paper, we survey all existing critical angle, wavelength, and in-plane stress data for noble gas broad beam ion-irradiation of silicon and germanium by argon, krypton and xenon at energies from 250eV to 2keV. While neglecting the effects of erosion and redistribution, which are widely regarded as key contributors to ion-induced pattern formation, we find that a viscous flow model is capable of explaining these three types of experimental data simultaneously using only parameters within a physically-reasonable range, and in a manner consistent with the defect kinetics of the amorphous layer. This bolsters the case for viscous flow and stress-driven instabilities as important components of an eventual, unifying model of nanoscale pattern formation under ion bombardment.</description>

      <title>Lipidation-induced bacterial cell membrane translocation of star-peptides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria demands development of novel and effective antimicrobial agents. Structurally Nanoengineered Antimicrobial Peptide Polymers (SNAPPs), characterized by their unique star-shaped architecture and potent multivalent interactions, represent a promising solution. This study leverages molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the impact of lipidation on SNAPPs' structural stability, membrane interactions, and antibacterial efficacy. We show that lipidation with hexanoic acid (C6), lauric acid (C12), and stearic acid (C18) enhances the {\alpha}-helical stability of SNAPP arms, facilitating deeper insertion into the hydrophobic core of bacterial membranes. Among the variants, C12-SNAPP exhibits the most significant bilayer disruption, followed by C6-SNAPP, whereas the excessive hydrophobicity of C18-SNAPP leads to pronounced arm back-folding towards the core, reducing its effective interaction with the bilayer and limiting its bactericidal performance. Additionally, potential of mean force (PMF) analysis reveals that lipidation reduces the free energy barrier for translocation through the bilipid membrane compared to non-lipidated SNAPPs. These findings underscore the critical role of lipidation in optimizing SNAPPs for combating MDR pathogens. By fine-tuning lipid chain lengths, this study provides a framework for designing next-generation antimicrobial agents to address the global antibiotic resistance crisis, advancing modern therapeutic strategies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While it is well established that self-propelled particles with alignment interactions can exhibit orientational order, the impact of self-replication and annihilation, which are key characteristics in cellular systems, on spatiotemporal order remains poorly understood. To explore the interplay between self-propulsion and self-replication, we introduce the active Brownian bug (ABB) model, in which self-propelled agents undergo stochastic, density-dependent replication and constant-rate death. Despite the absence of alignment interactions, the system exhibits flocking behavior characterized by high orientational order, while maintaining ordered hexagonal arrays. This emergent order arises from stochastic birth and death processes, offering a novel mechanism for flocking in proliferating cellular populations.</description>

      <title>Growing length and time scales in activity-mediated glassy dynamics in confluent cell monolayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17816v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Activity-mediated unjamming of a confluent glassy system is crucial for several biological processes, such as embryogenesis and cancer metastasis. During these processes, the cells progressively change their junction properties, characterized by an interaction parameter $p_0$, and become motile. Here, we study the effect of nonequilibrium active fluctuations, in the form of self-propulsion, on the glassy dynamics in a confluent system. We simulate the active Vertex model and use the analytical mode-coupling theory (MCT) to show that the nature of the transition in the presence of activity remains similar to that in a thermal system where the fluctuations are temperature-like. The agreement of the simulation results with the MCT predictions demonstrates that the structure-dynamics feedback mechanism controls the relaxation dynamics. In addition, we present the first computation of a dynamic length scale, $\xi_d$, in confluent systems using finite-size scaling, and show that the growing relaxation time exhibita a power-law dependence on $\xi_d$. Furthermore, unlike particulate glasses, the static length that governs the finite-size scaling of the relaxation time is proportional to $\xi_d$, revealing the unique nature of the glassy dynamics in confluent systems.</description>

      <title>Double Splay Nematic Order in Confined Polar Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12336v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we demonstrate that when a ferroelectric nematic is confined between two glass plates coated with ionic polymers, a modulated phase emerges in a narrow temperature range between the nematic and ferroelectric nematic phases. This modulated phase emerges from the nematic phase in a continuous manner and then transforms into the ferroelectric nematic phase via a first-order transition upon cooling. Using optical microscopy, we provide compelling evidence that this modulated phase corresponds to the theoretically predicted double splay nematic phase. In this phase, splay deformations alternate in two orthogonal directions oriented at 45{\deg} to the substrate surfaces, creating a modulation wavelength that is twice the thickness of the cell. Our experiments with different ionic coatings reveal that only polymeric cationic coatings effectively promote the formation of this phase, highlighting the critical role of electrical screening. These findings not only confirm the existence of the double splay nematic phase but also provide insights into the distinctive topological defects of this phase in confined geometries.</description>

      <title>The Dean-Kawasaki equation and stochastic density functional theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13467v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Dean-Kawasaki (DK) equation, which is at the basis of stochastic density functional theory (SDFT), was proposed in the mid-nineties to describe the evolution of the density of interacting Brownian particles, which can represent a large number of systems such as colloidal suspensions, supercooled liquids, polymer melts, biological molecules, active or chemotactic particles, or ions in solution. This theoretical framework, which can be summarized as a mathematical reformulation of the coupled overdamped Langevin equations that govern the dynamics of the particles, has attracted a significant amount of attention during the past thirty years. In this review, I present the context in which this framework was introduced, and I recall the main assumptions and calculation techniques that are employed to derive the DK equation. Then, in the broader context of statistical mechanics, I show how SDFT is connected to other theories, such fluctuating hydrodynamics, macroscopic fluctuation theory, or mode-coupling theory. The mathematical questions that are raised by the DK equation are presented in a non-specialist language. In the last parts of the review, I show how the original result was extended in several directions, I present the different strategies and approximations that have been employed to solve the DK equation, both analytically and numerically. I finally list the different situations where SDFT was employed to describe the fluctuations of Brownian suspensions, from the physics of active matter to the description of charged particles and electrolytes.</description>

      <title>Brownian motion and microrheology in complex fluids under periodic boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09610v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We review the theoretical aspects of determining linear rheology using passive microrheology from simulations under periodic boundary conditions (PBC). It is common to impose periodic boundary conditions when evaluating bulk properties by molecular simulation. The Brownian motion of the probe particles is affected by PBCs, and thus their effects must be considered when microrheological analysis is applied to evaluate the dynamic modulus. First, we review the theory of microrheology based on the generalized Langevin equation (GLE) in an unbounded domain. Then, we briefly discuss the effect of periodic boundary conditions on the diffusion coefficient. After that, we explain the effect of PBCs on the mean-square displacement of Brownian particles and their impact on microrheology. The passive microrheology technique under PBCs provides a new approach for rheology evaluation in molecular simulations of complex liquids in addition to the traditional Green--Kubo formula and non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD).</description>

      <title>A Fluctuation Theory of Liquid-Phase Solutions: Shear Viscosity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10303v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurately describing liquids and their mixtures beyond equilibrium remains a significant challenge in modern chemical physics and physical chemistry, especially regarding the calculation of transport properties in liquid-phase systems. This paper introduces a phenomenological nonequilibrium theory specifically designed for multicomponent liquid-phase solutions. Our field-theoretical framework, rooted in nonequilibrium statistical mechanics, incorporates quasi-stationary concentration fluctuations that align with equilibrium liquid theory as described by classical density functional theory. This method serves as a phenomenological extension of the established Dean-Kawasaki stochastic density functional theory, enabling the computation of shear viscosity. We apply our approach to derive general formula for the shear viscosity in single-solute solutions. Our findings yield new results and successfully reproduce previously established results for such systems as solutions containing soft-core particles, hard spheres, one-component plasma, and near-critical solutions.</description>

      <title>Eppur si muove: Shape of topological defects -- and consequent motion -- in active nematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19665v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological defects in systems with liquid-crystalline order are crucial in determining their large-scale properties. In active systems, they are known to have properties impossible at equilibrium: for example, $+1/2$ defects in nematically-ordered systems self-propel. While some previous theoretical descriptions relied on assuming that the defect shape remains unperturbed by activity, we show that this assumption can lead to inconsistent predictions. We compute the shape of $-1/2$ defects and show that the one of $+1/2$ is intimately related to their self-propulsion speed. Our analytical predictions are corroborated via numerical simulations of a generic active nematic theory.</description>

      <title>Engineering Morphologies of Metal-Based Colloidal Assemblies via Colloid Jamming at Liquid-Liquid Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06026v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Self-assemblies, structured via nanoparticles, show promise as materials for advanced applications, like photonic devices, electrochemical energy storage units and catalysis support. Despite observing diverse morphologies, a comprehensive understanding of the formation mechanism remains elusive. In this work, we show that the coordination interaction between metal-based sulfide nanoparticles (MS NPs) and the fluorosurfactants at the droplet interface influences the morphology during the evaporation-induced self-assembly facilitated by droplet microfluidics. Further investigation into fluorosurfactants with various chemical groups and MS NPs reveals that the strength of coordination interactions significantly influences assembly morphology. The interfacial interactions can be eliminated through coating a SiO2 layer on the metal-based colloid (M@SiO2 NPs). In addition, we demonstrate that the morphologies of the self-assemblies can be engineered via the coordination interactions between the MS NPs and fluorosurfactants, and by varying the concentrations of MS NPs. Utilizing these interfacial interactions, assemblies with core-shell and homogeneous distribution of binary nanoparticles were constructed. Our findings offer novel insights into the interfacial jamming of nanoparticles at the droplet interface through evaporation-induced self-assembly, and into the design of metal-based colloidal assemblies with diverse morphologies, crucial for developing novel functional assemblies for catalysis, plasmonic, and porous materials in a controlled manner.</description>

      <title>Time-delayed Newton's law of cooling with a finite-rate thermal quench: Impact on the Mpemba and Kovacs effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13665v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Mpemba and Kovacs effects are two notable memory phenomena observed in nonequilibrium relaxation processes. In a recent study [Phys.~Rev.~E \textbf{109}, 044149 (2024)], these effects were analyzed within the framework of the time-delayed Newton's law of cooling under the assumption of instantaneous temperature quenches. Here, the analysis is extended to incorporate finite-rate quenches, characterized by a nonzero quench duration $\sigma$. The results indicate that a genuine Mpemba effect is absent under finite-rate quenches if both samples experience the same thermal environment during the quenching process. However, if $\sigma$ remains sufficiently small, the deviations in the thermal environment stay within an acceptable range, allowing the Mpemba effect to persist with a slightly enhanced magnitude. In contrast, the Kovacs effect is significantly amplified, with the transient hump in the temperature evolution becoming more pronounced as both the waiting time and $\sigma$ increase. These findings underscore the importance of incorporating finite-time effects in nonequilibrium thermal relaxation models and offer a more realistic perspective for experimental studies.</description>

      <title>General Hamiltonian description of nonreciprocal interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05246v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a vast class of systems, which includes members as diverse as active colloids and bird flocks, interactions do not stem from a potential, and are in general nonreciprocal. Thus, it is not possible to define a conventional energy function, nor to use analytical or numerical tools that rely on it. Here, we overcome these limitations by constructing a Hamiltonian that includes auxiliary degrees of freedom; when subject to a constraint, this Hamiltonian yields the original non-reciprocal dynamics. We show that Glauber dynamics based on the constrained Hamiltonian reproduces the steady states of the original Langevin dynamics, as we explicitly illustrate for dissipative XY spins with vision-cone interactions. Further, the symplectic structure inherent to our construction allows us to apply the well-developed notions of Hamiltonian engineering, which we demonstrate by varying the amplitude of a periodic drive to tune the spin interactions between those of a square and a chain lattice geometry. Overall, our framework for generic nonreciprocal pairwise interactions paves the way for bringing to bear the full conceptual and methodological power of conventional statistical mechanics and Hamiltonian dynamics to nonreciprocal systems.</description>

      <title>Narrowband, angle-stable, and highly efficient polariton organic light emitting diodes employing thermally activated delayed fluorescence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06057v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Narrowband emission is crucial for next generation optoelectronic devices to satisfy demands for high color brilliance. Microcavities can narrow emission spectra of organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) through the creation of resonant standing waves, independent of emitter material, enabling flexibility in molecular and device design. However, they induce a strong angle-dependence of the perceived emission color. Utilizing strong light-matter coupling of cavity photons with the virtually angle-independent exciton, leads to exciton-polariton emission showing reduced linewidths and suppressed angular dispersion if tuned correctly. Creating polaritons in highly efficient materials such as thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) molecules is however difficult as their low oscillator strengths intrinsically disfavor light-matter interaction. Here, we present the successful combination of a highly efficient but intrinsically broadband TADF emitter with a strongly absorbing assistant strong coupling material in a modified microcavity structure. Through optimizing the assistant strong coupling layer architecture, we demonstrate polariton OLEDs with exceptionally narrowband, angle stable emission at external quantum efficiencies above 20% for both bottom- and top-emitting designs, more than doubling the performance of previous record devices. The results pave the way for utilizing polaritonic emission at practical device efficiencies for display applications.</description>
