      <title>Dynamics of Spin-0 (Particles-Antiparticles) in Bonnor-Melvin Cosmological Space-Time Using the Generalized Feshbach-Villars Transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we employ the Generalized Feshbach-Villars transformation (GFVT) to investigate the relativistic quantum dynamics of spin-0 scalar particles within the backdrop of a magnetic universe characterized by the Bonnor-Melvin cosmological space-time, which exhibits a geometrical topology resulting in an angular deficit. We derive the radial equation of the Klein-Gordon equation using this FV representation and obtain analytical solutions utilizing special functions. Our analysis demonstrates that various parameters associated with the space-time geometry exert significant influence on the eigenvalue solutions within this novel representation. This research sheds light on the intricate dynamics of particles within the theoretical framework of quantum field theory in curved space-time.</description>

      <title>A Study of Levia-Civita and Cosmic String Solutions in Modified $f(R)$ Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this research manuscript, we explore cylindrically symmetric solutions within the framework of modified $f(R)$ theories of gravity, where $R$ representing the Ricci scalar. The study focuses on analyzing the cylindrical solutions within realistic space-time regions and investigates three distinct cases of exact solutions derived from the field equations of $f(R)$ theory of gravity. Moreover, we examine well-known Levi-Civita and cosmic string solutions for the said modify gravity. Furthermore, the manuscript delves into the implications of the obtained results by exploring energy conditions for each case. Notably, a violation of null energy conditions is observed, suggesting the potential existence of cylindrical wormholes. The findings contribute to the understanding of modified $f(R)$ theories of gravity, providing valuable insights into the nature of cylindrically symmetric solutions and their implications in theoretical physics.</description>

      <title>The Big Bang: Origins and initial conditions from Self-Regulating Cosmology (SRC) model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating appropriate initial conditions for the Universe is key to discussing cosmic evolution constructively. In standard cosmology the traditional approach assumes an early Universe that emerges from an infinite density, spacetime singularity. It then undergoes inflationary expansion, followed by a matter-creating "reheat" period. This approach produces results generally in agreement with observations. However, to date it is not known how (or even whether) a true past-directed spacetime singularity can generate a regular spacetime that becomes the observed Universe. It has been suggested that an appropriate approach should involve initial conditions that emerge naturally from existing physics. In this paper we generate initial conditions predicated on the Self-Regulating Cosmology (SRC) model recently presented [1]. In SRC, the dynamics leads to a universe that also self-regenerates from one evolutionary cosmic phase or (hereafter) kalpa to another. Within each such kalpa cosmic dynamics evolves between two different scales of de Sitter-like horizons. The end of a kalpa and the beginning of the next interface through a phase transition whose features naturally set all initial conditions for the new phase, including sourcing entropy. The SRC Universe satisfies Poincare Recurrence Theorem, with specified recurrence time. This facilitates a consistent co-application of Boltzmann Anthropic Hypothesis with the Past Hypothesis (hence with the Second Law of Thermodynamics). The issue of whether or not the early Universe undergoes inflation becomes naturally self-manifest in this scenario. The framework discusses two standing issues in cosmology: the old Cosmological Constant Problem, and the new issue of over-mature structures observed by JWST at high redshifts.</description>

      <title>Gravitational radiation of a spherically symmetric source in $f(R)$-gravitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is shown that Birkhoff's theorem for the general theory of relativity is overcome in the $f(R)$-theory of gravitation. That means, the $f(R)$-theory of gravitation, unlike Einstein's general theory of relativity, does not forbid gravitational radiation from a spherically symmetric source (whether stationary or non-stationary). As a consequence, in the $f(R)$-theory a spherically symmetric gravitational deformation (e.g., collapse/expansion or pulsation) could emit gravitational waves (of tensor- and scalar polarization modes), a phenomenon impossible in the general relativity. A test model is examined and it turns out that the gravitational radiation is strongest when the surface of the deforming object is in the vicinity of the (modified) event horizon, even suddenly flares up just outside the latter. In this letter, within the $f(R)$-theory of gravitation, a gravitational wave equation and a formula for the gravitational emission power are derived. These formulae, along with searching for signals, can be used for the experimental test of the $f(R)$-theory. In general, including the spherically symmetry case, gravitational radiation of both tensor- and scalar polarization modes are allowed, although under some circumstance the contribution of scalar modes is strongly suppressed.</description>

      <title>Strong lensing of gravitational waves with modified propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the impact of corrections to the propagation on the waveforms of gravitationally lensed gravitational waves under the geometrical optics approximation, focusing on both uniform cosmological modifications and local modifications localized around lensing objects. By adopting a model-independent phenomenological approach, we systematically investigate the effects of these modifications in strong lensing scenarios, where detection of multiple images is expected. Our analysis reveals that cosmological modifications can yield corrections to the time delay that remain to be minor compared with the effects that accumulate over the whole propagation process, which are present also in the unlensed waveform. By contrast, local modifications around lensing objects can alter the image position and also the magnification factor, which is potentially polarization-selective and frequency-dependent. In some case we can have image disappearance as well as signal amplification. Furthermore, we demonstrate that such modifications can cause degradation of waveform match with the templates based on general relativity. This study highlights the importance of considering waveform modifications to search for the signature of modified propagation or the existence of extra polarization modes, and proposes potential observational targets.</description>

      <title>Warp Factory: A Numerical Toolkit for the Analysis and Optimization of Warp Drive Geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The last few decades of warp drive research have focused on analytic methods to explore warp solutions to Einstein's field equations. These analytic solutions tend to favor simple metric forms which are easier to analyze but limit the space of exploration. In addition, all solutions to date have involved unphysical qualities, such as negative energy, violation of energy conditions, or enormous energy requirements. In an effort to explore the space of physically meaningful warp drives, the Advanced Propulsion Laboratory (APL) at Applied Physics has developed Warp Factory, a toolkit written in MATLAB for numerically analyzing and optimizing warp drive geometries. Warp Factory consists of a series of three primary modules: the solver, the analyzer, and the optimizer. Together, these modules allow users to solve the Einstein field equations, compute energy conditions and scalars, and perturbatively optimize general metrics. Finally, the toolkit offers insightful 2D and 3D visualizations of general metrics and stress-energy tensors. The methods used in Warp Factory, along with their application in evaluating and optimizing common metrics, are discussed. With Warp Factory, APL hopes to accelerate warp research and bring us one step closer to physical and realizable warp drives.</description>

      <title>Geometrisation of Fermions in Semi-Riemannian Spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An earlier scheme [arXiv:2404.03360], where torsion plays an essential part in a flat spacetime account of fermion spin, is extended to spacetimes with non-zero Riemann curvature. It is found that further essential features of the fermion, in particular its electromagnetic field, are determined by the curvature and torsion of spacetime. A natural model for the metric, singular along the spin axis of the particle, permits integration of a stress-energy tensor that fixes a realistic electron mass in terms of the Planck mass, despite the many orders of magnitude by which these values differ.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the spherically symmetric traversable wormholes with a scalar field supported by a phantom field in the anti-de Sitter (AdS) asymptotic spacetime. Despite coupling the scalar matter field, these wormholes remain massless and symmetric for reflection of the radial coordinate $r \rightarrow -r$. The solution possesses a finite Noether charge $Q$, which varies as a function of frequency $\omega$ with changes in the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ and the throat size $r_0$. Under specific conditions, an approximate ``event horizon'' will appear at the throat.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal modes and their excitation beyond general relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The response of black holes to small perturbations is known to be partially described by a superposition of quasinormal modes. Despite their importance to enable strong-field tests of gravity, little to nothing is known about what overtones and quasinormal-mode amplitudes are like for black holes in extensions to general relativity. We take a first step in this direction and study what is arguably the simplest model that allows first-principle calculations to be made: a nonrotating black hole in an effective-field-theory extension of general relativity with cubic-in-curvature terms. Using a phase-amplitude scheme that uses analytical continuation and the Pr\"ufer transformation, we compute, for the first time, the quasinormal overtone frequencies (in this theory) and quasinormal-mode excitation factors (in any theory beyond general relativity). We find that the overtone quasinormal frequencies and their excitation factors are more sensitive than the fundamental mode to the lengthscale $l$ introduced by the higher-derivative terms in the effective field theory. We argue that a description of all overtones cannot be made within the regime of validity of the effective field theory, and we conjecture that this is a general feature of any extension to general relativity that introduces a new lengthscale. We also find that a parametrization of the modifications to the general-relativistic quasinormal frequencies in terms of the ratio between $l$ and the black hole's mass is somewhat inadequate, and we propose a better alternative. As an application, we perform a preliminary study of the implications of the breakdown, in the effective field theory, of the equivalence between the quasinormal mode spectra associated to metric perturbations of polar and axial parity of the Schwarzschild black hole in general relativity. We also present a simple justification for the loss of isospectrality.</description>

      <title>Quasibound and quasinormal modes of a thick brane in Rastall gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the gravitational quasinormal modes of the thick brane in Rastall gravity. Using the asymptotic iteration and direct integration methods, we solve the quasinormal frequencies of the Rastall thick brane. We also obtained the waveforms of these quasinormal modes through numerical evolution. The results indicate that although the Rastall thick brane lacks a bound zero mode, when the Rastall parameter $\lambda\gtrsim0$, a long-lived quasinormal mode appears. This long-lived quasinormal mode may restore the four-dimensional effective Newtonian potential on the brane on a large scale. This may provide a new perspective for the localization of gravity on thick branes, that a thick brane does not necessarily require the gravity to be localized, perhaps quasi-localized is sufficient.</description>

      <title>Constraining the modified friction in gravitational wave propagation with precessing black hole binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A broad class of modified gravities can result in a modified friction effect in the propagation of gravitational waves (GWs). This effect changes the amplitude-damping rate of GWs during their propagation in the cosmological distance and thus modifies the standard luminosity distance of GWs in general relativity. Therefore, one can constrain this modified friction by measuring both the luminosity distance and redshift of the GW sources. In this paper, we investigate the prospects of constraining such modified friction effect by using the precessing binary black holes with ground-based GW detectors. For this purpose, we consider 20 precessing events detected by the GW detector network consisting of two LIGO detectors and two third-generation GW detectors (the Einstein Telescope and the Cosmic Explorer). The redshift information of these events is obtained by identifying their possible host galaxies in the GLADE+ galaxy catalog. We show that the precession in the binary system can improve significantly the precision of luminosity distance and thus lead to a tighter constraint on the modified friction. By assuming narrow priors on cosmological parameters that are consistent with the uncertainties of Planck 2018 results, our analysis shows that the modified friction effect, characterized by two parameters $(\Xi_0, n)$, can be constrained to be $\Xi_0 = 1.002^{+0.004}_{-0.004}$ and $n=3.257^{+2.595}_{-2.192}$, in which the result of $\Xi_0$ is about two orders of magnitude better than current result from an analysis with GWTC-3. Our result sets the stage for future research with third-generation GW detectors, offering new insights into gravitational parameter modifications. It also contributes to the understanding of the properties and applications of binary black hole systems with precession.</description>

      <title>Modern tools for computing neutron star properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Astronomical observations place increasingly tighter and more diverse constraints on the properties of neutron stars (NS). Examples include observations of radio or gamma-ray pulsars, accreting neutron stars and x-ray bursts, magnetar giant flares, and recently, the gravitational waves (GW) from coalescing binary neutron stars. Computing NS properties for a given EOS, such as mass, radius, moment of inertia, tidal deformability, and innermost stable circular orbits (ISCO), is therefore an important task. This task is unnecessarily difficult because relevant formulas are scattered throughout the literature and publicly available software tools are far from being complete and easy to use. Further, naive implementations are unreliable in numerical corner cases, most notably when using equations of state (EOS) with phase transitions. To improve the situation, we provide a public library for computing NS properties and handling of EOS data. Further, we include a collection of EOS based on existing nuclear physics models together with precomputed sequences of NS models. All methods are accessible via a Python interface. This article collects all relevant equations and numerical methods in full detail, including a novel formulation for the tidal deformability equations suitable for use with phase transitions. As a sidenote to the topic of ISCOs, we discuss the stability of non-interacting dark matter particle circular orbits inside NSs. Finally, we present some simple applications relevant for parameter estimation studies of GW data. For example, we explore the validity of universal relations, and discuss the appearance of multiple stable branches for parametrized EOS.</description>

      <title>Simulation-based inference of black hole ringdowns in the time domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational waves emitted by a ringing black hole allow us to perform precision tests of General Relativity in the strong field regime. With improvements to our current gravitational wave detectors and upcoming next-generation detectors, developing likelihood-free parameter inference infrastructure is critical as we will face complications like non-standard noise properties, partial data and incomplete signal modeling that may not allow for an analytically tractable likelihood function. In this work, we present a proof-of-concept strategy to perform likelihood-free Bayesian inference on ringdown gravitational waves using simulation based inference. Specifically, our method is based on truncated sequential neural posterior estimation, which trains a neural density estimator of the posterior for a specific observed data segment. We setup the ringdown parameter estimation directly in the time domain. We show that the parameter estimation results obtained using our trained networks are in agreement with well-established Markov-Chain methods for simulated injections as well as analysis on real detector data corresponding to GW150914. Additionally, to assess our approach's internal consistency, we show that the density estimators pass a Bayesian coverage test.</description>

      <title>An Intrinsic Coordinate Reference Frame Procedure I: Tensorial Canonical Weyl Scalars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Canonical quantization of gravity in general relativity is greatly simplified by the artificial decomposition of space and time into a 3+1 formalism. Such a simplification may appear to come at the cost of general covariance. This requires tangential and perpendicular infinitesimal diffeomorphisms generated by the symmetry group under the Legendre transformation of the given action. This gauge generator, along with the fact that Weyl curvature scalars may act as ``intrinsic coordinates" (or a dynamical reference frame) which depend only on the spatial metric $g_{ab}$ and the conjugate momenta $p^{cd}$, allow for an alternative approach to canonical quantization of gravity. In this paper we present the tensorial solution of the set of Weyl scalars in terms of canonical phase-space variables.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce perfect fluid Sinyukov-like tensors, a special kind of conformal Killing tensors, and prove a characterization of generalized RW spacetimes. In cosmological (RW) framework, we study the Friedmann equations of Conformal Killing Gravity. In addition to ordinary matter they contain a dark fluid and a Lambda term emergent from the conformal Killing extension. We then solve the equation for the evolution of the density contrast in matter-dominated universe. The main result is that the simultaneous presence of the dark sector and the Lambda term gives a deviation from Lambda-CDM and ordinary GR towards an enhancement of the overdensity growth.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal Modes in Modified Gravity using Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we apply a novel approach based on physics-informed neural networks to the computation of quasinormal modes of black hole solutions in modified gravity. In particular, we focus on the case of Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet theory, with several choices of the coupling function between the scalar field and the Gauss-Bonnet invariant. This type of calculation introduces a number of challenges with respect to the case of General Relativity, mainly due to the extra complexity of the perturbation equations and to the fact that the background solution is known only numerically. The solution of these perturbation equations typically requires sophisticated numerical techniques that are not easy to develop in computational codes. We show that physics-informed neural networks have an accuracy which is comparable to traditional numerical methods in the case of numerical backgrounds, while being very simple to implement. Additionally, the use of GPU parallelization is straightforward thanks to the use of standard machine learning environments.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from sub-solar mass primordial black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational waves from inspiraling sub-solar mass compact objects would provide almost definitive evidence for the existence of primordial black holes. In this chapter, we explain why these exotic objects are interesting candidates for current and future gravitational-wave observatories, and provide detailed explanations of how they are searched for. We describe one method, matched filtering, to search for binaries with masses between $[0.01,1]M_\odot$. Furthermore, since signals from inspiraling planetary- and asteroid-mass mass compact binaries ($[10^{-9},10^{-2}]M_\odot$) would spend hours to years in the detector frequency band, we explain the novel pattern recognition techniques that have been developed to search for them. Finally, we describe extreme mass ratio inspiral (EMRI) systems, and how these will be searched for in future space-based detectors. For all mass regimes, we comment on the prospects for detection.</description>

      <title>Disentanglement as a strong cosmic censor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: If entanglement builds spacetime, then conversely, disentanglement ought to destroy spacetime. From the quantum null energy condition and quantum focusing conjecture, we obtain disentanglement criteria which necessitate infinite energies and strong spacetime singularities. We apply our results to the strong cosmic censorship proposal, where strong singularities at the Cauchy horizons in black holes are desirable. Using our disentanglement criteria and without resorting to any detailed calculations, we provide an exceedingly general and physically transparent discussion of strong cosmic censorship in semiclassical black holes. We argue that strong cosmic censorship is enforced in asymptotically flat and de Sitter black holes by disentanglement and describe how similar disentanglement might be avoided in some anti-de Sitter cases.</description>

      <title>Diagnosing Emergent Isotropy in Anisotropic Holographic Systems using Quantum Information measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the behavior of holographic quantum information measures including Holographic Entanglement Entropy, Entanglement Wedge Cross-section, and butterfly velocity in a holographic p-wave superconductor model. We find a novel critical temperature, $T_{II}$, where an isotropic point emerges, signaling a shift from anisotropy to isotropy within the bulk geometry. We find that these measures respond differently to anisotropy, with HEE and EWCS revealing effects at various scales, while butterfly velocity is a precise probe of horizon anisotropy. These findings deepen our understanding of anisotropy in correlated systems, highlight the sensitivity of quantum information measures to spacetime structure, and pave the way for exploring quantum correlations in anisotropic phases.</description>

      <title>The emergence of spacetime: what role for functionalism?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Among the various attempts to formulate a theory of quantum gravity, a class of approaches suggests that spacetime, as modeled by general relativity, is destined to fade away. A major issue becomes then to identify which structures may inhabit the more fundamental, non-spatiotemporal environment, as well as to explain the relationship with the higher-level spatiotemporal physics. Recently, it has been suggested that a certain understanding of functionalism is the proper tool to suitably account for the recovery of spacetime. Here the viability and usefulness of such a conceptual strategy is explored, by looking at the various levels of spacetime emergence a theory of quantum gravity is expected to deal with. Our conclusion will be that, while its viability is clear also in a quantum gravity context, the import of spacetime functionalism remains rather unsettled.</description>

      <title>Robust parameter estimation within minutes on gravitational wave signals from binary neutron star inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The gravitational waves emitted by binary neutron star inspirals contain information on nuclear matter above saturation density. However, extracting this information and conducting parameter estimation remains a computationally challenging and expensive task. Wong et al. introduced Jim arXiv:2302.05333, a parameter estimation pipeline that combines relative binning and jax features such as hardware acceleration and automatic differentiation into a normalizing flow-enhanced sampler for gravitational waves from binary black hole (BBH) mergers. In this work, we extend the Jim framework to analyze gravitational wave signals from binary neutron stars (BNS) mergers with tidal effects included. We demonstrate that Jim can be used for full Bayesian parameter estimation of gravitational waves from BNS mergers within a few tens of minutes, which includes the training of the normalizing flow and computing the reference parameters for relative binning. For instance, Jim can analyze GW170817 in 26 minutes (33 minutes) of total wall time using the TaylorF2 (IMRPhenomD_NRTidalv2) waveform, and GW190425 in around 21 minutes for both waveforms. We highlight the importance of such an efficient parameter estimation pipeline for several science cases as well as its ecologically friendly implementation of gravitational wave parameter estimation.</description>

      <title>Similarities between projective quantum fields and the Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many homogeneous, four-dimensional space-time geometries can be considered within real projective geometry, which yields a mathematically well-defined framework for their deformations and limits without the appearance of singularities. Focussing on generalized unitary transformation behavior, projective quantum fields can be axiomatically introduced, which transform smoothly under geometry deformations and limits. Connections on the related projective frame bundles provide gauge fields with gauge group $\mathrm{PGL}_5\mathbb{R}$. For Poincar\'e geometry, on operator level only $\mathrm{P}(\mathrm{GL}_2\mathbb{R}\times \mathrm{GL}_3\mathbb{R})\cong \mathbb{R}_{\neq 0}\times \mathrm{PGL}_2\mathbb{R}\times \mathrm{PGL}_3\mathbb{R}$ gauge bosons can interact non-trivially with other projective quantum fields from the non- to ultra-relativistic limits. The corresponding propagating, complexified gauge bosons come with the Standard Model gauge group $G_{\mathrm{SM}}=(\mathrm{U}(1)\times \mathrm{SU}(2)\times \mathrm{SU}(3))/\mathbb{Z}_6$. Physical scale transformations can act as global gauge transformations and their spontaneous breaking can lead to masses for the projective quantum fields including the $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ gauge bosons. Projective quantum fields, which are irreducible both with respect to the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{pgl}_5\mathbb{R}$ and the Poincar\'e group, form Dirac fermions and $G_{\mathrm{SM}}$ gauge bosons interact with them similar to the Standard Model. For homogeneous, curved Lorentz geometries a gauge group similar to the gauge group of metric-affine gravity appears.</description>

      <title>Non-linear power spectrum and forecasts for Generalized Cubic Covariant Galileon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To fully exploit the data from next generation surveys, we need an accurate modelling of the matter power spectrum up to non-linear scales. Therefore in this work we present the halo model reaction framework for the Generalized Cubic Covariant Galileon (GCCG) model, a modified gravity model within the Horndeski class of theories which extends the cubic covariant Galileon (G3) by including power laws of the derivatives of the scalar field in the K-essence and cubic terms. We modify the publicly available software ReACT for the GCCG in order to obtain an accurate prediction of the non-linear power spectrum. In the limit of the G3 model we compare the modified ReACT code to $N$-body simulations and we find agreement within 5\% for a wide range of scales and redshifts. We then study the relevant effects of the modifications introduced by the GCCG on the non-linear matter power spectrum. Finally, we provide forecasts from spectroscopic and photometric primary probes by next generation surveys using a Fisher matrix method. We show that future data will be able to constrain at 1$\sigma$ the two additional parameters of the model at the percent level and that considering non-linear corrections to the matter power spectrum beyond the linear regime is crucial to obtain this result.</description>

      <title>Inverse problem in energy-dependent potentials using semi-classical methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wave equations with energy-dependent potentials appear in many areas of physics, ranging from nuclear physics to black hole perturbation theory. In this work, we use the semi-classical WKB method to first revisit the computation of bound states of potential wells and reflection/transmission coefficients in terms of the Bohr-Sommerfeld rule and the Gamow formula. We then discuss the inverse problem, in which the latter observables are used as a starting point to reconstruct the properties of the potentials. By extending known inversion techniques to energy-dependent potentials, we demonstrate that so-called width-equivalent or WKB-equivalent potentials are not isospectral anymore. Instead, we explicitly demonstrate that constructing quasi-isospectral potentials with the inverse techniques is still possible. Those reconstructed, energy-independent potentials share key properties with the width-equivalent potentials. We report that including energy-dependent terms allows for a rich phenomenology, particularly for the energy-independent equivalent potentials.</description>

Abstract: The formation and growth of black holes can strongly influence the distribution of dark matter around them. I discuss here the different types of dark matter overdensities around black holes, including dark matter cusps, spikes, mounds, crests, and gravitational atoms. I then review recent results on the evolution of a black holes binary in presence of dark matter, focusing on the energy transfer between binary and dark matter induced by dynamical friction. Finally, I present the prospects for studying dark matter with gravitational wave observations, and argue that future interferometers might be able to detect and characterise dark matter overdensities around black holes.</description>

      <title>Limiting noise and outliers in the MICROSCOPE space test of the weak equivalence principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.06400v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The MICROSCOPE space mission has tested the weak equivalence principle finding no violation to about 1e-15, about two orders of magnitude better than on the ground. We review this result looking for lessons for the future. The acceleration difference of the falling bodies is limited by random thermal noise attributed to losses in the tiny gold wire which connects each of them to the enclosing cage. Our analysis reveals anomalies which are inexplicable within the current best knowledge of such noise. The anomalies may be due to a fluctuating sub-microVolt potential caused by electric charge patches on the surface of the test bodies and the electrodes coupled to large acceleration/voltage biases. Since the acceleration difference is derived from the individual measurements of each test body, it depends upon their arbitrarily defined zero, and this causes the bias. The measurement data show a large number of outliers, acceleration spikes (glitches) induced by thermal stress from the Earth and the Sun on the insulating blankets of the spacecraft. They occur at the synodic frequency relative to Earth (also the frequency of a violation signal) and the Sun, their harmonics and their difference. Outliers are removed and the ensuing gaps (up to 35%, 40% of the data) are filled with artificial data. However, gaps and artificial data retain memory of the outliers they have replaced and may therefore mimic a violation signal or cancel an effect (signal or systematic). An existing alternative approach relying solely on measured data would make the result of the experiment fully robust and unquestionable. A correct model of the stiffness of the wire, the presence of a fluctuating patch potential noise with the same frequency dependence as thermal noise from internal damping, as well as an insulation that does not give rise to glitches, were all anticipated by the GOCE gravity mission.</description>

Abstract: In this study, for the first time, we analyse the quasinormal modes of black holes occurring within the framework of degenerate gravity. We investigate the properties of the asymptotically flat spacetimes introduced recently in [JCAP 02(2022)02] that satisfy degenerate Einstein Gauss-Bonnet(dEGB) action and belong to a much larger class of solutions which include cosmological constant. This solution has two distinct branches akin to Einstein Gauss-Bonnet(EBG) gravity. However, unlike the EBG solutions, both the branches of dEGB are well-defined asymptotically. The negative branches from both theories can be identified for the asymptotically flat case. We observe black holes for specific ranges of the Gauss-Bonnet coupling parameter and perform a stability analysis by calculating the quasinormal modes (QNMs) under scalar wave propagation. Finally, the ringdown spectrums of our black holes are compared with their GR counterparts.</description>

Abstract: Black hole solutions in the braneworld scenario are predicted to possess a tidal charge parameter, leaving imprints in the quasinormal spectrum. We conduct an extensive computation of such spectrum, and use it to construct a waveform model for the ringdown relaxation regime of binary black hole mergers observed by LIGO and Virgo. Applying a Bayesian time-domain analysis formalism, we analyse a selected dataset from the GWTC-3 LIGO-Virgo-Kagra catalog of binary coalescences, bounding the value of the tidal charge. With our analysis we obtain the first robust constraints on such charges, highlighting the importance of accounting for the previously ignored correlations with the other black hole intrinsic parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.17130v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wide binary stars are used to test the modified gravity called Scalar-Tensor-Vector Gravity or MOG. This theory is based on the additional gravitational degrees of freedom, the scalar field $G=G_N(1+\alpha)$, where $G_N$ is Newton's constant, and the massive (spin-1 graviton) vector field $\phi_\mu$. The wide binaries have separations of 2-30 kAU. The MOG acceleration law, derived from the MOG field equations and equations of motion of a massive test particle for weak gravitational fields, depends on the enhanced gravitational constant $G=G_N(1+\alpha)$ and the effective running mass $\mu$. The magnitude of $\alpha$ depends on the physical length scale or averaging scale $\ell$ of the system. The modified MOG acceleration law for weak gravitational fields predicts that for the solar system and for the wide binary star systems gravitational dynamics follows Newton's law.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.00865v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Einstein equivalence principle in general relativity allows us to interpret accelerating black holes as a black hole immersed into the gravitational field of a larger companion black hole. Indeed it is demonstrated that C-metrics can be obtained as a limit of a binary system where one of the black holes grows indefinitely large, becoming a Rindler horizon. When the bigger black hole, before the limiting process, is of Schwarzschild type we recover usual accelerating black holes belonging to the Plebanski-Demianski class, thus type D. Whether the greater black hole carries some extra features, such as electric charges or rotations, we get generalised accelerating black holes which belong to a more general class, the type I. In that case the background has a richer structure, reminiscent of the physical features of the inflated companion, with respect to the standard Rindler spacetime. This insight allows us to build a general type D metric, describing an accelerating Kerr-NUT black hole. It has well defined limits to all the type-D black holes of general relativity, including the elusive (type-D) accelerating Taub-NUT spacetime. Extension to the presence of the cosmological constant is also provided.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Brans-Dicke gravity from neutron star-black hole merger events using higher harmonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07017v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Brans-Dicke (BD) theory is one of the simplest scalar-tensor theories, which has potential relations with dark matter, dark energy, inflation, and primordial nucleosynthesis. The strongest constraint on the BD coupling constant is provided by the Shapiro time delay measurement in the solar system by Cassini. Constraints from gravitational wave (GW) events are subject to asymmetric binaries. The third Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog (GWTC) reports a neutron star-black hole (NSBH) merger event, GW200115, making it possible to constrain BD by GW. With the aid of this source and Bayesian Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analyses, we derive the 90\% credible lower bound on the modified parameter of scalar-tensor theories as $\varphi_{-2}&gt;-7.94\times10^{-4}$ by using dominant mode correction. Specific to BD, we have the constraint $\omega_{\rm BD}&gt;4.75$. Usually, asymmetric binary systems have a significant mass ratio; in such cases, higher harmonic modes cannot be neglected. Our work considers higher harmonic corrections from scalar-tensor and provides a tighter constraint of $\varphi_{-2}&gt;-7.59\times10^{-4}$. Transitioning to the BD theory, the constraint result is $\omega_{\rm BD}&gt;5.06$, with a 6.5\% improvement. We also consider a plausible NSBH event, GW190814, which is a highly unequal mass ratio source and exhibits strong evidence for higher-order multipoles. We obtain poor converged results when using the dominant mode while getting a constraint of $\varphi_{-2}&gt;-6.60\times10^{-4}$ on scalar-tensor theories when including the higher harmonic modes. This suggests that the difference between the dominant mode and higher modes has a significant impact on our analysis. Furthermore, treating this suspected event as an NSBH event, we find $\omega_{\rm BD}&gt;6.12$ when including the higher harmonic modes.</description>

      <title>Scale-dependent cosmology from effective quantum gravity in the invariant framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11559v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the possibility of a consistent cosmology based on the gauge-fixing independent running of the gravitational and cosmological constants ($G$ and $\Lambda$) in the framework of effective quantum gravity. In particular, their running in this framework was found to satisfy $G \propto \Lambda^4$. In the cosmological setting, the covariance of the theory provides energy conservation relations, which are impossible to satisfy with the unique scale parameter. However, by introducing the second sub-dominant scale corresponding to the higher-loop corrections and higher-derivative terms, one can close the system of equations for the running of parameters and arrive at the consistent cosmological solutions. This approach yields a change in the cosmological expansion history that affects the ratio of the Hubble parameter today to the Hubble parameter at high redshift.</description>

Abstract: We consider baryogenesis in quantum fluctuation modified gravity. We explore three forms (two are newly proposed here) of baryogenesis interaction and discuss the effect of these interaction terms on the baryon-to-entropy ratio during the radiation era of the expanding universe. We constrain the model parameters with the current observational data, implying that this modified gravity is capable to address the issue of baryon asymmetry in a successful manner.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Purity Lost: Perturbative and Resummed Late-Time Inflationary Decoherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12240v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the rate with which unobserved fields decohere other fields to which they couple, both in flat space and in de Sitter space, for scalar fields prepared in their standard adiabatic vacuum. The process is very efficient in de Sitter space once the modes in question pass outside the Hubble scale, displaying the tell-tale phenomenon of secular growth that indicates the breakdown of perturbative methods on a time scale parameterically long compared with the Hubble time. We show how to match the perturbative evolution valid at early times onto a late-time Lindblad evolution whose domain of validity extends to much later times, thereby allowing a reliable resummation of the perturbative result beyond the perturbative regime. Super-Hubble modes turn out to be dominantly decohered by unobserved modes that are themselves also super-Hubble. When applied to curvature perturbations during inflation this observation closes a potential loophole in recent calculations of the late-time purity of the observable primordial fluctuations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13058v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the perturbative, fully explicit, analytical behaviour of photon escape cones in the Kerr spacetime. When one conducts the fully general non-perturbative Kerr analysis, one quickly finds that one must at some point appeal to numerical and/or graphical methods. Herein we find that we are able to say much more if we look at the slow rotation limit (i.e., $a \ll m$). Indeed we give explicit and tractable expressions for the first and second order (in $a$) contributions to both the shape of the escape cone, and the solid angle subtended by the escape cone. We then look at a few special cases at each order, thereby leading to explicit expressions for the black hole silhouette, expressions which are of great interest to the observational community when studying images of black hole silhouettes ("shadows").</description>

      <title>Tipler Naked Singularities in $N$ Dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02940v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A spacetime singularity, identified by the existence of incomplete causal geodesics in the spacetime, is called a (Tipler) strong curvature singularity if the volume form acting on independent Jacobi fields along causal geodesics vanishes in the approach of the singularity. It is called naked if it is the past endpoint of causal curves in spacetime. Here, we study the formation of strong curvature naked singularities arising from spherically symmetric gravitational collapse of general type-I matter fields in an arbitrarily finite number of dimensions. In the spirit of Joshi and Dwivedi [1], and Goswami and Joshi [2], we first construct regular initial data in terms of matter variables and geometric quantities, subject to the dominant and null energy conditions. Using this initial data, we derive two distinct (but not mutually exclusive) conditions, which we call the positive root condition (PRC) and the simple positive root condition (SPRC), that serve as necessary and sufficient conditions, respectively, for the existence of naked singularities. In doing so, we generalize the results of [1] and [2]. We further restrict the PRC and the SPRC by imposing the curvature growth condition (CGC) of Clarke and Krolak [3] on all causal curves that satisfy the causal convergence condition. The CGC then gives a sufficient condition ensuring that the naked singularities implying the PRC and implied by the SPRC, are of strong curvature type and hence correspond to the inextendibility of the spacetime. Using the CGC, we extend the results of [4] (that hold for dimension $N=4$) to the case $N=5$, showing that strong curvature naked singularities can occur in this case. However, for the case $N\geq6$, we show that past-incomplete causal curves that identify naked singularities do not satisfy the CGC. These results shed light on the validity of the cosmic censorship conjectures in arbitrary dimensions.</description>

Abstract: We study radial perturbations of spherically symmetric spin-$0$ and spin-$1$ bosonic stars, computing numerically the squared frequency of the fundamental mode. We find that not all critical points $-$ where the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner mass attains an extremum $-$ correspond to zero modes. Thus, radial stability does not $\textit{always}$ change at such critical points. The results are in agreement with the so-called critical point method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10082v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most self-force calculations rely, in one way or another, on representations of a particle's Detweiler- Whiting singular field. We present a simple method of calculating the singular field to high order in a local expansion in powers of distance from the particle. As a demonstration, we compute the singular field to 14th order in distance, 10 orders beyond the previous state of the art, in the simple case of a scalar charge in circular orbit around a Schwarzschild black hole. We provide the result in both a 4-dimensional form and a decomposed form suitable for use in an m-mode puncture scheme. Our method should have applications in overcoming bottlenecks in current self-force calculations at both first and second order in perturbation theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10083v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Second-order self-force calculations will be critical for modelling extreme-mass-ratio inspirals, and they are now known to have high accuracy even for binaries with mass ratios $\sim 1:10$. Many of the challenges facing these calculations are related to slow convergence of spherical-harmonic (or spheroidal harmonic) mode sums in a region containing the small companion. In this paper, we begin to develop a multi-domain framework that can evade those problems. Building on recent work by Osburn and Nishimura, in the problematic region of spacetime we use a puncture scheme and decompose the punctured field equations into a basis of Fourier and azimuthal $m$ modes, avoiding a harmonic decomposition in the $\theta$ direction. Outside the problematic region, we allow for a complete spherical- or spheroidal-harmonic decomposition. As a demonstration, we implement this framework in the simple context of a scalar charge in circular orbit around a Schwarzschild black hole. Our implementation utilizes several recent advances: a spectral method in each region, hyperboloidal compactification, and an extremely high-order puncture.</description>

Abstract: We study the variance in the measurement of observables during scattering events, as computed using amplitudes. The classical regime, characterised by negligible uncertainty, emerges as a consequence of an infinite set of relationships among multileg, multiloop amplitudes in a momentum-transfer expansion. We discuss two non-trivial examples in detail: the six-point tree and the five-point one-loop amplitudes in scalar QED. We interpret these relationships in terms or a coherent exponentiation of radiative effects in the classical limit which generalises the eikonal formula, and show how to recover the impulse, including radiation reaction, from this generalised eikonal. Finally, we incorporate the physics of spin into our framework.</description>

      <title>Dispersion relations alone cannot guarantee causality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.05987v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that linear superpositions of plane waves involving a single-valued, covariantly stable dispersion relation $\omega(k)$ always propagate outside the lightcone, unless $\omega(k) =a+b k$. This implies that there is no notion of causality for individual dispersion relations, since no mathematical condition on the function $\omega(k)$ (such as the front velocity or the asymptotic group velocity conditions) can serve as a sufficient condition for subluminal propagation in dispersive media. Instead, causality can only emerge from a careful cancellation that occurs when one superimposes all the excitation branches of a physical model. This is shown to happen automatically in local theories of matter that are covariantly stable. Hence, we find that the need for nonhydrodynamic modes in relativistic fluid mechanics is analogous to the need for antiparticles in relativistic quantum mechanics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.10594v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the hydrodynamic regime, field theories typically have their boost symmetry spontaneously broken due to the presence of a thermal rest frame although the associated Goldstone field does not acquire independent dynamics. We show that this is not the case for Carrollian field theories where the boost Goldstone field plays a central role. This allows us to give a first-principles derivation of the equilibrium currents and dissipative effects of Carrollian fluids. We also demonstrate that the limit of vanishing speed of light of relativistic fluids is a special case of this class of Carrollian fluids. Our results shine light on the thermodynamic properties and thermal partition functions of Carrollian field theories.</description>

Abstract: AdS$_4$ generalized extremal branes are scrutinized in the context of AdS/CFT. Holographic superconductors are studied as dual objects to AdS$_4$ generalized black branes, whose coefficients of response and transport in the dual condensed matter theory are calculated and discussed. The holographic Weyl anomaly is also addressed. The holographic superconductor bound current is shown to be enhanced by the parameter controlling the family of AdS$_4$ generalized extremal brane solutions, when compared to the standard AdS$_4$-Reissner-Nordstr\"om black brane results. In the probe limit, the electrical DC conductivity for holographic superconductors with AdS$_4$ generalized extremal brane dual background is also reported.</description>

      <title>Improved Reall-Santos method for AdS black holes in general 4-derivative gravities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11610v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For asymptotically flat black holes, Reall-Santos method is a convenient tool to compute leading higher derivative corrections to the thermodynamic quantities without actually solving the modified field equations. However, there are subtleties in its generalization to asymptotically AdS black holes with general higher derivative corrections. First of all, it is necessary to know all the higher derivative holographic counterterms and the surface terms implementing the variational principle and subtracting the divergence. One then needs to solve for the modified AdS radius and rescale the time coordinate in an appropriate way such that the induced metric on the conformal boundary of AdS black hole is not modified. We observe that Reall-Santos method can be directly applied to a particular 4-derivative gravity model, known as the Einstein-Weyl gravity, which does not modify the AdS radius and requires only the Gibbons-Hawking-York term and holographic counterterms for the 2-derivative theory. We thus suggest that to compute the thermodynamic quantities of AdS black holes in general 4-derivative theories of gravity, one simply needs to transform it to a Einstein-Weyl gravity with identical thermodynamic variables by appropriate field redefinitions. We explicitly verify this proposal with spherically-symmetric and static charged black holes in Einstein-Maxwell theory extended with generic 4-derivative interactions.</description>

Abstract: We derive constraints on the four dimensional energy-momentum tensor from gravitational and gauge anomalies. Our work can be considered an extension of Duff's analysis [1] to include parity-odd terms and explicit symmetry breaking. The constraints imply the absence of the parity-odd $R\tilde R$ and $F\tilde F$ terms, for theories whose symmetries are compatible with dimensional regularisation, in a model-independent way. Remarkably, even in the case of explicit symmetry breaking the $\Box R$-anomaly is found to be finite and unambiguous after applying the symmetry constraints. We compute mixed gravity-gauge anomalies at leading order and deduce phenomenological consequences for vector bosons associated with global chiral symmetries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13730v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Supersymmetric elementary string states in the compactified heterotic string theory are described by small black holes that have zero area event horizon. In this paper we compute the supersymmetric index of such elementary string states using gravitational path integral. The dominant contribution to the path integral comes from an Euclidean rotating black hole solution of the supergravity theory with a finite area event horizon, but the logarithm of the index, computed from the saddle point, vanishes. Nevertheless we show that the solution is singular on certain subspaces of the horizon where higher derivative corrections can be important, and once the higher derivative corrections are taken into account the solution could yield a finite result for the logarithm of the index whose form agrees with the microscopic results up to an overall numerical constant. While the numerical constant is not determined in our analysis, we show that it is independent of the details of the compactification and even the number of non-compact dimensions, in agreement with the microscopic results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13852v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that it is possible to define a timelike future-directed information current within relativistic first-order hydrodynamics. This constitutes the first step toward a covariantly stable and causal formulation of first-order fluctuating hydrodynamics based on thermodynamic principles. We provide several explicit examples of first-order theories with an information current, covering many physical phenomena, ranging from electric conduction to viscosity and elasticity. We use these information currents to compute the corresponding equal-time correlation functions, and we find that the physically relevant (equal-time) correlators do not depend on the choice of the hydrodynamic frame as long as the frame leads to causal and stable dynamics. In the example of chiral hydrodynamics, we find that circularly polarized shear waves have different probabilities of being excited depending on their handedness, generating net helicity in chiral fluids.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17996v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Considering homogeneous four-dimensional space-time geometries within real projective geometry provides a mathematically well-defined framework to discuss their deformations and limits without the appearance of coordinate singularities. On Lie algebra level the related conjugacy limits act isomorphically to concatenations of contractions. We axiomatically introduce projective quantum fields on homogeneous space-time geometries, based on correspondingly generalized unitary transformation behavior and projectivization of the field operators. Projective correlators and their expectation values remain well-defined in all geometry limits, which includes their ultraviolet and infrared limits. They can degenerate with support on space-time boundaries and other lower-dimensional space-time subspaces. We explore fermionic and bosonic superselection sectors as well as the irreducibility of projective quantum fields. Dirac fermions appear, which obey spin-statistics as composite quantum fields. The framework systematically formalizes and generalizes the ambient space techniques regularly employed in conformal field theory.</description>

Abstract: The DESI year one observations can help probe new physics on cosmological scales. In light of the latest DESI BAO measurements, we constrain five popular cosmological scenarios including inflation, modified gravity, annihilating dark matter and interacting dark energy. Using a data combination of BICEP/Keck array, cosmic microwave background and DESI, we obtain the $1\sigma$ and $2\sigma$ constraints on the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r_{0.05}= 0.0176^{+0.0070}_{-0.0130}$ and $r_{0.05}=0.018^{+0.020}_{-0.017}$ indicating a beyond $2\sigma$ evidence of primordial gravitational waves. Using the combination of cosmic microwave background and DESI, we find a $2.4\sigma$ evidence for gravitational theories beyond the general relativity, shrink the dark matter annihilation cross-section by $12\%$ relative to cosmic microwave background, obtain a $1.3\sigma$ hint of the positive interaction between dark matter and dark energy implying that energy may be transferred from dark matter to dark energy in the dark sector of the universe, and give a clue of massive sterile neutrinos via the $2\sigma$ constraint on the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom $N_{eff}=3.16^{+0.26}_{-0.11}$ and the effective mass $m^{eff}_{\nu, sterile}&lt;0.52$ eV. Future DESI observations could go a step further to explore the nature of inflation, dark matter, dark energy and neutrinos, and test the validity of general relativity on cosmological scales.</description>
