      <title>An in-depth study of ball-bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09200v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the class of so called `ball-bodies' in ${\mathbb R}^n$, given by intersections of translates of Euclidean unit balls (or, equivalently, summand of the Euclidean ball). We study the class along with the natural duality operator defined on it. The class is naturally linked to many interesting problems in convex geometry, including bodies of constant width and the Knesser-Poulsen conjecture. We discuss old and new inequalities of isoperimetric type and of Santal\'{o} type, in this class. We study the boundary structure of bodies in the class, Carath\'eodory type theorem and curvature relations. We discuss various symmetrizations with relation to this class, and make some first steps regarding problems for bodies of constant width.</description>

      <title>Realizations of homology classes and projection areas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The relationship between convex geometry and algebraic geometry has deep historical roots, tracing back to classical works in enumerative geometry. In this paper, we continue this theme by studying two interconnected problems regarding projections of geometric objects in four-dimensional spaces:
  (1) Let $A$ be a convex body in $\mathbb{R}^4$, and let $(p_{12}, p_{13}, p_{14}, p_{23}, p_{24}, p_{34})$ be the areas of the six coordinate projections of $A$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$. Which tuples of six nonnegative real numbers can arise in this way?
  (2) Let $S$ be an irreducible surface in $(\mathbb{P}^1)^4$, and let $(p_{12}, p_{13}, p_{14}, p_{23}, p_{24}, p_{34})$ be the degrees of the six coordinate projections from $S$ to $(\mathbb{P}^1)^2$. Which tuples of six nonnegative integers can arise in this way?
  We show that these questions are governed by the Pl\"ucker relations for the Grassmannian $\text{Gr}(2,4)$ over the triangular hyperfield $\mathbb{T}_2$. We extend our analysis by determining the homology classes in $(\mathbb{P}^m)^n$ proportional to the fundamental classes of irreducible algebraic surfaces, resolving the algebraic Steenrod problem in this setting. Our results lead to several conjectures on realizable homology classes in smooth projective varieties and on the projection volumes of convex bodies.</description>

      <title>Tiling the 4-ball with knotted surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that for any closed, orientable surface $K$ smoothly embedded in $\mathbb{R}^4$, the unit $4$-ball $B^4 \subset \mathbb{R}^4$ can be tiled using $n \geq 3$ tiles each congruent to a regular neighborhood (with corners) of a surface smoothly isotopic to $K$. This gives a 4-dimensional analog of tilings of the $3$-ball that were constructed in the 90's using congruent knotted tori.</description>

      <title>Beyond graph products and cactus groups: quandle products of groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce and initiate the study of quandle products of groups, a family of groups that includes graph products of groups, cactus groups, wreath products, and the recently introduced trickle groups. Our approach is geometric: we show that quandle products admit quasi-median Cayley graphs; and, then, we exploit this geometry to deduce various valuable information about quandle products.</description>

      <title>Orlicz-Sobolev embeddings and heat kernel based Besov classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates functional inequalities involving Besov spaces and functions of bounded variation, when the underlying metric measure space displays different local and global structures. Particular focus is put on the $L^1$ theory and its applications to sets of finite perimeter and isoperimetric inequalities, which can now capture such structural differences.</description>

      <title>Fourier analytic properties of Kakeya sets in finite fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that a Kakeya set in a vector space over a finite field of size $q$ always supports a probability measure whose Fourier transform is bounded by $q^{-1}$ for all non-zero frequencies. We show that this bound is sharp in all dimensions at least 2. In particular, this provides a new and self-contained proof that a Kakeya set in dimension 2 has size at least $q^2/2$ (which is asymptotically sharp). We also establish analogous results for sets containing $k$-planes in a given set of orientations.</description>

      <title>Robust Representation and Estimation of Barycenters and Modes of Probability Measures on Metric Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the problem of defining and estimating statistics for distributions on spaces such as Riemannian manifolds and more general metric spaces. The challenge comes, in part, from the fact that statistics such as means and modes may be unstable: for example, a small perturbation to a distribution can lead to a large change in Fr\'echet means on spaces as simple as a circle. We address this issue by introducing a new merge tree representation of barycenters called the barycentric merge tree (BMT), which takes the form of a measured metric graph and summarizes features of the distribution in a multiscale manner. Modes are treated as special cases of barycenters through diffusion distances. In contrast to the properties of classical means and modes, we prove that BMTs are stable -- this is quantified as a Lipschitz estimate involving optimal transport metrics. This stability allows us to derive a consistency result for approximating BMTs from empirical measures, with explicit convergence rates. We also give a provably accurate method for discretely approximating the BMT construction and use this to provide numerical examples for distributions on spheres and shape spaces.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Asymptotic-type Dimension Bounds Through Combinatorial Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16660v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an alternative probabilistic proof for the sharp Assouad--Nagata dimension bound of a doubling metric space. In addition, we explore some partial rigidity results and applications to scalar curvature. A significant technical tool in our argument is the concept of padded decomposition, which originates in computer science and has been extended to general separable metric spaces by us. Along the way, we extend the sharp upper bound on the asymptotic dimension of graphs with polynomial growth to noncollapsed locally compact metric measure spaces with polynomial volume growth. This sheds light on broader applications of probabilistic methods in metric geometry.</description>
