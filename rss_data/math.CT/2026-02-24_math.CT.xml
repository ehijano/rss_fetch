      <title>Finitary Cartesian closed varieties and semigroup actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We build on some ideas of Richard Garner. Let $M$ be a monoid and $B$ a Boolean algebra. A `matched pair' $[B|M]$ consists of $B$ and $M$ and some mutual interactions. Garner showed that every such matched pair determines (what we shall call) a Boolean left restriction monoid $S = S[B|M]$. In this paper, we show that the data of a $[B|M]$-set (defined later) may be encoded by means of a certain kind of action by $S$. This means that the category $[B|M]$-{\bf sets} is equivalent to a category of {\bf $S$-actions}. We deduce, as a result of Garner's work, that every non-degenerate finitary Cartesian closed variety is equivalent to a special category of $S$-actions where $S$ is a Boolean left restriction monoid.</description>

      <title>A Structural Fixed-Point Principle in Kunen's Theorem on Quasigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kunen proved that a quasigroup satisfying a Moufang-type identity ($N1$) must be a loop. We reformulate the argument in the category $\mathbf{Set}$ as a fixed-point extraction principle. From $N1$ one canonically obtains an idempotent endomorphism $j:G\to G$. Its fixed-point object $\mathrm{Fix}(j)=\mathrm{Eq}(j,\mathrm{id}_G)$ splits off as a retract. The $N1$-symmetry forces $j$ to coequalize the (regular) translation action, hence $j$ factors through the terminal object. Thus $\mathrm{Fix}(j)\cong 1$, yielding a unique global identity element. This provides a conceptual reformulation of Kunen's original algebraic proof \cite{Kunen}.</description>

      <title>Ganea decompositions of classifying spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study homotopy decompositions of the classifying spaces $BG$ of compact connected Lie groups obtained by (relative) fiber-cofiber construction. Given a pair of Borel fibrations $ F \to E \to BG $ and $F' \to E' \to BG $, this construction yields a tower (telescope) of spaces $ X_{m}(F,F') $ over $BG$ indexed by $ \mathbb{Z}_+ $ that converges in the sense that $\text{hocolim} \,(X_{m})\,$ is weakly homotopy equivalent to $BG$. We determine cohomological conditions on the fibrations that produce the spaces $X_{m}(F,F')$ with properties similar to those of the spaces of quasi-invariants of Weyl groups constructed by the first and third authors. We prove that, under these conditions, the resulting homotopy decompositions of $BG$ are sharp (over $\mathbb{Q}$), the spaces $X_{m}(F,F')$ are rationally formal and Cohen-Macaulay, their cohomology rings being finite rank free modules over $H^*(BG, \mathbb{Q})$. We construct many examples which include the fundamental (maximal torus) fibration $ G/T \to BT \to BG $ as well as the universal fibration $\, E_{\rm com}G_{\bf 1} \to B_{\rm com}G_{\bf 1} \to BG \,$ for the classifying space $B_{\rm com}G$ of commuting elements in $G$ introduced by Adem and G\'{o}mez, as the first fibration in the pair. In most cases, we give an explicit presentation for the (equivariant) cohomology rings in terms of characteristic classes and compute the (equivariant) $K$-theory of the spaces involved. The paper contains an Appendix, where we re-examine the topological fiber-cofiber construction in an abstract setting, proving an $\infty$-categorical extension of the classical Ganea Theorem.</description>

      <title>Higher-order circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.18701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We write down a series of basic laws for (strict) higher-order circuit diagrams. More precisely, we define higher-order circuit theories in terms of: (a) nesting, (b) temporal and spatial composition, and (c) equivalence between lower-order bipartite processes and higher-order bipartite states. In category-theoretic terms, these laws are expressed using enrichment and cotensors in symmetric polycategories, along with a frobenius-like coherence between them. We describe how these laws capture the salient features of higher-order quantum theory, and discover an upper bound for higher-order circuits: any higher-order circuit theory embeds into the theory of strong profunctors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.18804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a commutative unital ring $R$ with fixed ideals $I$ and $J$, we introduce and study $I$-prime $R$-modules and $(I, J)$-prime $R$-modules together with their duals $I$-coprime $R$-modules and $(I,J)$-coprime $R$-modules respectively. We employ category-theoretic techniques to reveal their structural properties. Our main results are versions of the Greenlees-May Duality and the Matlis-Greenlees-May Equivalence to the setting of these prime and coprime modules. This generalizes work on $I$-reduced modules and $I$-coreduced modules. We demonstrate that these ``locally prime" modules serve as a tool for studying the classical ``globally prime" modules, creating a bridge between local and global primality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.19144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We initiate the study of non-semisimple algebras in fusion categories by establishing the framework of $\mathcal{C}$-species -- analogous to the framework of species and quivers used in the study of Artin algebras. Under the (necessary) assumption that the fusion category is separable, we show that any algebra is Morita equivalent to an admissible quotient of the path algebra of a $\mathcal{C}$-species. Moreover, we show that an algebra is hereditary if and only if no further quotient is required. These results generalise that of Gabriel's for finite-dimensional algebras.</description>

Abstract: We show that discrete and classical homotopy theories are equivalent after localizing at n-equivalences for any non-negative integer n. By constructing an explicit homotopy inverse to the graph nerve functor associating an n-fibrant cubical set to a graph, we are also able to give explicit computations of several previously unknown discrete homotopy groups of boundaries of cubes and suspensions of cycles.</description>

      <title>Toposes with enough points as categories of \'etale spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09604v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend Makkai duality between coherent toposes and ultracategories to a duality between toposes with enough points and ultraconvergence spaces. Our proof generalizes and simplifies Makkai's original proof. Our main result can also be seen as an extension to ionads of Barr's equivalence between topological spaces and relational modules for the ultrafilter monad. In view of the correspondence between toposes and geometric theories, we obtain a strong conceptual completeness theorem, in the sense of Makkai, for geometric theories with enough Set-models. The same result has recently been obtained independently by Saadia (arXiv:2506.23935) and by Hamad (arXiv:2507.07922). Both of their proofs rely on groupoid representations of toposes, which our proof here does not assume.</description>

      <title>Lie groups in tangent join restriction categories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.18410v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Principal bundles have at least three different definitions, depending on the category of geometric objects studied.
  In Differential Geometry, they are defined as locally trivial projection map of smooth manifolds with an atlas whose transition maps are given by group multiplication. In Topology they are $G$-equivariantly trivial $G$-spaces. In Algebraic Geometry, they are \'Etale locally isotrivial geometric quotients of $G$-varieties.
  The goal of this work is to have a categorical notion that recovers all of them. While they are different structures, they are all locally isomorphic to the Cartesian product of a base space with a group.
  There are a variety of other results on group objects and their tangent bundle. In particular we show that the tangent bundle is the product of the tangent space and the group object and that the tangent space has an external Lie algebra structure, generalizing the correspondence between Lie groups and Lie algebras.
  In order to give a purely categorical definition of a principal bundle, we formulate this notion in the language of join restriction categories. Restriction categories were developed by Cockett and Lack to generalize partial maps (maps defined only on a subset of the domain) and have since then found applications in mathematics and computer science. Join restriction categories, as described by Guo are restriction categories where local restrictions can be joined to obtain a global map. Together with a manifold construction due to Grandis, that allows us to glue together objects, we can describe principal bundles entirely in the language of join-restriction categories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17489v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop foundations for abstract homotopy theory based on Grothendieck's idea of a "derivator". The theory is model-independent, and does not depend on model categories, nor on simplicial sets. It is designed to accomodate all the usual potential applications, such as e.g. enhancements for derived categories of coherent sheaves, in a way that is as close as possible to usual category theory.</description>

      <title>$\otimes$-Frobenius functors and exact module categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16978v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We call a tensor functor $F:\mathcal{C}\to\mathcal{D}$ between finite tensor categories $\otimes$-Frobenius if its left and right adjoints are isomorphic as $\mathcal{C}$-bimodule functors. We give several characterizations of this notion -- most notably, $F$ is $\otimes$-Frobenius if and only if the centralizer $Z({}_{F}\!{\mathcal{D}}_{\!F})$ is unimodular. We use them to analyze how actions on module categories behave under pullback along $F$. For perfect functors, we show that twisting a $\mathcal{D}$-module category $\mathcal{M}$ along $F$ preserves exactness, and that pivotality, unimodularity, and sphericality are preserved whenever $F$ is $\otimes$-Frobenius (or, more generally, Frobenius with respect to $\mathcal{M}$).
  Applications include: (i) explicit criteria for $\otimes$-Frobenius functors arising from bialgebra maps $f\!:\!H'\!\to\!H$ between finite-dimensional Hopf algebras; and (ii) criteria ensuring that objects of internal natural transformations are (symmetric) Frobenius algebras in $Z(\mathcal{C})$. Along the way we show that central tensor functors are Frobenius iff they are $\otimes$-Frobenius and that any tensor functor between separable fusion categories is $\otimes$-Frobenius, answering questions of Flake-Laugwitz-Posur.</description>

      <title>Empirical Measures and Strong Laws of Large Numbers in Categorical Probability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21576v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Glivenko--Cantelli theorem is a uniform version of the strong law of large numbers. It states that for every IID sequence of random variables, the empirical measure converges to the underlying distribution (in the sense of uniform convergence of the CDF). In this work, we provide tools to study such limits of empirical measures in categorical probability. We propose two axioms, namely permutation invariance and empirical adequacy, that a morphism of type $X^{\mathbb{N}} \to X$ should satisfy to be interpretable as taking an infinite sequence as input and producing a sample from its empirical measure as output. Since not all sequences have a well-defined empirical measure, such \emph{empirical sampling morphisms} live in quasi-Markov categories, which, unlike Markov categories, allow for partial morphisms.
  Given an empirical sampling morphism and a few other properties, we prove representability as well as abstract versions of the de Finetti theorem, the Glivenko--Cantelli theorem and the strong law of large numbers.
  We provide several concrete constructions of empirical sampling morphisms as partially defined Markov kernels on standard Borel spaces. Instantiating our abstract results then recovers the standard Glivenko--Cantelli theorem and the strong law of large numbers for random variables with finite first moment. Our work thus provides a joint proof of these two theorems in conjunction with the de Finetti theorem from first principles.</description>

      <title>Joins of closed sublocales are not always a coframe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00987v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a locale $L$, the collection $\mathsf{S}_c(L)$ of joins of closed sublocales forms a frame--somewhat unexpectedly, as it is naturally embedded in the coframe of all sublocales of $L$, where by coframe we mean the order-theoretic dual of a frame. This construction has attracted attention in point-free topology: as a maximal essential extension in the category of frames, for its (non-)functorial properties, its relation to canonical extensions and exact filters of frames, etc.
  A central open question of the theory, posed by Picado, Pultr, and Tozzi in 2019, asked whether $\mathsf{S}_c(L)$ is always a coframe, or whether there exists a locale for which this fails. In this paper, we resolve this question in the negative by constructing a locale $L$ such that $\mathsf{S}_c(L)$ is not a coframe. The main challenge in such questions lies in the difficulty of understanding exact infima in $\mathsf{S}_c(L)$; we circumvent this by analysing a certain separation property satisfied by $\mathsf{S}_c(L)$.</description>

      <title>Localizing invariants of constructible sheaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12810v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given an open-closed decomposition of the stratifying poset, we construct a new semi-orthogonal decomposition of the $\infty$-category of constructible sheaves on a stratified space admitting an exit-path $\infty$-category. From this we obtain a direct sum decomposition of the localizing invariants of the $\infty$-category of constructible sheaves. Since the $\ast$-pullback to the open stratum in the usual (recollement) semi-orthogonal decomposition is not strongly left adjoint, this splitting does not follow from pure sheaf theory considerations. Instead, the splitting crucially relies on the exodromy equivalence: it implies that on the level of constructible sheaves, the $\ast$-pullback to a closed stratum and the $!$-pushforward from an open stratum admit left adjoints. These new functors provide an additional semi-orthogonal decomposition (with the roles of open and closed reversed) in which the relevant functors are strongly left adjoint.</description>

      <title>Igusa-Todorov properties of recollements of abelian categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12702v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the behavior of Igusa-Todorov properties under recollements of abelian categories. In particular, we study how the Igusa-Todorov distances of the categories involved in a recollement are related. Applications are given to Artin algebras, especially to Morita context rings.</description>

      <title>Condensed Sets and the Solovay Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09283v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We exhibit a geometric morphism from the Grothendieck topos representing the Solovay model to the $\kappa$-pyknotic sets of Barwick--Haine and Clausen--Scholze. We then use the properties of this morphism and automatic continuity in the Solovay model to prove Clausen--Scholze's resolution of the Whitehead problem for discrete condensed abelian groups. We also exhibit an analogous internal $Ext$ computation between locally compact abelian groups in the Solovay model.</description>
