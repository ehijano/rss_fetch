      <title>6D Movable Antenna Enhanced Wireless Network Via Discrete Position and Rotation Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Six-dimensional movable antenna (6DMA) is an effective approach to improve wireless network capacity by adjusting the 3D positions and 3D rotations of distributed antenna surfaces based on the users' spatial distribution and statistical channel information. Although continuously positioning/rotating 6DMA surfaces can achieve the greatest flexibility and thus the highest capacity improvement, it is difficult to implement due to the discrete movement constraints of practical stepper motors. Thus, in this paper, we consider a 6DMA-aided base station (BS) with only a finite number of possible discrete positions and rotations for the 6DMA surfaces. We aim to maximize the average network capacity for random numbers of users at random locations by jointly optimizing the 3D positions and 3D rotations of multiple 6DMA surfaces at the BS subject to discrete movement constraints. In particular, we consider the practical cases with and without statistical channel knowledge of the users, and propose corresponding offline and online optimization algorithms, by leveraging the Monte Carlo and conditional sample mean (CSM) methods, respectively. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of our proposed offline and online algorithms for discrete position/rotation optimization of 6DMA surfaces as compared to various benchmark schemes with fixed-position antennas (FPAs) and 6DMAs with limited movability. It is shown that 6DMA-BS can significantly enhance wireless network capacity, even under discrete position/rotation constraints, by exploiting the spatial distribution characteristics of the users.</description>

      <title>Latency-Aware Generative Semantic Communications with Pre-Trained Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative foundation AI models have recently shown great success in synthesizing natural signals with high perceptual quality using only textual prompts and conditioning signals to guide the generation process. This enables semantic communications at extremely low data rates in future wireless networks. In this paper, we develop a latency-aware semantic communications framework with pre-trained generative models. The transmitter performs multi-modal semantic decomposition on the input signal and transmits each semantic stream with the appropriate coding and communication schemes based on the intent. For the prompt, we adopt a re-transmission-based scheme to ensure reliable transmission, and for the other semantic modalities we use an adaptive modulation/coding scheme to achieve robustness to the changing wireless channel. Furthermore, we design a semantic and latency-aware scheme to allocate transmission power to different semantic modalities based on their importance subjected to semantic quality constraints. At the receiver, a pre-trained generative model synthesizes a high fidelity signal using the received multi-stream semantics. Simulation results demonstrate ultra-low-rate, low-latency, and channel-adaptive semantic communications.</description>

      <title>Cache-Enabled Millimetre-Wave Fluid Antenna Systems: Modeling and Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter investigates the performance of content caching in a heterogeneous cellular network (HetNet) consisting of fluid antenna system (FAS)-equipped mobile users (MUs) and millimeter-wave (mm-wave) single-antenna small base stations (SBSs), distributed according to the independent homogeneous Poisson point processes (HPPP). In particular, it is assumed that the most popular contents are cached in the SBSs to serve the FAS-equipped MUs requests. To assess the system performance, we derive compact expressions for the successful content delivery probability (SCDP) and the content delivery delay (CDD) using the Gauss-Laguerre quadrature technique. Our numerical results show that the performance of cache-enabled mm-wave HetNets can be greatly improved, when the FAS is utilized at the MUs instead of traditional fixed-antenna system deployment.</description>

      <title>Computer classification of linear codes based on lattice point enumeration and integer linear programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linear codes play a central role in coding theory and have applications in several branches of mathematics. For error correction purposes the minimum Hamming distance should be as large as possible. Linear codes related to applications in Galois Geometry often require a certain divisibility of the occurring weights. In this paper we present an algorithmic framework for the classification of linear codes over finite fields with restricted sets of weights. The underlying algorithms are based on lattice point enumeration and integer linear programming. We present new enumeration and non-existence results for projective two-weight codes, divisible codes, and additive $\mathbb{F}_4$-codes.</description>

      <title>Robust Analysis of Full-Duplex Two-Way Space Shift Keying With RIS Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted index modulation system schemes are considered a promising technology for sixth-generation (6G) wireless communication systems, which can enhance various system capabilities such as coverage and reliability. However, obtaining perfect channel state information (CSI) is challenging due to the lack of a radio frequency chain in RIS. In this paper, we investigate the RIS-assisted full-duplex (FD) two-way space shift keying (SSK) system under imperfect CSI, where the signal emissions are augmented by deploying RISs in the vicinity of two FD users. The maximum likelihood detector is utilized to recover the transmit antenna index. With this in mind, we derive closed-form average bit error probability (ABEP) expression based on the Gaussian-Chebyshev quadrature (GCQ) method and provide the upper bound and asymptotic ABEP expressions in the presence of channel estimation errors. To gain more insights, we also derive the outage probability and provide the throughput of the proposed scheme with imperfect CSI. The correctness of the analytical derivation results is confirmed via Monte Carlo simulations. It is demonstrated that increasing the number of elements of RIS can significantly improve the ABEP performance of the FD system over the half-duplex (HD) system. Furthermore, in the high SNR region, the ABEP performance of the FD system is better than that of the HD system.</description>

      <title>A Novel Temperature-based Model for SWIPT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, a novel communication paradigm for simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) is proposed, which leverages the thermal characteristics of electromagnetic signals. In particular, the proposed scheme exploits the inherent thermal dynamics of electromagnetic signals, enabling the seamless integration of information decoding and energy harvesting (EH). As a consequence, in contrast to conventional SWIPT techniques, the proposed model eliminates the need to divide the received signal into orthogonal components. By exploiting the thermal correlation between consecutive time slots, the communication channel is converted to a virtual multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel with memory. We evaluate the achievable rate of the proposed temperature-modulated channel for uniform and exponential input distributions and assess its performance in terms of harvested energy through a non-linear harvesting model. Our numerical results reveal that the exponential distribution outperforms the uniform distribution in rate and harvested energy at low input power levels, while the uniform distribution achieves a better EH performance at high input power levels.</description>

      <title>Physics-compliant diagonal representation of beyond-diagonal RIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-compliant models of RIS-parametrized channels assign a load-terminated port to each RIS element. For conventional diagonal RIS (D-RIS), each auxiliary port is terminated by its own independent and individually tunable load (i.e., independent of the other auxiliary ports). For beyond-diagonal RIS (BD-RIS), the auxiliary ports are terminated by a tunable load circuit which couples the auxiliary ports to each other. Here, we point out that a physics-compliant model of the load circuit of a BD-RIS takes the same form as a physics-compliant model of a D-RIS-parametrized radio environment: a multi-port network with a subset of ports terminated by individually tunable loads (independent of each other). Consequently, we recognize that a BD-RIS-parametrized radio environment can be understood as a multi-port cascade network (i.e., the cascade of radio environment with load circuit) terminated by individually tunable loads (independent of each other). Hence, the BD-RIS problem can be mapped into the original D-RIS problem by replacing the radio environment with the cascade of radio environment and load circuit. The insight that BD-RIS can be physics-compliantly analyzed with the conventional D-RIS formalism implies that (i) the same optimization protocols as for D-RIS can be used for the BD-RIS case, and (ii) it is unclear if existing comparisons between BD-RIS and D-RIS are fair because for a fixed number of RIS elements, a BD-RIS has usually more tunable lumped elements.</description>

      <title>HILL: Hierarchy-aware Information Lossless Contrastive Learning for Hierarchical Text Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing self-supervised methods in natural language processing (NLP), especially hierarchical text classification (HTC), mainly focus on self-supervised contrastive learning, extremely relying on human-designed augmentation rules to generate contrastive samples, which can potentially corrupt or distort the original information. In this paper, we tend to investigate the feasibility of a contrastive learning scheme in which the semantic and syntactic information inherent in the input sample is adequately reserved in the contrastive samples and fused during the learning process. Specifically, we propose an information lossless contrastive learning strategy for HTC, namely \textbf{H}ierarchy-aware \textbf{I}nformation \textbf{L}ossless contrastive \textbf{L}earning (HILL), which consists of a text encoder representing the input document, and a structure encoder directly generating the positive sample. The structure encoder takes the document embedding as input, extracts the essential syntactic information inherent in the label hierarchy with the principle of structural entropy minimization, and injects the syntactic information into the text representation via hierarchical representation learning. Experiments on three common datasets are conducted to verify the superiority of HILL.</description>

      <title>FedMIL: Federated-Multiple Instance Learning for Video Analysis with Optimized DPP Scheduling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many AI platforms, including traffic monitoring systems, use Federated Learning (FL) for decentralized sensor data processing for learning-based applications while preserving privacy and ensuring secured information transfer. On the other hand, applying supervised learning to large data samples, like high-resolution images requires intensive human labor to label different parts of a data sample. Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) alleviates this challenge by operating over labels assigned to the 'bag' of instances. In this paper, we introduce Federated Multiple-Instance Learning (FedMIL). This framework applies federated learning to boost the training performance in video-based MIL tasks such as vehicle accident detection using distributed CCTV networks. However, data sources in decentralized settings are not typically Independently and Identically Distributed (IID), making client selection imperative to collectively represent the entire dataset with minimal clients. To address this challenge, we propose DPPQ, a framework based on the Determinantal Point Process (DPP) with a quality-based kernel to select clients with the most diverse datasets that achieve better performance compared to both random selection and current DPP-based client selection methods even with less data utilization in the majority of non-IID cases. This offers a significant advantage for deployment on edge devices with limited computational resources, providing a reliable solution for training AI models in massive smart sensor networks.</description>

      <title>Leveraging A Variety of Anchors in Cellular Network for Ubiquitous Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has recently attracted tremendous attention from both academia and industry, being envisioned as a key part of the standards for the sixth-generation (6G) cellular network. A key challenge of 6G-oriented ISAC lies in how to perform ubiquitous sensing based on the communication signals and devices. Previous works have made great progresses on studying the signal waveform design that leads to optimal communication-sensing performance tradeoff. In this article, we aim to focus on issues arising from the exploitation of the communication devices for sensing in 6G network. Particularly, we will discuss about how to leverage various nodes available in the cellular network as anchors to perform ubiquitous sensing. On one hand, the base stations (BSs) will be the most important anchors in the future 6G ISAC network, since they can generate/process radio signals with high range/angle resolutions, and their positions are precisely known. Correspondingly, we will first study the BS-based sensing technique. On the other hand, the BSs alone may not enable ubiquitous sensing, since they cannot cover all the places with strong line-of-sight (LOS) links. This motivates us to investigate the possibility of using other nodes that are with higher density in the network to act as the anchors. Along this line, we are interested in two types of new anchors - user equipments (UEs) and reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs). This paper will shed light on the opportunities and challenges brought by UE-assisted sensing and RIS-assisted sensing. Our goal is to devise a novel 6G-oriented sensing architecture where BSs, UEs, and RISs can work together to provide ubiquitous sensing services.</description>

      <title>Sample complexity of quantum hypothesis testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum hypothesis testing has been traditionally studied from the information-theoretic perspective, wherein one is interested in the optimal decay rate of error probabilities as a function of the number of samples of an unknown state. In this paper, we study the sample complexity of quantum hypothesis testing, wherein the goal is to determine the minimum number of samples needed to reach a desired error probability. By making use of the wealth of knowledge that already exists in the literature on quantum hypothesis testing, we characterize the sample complexity of binary quantum hypothesis testing in the symmetric and asymmetric settings, and we provide bounds on the sample complexity of multiple quantum hypothesis testing. In more detail, we prove that the sample complexity of symmetric binary quantum hypothesis testing depends logarithmically on the inverse error probability and inversely on the negative logarithm of the fidelity. As a counterpart of the quantum Stein's lemma, we also find that the sample complexity of asymmetric binary quantum hypothesis testing depends logarithmically on the inverse type~II error probability and inversely on the quantum relative entropy. Finally, we provide lower and upper bounds on the sample complexity of multiple quantum hypothesis testing, with it remaining an intriguing open question to improve these bounds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a reciprocity calibration method for dual-antenna repeaters in wireless networks. The method uses bi-directional measurements between two network nodes, A and B, where for each bi-directional measurement, the repeaters are configured in different states. The nodes A and B could be two access points in a distributed MIMO system, or they could be a base station and a mobile user terminal, for example. From the calibration measurements, the differences between the repeaters' forward and reverse gains are estimated. The repeaters are then (re-)configured to compensate for these differences such that the repeaters appear, transparently to the network, as reciprocal components of the propagation environment, enabling reciprocity-based beamforming in the network.</description>

      <title>On Codes for the Noisy Substring Channel</title>

      <description>arXiv:2102.01412v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of coding for the substring channel, in which information strings are observed only through their (multisets of) substrings. Due to existing DNA sequencing techniques and applications in DNA-based storage systems, interest in this channel has renewed in recent years. In contrast to existing literature, we consider a noisy channel model where information is subject to noise before its substrings are sampled, motivated by in-vivo storage. We study two separate noise models, substitutions or deletions. In both cases, we examine families of codes which may be utilized for error-correction and present combinatorial bounds on their sizes. Through a generalization of the concept of repeat-free strings, we show that the added required redundancy due to this imperfect observation assumption is sublinear, either when the fraction of errors in the observed substring length is sufficiently small, or when that length is sufficiently long. This suggests that no asymptotic cost in rate is incurred by this channel model in these cases. Moreover, we develop an efficient encoder for such constrained strings in some cases. Finally, we show how a similar encoder can be used to avoid formation of secondary-structures in coded DNA strands, even when accounting for imperfect structures.</description>

      <title>Achievable Sum Rate Optimization on NOMA-aided Cell-Free Massive MIMO with Finite Blocklength Coding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.02107v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)-aided cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CFmMIMO) has been considered as a promising technology to fulfill strict quality of service requirements for ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC). However, finite blocklength coding (FBC) in URLLC makes it challenging to achieve the optimal performance in the NOMA-aided CFmMIMO system. In this paper, we investigate the performance of the NOMA-aided CFmMIMO system with FBC in terms of achievable sum rate (ASR). Firstly, we derive a lower bound (LB) on the ergodic data rate. Then, we formulate an ASR maximization problem by jointly considering power allocation and user equipment (UE) clustering. To tackle such an intractable problem, we decompose it into two sub-problems, i.e., the power allocation problem and the UE clustering problem. A successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithm is proposed to solve the power allocation problem by transforming it into a series of geometric programming problems. Meanwhile, two algorithms based on graph theory are proposed to solve the UE clustering problem by identifying negative loops. Finally, alternative optimization is performed to find the maximum ASR of the NOMA-aided CFmMIMO system with FBC. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms significantly outperform the benchmark algorithms in terms of ASR under various scenarios.</description>

Abstract: Upon the advent of the emerging metaverse and its related applications in Augmented Reality (AR), the current bit-oriented network struggles to support real-time changes for the vast amount of associated information, hindering its development. Thus, a critical revolution in the Sixth Generation (6G) networks is envisioned through the joint exploitation of information context and its importance to the task, leading to a communication paradigm shift towards semantic and effectiveness levels. However, current research has not yet proposed any explicit and systematic communication framework for AR applications that incorporate these two levels. To fill this research gap, this paper presents a task-oriented and semantics-aware communication framework for augmented reality (TSAR) to enhance communication efficiency and effectiveness in 6G. Specifically, we first analyse the traditional wireless AR point cloud communication framework and then summarize our proposed semantic information along with the end-to-end wireless communication. We then detail the design blocks of the TSAR framework, covering both semantic and effectiveness levels. Finally, numerous experiments have been conducted to demonstrate that, compared to the traditional point cloud communication framework, our proposed TSAR significantly reduces wireless AR application transmission latency by 95.6%, while improving communication effectiveness in geometry and color aspects by up to 82.4% and 20.4%, respectively.</description>

      <title>OTFS-based Robust MMSE Precoding Design in Over-the-air Computation</title>

Abstract: Over-the-air computation (AirComp), as a data aggregation method that can improve network efficiency by exploiting the superposition characteristics of wireless channels, has received much attention recently. Meanwhile, the orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation can provide a strong Doppler resilience and facilitate reliable transmission for high-mobility communications. Hence, in this work, we investigate an OTFS-based AirComp system in the presence of time-frequency dual-selective channels. In particular, we commence from the development of a novel transmission framework for the considered system, where the pilot signal is sent together with data, and the channel estimation is implemented according to the echo from the access point to the sensor, thereby reducing the overhead of channel state information (CSI) feedback. Hereafter, based on the CSI estimated from the previous frame, a robust precoding matrix aiming at minimizing mean square error in the current frame is designed, which takes into account the estimation error from the receiver noise and the outdated CSI. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed robust precoding scheme by comparing it with the non-robust precoding. The performance gain is more obvious in a high signal-to-noise ratio in case of large channel estimation errors.</description>

      <title>Time-Frequency-Space Transmit Design and Receiver Processing with Dynamic Subarray for Terahertz Integrated Sensing and Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.04440v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Terahertz (THz) integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) enables simultaneous data transmission with Terabit-per-second (Tbps) rate and millimeter-level accurate sensing. To realize such a blueprint, ultra-massive antenna arrays with directional beamforming are used to compensate for severe path loss in the THz band. In this paper, the time-frequency-space transmit design is investigated for THz ISAC to generate time-varying scanning sensing beams and stable communication beams. Specifically, with the dynamic array-of-subarray (DAoSA) hybrid beamforming architecture and multi-carrier modulation, two ISAC hybrid precoding algorithms are proposed, namely, a vectorization (VEC) based algorithm that outperforms existing ISAC hybrid precoding methods and a low-complexity sensing codebook assisted (SCA) approach. Meanwhile, coupled with the transmit design, parameter estimation algorithms are proposed to realize high-accuracy sensing, including a wideband DAoSA MUSIC method for angle estimation and a sum-DFT-GSS approach for range and velocity estimation. Numerical results indicate that the proposed algorithms can realize centi-degree-level angle estimation accuracy and millimeter-level range estimation accuracy, which are one or two orders of magnitudes better than the methods in the millimeter-wave band. In addition, to overcome the cyclic prefix limitation and Doppler effects, an inter-symbol interference- and inter-carrier interference-tackled sensing algorithm is developed to refine sensing capabilities for THz ISAC.</description>

      <title>Near-Field Multiuser Beam-Training for Extremely Large-Scale MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13597v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) systems are capable of improving spectral efficiency by employing far more antennas than conventional massive MIMO at the base station (BS). However, beam training in multiuser XL-MIMO systems is challenging. To tackle these issues, we conceive a three-phase graph neural network (GNN)-based beam training scheme for multiuser XL-MIMO systems. In the first phase, only far-field wide beams have to be tested for each user and the GNN is utilized to map the beamforming gain information of the far-field wide beams to the optimal near-field beam for each user. In addition, the proposed GNN-based scheme can exploit the position-correlation between adjacent users for further improvement of the accuracy of beam training. In the second phase, a beam allocation scheme based on the probability vectors produced at the outputs of GNNs is proposed to address the above beam-direction conflicts between users. In the third phase, the hybrid TBF is designed for further reducing the inter-user interference. Our simulation results show that the proposed scheme improves the beam training performance of the benchmarks. Moreover, the performance of the proposed beam training scheme approaches that of an exhaustive search, despite requiring only about 7% of the pilot overhead.</description>

      <title>RIS-assisted Cell-Free Massive MIMO Systems With Two-Timescale Design and Hardware Impairments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15588v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrating the reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) into a cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) system is an effective solution to achieve high system capacity with low cost and power consumption. However, existing works of RIS-assisted systems mostly assumed perfect hardware, while the impact of hardware impairments (HWIs) is generally ignored. In this paper, we consider the general Rician fading channel and uplink transmission of the RIS-assisted CF-mMIMO system under transceiver impairments and RIS phase noise. To reduce the feedback overhead and power consumption, we propose a two-timescale transmission scheme to optimize the passive beamformers at RISs with statistical channel state information (CSI), while transmit beamformers at access points (APs) are designed based on instantaneous CSI. Also, the maximum ratio combining (MRC) detection is applied to the central processing unit (CPU). On this basis, we derive the closed-form approximate expression of the achievable rate, based on which the impact of HWIs and the power scaling laws are analyzed to draw useful theoretical insights. To maximize the users' sum rate or minimum rate, we first transform our rate expression into a tractable form, and then optimize the phase shifts of RISs based on an accelerated gradient ascent method. Finally, numerical results are presented to demonstrate the correctness of our derived expressions and validate the previous analysis, which provide some guidelines for the practical application of the imperfect RISs in the CF-mMIMO with transceiver HWIs.</description>

      <title>Modelling Irrational Behaviour of Residential End Users using Non-Stationary Gaussian Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.09012v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Demand response (DR) plays a critical role in ensuring efficient electricity consumption and optimal use of network assets. Yet, existing DR models often overlook a crucial element, the irrational behaviour of electricity end users. In this work, we propose a price-responsive model that incorporates key aspects of end-user irrationality, specifically loss aversion, time inconsistency, and bounded rationality. To this end, we first develop a framework that uses Multiple Seasonal-Trend decomposition using Loess (MSTL) and non-stationary Gaussian processes to model the randomness in the electricity consumption by residential consumers. The impact of this model is then evaluated through a community battery storage (CBS) business model. Additionally, we apply a chance-constrained optimisation model for CBS operation that deals with the unpredictability of the end-user irrationality. Our simulations using real-world data show that the proposed DR model provides a more realistic estimate of end-user price-responsive behaviour when considering irrationality. Compared to a deterministic model that cannot fully take into account the irrational behaviour of end users, the chance-constrained CBS operation model yields an additional 19% revenue. Lastly, the business model reduces the electricity costs of solar end users by 11%.</description>
