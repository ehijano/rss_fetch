      <title>Deep Learning and Chaos: A combined Approach To Image Encryption and Decryption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel image encryption and decryption algorithm using hyperchaotic signals from the novel 3D hyperchaotic map, 2D memristor map, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and key sensitivity analysis to achieve robust security and high efficiency. The encryption starts with the scrambling of gray images by using a 3D hyperchaotic map to yield complex sequences under disruption of pixel values; the robustness of this original encryption is further reinforced by employing a CNN to learn the intricate patterns and add the safety layer. The robustness of the encryption algorithm is shown by key sensitivity analysis, i.e., the average sensitivity of the algorithm to key elements. The other factors and systems of unauthorized decryption, even with slight variations in the keys, can alter the decryption procedure, resulting in the ineffective recreation of the decrypted image. Statistical analysis includes entropy analysis, correlation analysis, histogram analysis, and other security analyses like anomaly detection, all of which confirm the high security and effectiveness of the proposed encryption method. Testing of the algorithm under various noisy conditions is carried out to test robustness against Gaussian noise. Metrics for differential analysis, such as the NPCR (Number of Pixel Change Rate)and UACI (Unified Average Change Intensity), are also used to determine the strength of encryption. At the same time, the empirical validation was performed on several test images, which showed that the proposed encryption techniques have practical applicability and are robust to noise. Simulation results and comparative analyses illustrate that our encryption scheme possesses excellent visual security, decryption quality, and computational efficiency, and thus, it is efficient for secure image transmission and storage in big data applications.</description>

      <title>Adaptive spectral proper orthogonal decomposition of tonal flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02385v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An adaptive algorithm for spectral proper orthogonal decomposition (SPOD) of mixed broadband-tonal turbulent flows is developed. Sharp peak resolution at tonal frequencies is achieved by locally minimizing the bias of the spectrum. Smooth spectrum estimates of broadband regions are achieved by locally reducing the variance of the spectrum. The method utilizes multitaper estimation with sine tapers. An iterative criterion based on modal convergence is introduced to enable the SPOD to adapt to spectral features. For tonal flows, the adaptivity is controlled by a single user input; for broadband flows, a constant number of sine tapers is recommended without adaptivity. The discrete version of Parseval's theorem for SPOD is stated. Proper normalization of the tapers ensures that Parseval's theorem is satisfied in expectation. Drastic savings in computational complexity and memory usage are facilitated by two aspects: (i) sine tapers, which permit post hoc windowing of a single Fourier transform; and (ii) time-domain lossless compression using a QR or eigenvalue decomposition. Sine-taper SPOD is demonstrated on time-resolved particle image velocimetry (TR-PIV) data from an open cavity flow and high-fidelity large-eddy simulation (LES) data from a round jet, with and without adaptivity. For the tonal cavity flow, the adaptive algorithm outperforms Slepian-based multitaper SPOD in terms of variance and local bias of the spectrum, mode convergence, and memory usage.</description>
