      <title>Comments on "Non-local Nucleon Matrix Elements in the Rest Frame"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent paper, "Non-local Nucleon Matrix Elements in the Rest Frame" (arXiv: 2407.16577), it was demonstrated that the next-to-leading order perturbative theory can describe, to a few percent accuracy, the lattice QCD static nucleon matrix elements of spatial correlators with separations up to 0.6~fm. We argue that perturbative QCD breaks down at such a distance scale after resumming the associated large logarithms, while the ansatz used in the analysis there did not account for resummation or the leading renormalon, both of which significantly affect the convergence of perturbation theory. Besides, we provide an explanation why the ansatz appears to describe the lattice data despite the breakdown of perturbation theory at large distances.</description>

      <title>One Born$-$Oppenheimer Effective Theory to rule them all: hybrids, tetraquarks, pentaquarks, doubly heavy baryons and quarkonium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of XYZ exotic states in the hadronic sector with two heavy quarks, represents a significant challenge in particle theory. Understanding and predicting their nature remains an open problem. In this work, we demonstrate how the Born$-$Oppenheimer (BO) effective field theory (BOEFT), derived from Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) on the basis of scale separation and symmetries, can address XYZ exotics of any composition. We derive the Schr\"odinger coupled equations that describe hybrids, tetraquarks, pentaquarks, doubly heavy baryons, and quarkonia at leading order, incorporating nonadiabatic terms, and present the predicted multiples. We define the static potentials in terms of the QCD static energies for all relevant cases. We provide the precise form of the nonperturbative low-energy gauge-invariant correlators required for the BOEFT: static energies, generalized Wilson loops, gluelumps, and adjoint mesons. These are to be calculated on the lattice and we calculate here their short-distance behavior. Furthermore, we outline how spin-dependent corrections and mixing terms can be incorporated using matching computations. Lastly, we discuss how static energies with the same BO quantum numbers mix at large distances leading to the phenomenon of avoided level crossing. This effect is crucial to understand the emergence of exotics with molecular characteristics, such as the $\chi_{c1}(3872)$. With BOEFT both the tetraquark and the molecular picture appear as part of the same description.</description>

      <title>Functional Equations and Pole Structure of the Bartholdi Zeta Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the Bartholdi zeta function on a connected simple digraph with $n_V$ vertices and $n_E$ edges. We derive a functional equation for the Bartholdi zeta function $\zeta_G(q,u)$ on a regular graph $G$ with respect to the bump parameter $u$. We also find an equivalence between the Bartholdi zeta function with a specific value of $u$ and the Ihara zeta function at $u=0$. We determine bounds of the critical strip of $\zeta_G(q,u)$ for a general graph. If $G$ is a $(t+1)$-regular graph, the bounds are saturated and $q=(1-u)^{-1}$ and $q=(t+u)^{-1}$ are the poles at the boundaries of the critical strip for $u\ne 1, -t$. When $G$ is the regular graph and the spectrum of the adjacency matrix satisfies a certain condition, $\zeta_G(q,u)$ satisfies the so-called Riemann hypothesis. For $u \ne 1$, $q=\pm(1-u)^{-1}$ are poles of $\zeta_G(q,u)$ unless $G$ is tree. Although the order of the pole at $q=(1-u)^{-1}$ is $n_E-n_V+1$ if $u\ne u_* \equiv 1-\frac{n_E}{n_V}$, it is enhanced at $u=u_*$. In particular, if the Moore-Penrose inverse of the incidence matrix $L^+$ and the degree vector $\vec{d}$ satisfy the condition $|L^+ \vec{d}|^2\ne n_E$, the order of the pole at $q=(1-u)^{-1}$ increases only by one at $u=u_*$. The order of the pole at $q=-(1-u)^{-1}$ coincides with that at $q=(1-u)^{-1}$ if $G$ is bipartite and is $n_E-n_V$ otherwise.</description>

      <title>New Field Theories with Foliation Structure and Subdimensional Particles from Godbillon-Vey Invariant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, subdimensional particles including fractons have attracted much attention from various areas. Notable features of such matter phases are mobility constraints and subextensive ground state degeneracies (GSDs). In this paper, we propose a BF-like theory motivated by the Godbillon-Vey invariant, which is a mathematical invariant of the foliated manifold. Our theory hosts subsystem higher form symmetries which manifestly ensure the mobility constraint and subextensive GSD through the spontaneous symmetry breaking. We also discuss some lattice spin models which realize the same low energy behaviours as the BF-like theory. Furthermore, we explore dynamical matter theories which are coupled to the BF-like theory.</description>

      <title>Tensor renormalization group study of the three-dimensional SU(2) and SU(3) gauge theories with the reduced tensor network formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16763v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a tensor renormalization group simulation of non-Abelian gauge theory in three dimensions using a formulation based on the `armillary sphere.' In this formulation, matrix indices are completely traced out, eliminating the degeneracy in the singular value spectrum of the initial tensor. We demonstrate the usefulness of this technique by computing the average plaquette at zero temperature and the Polyakov loop susceptibility at finite temperatures for 2+1D SU(2) and SU(3) gauge theories. The deconfinement transition is identified for both gauge groups, with the SU(2) case being consistent with previous Monte Carlo results.</description>

      <title>Study of the mass of pseudoscalar glueball with a deep neural network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12010v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A deep neural network (DNN) is utilized to study the mass of the pseudoscalar glueball in lattice QCD based on Monte Carlo simulations. To obtain an accurate and stable mass value, I constructed a new network. The results show that this DNN provides a more precise and stable mass estimate compared to the traditional least squares method.</description>

      <title>Gross-Witten-Wadia Phase Transition in Induced QCD on the Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.03692v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine a modification of the Kazakov-Migdal (KM) model with gauge group $U(N_c)$, where the adjoint scalar fields in the conventional KM model are replaced by $N_f$ fundamental scalar fields (FKM model). After tuning the coupling constants and eliminating the fundamental scalar fields, the partition function of this model is expressed as an integral of a graph zeta function weighted by unitary matrices. The FKM model on cycle graphs at large $N_c$ exhibits the Gross-Witten-Wadia (GWW) phase transition only when $N_f &gt; N_c$. In the large $N_c$ limit, we evaluate the free energy of the model on a general graph in two distinct parameter regimes and demonstrate that the FKM model generally consists of multiple phases. The effective action of the FKM model reduces to the standard Wilson action by taking an appropriate scaling limit when the graph consists of plaquettes (fundamental cycles) of the same size, as in the square lattice case. We show that, for the FKM model on such a graph, the third-order GWW phase transition universally occurs in this scaling limit.</description>
