      <title>Magnetic reconnection: an alternative explanation of radio emission in galaxy clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations of galaxy clusters show radio emission extended over almost the system scale, necessitating mechanisms for particle acceleration. Previous models for acceleration such as diffusive shock acceleration and that due to turbulence fall short in terms of efficiency. In this letter, we propose the possibility of acceleration via magnetic reconnection. In particular, we invoke the plasmoid instability which has been previously applied to understand particle energization in high energy systems. Turbulence in galaxy clusters lead to fluctuation dynamos that are known to generate magnetic fields structures consisting of sharp reversals. These form natural sites of reconnection. We perform Particle-In-Cell (PIC) simulations of the plasmoid instability in collisionless and nonrelativistic plasmas. We show that the resulting particle energy spectra have power law indices that are consistent with that inferred from observations. Our estimates of the maximum achievable Lorentz factor is about $10^5$ indicating that acceleration due magnetic reconnection is a promising avenue for understanding the origin of nonthermal emission in galaxy clusters.</description>

      <title>Impact of evolving dark energy on the search for primordial gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent data seem to suggest a preference for the evolving dark energy (DE). However, if the case is actually so, and not caused by unknown systematics in data, it might impact our understanding about our Universe in an anomalous way due to the shifts of some primary parameters. As an example, we present the search for the primordial gravitational waves, based on the evolving DE. The joint analysis of recent BICEP/Keck cosmic microwave background (CMB) B-mode polarization data with Planck18 CMB, DESI baryon acoustic oscillations and PantheonPlus data shows that the bestfit tensor-to-scalar ratio is $r_{0.05}\sim 0.01$, and the lower bound of $r_{0.05}$ is $\sim 2\sigma$ non-zero.</description>

      <title>Modeling Foreground Spatial Variations in 21 cm Gaussian Process Component Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gaussian processes (GPs) have been extensively utilized as nonparametric models for component separation in 21 cm data analyses. This exploits the distinct spectral behavior of the cosmological and foreground signals, which are modeled through the GP covariance kernel. Previous approaches have employed a global GP kernel along all lines of sight (LoS). In this work, we study Bayesian approaches that allow for spatial variations in foreground kernel parameters, testing them against simulated HI intensity mapping observations. We consider a no-pooling (NP) model, which treats each LoS independently by fitting for separate covariance kernels, and a hierarchical Gaussian Process (HGP) model that allows for variation in kernel parameters between different LoS, regularized through a global hyperprior. We find that accounting for spatial variations in the GP kernel parameters results in a significant improvement in cosmological signal recovery, achieving up to a 30% reduction in the standard deviation of the residual distribution and improved model predictive performance. Allowing for spatial variations in GP kernel parameters also improves the recovery of the HI power spectra and wavelet scattering transform coefficients. Whilst the NP model achieves superior recovery as measured by the residual distribution, it demands extensive computational resources, faces formidable convergence challenges, and is prone to overfitting. Conversely, the HGP model strikes a balance between the accuracy and robustness of the signal recovery. Further improvements to the HGP model will require more physically motivated modeling of foreground spatial variations.</description>

      <title>The impact of lossy data compression on the power spectrum of the high redshift 21-cm signal with LOFAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current radio interferometers output multi-petabyte-scale volumes of data per year making the storage, transfer, and processing of this data a sizeable challenge. This challenge is expected to grow with the next-generation telescopes such as the Square Kilometre Array. Lossy compression of interferometric data post-correlation can abate this challenge. However, since high-redshift 21-cm studies impose strict precision requirements, the impact of such lossy data compression on the 21-cm signal power spectrum statistic should be understood. We apply Dysco visibility compression, a technique to normalize and quantize specifically designed for radio interferometric data. We establish the level of the compression noise in the power spectrum in comparison to the thermal noise as well as its coherency behavior. Finally, for optimal compression results, we compare the compression noise obtained from different compression settings to a nominal 21-cm signal power. From a single night of observation, we find that the noise introduced due to the compression is more than five orders of magnitude lower than the thermal noise level in the power spectrum. The noise does not affect calibration. The compression noise shows no correlation with the sky signal and has no measurable coherent component. The level of compression error in the power spectrum ultimately depends on the compression settings. Dysco visibility compression is found to be of insignificant concern for 21-cm power spectrum studies. Hence, data volumes can be safely reduced by factors of $\sim 4$ and with insignificant bias to the final power spectrum. Data from SKA-low will likely be compressible by the same factor as LOFAR, owing to the similarities of the two instruments. The same technique can be used to compress data from other telescopes, but a small adjustment of the compression parameters might be required.</description>

      <title>Discovering the Cosmic Evolution of Supermassive Black Holes using Nano-Hertz Gravitational Waves and Galaxy Surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation and evolution of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in the Universe remains an open question in cosmology. We show for the first time that the evolution of SMBHs with redshift leads to a unique signature on the angular cross-correlation power spectrum between the multi-frequency nano-hertz (nHz) stochastic gravitational wave (SGWB) and the galaxy density in the Universe. By using galaxy catalogs from the upcoming Rubin LSST Observatory in synergy with the nHz SGWB signal accessible from the Square Kilometer Array, we can measure this signal with a signal-to-noise ratio above five, thereby opening a new observational window to the cosmic evolution of SMBHs across redshift. This discovery space that can be opened by the cross-correlation of the nHz SGWB will not be possible by any other currently known techniques.</description>

      <title>Inferring the mass content of galaxy clusters with satellite kinematics and Jeans Anisotropic modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Satellite galaxies can be used to indicate the dynamical mass of galaxy groups and clusters. In this study, we apply the axis-symmetric Jeans Anisotropic Multi-Gaussian Expansion JAM modeling to satellite galaxies in 28 galaxy clusters selected from the TNG300-1 simulation with halo mass of $\log_{10}M_{200}/M_\odot&gt;14.3$. If using true bound satellites as tracers, the best constrained total mass within the half-mass radius of satellites, $M(&lt;r_\mathrm{half})$, and the virial mass, $M_{200}$, have average biases of -0.01 and $0.03$~dex, with average scatters of 0.11~dex and 0.15~dex. If selecting companions in redshift space with line-of-sight depth of 2,000~km/s, the biases are -0.06 and $0.01$~dex, while the scatters are 0.12 and 0.18~dex for $M(&lt;r_\mathrm{half})$ and $M_{200}$. By comparing the best-fitting and actual density profiles, we find $\sim$29% of best-fitting density profiles show very good agreement with the truth, $\sim$32% display over or under estimates at most of the radial range with biased $M(&lt;r_\mathrm{half})$, and 39% show under/over estimates in central regions and over/under estimates in the outskirts, with good constraints on $M(&lt;r_\mathrm{half})$, yet most of the best constraints are still consistent with the true profiles within 1-$\sigma$ statistical uncertainties for the three circumstances. Using a mock DESI Bright Galaxy Survey catalog with the effect of fiber incompleteness, we find DESI fiber assignments and the choice of flux limits barely modify the velocity dispersion profiles and are thus unlikely to affect the dynamical modeling outcomes. Our results show that with current and future deep spectroscopic surveys, JAM can be a powerful tool to constrain the underlying density profiles of individual massive galaxy clusters.</description>

      <title>Revisiting primordial magnetic fields through 21-cm physics: Bounds and forecasts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Primordial magnetic fields (PMFs) may significantly influence 21-cm physics via two mechanisms: (i) magnetic heating of the intergalactic medium (IGM) through ambipolar diffusion (AD) and decaying magnetohydrodynamic turbulence (DT), (ii) impact on the star formation rate density (SFRD) through small-scale enhancement of the matter power spectrum. In this analysis, we integrate both of these effects within a unified analytical framework and use it to determine upper bounds on the parameter space of a nearly scale-invariant non-helical PMF in the light of the global 21-cm signal observed by EDGES. Our findings reveal that the joint consideration of both effects furnishes constraints of the order $B_0\lesssim\mathcal{O}(10^{-2})$ nG on the present-day magnetic field strength, which are considerably tighter compared to earlier analyses. We subsequently explore the prospects of detecting such a magnetized 21-cm power spectrum at the upcoming SKA-Low mission. For the relevant parameters of the PMF ($B_0$ and $n_{\!_{B}}$) and the excess radio background ($\xi$), SNR estimation and Fisher forecast analysis indicate that it may be possible to constrain these three parameters with relative $1\sigma$ uncertainties $\lesssim10\%$ and an associated SNR $\gtrsim10$ at SKA-Low. This also leads to possible correlations among these three parameters, thus revealing intriguing trends of interplay among the various physical processes involved.</description>

      <title>mochi_class: Modelling Optimisation to Compute Horndeski In class</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce mochi_class, an extension of the Einstein-Boltzmann solver hi_class, designed to unlock the full phenomenological potential of Horndeski gravity. This extension allows for general input functions of time without the need for hard-coded parametrisations or covariant Lagrangians. By replacing the traditional $\alpha$-parametrisation with a set of stable basis functions, mochi_class ensures that the resulting effective theories are inherently free from gradient and ghost instabilities. Additionally, mochi_class features a quasi-static approximation implemented at the level of modified metric potentials, enhancing prediction accuracy, especially for models transitioning between a super- and sub-Compton regime. mochi_class can robustly handle a wide range of models without fine-tuning, and introduces a new approximation scheme that activates modifications to the standard cosmology deep in the matter-dominated era. Furthermore, it incorporates viability conditions on the equation of motion for the scalar field fluctuations, aiding in the identification of numerical instabilities. Through comprehensive validation against other Einstein-Boltzmann solvers, mochi_class demonstrates excellent performance and accuracy, broadening the scope of hi_class by facilitating the study of specific modified gravity models and enabling exploration of previously inaccessible regions of the Horndeski landscape.

      <title>Q-Balls in the Presence of Attractive Force</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Q-balls are non-topological solitons in field theories whose stability is typically guaranteed by the existence of a global conserved charge. A classic realization is the Friedberg-Lee-Sirlin (FLS) Q-ball in a two-scalar system where a real scalar $\chi$ triggers the symmetry breaking and confining a complex scalar $\Phi$ with a global $U(1)$ symmetry. A quartic interaction $\kappa \chi^2|\Phi|^2$ with $\kappa&gt;0$ is usually considered to produce a nontrivial Q-ball configuration, and this repulsive force contributes to its stability. On the other hand, the attractive cubic interaction $\Lambda \chi |\Phi|^2$ is generally allowed in a renormalizable theory and could induce an instability. In this paper, we study the behavior of the Q-ball under the influence of this attractive force which has been overlooked. We find approximate Q-ball solutions in the limit of weak and moderate force couplings using the thin-wall and thick-wall approximations respectively. Our analytical results are consistent with numerical simulations and predict the parameter dependencies of the maximum charge. A crucial difference with the ordinary FLS Q-ball is the existence of the maximum charge beyond which the Q-ball solution is classically unstable. Such a limitation of the charge fundamentally affects Q-ball formation in the early Universe and could plausibly lead to the formation of primordial black holes.</description>

      <title>Axion-Photon Mixing in 3D: Classical Equations and Geometric Optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Light particle-photon mixing in magnetised plasmas plays a vital role in constraining the existence of new physics, especially axions, dark photons, and ultra-high-frequency gravitational waves. Recently, we derived an expression for the resonant conversion of axions to photons in inhomogeneous media using kinetic theory to derive photon transport equations. In this work, we show how the same expression for the conversion probability can be obtained from the classical wave equations of axion-electrodynamics by deriving an equivalent transport equation along the photon worldline. This result provides further corroboration of this expression for the resonant production of photons from light particles, which has also recently been supported by independent numerical simulations of full axion-electrodynamics. In addition, this new approach provides a more general expression that accounts for mixing away from resonance, which is integrated along the whole worldline of the photon in a way that naturally incorporates a curved photon trajectory relevant to refractive media where the photon and light-particle worldlines differ.</description>

      <title>High-energy neutrino emission from tidal disruption event outflow-cloud interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tidal disruption events (TDEs), characterized by their luminous transients and high-velocity outflows, have emerged as plausible sources of high-energy neutrinos contributing to the diffuse neutrino. In this study, we calculate the contribution of TDEs to the diffuse neutrino by employing the outflow-cloud model within the TDE framework. Our analysis indicates that the contribution of TDEs becomes negligible when the redshift $Z$ exceeds 2. Employing a set of fiducial values, which includes outflow energy $E_{\rm kin}=10^{51}$ erg, a proton spectrum cutoff energy $E_{\rm p,max}=100$ PeV, a volume TDE rate $\dot{N}=8 \times 10^{-7}\ \rm Mpc^{-3}\ year^{-1}$, covering fraction of clouds $C_V=0.1$, energy conversion efficiency in the shock $\eta =0.1$, and a proton spectrum index $\Gamma=-1.7$, we find that TDEs can account for approximately 80\% of the contribution at energies around 0.3 PeV. Additionally, TDEs still contribute around 18\% to the IceCube data below 0.1 PeV and the total contribution is $\sim 24^{+2}_{-15}\%$. In addition, we also discuss the potential influence of various parameter values on the results in detail. With the IceCube data, we impose constraints on the combination of the physical parameters, i.e., $C_{f}=\dot{N}E_{\rm kin}C_{\rm v}\eta$. Future observations or theoretical considerations would fix some physical parameters, which will help to constrain some individual parameters of TDEs.</description>

      <title>Hyperfine structure of the methanol molecule as traced by Class I methanol masers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present results on simultaneous observations of Class~I methanol masers at 25, 36, and 44 GHz towards 22 Galactic targets carried out with the Effelsberg 100-m telescope. The study investigates relations between the hyperfine (HF) structure of the torsion-rotation transitions in CH3OH and maser activity. By analyzing the radial velocity shifts between different maser lines together with the patterns of the HF structure based on laboratory measurements and quantum-chemical calculations, we find that in any source only one specific HF transition forms the maser emission and that this transition changes from source to source. The physical conditions leading to this selective behavior are still unclear. Using accurate laboratory rest frequencies for the 25 GHz transitions, we have refined the centre frequencies for the HF multiplets at 36, 44, and 95 GHz: f_36 = (36169.2488 +/- 0.0002_stat +/- 0.0004_sys) MHz. f_44 = (44069.4176 +/- 0.0002_stat +/- 0.0004_sys) MHz, and f_95 = (95169.4414 +/- 0.0003_stat +/- 0.0004_sys) MHz. Comparison with previous observations of 44 GHz masers performed 6-10 years ago with a Korean 21-m KVN telescope towards the same targets confirms the kinematic stability of Class~I maser line profiles during this time interval and reveals a systematic radial velocity shift of 0.013 +/- 0.005 km/s between the two telescopes.</description>

      <title>Tying knots in particle physics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lord Kelvin's pioneering hypothesis that the identity of atoms is knots of vortices of the aether had a profound impact on the fields of mathematics and physics despite being subsequently refuted by experiments. While knot-like excitations emerge in various systems of condensed matter physics, the fundamental constituents of matter have been revealed to be elementary particles such as electrons and quarks, seemingly leaving no room for the appearance of knots in particle physics. Here, we show that knots indeed appear as meta-stable solitons in a realistic extension of the standard model of particle physics that provides the QCD axion and right-handed neutrinos. This result suggests that during the early Universe, a "knot dominated era" may have existed, where knots were a dominant component of the Universe, and this scenario can be tested through gravitational wave observations. Furthermore, we propose that the end of this era involves the collapse of the knots via quantum tunneling, leading to the generation of matter-antimatter asymmetry in the Universe. Our findings exhibit the significant role of knots in particle physics and represent a modern version of Kelvin's hypothesis.</description>

      <title>A $\sim 43$ GeV $\gamma$-ray line signature in the directions of a group of nearby massive galaxy clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the largest gravitationally bound objects in the Universe, galaxy clusters have provided the first piece of evidence for the presence of dark matter and may be suitable targets for indirect dark matter searches. Among various signals, the GeV-TeV $\gamma$-ray line has been taken as the smoking-gun signal of the dark matter annihilation/decay since no known astrophysical/physical process(es) could generate such a peculiar spectrum. With 15.5 years of Fermi-LAT P8R3 publicly available data, we search for the $\gamma$-ray line emission in the directions of a group of 13 nearby massive galaxy clusters with an unbinned likelihood analysis. A $\gamma$-ray line signal at $\sim 43.2$ GeV has a net TS value of $\approx 30$ if we only take into account the data in the directions of Virgo, Fornax and Ophiuchus clusters, three massive clusters with the highest J-factors expected to generate the dark matter annihilation signal. The signal still presents when the data of other 10 nearby massive clusters have also been included, though the TS value decreases to $\approx 21$ likely because of their lower signal-to-noise ratios. The absence of this signal in the inner Galaxy disfavors both the instrumental effect and the canonical dark matter annihilation interpretation, and a more sophisticated dark matter model or very peculiar astrophysical scenario might be needed. This $\gamma$-ray line signal, if intrinsic, could be unambiguously verified by the Very Large Area $\gamma$-ray Space Telescope in its first two years of performance.</description>

      <title>On the statistical theory of self-gravitating collisionless dark matter flow: high order kinematic and dynamic relations</title>

Abstract: To better understand the collisionless dark matter flow on different scales, statistical theory involving kinematic and dynamic relations must be developed for different types of flow, e.g. incompressible, constant divergence, and irrotational flow. This paper extends our previous work on the second-order statistics (Phys. Fluids 35, 077105) to high order statistics. Kinematic and dynamic relations were developed for dark matter flow on different scales. The results were validated by N-body simulations. On large scales, we found i) third-order velocity correlations can be related to density correlation or pairwise velocity; ii) the $p$th-order velocity correlations follow $\propto a^{(p+2)/2}$ for odd $p$ and $\propto a^{p/2}$ for even $p$, where $a$ is the scale factor; iii) the overdensity $\delta$ is proportional to density correlation on the same scale; iv) velocity dispersion on a given scale $r$ is proportional to the overdensity on the same scale. On small scales, i) a self-closed velocity evolution is developed by decomposing the velocity into motion in haloes and motion of haloes; ii) the evolution of vorticity and enstrophy are derived from the evolution of velocity; iii) dynamic relations are derived to relate second- and third-order correlations; iv) while the first moment of pairwise velocity follows $\langle\Delta u_L\rangle=-Har$ ($H$ is the Hubble parameter), the third moment follows $\langle(\Delta u_L)^3\rangle\propto\varepsilon_uar$ that can be directly compared with simulations and observations, where $\varepsilon_u\approx10^{-7}$m$^2$/s$^3$ is the constant rate for energy cascade; v) the $p$th order velocity correlations follow $\propto a^{(3p-5)/4}$ for odd $p$ and $\propto a^{3p/4}$ for even $p$. Finally, the combined kinematic and dynamic relations lead to exponential and one-fourth power-law velocity correlations on large and small scales, respectively.</description>

      <title>21cmEMU: an emulator of 21cmFAST summary observables</title>

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed rapid progress in observations of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). These have enabled high-dimensional inference of galaxy and intergalactic medium (IGM) properties during the first billion years of our Universe. However, even using efficient, semi-numerical simulations, traditional inference approaches that compute 3D lightcones on-the-fly can take $10^5$ core hours. Here we present 21cmEMU: an emulator of several summary observables from the popular 21cmFAST simulation code. 21cmEMU takes as input nine parameters characterizing EoR galaxies, and outputs the following summary statistics: (i) the IGM mean neutral fraction; (ii) the 21-cm power spectrum; (iii) the mean 21-cm spin temperature; (iv) the sky-averaged (global) 21-cm signal; (v) the ultraviolet (UV) luminosity functions (LFs); and (vi) the Thomson scattering optical depth to the cosmic microwave background (CMB). All observables are predicted with sub-percent median accuracy, with a reduction of the computational cost by a factor of over 10$^4$. After validating inference results, we showcase a few applications, including: (i) quantifying the relative constraining power of different observational datasets; (ii) seeing how recent claims of a late EoR impact previous inferences; and (iii) forecasting upcoming constraints from the sixth observing season of the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA) telescope. 21cmEMU is publicly-available, and is included as an alternative simulator in the public 21CMMC sampler.</description>

      <title>Averaging over cosmic structure: Cosmological backreaction and the gauge problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.19451v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The observation that accelerated cosmic expansion appears to start around the time that nonlinear cosmic structure is appearing seems like an extraordinary coincidence, unless the acceleration is somehow driven by the emergence of the structure. That has given rise to the controversial concept of a gravitational backreaction through which inhomogeneity becomes a driver of accelerated expansion. The standard route when studying strongly inhomogeneous cosmological models is to take either a perturbative approach or a spatial averaging approach. Here we argue that because backreaction is in fact a nonlinear multiscale phenomenon, perturbative approaches may have a limited validity. With respect to the currently proposed averaging approaches we here show that they lead to gauge dependent backreaction and hence ambiguous estimates of its magnitude. In the present study, we formalise inhomogeneous cosmic evolution within the framework of foliations of spacetime. Fixing a foliation amounts to making a gauge choice. Addressing the correspondence between the metric tensor and the foliation allows us to clarify the implications of choosing a foliation for the representation of equivalent cosmologies. It is important to note that, within the context of backreaction, this formalism allows us to discuss the vagaries of averaging in the framework of spacetime foliations. It reveals that spatial averaging can induce artificial, i.e. gauge dependent, backreaction terms that arise from any specific choice of gauge. Averaging methods presented so far all encounter this problem. However, within our foliation framework, we can produce a gauge invariant method of averaging by invoking the gauge-invariant Bardeen formalism for cosmological perturbation theory. We demonstrate that this implies the gauge invariance of the averaging procedure. This makes it applicable to standard cosmological simulations.</description>

      <title>Evaluating a Sigmoid Dark Energy Model to Explain the Hubble Tension</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.05510v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study we analyze Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) data sourced from the Pantheon+ compilation to investigate late-time physics effects influencing the expansion history, $H(z)$, at redshifts $(z &lt; 2)$. Our focus centers on a time-varying dark energy (DE) model that introduces a rapid transition in the equation of state, at a specific redshift, $z_a$, from the baseline, $\Lambda = -1$, value to the present value, $w_0$, through the implementation of a sigmoid function. The constraints obtained for the DE sigmoid phenomenological parametrization have broad applicability for dynamic DE models that invoke late-time physics. Our analysis indicates that the sigmoid model provides a slightly better, though not statistically significant, fit to the SNe Pantheon+ data compared to the standard LCDM alone. The fit results, assuming a flat geometry and maintaining $\Omega_m$ constant at the 2018-Planck value of $0.3153$, are as follows: $H_0 = 73.3^{+0.2}_{-0.6}$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$, $w_{0} = -0.95^{+0.15}_{-0.02}$, $z_a = 0.8 \pm 0.46$. The errors represent statistical uncertainties only. The available SN dataset lacks sufficient statistical power to distinguish between the baseline LCDM and the alternative sigmoid models. A feature of interest offered by the sigmoid model is that it identifies a specific redshift, $z_a = 0.8$, where a potential transition in the equation of state could have occurred. The sigmoid model does not favor a DE in the phantom region ($w_0 &lt; -1$). Further constraints to the dynamic DE model have been obtained using CMB data to compute the distance to the last scattering surface. While the sigmoid DE model does not completely resolve the $H_0$ tension, it offers a transition mechanism that can still play a role alongside other potential solutions.</description>

      <title>Massive black hole binaries in LISA: constraining cosmological parameters at high redshifts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.04632v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the scientific objectives of the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) is to probe the expansion of the Universe using gravitational wave observations. Indeed, as gravitational waves from the coalescence of a massive black hole binary (MBHB) carry direct information of its luminosity distance, an accompanying electromagnetic (EM) counterpart can be used to determine its redshift. This method of $bright$ $sirens$, when applied to LISA, enables one to build a gravitational Hubble diagram to high redshift. In this work, we forecast the ability of LISA-detected MBHB bright sirens to constrain cosmological models. The expected EM emission from MBHBs can be detected up to redshift $z\sim 7$ with future astronomical facilities, and the distribution of MBHBs with detectable counterpart peaks at $z\sim 2-3$. Therefore, we propose several methods to leverage the ability of LISA to constrain the expansion of the Universe at $z\sim 2-3$, a poorly charted epoch in cosmography. We find that the most promising method consists in using a model-independent approach based on a spline interpolation of the luminosity distance-redshift relation: in this case, LISA can constrain the Hubble parameter at $z\sim2-3$ with a relative precision of at least $10\%$.</description>

Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of statistical tools for evaluating tensions in cosmological parameter estimates arising from distinct datasets. Focusing on the unresolved Hubble constant ($H_0$) tension, we explore the Pantheon Plus + SH0ES (PPS) compilation, which includes low-redshift Cepheid data from the SH0ES collaboration, along with the latest release of CMB data from the Planck collaboration, Cosmic Chronometers (CC) dataset and the most recent Baryonic Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) datasets. Employing various tension metrics, we quantitatively assess the inconsistencies in parameter estimates, emphasizing the importance of capturing multidimensional tensions. Our results reveal substantial tension between PPS and Planck 2018 datasets and moderate tension between the BAO data sets and all other datasets. We highlight the importance of adopting these metrics to enhance the precision of future cosmological analyses and facilitate the resolution of existing tensions.</description>

      <title>Modeling the core-halo mass relation in fuzzy dark matter halos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.10744v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fuzzy dark matter (FDM) is an intriguing candidate alternative to the standard cold dark matter (CDM). The FDM model predicts that dark halos have characteristic core structures generated by the effect of quantum pressure, which is different from the structure of CDM halos. We devise a semi-analytic model of a FDM halo density profile by assuming that the density distribution results from the redistribution of mass in a halo with the Navarro-Frenk-White profile. We calculate the mass redistribution radius by considering dynamical relaxation within the FDM halo. We adopt a concentration-halo mass relation with lower concentration compared to that in the CDM model below the half mode mass, which originates from the suppressed matter density fluctuations at small length scales. Our model reproduces the core-halo mass relation (CHMR) found in the numerical simulation of \citet{2014NatPh..10..496S} at $z&lt;1$. We show that the CHMR is well described by a double power law, unlike previous studies that approximate it by a single power law. Our model predictions are in reasonable agreement with the results of the largest FDM simulation of \citet{2021MNRAS.506.2603M} at $z=3$. We find that the core mass for a given halo mass follows the log-normal distribution, both in our model and in the simulation results for the first time, and quantitatively compare the variance of the distribution among them. Although our model does not fully explain the scatter of the CHMR, we show the scatter of the concentration-halo mass relation sizably contributes to them.</description>

      <title>Primordial black holes and secondary gravitational waves from the inflation potential with a tiny Lorentz function bump</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15979v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores the generation of primordial black holes (PBHs) and scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) from the inflation potential with a tiny Lorentz function bump. We choose the Starobinsky model as basic potential, which satisfies the condition of observational constraints of the CMB at a large scale. We find that the tiny Lorentz function bump can enhance the primordial curvature power spectrum to $\mathcal{O}(10^{-2})$ at a small scale, leading to the formation of PBHs with sufficient abundance. Furthermore, we discover that the abundance of PBHs with mass $10^{-12}M_\odot$ is approximately $1$, which can make up almost all dark matter. In addition, the SIGWs generated by our models can be tested by the Square Kilometre Array (SKA), Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTA), TianQin, Taiji, Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), and DECIGO. It should be emphasized that, compared with the tiny Gaussian bump case, the Lorentz function bump case can easily produce a sufficient abundance of PBHs with a wider mass range, and accompanying a broader frequency range of SIGWs, which predicts the advantage of the Lorentz function bump for basic potential with big e-folding number $N$ around $55\sim60$.</description>

      <title>Unleashing cosmic shear information with the tomographic weak lensing PDF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09651v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we demonstrate the constraining power of the tomographic weak lensing convergence PDF for StageIV-like source galaxy redshift bins and shape noise. We focus on scales of $10$ to $20$ arcmin in the mildly nonlinear regime, where the convergence PDF and its changes with cosmological parameters can be predicted theoretically. We model the impact of reconstructing the convergence from the shear field using the well-known Kaiser-Squires formalism. We cross-validate the predicted and the measured convergence PDF derived from convergence maps reconstructed using simulated shear catalogues. Employing a Fisher forecast, we determine the constraining power for $(\Omega_{m},S_{8},w_{0})$. We find that adding a 5-bin tomography improves the $\kappa-$PDF constraints by a factor of $\{3.8,1.3,1.6\}$ for $(\Omega_{m}, S_{8},w_{0})$ respectively. Additionally, we perform a joint analysis with the shear two-point correlation functions, finding an enhancement of around a factor of $1.5$ on all parameters with respect to the two-point statistics alone. These improved constraints come from disentangling $\Omega_{\rm m}$ from $w_0$ by extracting non-Gaussian information, in particular, including the PDF skewness at different redshift bins. We also study the effect of varying the number of parameters to forecast, in particular we add $h$, finding that the convergence PDF maintains its constraining power while the precision from two-point correlations degrades by a factor of $\{1.7,1.4,1.8\}$ for $\{\Omega_{\rm m},S_8,w_0\}$, respectively.</description>

      <title>Markov Walk Exploration of Model Spaces: Bayesian Selection of Dark Energy Models with Supernovae</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06259v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Central to model selection is a trade-off between performing a good fit and low model complexity: A model of higher complexity should only be favoured over a simpler model if it provides significantly better fits. In Bayesian terms, this can be achieved by considering the evidence ratio, enabling choices between two competing models. We generalise this concept by constructing Markovian random walks for exploring the entire model spaces governed by the logarithmic evidence ratio, in analogy to the logarithmic likelihood ratio in parameter estimation problems. The theory of Markovian model exploration has an analytical description with partition functions, which we derive for both the canonical and macrocanonical case. We apply our methodology to selecting a polynomial for the dark energy equation of state function $w(a)$ fulfilling sensible physical priors, on the basis of data for the supernova distance-redshift relation. We conclude by commenting on Jeffreys' scale for Bayesian evidence ratios, choices of model priors and derived quantities like Shannon entropies for posterior model probabilities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.10058v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The gravitational positivity bound gives quantitative "swampland'' constraints on low-energy effective theories inside theories of quantum gravity. We give a comprehensive discussion of this bound for those interested in applications to phenomenological model building. We present a practical recipe for deriving the bound, and discuss subtleties relevant for realistic models. As an illustration, we study the positivity bound on the scattering of the massive gauge bosons in the Higgs/St\"{u}ckelberg mechanism. Under certain assumptions on gravitational amplitudes at high energy, we obtain a lower bound $m_{V} \gtrsim \Lambda_\mathrm{UV}^2 /g M_\mathrm{Pl}$ on the gauge boson mass $m_V$, where $g$ is the coupling constant of the gauge field, $M_\mathrm{Pl}$ is the reduced Planck mass and $\Lambda_\mathrm{UV}$ is the ultraviolet cutoff of the effective field theory. This bound can strongly constrain new physics models involving a massive gauge boson.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00741v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform the lattice simulation to estimate the axion dark matter abundance radiated from the global cosmic strings in the post-inflationary scenario. The independent numerical confirmation on the recently observed logarithmic growth in both the number of strings per Hubble patch and the spectral index of the power law scaling for the axion spectrum is reported. These logarithmic scalings are checked against two different prescriptions for generating initial random field configurations, namely fat-string type and thermal phase transition. We discuss a possible strong correlation between the axion spectrum and the string evolutions with different initial conditions to support the insensitivity of scaling behaviors against different initial data and we provide a qualitative understanding of it. The impact of various combinations of the power law of the axion spectrum, nonlinearities around the QCD scale, and average inter-string distances on the axion abundance is discussed. Additionally, we introduce a new novel string identification method, based on the tetrahedralization of the space, which guarantees the connectedness of the strings and provides a convenient way of assigning the core location. Finally we derive the lower bound on the axion mass.</description>

Abstract: Advancements in cosmology through next-generation ground-based gravitational wave observatories will bring in a paradigm shift. We explore the pivotal role that gravitational-wave standard sirens will play in inferring cosmological parameters with next-generation observatories, not only achieving exquisite precision but also opening up unprecedented redshifts. We examine the merits and the systematic biases involved in gravitational-wave standard sirens utilizing binary black holes, binary neutron stars, and neutron star-black hole mergers. Further, we estimate the precision of bright sirens, golden dark sirens, and spectral sirens for these binary coalescences and compare the abilities of various next-generation observatories (A^sharp, Cosmic Explorer, Einstein Telescope, and their possible networks). When combining different sirens, we find sub-percent precision over more than 10 billion years of cosmic evolution for the Hubble expansion rate $H(z)$. This work presents a broad view of opportunities to precisely measure the cosmic expansion rate, decipher the elusive dark energy and dark matter, and potentially discover new physics in the uncharted Universe with next-generation gravitational-wave detectors.</description>

      <title>The Disruption of Dark Matter Minihalos by Successive Stellar Encounters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03236v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scenarios such as the QCD axion with the Peccei-Quinn symmetry broken after inflation predict an enhanced matter power spectrum on sub-parsec scales. These theories lead to the formation of dense dark matter structures known as minihalos, which provide insights into early Universe dynamics and have implications for direct detection experiments. We examine the mass loss of minihalos during stellar encounters, building on previous studies that derived formulas for mass loss and performed N-body simulations. We propose a new formula for the mass loss that accounts for changes in the minihalo profile after disruption by a passing star. We also investigate the mass loss for multiple stellar encounters. We demonstrate that accurately assessing the mass loss in minihalos due to multiple stellar encounters necessitates considering the alterations in the minihalo's binding energy after each encounter, as overlooking this aspect results in a substantial underestimation of the mass loss.</description>

      <title>Tidal evolution of cored and cuspy dark matter halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09597v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The internal structure and abundance of dark matter halos and subhalos are powerful probes of the nature of dark matter. In order to compare observations with dark matter models, accurate theoretical predictions of these quantities are needed. We present a fast and accurate method to describe the tidal evolution of subhalos within their parent halo, based on a semi-analytic approach. We first consider idealized N-body simulations of subhalos within their host halo, using a generalized mass density profile that describes their properties in a variety of dark matter models at infall, including popular warm, cold, and self-interacting ones. Using these simulations we construct tidal "tracks" for the evolution of subhalos based on their conditions at infall. Second, we use the results of these simulations to build semi-analytic models for tidal effects, including stripping and heating and implement them within the code GALACTICUS. Our semi-analytic models can accurately predict the tidal evolution of both cored and cuspy subhalos, including the bound mass and density profiles, providing a powerful and efficient tool for studying the post-infall properties of subhalos in different dark matter models.</description>
