      <title>Axioms of Quantum Mechanics in light of Continuous Model Theory</title>

Abstract: The aim of this note is to recast somewhat informal axiom system of quantum mechanics used by physicists (Dirac calculus) in the language of Continuous Logic.
  We note an analogy between Tarski's notion of cylindric algebras, as a tool of algebraisation of first order logic, and Hilbert spaces which can serve the same purpose for continuous logic of physics.

      <title>Effective Versions of Strong Measure Zero</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective versions of strong measure zero sets are developed for various levels of complexity and computability. It is shown that the sets can be equivalently defined using a generalization of supermartingales called odds supermartingales, success rates on supermartingales, predictors, and coverings. We show Borel's conjecture of a set having strong measure zero if and only if it is countable holds in the time and space bounded setting. At the level of computability this does not hold. We show the computable level contains sequences at arbitrary levels of the hyperarithmetical hierarchy by proving a correspondence principle yielding a condition for the sets of computable strong measure zero to agree with the classical sets of strong measure zero. An algorithmic version of strong measure zero using lower semicomputability is defined. We show that this notion is equivalent to the set of NCR reals studied by Reimann and Slaman, thereby giving new characterizations of this set. Effective strong packing dimension zero is investigated requiring success with respect to the limit inferior instead of the limit superior. It is proven that every sequence in the corresponding algorithmic class is decidable. At the level of computability, the sets coincide with a notion of weak countability that we define.</description>

      <title>Unlikely intersections in Shimura varieties and beyond: a survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of this note is to provide a concise introduction to so-called problems of unlikely intersections for (pure) Shimura varieties and to review the current state-of-the-art. In the process, we will touch upon more general settings and some of the results in those contexts.</description>

      <title>Cohomological VC-density: Bounds and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09670v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The concept of Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) density is pivotal across various mathematical fields, including discrete geometry, probability theory and model theory. In this paper, we introduce a topological generalization of VC-density. Let $Y$ be a topological space and $\mathcal{X}$ a family of closed subspaces of $Y$. For each $p \geq 0$, we define a number, $\mathrm{vcd}^{p}_{\mathcal{X}}$, which we refer to as the degree $p$ VC-density of the family $\mathcal{X}$. The classical notion of VC-density within this topological framework can be recovered by setting $p=0$.
  Our definition of degree $p$ VC-density extends to higher orders as well. For $p \geq 0$, $q \geq 1$, we define the degree $p$, order $q$ VC density $\mathrm{vcd}^{p,q}_{\mathcal{X}}$ of $\mathcal{X}$, which recovers Shelah's notion of higher order VC-density for $q$-dependent families when $p=0$. Our definition introduces a completely new notion when $p &gt; 0$.
  We examine the properties of $\mathrm{vcd}_{\mathcal{X}}^p$ (as well as $\mathrm{vcd}^{p,q}_{\mathcal{X}}$) when the families $\mathcal{X}$ are definable in structures with some underlying topology (for instance, the Euclidean topology for o-minimal structures over $\mathbb{R}$, the analytic topology over $\mathbb{C}$, or the \'{e}tale site for schemes over arbitrary algebraically closed fields). Our main result establishes that in any model of these theories
  \[ \mathrm{vcd}_{\mathcal{X}}^p \leq (p+1) \dim X, \] and more generally for any $q \geq 1$ \[ \mathrm{vcd}^{p,q}_{\mathcal{X}} \leq (p+q) \dim X. \] We give examples to show that our bounds are optimal. We also present combinatorial applications of our higher-degree VC-density bounds, deriving higher degree topological analogs of well-known results such as the existence of $\varepsilon$-nets and the fractional Helly theorem.</description>

      <title>Big Ramsey degrees using parameter spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2009.00967v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the universal homogeneous partial order has finite big Ramsey degrees and discuss several corollaries. Our proof relies on parameter spaces and the Carlson-Simpson theorem rather than on (a strengthening of) the Halpern-L\"auchli theorem and the Milliken tree theorem, which are typically used to bound big Ramsey degrees in the existing literature (originating from the work of Laver and Milliken).
  This new technique has many additional applications. We show that the homogeneous universal triangle-free graph has finite big Ramsey degrees, providing a short proof of a recent result by Dobrinen. Moreover, generalizing an indivisibility (vertex partition) result of Nguyen van Th\'e and Sauer, we give an upper bound on big Ramsey degrees of metric spaces with finitely many distances. This leads to a new combinatorial argument for the oscillation stability of the Urysohn Sphere.</description>

      <title>One-ended spanning subforests and treeability of groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.07431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2104.07431v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that several new classes of groups are measure strongly treeable. In particular, finitely generated groups admitting planar Cayley graphs, elementarily free groups, and the group of isometries of the hyperbolic plane and all its closed subgroups. This provides the first examples of one-ended nonamenable groups which are measure strongly treeable. In higher dimensions, we also prove a dichotomy that the fundamental group of a closed aspherical $3$-manifold is either amenable or has strong ergodic dimension $2$. Our main technical tool is a method for finding measurable treeings of Borel planar graphs by constructing one-ended spanning subforests in their planar dual. Our techniques for constructing one-ended spanning subforests also give a complete classification of the locally finite pmp graphs which admit Borel a.e.\ one-ended spanning subforests.</description>
