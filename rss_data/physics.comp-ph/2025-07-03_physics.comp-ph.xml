      <title>An Algorithm for Automated Extraction of Resonance Parameters from the Stabilization Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The application of the stabilization method [A.~U.\ Hazi and H.~S.\ Taylor, Phys.~Rev.~A {\bf 1}, 1109 (1970)]) to extract accurate energy and lifetimes of resonance states is challenging: The process requires labor-intensive numerical manipulation of a large number of eigenvalues of a parameter-dependent Hamiltonian matrix, followed by a fitting procedure. In this article, we present \dosmax, an efficient algorithm implemented as an open-access \texttt{Python} code, which offers full automation of the stabilization diagram analysis in a user-friendly environment while maintaining high numerical precision of the computed resonance characteristics. As a test case, we use \dosmax to analyze the natural parity doubly-excited resonance states (${}^{1}\textnormal{S}^{\textnormal{e}}$, ${}^{3}\textnormal{S}^{\textnormal{e}}$, ${}^{1}\textnormal{P}^{\textnormal{o}}$, and ${}^{3}\textnormal{P}^{\textnormal{o}}$) of helium, demonstrating the accuracy and efficiency of the developed methodology. The presented algorithm is applicable to a wide range of resonances in atomic, molecular, and nuclear systems.</description>

      <title>Improved energies and wave function accuracy with Weighted Variational Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural network parametrizations have increasingly been used to represent the ground and excited states in variational Monte Carlo (VMC) with promising results. However, traditional VMC methods only optimize the wave function in regions of peak probability. The wave function is uncontrolled in the tails of the probability distribution, which can limit the accuracy of the trained wavefunction approximation. To improve the approximation accuracy in the probability tails, this paper interprets VMC as a gradient flow in the space of wave functions, followed by a projection step. From this perspective, arbitrary probability distributions can be used in the projection step, allowing the user to prioritize accuracy in different regions of state space. Motivated by this theoretical perspective, the paper tests a new weighted VMC method on the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model for a periodic spin chain. Compared to traditional VMC, weighted VMC reduces the error in the ground state energy by a factor of 2 and it reduces the errors in the local energies away from the mode by large factors of $10^2$--$10^4$.</description>

      <title>Extracting the singularity of the logarithmic partition function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In principle, the logarithm of the partition function and its derivatives can be used to rigorously determine the nature of phase transitions. However, in practice, this approach is often ineffective in numerical calculations, since resolving the singularities of the logarithmic partition function requires extremely high precision data especially when distinguishing between weakly first order phase transitions and deconfined quantum critical points. Based on the finite size scaling hypothesis, we propose that the singular contribution to the logarithmic partition function in quantum phase transitions can be extracted by eliminating the leading volume-law term. This is achieved by computing the Renyi thermal entropy (RTE) and its derivative (DRTE). We have derived the scaling relations for RTE and DRTE, which successfully determine the phase transition points and critical exponents through data collapse in various quantum many body systems. Notably, beyond their utility in locating quantum critical points, we find that DRTE is remarkably effective in detecting weakly first order phase transitions, such as in $ JQ $ models, which were initially thought to be continuous deconfined quantum phase transitions. The discontinuity of these transitions is challenging to detect using traditional local physical quantities. This work provides a new and powerful paradigm for studying quantum many body phase transitions.</description>

      <title>HPC-AI Coupling Methodology for Scientific Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have fundamentally transformed numerical-based high-performance computing (HPC) applications with data-driven approaches and endeavored to address existing challenges, e.g. high computational intensity, in various scientific domains. In this study, we explore the scenarios of coupling HPC and AI (HPC-AI) in the context of emerging scientific applications, presenting a novel methodology that incorporates three patterns of coupling: surrogate, directive, and coordinate. Each pattern exemplifies a distinct coupling strategy, AI-driven prerequisite, and typical HPC-AI ensembles. Through case studies in materials science, we demonstrate the application and effectiveness of these patterns. The study highlights technical challenges, performance improvements, and implementation details, providing insight into promising perspectives of HPC-AI coupling. The proposed coupling patterns are applicable not only to materials science but also to other scientific domains, offering valuable guidance for future HPC-AI ensembles in scientific discovery.</description>

      <title>Tensor Decomposition Networks for Fast Machine Learning Interatomic Potential Computations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: $\rm{SO}(3)$-equivariant networks are the dominant models for machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs). The key operation of such networks is the Clebsch-Gordan (CG) tensor product, which is computationally expensive. To accelerate the computation, we develop tensor decomposition networks (TDNs) as a class of approximately equivariant networks whose CG tensor products are replaced by low-rank tensor decompositions, such as the CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) decomposition. With the CP decomposition, we prove (i) a uniform bound on the induced error of $\rm{SO}(3)$-equivariance, and (ii) the universality of approximating any equivariant bilinear map. To further reduce the number of parameters, we propose path-weight sharing that ties all multiplicity-space weights across the $O(L^3)$ CG paths into a single path without compromising equivariance, where $L$ is the maximum angular degree. The resulting layer acts as a plug-and-play replacement for tensor products in existing networks, and the computational complexity of tensor products is reduced from $O(L^6)$ to $O(L^4)$. We evaluate TDNs on PubChemQCR, a newly curated molecular relaxation dataset containing 105 million DFT-calculated snapshots. We also use existing datasets, including OC20, and OC22. Results show that TDNs achieve competitive performance with dramatic speedup in computations.</description>

      <title>LOMS.cz: A computational platform for high-throughput Classical and Combinatorial Judd-Ofelt analysis and rare-earth spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present LOMS.cz (Luminescence, Optical and Magneto-optical Software), an open-source computational platform that addresses the long-standing challenge of standardizing Judd-Ofelt (JO) calculations in rare-earth spectroscopy. Despite JO theory's six-decade history as the fundamental framework for understanding $4f\leftrightarrow4f$ transitions, the field lacks standardized computational methodologies for precise and reproducible parameter determination. LOMS integrates three key innovations: (1) automated computation of JO parameters, transition probabilities, branching ratios, and theoretical radiative lifetimes, (2) a dynamically expanding database of experimentally validated parameters enabling direct comparison between computed and empirical results, and (3) a novel Combinatorial JO (C-JO) analysis algorithm that systematically identifies optimal absorption band combinations to ensure reliable parameter extraction. As a proof-of-concept, we demonstrate how this computational framework enables rapid screening of spectroscopic parameters, allowing researchers to predict optical properties with enhanced reliability. By combining automated analysis with experimental validation through its integrated database, LOMS.cz establishes a standardized platform for accelerating the discovery and optimization of rare-earth-based photonic and optoelectronic materials.</description>

      <title>Coupled Fire-Cloud Simulations Reveal Mechanisms of Pyrocumulonimbus Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pyrocumulonimbus (pyroCb) firestorms occur when the updraft from a wildfire forms a precipitating cloud. These clouds create unpredictable winds, posing threats to life and property. The coupled fire-atmosphere interactions that govern the behavior of pyroCb are incompletely understood, with previous simulations either treating the fire as static or using semi-empirical rate of spread models. It is disputed whether fuel moisture serves as an energy source or sink for pyroCB events. We use a fine-scale cloud model coupled with a fire model with combustion physics to simulate and analyze the co-evolution of pyroCb and its associated fire. Here we show fuel moisture acts as an energy sink attenuating fire intensity and suppressing pyroCb development, and we also identify and quantify a positive feedback loop, the self-amplifying fire-induced recirculation (SAFIR) mechanism, where precipitation-induced downdrafts intensify the parent fire. Our results demonstrate fuel moisture is an insignificant source of moisture for the pyroCb, contradicting previous forecasting guidance. Our analysis of the SAFIR mechanism shows weak upper-level winds favor a pyroCb downdraft close to the parent fire, creating conditions for rapid intensification. These findings provide a new mechanistic framework for understanding pyroCb behavior, offering insight towards improved prediction of these extreme events.</description>

      <title>Electronic structure and defect properties of Bi-doped GaN: origins of photoluminescence and optical absorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extreme lattice-mismatched III-V nitrides, such as Bi-incorporated GaN, have been realized experimentally thanks to recent advances in epitaxial growth and characterization techniques. However, theoretical insights into defect-related optical absorption and emission phenomena in these materials remain scarce. Here, we apply hybrid density functional theory to systematically explore the role of substitutional bismuth atoms on both cationic $\mathrm{Bi_{Ga}}$ and anionic $\mathrm{Bi_{N}}$ sites in Bi-incorporated GaN, as well as their complexes with native vacancies. Our calculations reveal that the charge-compensated defect complexes $(\mathrm{Bi_{N}} + \mathrm{V_{Ga}})^{3-}$ and $(\mathrm{Bi_{N}} + \mathrm{V_{Ga}})^{3+}$ stabilize anionic bismuth incorporation, accounting for the experimentally observed absorption peaks at ~1.11 eV and ~3.17 eV. We further uncover the origins of the reported band-edge emissions near 2.0 eV and 2.5 eV by examining various charge states of $\mathrm{Bi_{Ga}}$ and $\mathrm{Bi_{N}}$ centers. Our findings elucidate the defect-level physics of Bi-doped GaN and provide practical guidelines for controlling the incorporation of Bi into GaN.</description>

      <title>Spectral Learning of Magnetized Plasma Dynamics: A Neural Operator Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fourier neural operators (FNOs) provide a mesh-independent way to learn solution operators for partial differential equations, yet their efficacy for magnetized turbulence is largely unexplored. Here we train an FNO surrogate for the 2-D Orszag-Tang vortex, a canonical non-ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) benchmark, across an ensemble of viscosities and magnetic diffusivities. On unseen parameter settings the model achieves a mean-squared error of $\approx 6 \times 10^{-3}$ in velocity and $\approx 10^{-3}$ in magnetic field, reproduces energy spectra and dissipation rates within $96\%$ accuracy, and retains temporal coherence over long timescales. Spectral analysis shows accurate recovery of large- and intermediate-scale structures, with degradation at the smallest resolved scales due to Fourier-mode truncation. Relative to a UNet baseline the FNO cuts error by $97\%$, and compared with a high-order finite-volume solver it delivers a $25\times$ inference speed-up, offering a practical path to rapid parameter sweeps in MHD simulations.</description>

      <title>Quantum Anharmonic Effects in Hydrogen-Bond Symmetrization of High-Pressure Ice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nuclear quantum effects of hydrogen play a significant role in determining the phase stability of water ice. Hydrogen-bond symmetrization occurs as hydrogen atoms tunnel in a double-well potential, ultimately occupying the midpoint between oxygen atoms and transforming ice VIII into ice X under high pressure. Quantum fluctuations lower this transition from classical predictions of over 100 GPa to 60 GPa. We reveal that the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof functional underestimates the hydrogen double-well barrier, thus resulting in a transition pressure over 10 GPa lower than the strongly constrained and appropriately normed functional, which is validated against quantum Monte Carlo calculations. Nuclear quantum anharmonicity, treated via neural canonical transformation (NCT), reveals that this transition pressure is temperature-independent and observes a 2 GPa reduction when comparing the non-Gaussian flow models based wavefunction compared to the self-consistent harmonic approximation. Despite increasing pressure typically shortens chemical bonds and hardens phonon modes, NCT calculations reveal that hydrogen bond softens hydrogen-oxygen stretching in ice VIII upon pressure.</description>

      <title>More sophisticated is not always better: comparison of similarity measures for unsupervised learning of pathways in biomolecular simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Finding process pathways in molecular simulations such as the unbinding paths of small molecule ligands from their binding sites at protein targets in a set of trajectories via unsupervised learning approaches requires the definition of a suitable similarity measure between trajectories. We here evaluate the performance of four such measures with varying degree of sophistication, i.e., Euclidean and Wasserstein distances, Procrustes analysis and dynamical time warping, when analyzing trajectory data from two different biased simulation driving protocols in the form of constant velocity constraint targeted MD and steered MD. In a streptavidin-biotin benchmark system with known ground truth clusters, Wasserstein distances yielded the best clustering performance, closely followed by Euclidean distances, both being the most computationally efficient similarity measures. In a more complex A2a receptor-inhibitor system, however, the simplest measure, i.e., Euclidean distances, was sufficient to reveal meaningful and interpretable clusters.</description>

Abstract: The main objective of this study is to simulate the behavior of the reactive flow of the turbulent flame in aeronautical combustion chamber of the ALLISON-T56 turboprop, and contribute to the analysis of flame structure and determine for given pressure and temperature of fresh gas the behavior of the thermodynamic parameters of combustion. The numerical approach is based on the resolution of basic equations of turbulent combustion using Ansys-Fluent code where the turbulence model K-e is chosen, the geometry of the combustion chamber is made using Ansys-workbench software. Thereafter, we simulate the transient temperature field through the wall of a tubular combustion chamber, and the characterization of the thermal expansion, the thermoelastic stresses and strains with the physical properties of refractory materials. The obtained results are then compared with the results of the scientific literature</description>

      <title>Electron-phonon vertex correction effect in superconducting H3S</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Migdal-Eliashberg (ME) formalism provides a reliable framework for describing phonon-mediated superconductivity in the adiabatic regime, where the electronic Fermi energy exceeds the characteristic phonon energy. In this work, we go beyond this limit by incorporating first-order vertex corrections to the electron-phonon (e-ph) interaction within the Eliashberg formalism and assess their impact on the superconducting properties of H3S and Pb using first-principles calculations. For H3S, where the adiabatic assumption breaks down, we find that vertex corrections to the e-ph coupling are substantial. When combined with phonon anharmonicity and the energy dependence of the electronic density of states, the predicted critical temperature (Tc) is in very good agreement with experimental observations. In contrast, for elemental Pb, where the adiabatic approximation remains valid, vertex corrections have a negligible effect, and the calculated Tc and superconducting gap closely match the predictions of the standard ME formalism. These findings demonstrate the importance of non-adiabatic corrections in strongly coupled high-Tc hydrides and establish a robust first-principles framework for accurately predicting superconducting properties across different regimes.</description>

      <title>PhyLiNO: A Forward-Folding Likelihood-Fit Framework for Neutrino Oscillation Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15253v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a framework for the analysis of data from neutrino oscillation experiments. The framework performs a profile likelihood fit and employs a forward-folding technique to optimize its model with respect to the oscillation parameters. It is capable of simultaneously handling multiple datasets from the same or different experiments and their correlations. The code of the framework is optimized for performance and allows for convergence times of a few seconds handling hundreds of fit parameters, thanks to multi-threading and usage of GPUs. The framework was developed in the context of the Double Chooz experiment, where it was successfully used to fit three- and four-flavor models to the data, as well as in the measurement of the energy spectrum of reactor neutrinos. We demonstrate its applicability to other experiments by applying it to a study of the oscillation analysis of a medium baseline reactor experiment similar to JUNO.</description>

      <title>Applying Space-Group Symmetry to Speed up Hybrid-Functional Calculations within the Framework of Numerical Atomic Orbitals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02422v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Building upon the efficient implementation of hybrid density functionals (HDFs) for large-scale periodic systems within the framework of numerical atomic orbital bases using the localized resolution of identity (RI) technique, we have developed an algorithm that exploits the space group symmetry in key operation steps of HDF calculations, leading to further improvements in two ways. First, the reduction of $\mathbf{k}$-points in the Brillouin zone can reduce the number of Kohn-Sham equations to be solved. This necessitates the correct implementation of the rotation relation between the density matrices of equivalent $\mathbf{k}$-points within the representation of atomic orbitals. Second, the reduction of the real-space sector can accelerate the construction of the exact-exchange part of the Hamiltonian in real space. We have implemented this algorithm in the ABACUS software interfaced with LibRI, and tested its performance for several types of crystal systems with different symmetries. The expected speed-up is achieved in both aspects: the time of solving the Kohn-Sham equations decreases in proportion with the reduction of $\mathbf{k}$-points, while the construction of the Hamiltonian in real space is sped up by several times, with the degree of acceleration depending on the size and symmetry of the system.</description>

      <title>Aitomia: Your Intelligent Assistant for AI-Driven Atomistic and Quantum Chemical Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08195v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have developed Aitomia - a platform powered by AI to assist in performing AI-driven atomistic and quantum chemical (QC) simulations. This evolving intelligent assistant platform is equipped with chatbots and AI agents to help experts and guide non-experts in setting up and running the atomistic simulations, monitoring their computation status, analyzing the simulation results, and summarizing them for the user in text and graphical forms. We achieve these goals by exploiting open-source large language models (LLMs, original and fine-tuned), rule-based agents, and a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system. Aitomia leverages the versatility of our MLatom ecosystem, supporting AI-enhanced computational chemistry tasks ranging from ground- to excited-state calculations such as geometry optimizations, thermochemistry, and spectra calculations. Aitomia is the first intelligent assistant publicly accessible online on a cloud computing platform for atomistic simulations of broad scope (Aitomistic Hub at https://aitomistic.xyz), while it may also be deployed locally as described at http://mlatom.com/aitomia. Aitomia is expected to lower the barrier to performing atomistic simulations, democratizing simulations, and accelerating research and development in the relevant fields.</description>

      <title>Holography Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01724v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have constructed a generative artificial intelligence model to predict dual gravity solutions when provided with the input of holographic entanglement entropy. The model utilized in our study is based on the transformer algorithm, widely used for various natural language tasks including text generation, summarization, and translation. This algorithm possesses the ability to understand the meanings of input and output sequences by utilizing multi-head attention layers. In the training procedure, we generated pairs of examples consisting of holographic entanglement entropy data and their corresponding metric solutions. Once the model has completed the training process, it demonstrates the ability to generate predictions regarding a dual geometry that corresponds to the given holographic entanglement entropy. Subsequently, we proceed to validate the dual geometry to confirm its correspondence with the holographic entanglement entropy data.</description>

      <title>A universal black-box quantum Monte Carlo approach to quantum phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03924v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive exact, universal, closed-form quantum Monte Carlo estimators for finite-temperature energy susceptibility and fidelity susceptibility, applicable to essentially arbitrary Hamiltonians. Combined with recent advancements in Monte Carlo, our approach enables a black-box framework for studying quantum phase transitions--without requiring prior knowledge of an order parameter or the manual design of model-specific ergodic quantum Monte Carlo update rules. We demonstrate the utility of our method by applying a single implementation to the transverse-field Ising model, the XXZ model, and an ensemble of models related by random unitaries.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium friction and free energy estimates for kinetic coarse-graining -- Driven particles in responsive media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18484v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Predicting the molecular friction and energy landscapes under nonequilibrium conditions is key to coarse-graining the dynamics of selective solute transport through complex, fluctuating and responsive media, e.g., polymeric materials such as hydrogels, cellular membranes or ion channels. The analysis of equilibrium ensembles already allows such a coarse-graining for very mild nonequilibrium conditions. Yet in the presence of stronger external driving and/or inhomogeneous setups, the transport process is governed apart from a potential of mean force also by a nontrivial position- and velocity-dependent friction. It is therefore important to find suitable and efficient methods to estimate the mean force and the friction landscape, which then can be used in a low-dimensional, coarse-grained Langevin framework to predict the system's transport properties and timescales. In this work, we evaluate different coarse-graining approaches based on constant-velocity constraint simulations for generating such estimates using two model systems, which are a 1D responsive barrier as a minimalistic model and a single tracer driven through a 3D bead-spring polymer membrane as a more sophisticated problem. Finally, we demonstrate that the estimates from 3D constant-velocity simulations yield the correct velocity-dependent friction, which can be directly utilized for coarse-grained (1D) Langevin simulations with constant external driving forces.</description>

      <title>Residual U-Net for accurate and efficient prediction of hemodynamics in two-dimensional asymmetric stenosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05778v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study presents residual U-Net (U-ResNet), a deep learning surrogate model for predicting steady hemodynamic fields in two-dimensional asymmetric stenotic channels at Reynolds numbers ranging from 200 to 800. By integrating residual connections with multi-scale feature extraction, U-ResNet achieves exceptional accuracy while significantly reducing computational costs compared to computational fluid dynamics (CFD) approaches. Comprehensive evaluation against U-Net, Fourier Neural Operator (FNO), and U-Net enhanced Fourier Neural Operator (UFNO) demonstrates U-ResNet superior performance in capturing sharp hemodynamic gradients and complex flow features. For pressure prediction, U-ResNet achieves a normalized mean absolute error (NMAE) of 1.10%. Similarly, the performance of U-ResNet for wall shear stress (NMAE: 0.56%), velocity (NMAE: 1.06%), and vorticity (NMAE: 0.69%) consistently surpasses alternative architectures. Notably, U-ResNet demonstrates robust generalization to interpolated Reynolds numbers without retraining - a capability rarely achieved in existing models. From a computational perspective, U-ResNet delivers a 180-fold acceleration over CFD, reducing simulation time from approximately 30 minutes to 10 seconds per case. The model with non-dimensional formulation ensures scalability across vessel sizes and anatomical locations, enhancing its applicability to diverse clinical scenarios. These advances position U-ResNet as a promising auxiliary tool to complement CFD simulations for real-time clinical decision support, treatment planning, and medical device optimization. Future work will focus on extending the framework to three-dimensional geometries and integrating it with patient-specific data.</description>

      <title>Learning to Maximize Quantum Neural Network Expressivity via Effective Rank</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15375v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum neural networks (QNNs) are widely employed as ans\"atze for solving variational problems, where their expressivity directly impacts performance. Yet, accurately characterizing QNN expressivity remains an open challenge, impeding the optimal design of quantum circuits. In this work, we introduce the effective rank, denoted as $\kappa$, as a novel quantitative measure of expressivity. Specifically, $\kappa$ captures the number of effectively independent parameters among all the variational parameters in a parameterized quantum circuit, thus reflecting the true degrees of freedom contributing to expressivity. Through a systematic analysis considering circuit architecture, input data distributions, and measurement protocols, we demonstrate that $\kappa$ can saturate its theoretical upper bound, $d_n=4^n-1$, for an $n$-qubit system when each of the three factors is optimally expressive. This result provides a rigorous framework for assessing QNN expressivity and quantifying their functional capacity. Building on these theoretical insights, and motivated by the vast and highly structured nature of the circuit design space, we employ $\kappa$ as a guiding metric for the automated design of highly expressive quantum circuit configurations. To this end, we develop a reinforcement learning framework featuring a self-attention transformer agent that autonomously explores and optimizes circuit architectures. By integrating theoretical characterization with practical optimization, our work establishes $\kappa$ as a robust tool for quantifying QNN expressivity and demonstrates the effectiveness of reinforcement learning in designing high-performance quantum circuits. This study paves the way for building more expressive QNN architectures, ultimately enhancing the capabilities of quantum machine learning.</description>
