      <title>Alya towards Exascale: Optimal OpenACC Performance of the Navier-Stokes Finite Element Assembly on GPUs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of providing portable and highly efficient code structures for CPU and GPU architectures. We choose the assembly of the right-hand term in the incompressible flow module of the High-Performance Computational Mechanics code Alya, which is one of the two CFD codes in the Unified European Benchmark Suite. Starting from an efficient CPU-code and a related OpenACC-port for GPUs we successively investigate performance potentials arising from code specialization, algorithmic restructuring and low-level optimizations.
  We demonstrate that only the combination of these different dimensions of runtime optimization unveils the full performance potential on the GPU and CPU. Roofline-based performance modelling is applied in this process and we demonstrate the need to investigate new optimization strategies if a classical roofline limit such as memory bandwidth utilization is achieved, rather than stopping the process. The final unified OpenACC-based implementation boosts performance by more than 50x on an NVIDIA A100 GPU (achieving approximately 2.5 TF/s FP64) and a further factor of 5x for an Intel Icelake based CPU-node (achieving approximately 1.0 TF/s FP64).
  The insights gained in our manual approach lays ground implementing unified but still highly efficient code structures for related kernels in Alya and other applications. These can be realized by manual coding or automatic code generation frameworks.</description>

      <title>Realtime Facial Expression Recognition: Neuromorphic Hardware vs. Edge AI Accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper focuses on real-time facial expression recognition (FER) systems as an important component in various real-world applications such as social robotics. We investigate two hardware options for the deployment of FER machine learning (ML) models at the edge: neuromorphic hardware versus edge AI accelerators. Our study includes exhaustive experiments providing comparative analyses between the Intel Loihi neuromorphic processor and four distinct edge platforms: Raspberry Pi-4, Intel Neural Compute Stick (NSC), Jetson Nano, and Coral TPU. The results obtained show that Loihi can achieve approximately two orders of magnitude reduction in power dissipation and one order of magnitude energy savings compared to Coral TPU which happens to be the least power-intensive and energy-consuming edge AI accelerator. These reductions in power and energy are achieved while the neuromorphic solution maintains a comparable level of accuracy with the edge accelerators, all within the real-time latency requirements.</description>
