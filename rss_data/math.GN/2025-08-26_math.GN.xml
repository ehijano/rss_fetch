      <title>A subbase property for describing edge-end spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a previous joint work with Aurichi and Magalh\~aes Jr., we showed that the topological spaces arising from the edge-end structure of infinite graphs define a proper subfamily of those obtained through the well-known (vertex-)ends. This result was later recovered by a more general approach due to Pitz, who also stated the problem of finding a purely topological characterization for the class of edge-end spaces. His question reads as an edge-related version of a similar conjecture posed by Diestel in 1992, but there regarding the usual end structure of infinite graphs and which was recently answered also by Pitz via the existence of a suitable clopen subbase. This paper shows how an extra intersection property can be combined with his solution in order to restrict it to the edge-end spaces, hence stating a topological description for this later family as well.</description>

      <title>Topological cones and positively polarizable hyperbolic norms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the first part of this article, we study linear cones over totally ordered fields. We show that for each such cone there uniquely exists a universal vector space (called its spanned vector space) into which it embeds as a generating convex cone. Moreover, we investigate topologies on cones for which the natural cone operations are continuous, and study how these topologies carry over to the spanned vector space. In the second part, we deal with hyperbolic norms which satisfy a polarization identity and are defined on cones over the real numbers. We show that, under reasonable assumptions, such hyperbolic norms induce a Lorentzian inner product on the spanned vector space. Finally, we establish a link between completeness under the Wick rotation of a Lorentzian inner product and order-theoretic completeness.</description>

      <title>Machine Space I: Weak exponentials and quantification over compact spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.11339v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topology may be interpreted as the study of verifiability, where opens correspond to semi-decidable properties. In this paper we make a distinction between verifiable properties themselves and processes which carry out the verification procedure. The former are simply opens, while we call the latter machines. Given a frame presentation $\mathcal{O} X = \langle G \mid R\rangle$ we construct a space of machines $\Sigma^{\Sigma^G}$ whose points are given by formal combinations of basic machines corresponding to generators in $G$. This comes equipped with an `evaluation' map making it a weak exponential with base $\Sigma$ and exponent $X$.
  When it exists, the true exponential $\Sigma^X$ occurs as a retract of machine space. We argue this helps explain why some spaces are exponentiable and others not. We then use machine space to study compactness by giving a purely topological version of Escard\'o's algorithm for universal quantification over compact spaces in finite time. Finally, we relate our study of machine space to domain theory and domain embeddings.</description>
