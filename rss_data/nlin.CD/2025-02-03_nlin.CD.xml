      <title>Bridging Entanglement and Magic Resources through Operator Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Local operator entanglement (LOE) dictates the complexity of simulating Heisenberg evolution using tensor network methods, and serves as strong dynamical signature of quantum chaos. We show that LOE is also sensitive to how non-Clifford a unitary is: its magic resources. In particular, we prove that LOE is always upper-bound by three distinct magic monotones: $T$-count, unitary nullity, and operator stabilizer R\'enyi entropy. Moreover, in the average case for large, random circuits, LOE and magic monotones approximately coincide. Our results imply that an operator evolution that is expensive to simulate using tensor network methods must also be inefficient using both stabilizer and Pauli truncation methods. A direct corollary of our bounds is that any quantum chaotic dynamics cannot be simulated classically. Entanglement in operator space therefore measures a unified picture of non-classical resources, in stark contrast to the Schr\"odinger picture.</description>

      <title>Complex network approaches to nonlinear time series analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the last decade, there has been a growing body of literature addressing the utilization of complex network methods for the characterization of dynamical systems based on time series. While both nonlinear time series analysis and complex network theory are widely considered to be established fields of complex systems sciences with strong links to nonlinear dynamics and statistical physics, the thorough combination of both approaches has become an active field of nonlinear time series analysis, which has allowed addressing fundamental questions regarding the structural organization of nonlinear dynamics as well as the successful treatment of a variety of applications from a broad range of disciplines. In this report, we provide an in-depth review of existing approaches of time series networks, covering their methodological foundations, interpretation and practical considerations with an emphasis on recent developments. After a brief outline of the state-of-the-art of nonlinear time series analysis and the theory of complex networks, we focus on three main network approaches, namely, phase space based recurrence networks, visibility graphs and Markov chain based transition networks, all of which have made their way from abstract concepts to widely used methodologies. These three concepts, as well as several variants thereof will be discussed in great detail regarding their specific properties, potentials and limitations. More importantly, we emphasize which fundamental new insights complex network approaches bring into the field of nonlinear time series analysis. In addition, we summarize examples from the wide range of recent applications of these methods, covering rather diverse fields like climatology, fluid dynamics, neurophysiology, engineering and economics, and demonstrating the great potentials of time series networks for tackling real-world contemporary scientific problems.</description>

      <title>Turbulence: A Nonequilibrium Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tools of quantum and statistical field theories have ben successfully ported to turbulence. Here, we review the key results of turbulence field theory. Thermalized spectrally-truncated Euler equation is described by \textit{equilibrium field theory}, in which the equipartitioned Fourier modes generate zero energy flux. In contrast, modelling of hydrodynamic turbulence (HDT), which has small viscosity, requires \textit{nonequilibrium field theory}. In HDT, the viscosity is renormalized using field theory that leads to wavenumber-dependent viscosity and energy spectrum. Field theory calculations also yields nonzero energy flux for HDT. These field theory computations have been generalized to other systems, e.g., passive scalar and magnetohydrodynamics. In this review, we cover these aspects, along with a brief coverage of weak turbulence and intermittency.</description>
