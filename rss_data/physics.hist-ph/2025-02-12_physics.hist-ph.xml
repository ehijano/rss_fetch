      <title>On the distinction between beables and qualia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The link between the de Broglie-Bohm interpretation and the hard problem of consciousness is investigated. We highlight that beables of the de Broglie-Bohm interpretation are not themselves qualia, but are intimately related to qualia. It is then argued that qualia are necessary for the de Broglie-Bohm interpretation, and conversely the de Broglie-Bohm interpretation (or similar theories) are necessary for qualia. Therefore, there is a reflexive two-way relationship between the beables of the de Broglie-Bohm interpretation and qualia such that they support the existence of each other. By using this reflexive argument, the hard problem of consciousness can be addressed via an indirect route.</description>

      <title>What Kind of Relationality does Quantum Mechanics Exhibit?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article I elaborate on the approach to relational quantum mechanics suggested by Adlam and Rovelli (2023). I suggest that this approach fills an important gap in the spectrum of relational approaches, because it posits that the relational aspects of quantum mechanics are both inherent and dynamical. I compare this approach to Orthodox RQM, arguing that it has a number of advantages, and I show how some possible objections can be resolved.</description>

      <title>Not Quite Killing It: Black Hole Evaporation, Global Energy, and De-Idealization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11142v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A family of arguments for black hole evaporation relies on conservation laws, defined through symmetries represented by Killing vector fields which exist globally or asymptotically. However, these symmetries often rely on the idealizations of stationarity and asymptotic flatness, respectively. In non-stationary or non-asymptotically-flat spacetimes where realistic black holes evaporate, the requisite Killing fields typically do not exist. Can we 'de-idealize' these idealizations, and subsequently the associated arguments for black hole evaporation? Here, I critically examine the strategy of using 'approximately Killing' fields to de-idealize black hole spacetimes and approximately extend conservation laws to non-idealized cases. I argue that this approach encounters significant challenges, undermining the use of these idealizations to justify the evaporation of realistic -- rather than idealized -- black holes, and raising questions about the justified use of such idealizations.</description>

      <title>Prolegomena To Any Future Device Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.15822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.15822v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For the last 60 years, advances in conventional computing platforms have been driven by the empirical notion known as Moores law. In its essence, Moores law is a ubiquitous description of the exponential increase in transistor density acting as a proxy for computing power as a function of time. While this trend started as an interesting observation, it has evolved into a self-fulfilling prophecy used to drive the entire semiconductor industry. Arguments for or against the end of Moores law have proliferated and the reluctant consensus is that Moores law will disappear. Warnings of the end of this trend have been repeatedly thwarted by advances in many different aspects of the computing ecosystem including materials improvements, device design, device or circuit cleverness, and software and architectural innovations. While many have argued the impending doom of Moores law is the ultimate roadblock imposed by atomic length scales, quantum processes, and energy consumption limits, we contend that Moores law must be jettisoned for a different reason: Words matter. Even those who adamantly declare the end of Moores law still use the language of Moores law. The inward focus of this notion imposes an intellectual tyranny that inhibits revolutionary progress. We suggest instead a more outwardly focused perspective and suggest a shift in language to a regime we coin the Feynman Mandate. In this perspective, we outline the issues with the continued use of Moores law as well as a prescription of transitioning to a new lexicon. We outline a new, more general metric for ascertaining progress and identify the roles of various stakeholders in this process.</description>
