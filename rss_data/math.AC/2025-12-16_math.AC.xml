      <title>Geometrically vertex decomposable open neighborhood ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove that the open neighborhood ideal of a TD-unmixed tree is geometrically vertex decomposable. This result implies that the associated Stanley-Reisner complex is vertex decomposable. We further demonstrate that Cohen-Macaulay open neighborhood ideals of trees are special cases of Cohen-Macaulay facet ideals of simplicial trees. Finally, we investigate open neighborhood ideals of chordal graphs and establish that almost all square-free monomial ideal can be realized as the open neighborhood ideal of a chordal graph.</description>

      <title>Bounded powers of edge ideals: Pseudo-Gorenstein and Level polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A lattice polytope $\mathcal{P} \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ of dimension $n$ is called level* if (i) $\mathcal{P}$ is normal, (ii) $(\mathcal{P} \setminus \partial \mathcal{P}) \cap \mathbb{Z}^n \neq \emptyset$ and (iii) for each $N = 2,3, \ldots$ and for each $\textbf{a} \in N(\mathcal{P} \setminus \partial \mathcal{P}) \cap \mathbb{Z}^n$, there is $\textbf{a}_0 \in (\mathcal{P} \setminus \partial \mathcal{P}) \cap \mathbb{Z}^n$ together with $\textbf{a}' \in (N-1)\mathcal{P} \cap \mathbb{Z}^n$ for which $\textbf{a} = \textbf{a}_0 + \textbf{a}'$, where $N\mathcal{P} = \{N\textbf{a} : \textbf{a} \in \mathcal{P}\}$. A normal polytope $\mathcal{P} \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ of dimension $n$ is called pseudo-Gorenstein* [4] if $
|(\mathcal{P} \setminus \partial \mathcal{P}) \cap \mathbb{Z}^n| = 1. $ A pseudo-Gorenstein* polytope $\mathcal{P}$ is level* if and only if $\mathcal{P}$ is reflexive up to translation. In the present paper, level* polytopes together with pseudo-Gorenstein* polytopes arising from discrete polymatroids of bounded powers of edge ideals are studied.</description>

      <title>Tropical Invariants for Permutation Group Actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the action of a permutation group $G$ of order $k$ on the tropical polynomial semiring in $n$ variables. We prove that the sub-semiring of invariant polynomials is finitely generated if and only if $G$ is generated by $2$-cycles. There do exist finitely many separating invariants of degree at most $\max\{n,{n\choose 2}\}$. Separating tropical invariants can be used to construct bi-Lipschitz embeddings of the orbit space ${\mathbb R}^n/G$ into Euclidean space. We also show that the invariant polynomials of degree $\leq n p_1p_2\cdots p_k$ generate the semifield of invariant rational tropical functions, where $p_1,p_2,\dots,p_k$ are the first $k$ prime numbers. Most results are also true over arbitrary semirings that are additively idempotent and multiplicatively cancellative.</description>

      <title>A variant of R{\"o}hr's vanishing theorem with an application to the normal reduction number for normal surface singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $A$ be an excellent two-dimensional normal local ring containing an algebraically closed field and let $X\to \mathrm{Spec} (A)$ be a resolution of singularity. We prove a theorem giving a condition under which the dimension of the cohomology group of invertible sheaves on $X$ coincides with a natural lower bound. Applying this theorem, we establish upper bounds for the normal reduction number $\bar{\mathrm{r}}(A)$ of $A$. For example, we prove the inequality $\bar{\mathrm{r}}(A) \le p_a(A)+1$, where $p_a(A)$ denotes the arithmetic genus, a fundamental combinatorial (topological) invariant. We introduce the notion of almost cone singularities and give a sharper inequality $\bar{\mathrm{r}}(A) \le p_f(A)+1$ for such singularities, where $p_f(A)$ denotes the fundamental genus. We also show that $\bar{\mathrm{r}}(A)$ is not a combinatorial invariant in general.</description>

      <title>The locally free locus of Quot schemes on $\mathbb{P}^1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We characterize components of the locally free locus $\operatorname{Quot}^{n,d}_{\mathbb{P}^1}(\mathcal{O}(\vec{e}))^{\circ}$ of the Quot scheme associated to any vector bundle on $\mathbb{P}^1$. Specifically, we show that the components are in bijection with certain combinatorial objects which we call strongly stable pairs. Using our explicit understanding of the components, we prove that $\operatorname{Quot}^{n,d}_{\mathbb{P}^1}(\mathcal{O}(\vec{e}))^{\circ}$ is connected, and we give an explicit bound for when $\operatorname{Quot}^{n,d}_{\mathbb{P}^1}(\mathcal{O}(\vec{e}))^{\circ}$ is irreducible. The key ingredient is a combinatorial criterion for when a triple of vector bundles on $\mathbb{P}^1$ arises in a short exact sequence. As a consequence, we prove that in codimension $2$, all integral lattice points in the Boij-S\"oderberg cone are Betti diagrams of actual modules.</description>

      <title>Nondimensionalization is more science than art</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When faced with a mathematical model, often the first step is to reduce the complexity of the model by turning variables and parameters into dimensionless quantities. This process is often performed by hand, relying on a skill practiced over many years, and attempted for small models. Nondimensionalization is often considered an art, as there is no formal method accessible to applied scientists. Here we show how to systematically perform nondimensionalization for arbitrarily sized models described by rational first order ordinary differential equations. We translate and extend an existing approach for computing rational invariants of the maximal scaling symmetry, which combines ideas from differential algebra, invariant theory and linear algebra, to the setting arising in biological models. The modeler inputs the system of equations and our implemented algorithm outputs the nondimensional quantities for the corresponding nondimensionalized model. We extend the algorithm to include initial conditions, and the modeler's choice of invariants, thereby including a larger class of nondimensionalizations. We further prove that any dimensionally consistent change of variables preserves the dimension of the maximal scaling symmetry. We showcase the framework on various models, including the classical Michaelis-Menten equations, which serves as a benchmark for asking and answering specific modeling questions.</description>

      <title>The rank 8 case of a conjecture on square-zero upper triangular matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.12944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2008.12944v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $A$ be the polynomial algebra in $r$ variables with coefficients in an algebraically closed field $k$. When the characteristic of $k$ is $2$, Carlsson conjectured that any $\mathrm{dg}$-$A$-module that is free of rank $N$ as an $A$-module and whose homology is nontrivial and finite dimensional as a $k$-vector space satisfies $N\geq 2^r$. In this paper, we examine a stronger conjecture concerning varieties of square-zero upper triangular $N\times N$ matrices. Stratifying these varieties via Borel orbits, we show that the stronger conjecture holds when $N = 8$ without any restriction on the characteristic of $k$. This result also verifies that if $X$ is a product of $3$ spheres of any dimensions, then the elementary abelian $2$-group of rank $4$ cannot act freely on $X$.</description>

      <title>On codimension-two subcanonical varieties inside $\mathbb{P}^n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19962v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $X \subseteq \mathbb{P}^n, n \geq 4$ be a codimension-two subcanonical local complete intersection variety with ideal sheaf $\mathcal{I}_X$. Let $a_X \in \mathbb{Z}$ be such that $\omega_X = \mathscr{O}_X(a_X)$. Assume that there exists $\displaystyle j \leq \frac{a_X+n+2}{2}$ such that $\Gamma(\mathcal{I}_X(j)) \neq 0$. We prove some sufficient conditions on the first deficiency module $\mathrm{H}^1_*(\mathcal{I}_X)$ that ensures that $X$ is a complete intersection. We also show that smooth codimension-two $3$-Buchsbaum varieties inside $\mathbb{P}^n, n \geq 6$ are complete intersections.</description>

      <title>A characteristic $p$ analog of formal lifting properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00648v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A field extension $L/K$ of characteristic $p &gt; 0$ is formally \'etale if and only if the relative Frobenius of $L/K$ is an isomorphism. Inspired by this classical result, we explore whether the formally \'etale property for a map $R \to S$ of $\mathbf{F}_p$-algebras is characterized by isomorphism of the relative Frobenius $F_{S/R}$. While $F_{S/R}$ being an isomorphism implies $R \to S$ is formally \'etale, the converse fails in the non-Noetherian setting. Thus, following Morrow, we introduce an enhancement of the formally \'etale property that we call b-nil (bounded nil) formally \'etale, and we show that $F_{S/R}$ is an isomorphism precisely when $R \to S$ is b-nil formally \'etale. We prove this result by first establishing several structural properties of b-nil formally smooth maps, which are defined analogously to the formally smooth case. Our structural results reveal that the b-nil formally smooth (resp. \'etale) property is quite different from the formally smooth (resp. \'etale) property. For instance, we show that any b-nil formally smooth algebra over an $F$-pure ring is reduced, whereas non-reduced formally \'etale algebras exist over $\mathbf{F}_p$ by a construction of Bhatt. We also show that the b-nil formally \'etale property neither implies nor is implied by having a trivial cotangent complex. We explore when formally smooth (resp. \'etale) implies b-nil formally smooth (resp. \'etale) in prime characteristic. A satisfactory picture emerges for ideal adic completions.</description>

      <title>Positioned and primary positioned $\mathcal{C}$-semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00454v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a positive integer cone and $k\in \mathcal{C}$. A $\mathcal{C}$-semigroup $S$ is $k$-positioned if for every $h\in \mathcal{C}\setminus S$ we have that $k-h$ belongs to $S$. In this work, we focus on this family of semigroups and introduce primary positioned $\mathcal{C}$-semigroups, characterizing a subfamily of them through the perspective of irreducibility. Furthermore, we provide some procedures to compute all such semigroups, describing a family of graphs containing all the primary positioned $\mathcal{C}$-semigroups for a fixed $k\in \mathcal{C}$.</description>

      <title>Oracle-Based Multistep Strategy for Solving Polynomial Systems Over Finite Fields and Algebraic Cryptanalysis of the Aradi Cipher</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09950v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The multistep solving strategy consists in a divide-and-conquer approach: when a multivariate polynomial system is computationally infeasible to solve directly, one variable is assigned over the elements of the base finite field, and the procedure is recursively applied to the resulting simplified systems. In a previous work by the same authors (among others), this approach proved effective in the algebraic cryptanalysis of the Trivium cipher.
  In this paper, we present a new recursive formulation of the corresponding algorithm based on a Depth-First Search strategy, along with a novel complexity analysis leveraging tree structures. We also introduce the notion of an "oracle function", which is intended to determine whether evaluating a new variable is required to simplify the current polynomial system. This notion allows us to unify all previously proposed variants of the multistep strategy, including the classical hybrid approach, by appropriately selecting the oracle function.
  Finally, we employ the multistep solving strategy in the cryptanalysis of the NSA's recently introduced low-latency block cipher Aradi, achieving a first full-round algebraic attack that exposes structural features in its symbolic model.</description>
