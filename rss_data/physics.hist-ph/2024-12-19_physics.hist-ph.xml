      <title>Dark Matter: Explanatory Unification and Historical Continuity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the hope to confirm the existence of dark matter by experimentally detecting it has diminished significantly. After more than 30 years of experimental searches, many of the most promising candidates have since been ruled out, leaving the epistemic and scientific condition of dark matter in a state of suspension. In efforts to improve the epistemic justification for the dark-matter hypothesis, physicists have turned to philosophical arguments and historical narratives. In this paper, I explicate two such strategies -- explanatory unification and historical continuity -- applied in the context of dark matter. I argue that greater care and attention should be invested in the explanatory arguments to increase their strength, and that a survey of primary historical sources in astronomy renders the historical evidence for the continuity of dark matter substantially weaker. The quality and rigor of the philosophical and historical arguments which physicists are constructing could be substantially improved by increasing interdisciplinary practices.</description>

      <title>The April 1, 2471 b.C. eclipse and the end of 4th Egyptian dynasty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On April 1, 2471 bC an impressive, unpredictable phenomenon occurred over the Delta of the Nile: a total solar eclipse, with totality band almost centered on the sacred city of Buto, and with the capital Memphis very close (&gt;95%) to totality. This date is compatible with existing chronologies for the reign of Pharaoh Shepseskaf, who adopted a clamorous symbolic break with respect to the tradition of solarized kings started by Khufu. Indeed his tomb was not built in view from Heliopolis and was not a pyramid, but a kind of unique monument resembling the symbolic shrine at Buto. The aim of the present paper is to investigate in a systematic way the possibility that the origin of this historical break, which marks the end of the 4th dynasty, can be identified precisely in the 2471 bC eclipse, therefore furnishing a new astronomical anchor for the chronology of the Old Kingdom.</description>
