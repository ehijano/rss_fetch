      <title>Optimal nonparametric estimation of the expected shortfall risk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the problem of estimating the expected shortfall risk of a financial loss using a finite number of i.i.d. data. It is well known that the classical plug-in estimator suffers from poor statistical performance when faced with (heavy-tailed) distributions that are commonly used in financial contexts. Further, it lacks robustness, as the modification of even a single data point can cause a significant distortion. We propose a novel procedure for the estimation of the expected shortfall and prove that it recovers the best possible statistical properties (dictated by the central limit theorem) under minimal assumptions and for all finite numbers of data. Further, this estimator is adversarially robust: even if a (small) proportion of the data is maliciously modified, the procedure continuous to optimally estimate the true expected shortfall risk. We demonstrate that our estimator outperforms the classical plug-in estimator through a variety of numerical experiments across a range of standard loss distributions.</description>

      <title>Calibration of the rating transition model for high and low default portfolios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we develop Maximum likelihood (ML) based algorithms to calibrate the model parameters in credit rating transition models. Since the credit rating transition models are not Gaussian linear models, the celebrated Kalman filter is not suitable to compute the likelihood of observed migrations. Therefore, we develop a Laplace approximation of the likelihood function and as a result the Kalman filter can be used in the end to compute the likelihood function. This approach is applied to so-called high-default portfolios, in which the number of migrations (defaults) is large enough to obtain high accuracy of the Laplace approximation. By contrast, low-default portfolios have a limited number of observed migrations (defaults). Therefore, in order to calibrate low-default portfolios, we develop a ML algorithm using a particle filter (PF) and Gaussian process regression. Experiments show that both algorithms are efficient and produce accurate approximations of the likelihood function and the ML estimates of the model parameters.</description>

      <title>Some properties of Euler capital allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper discusses capital allocation using the Euler formula and focuses on the risk measures Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Expected shortfall (ES). Some new results connected to this capital allocation is known. Two examples illustrate that capital allocation with VaR is not monotonous which may be surprising since VaR is monotonous. A third example illustrates why the same risk measure should be used in capital allocation as in the evaluation of the total portfolio. We show how simulation may be used in order to estimate the expected Return on risk adjusted capital in the commitment period of an asset. Finally, we show how Markov chain Monte Carlo may be used in the estimation of the capital allocation.</description>

      <title>On Unified Adaptive Portfolio Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.03391v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a unified framework for adaptive portfolio management, integrating dynamic Black-Litterman (BL) optimization with the general factor model, Elastic Net regression, and mean-variance portfolio optimization, which allows us to generate investors views and mitigate potential estimation errors systematically. Specifically, we propose an innovative dynamic sliding window algorithm to respond to the constantly changing market conditions. This algorithm allows for the flexible window size adjustment based on market volatility, generating robust estimates for factor modeling, time-varying BL estimations, and optimal portfolio weights. Through extensive ten-year empirical studies using the top 100 capitalized assets in the S&amp;P 500 index, accounting for turnover transaction costs, we demonstrate that this combined approach leads to computational advantages and promising trading performances.</description>

      <title>QFNN-FFD: Quantum Federated Neural Network for Financial Fraud Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02595v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study introduces the Quantum Federated Neural Network for Financial Fraud Detection (QFNN-FFD), a cutting-edge framework merging Quantum Machine Learning (QML) and quantum computing with Federated Learning (FL) for financial fraud detection. Using quantum technologies' computational power and the robust data privacy protections offered by FL, QFNN-FFD emerges as a secure and efficient method for identifying fraudulent transactions within the financial sector. Implementing a dual-phase training model across distributed clients enhances data integrity and enables superior performance metrics, achieving precision rates consistently above 95%. Additionally, QFNN-FFD demonstrates exceptional resilience by maintaining an impressive 80% accuracy, highlighting its robustness and readiness for real-world applications. This combination of high performance, security, and robustness against noise positions QFNN-FFD as a transformative advancement in financial technology solutions and establishes it as a new benchmark for privacy-focused fraud detection systems. This framework facilitates the broader adoption of secure, quantum-enhanced financial services and inspires future innovations that could use QML to tackle complex challenges in other areas requiring high confidentiality and accuracy.</description>
