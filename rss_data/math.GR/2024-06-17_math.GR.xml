      <title>Acylindrical hyperbolicity and the centers of Artin groups that are not free of infinity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Charney and Morris-Wright showed acylindrical hyperbolicity of Artin groups of infinite type associated with graphs that are not joins, by studying clique-cube complexes and the actions on them. The authors developed their study and clarified when acylindrical hyperbolicity holds for Artin groups of infinite type associated with graphs that are not cones. In this paper, we introduce reduced clique-cube complexes. By using them, we show acylindrical hyperbolicity of irreducible Artin groups associated with graphs that are not cliques, that is, irreducible Artin groups that are not free of infinity. Such Artin groups contain infinite type Artin groups of type FC. As an application, we see that the centers of such Artin groups are finite, and that actually they are trivial in many cases.</description>

      <title>Forest-skein groups III: simplicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An Ore forest-skein category provides three forest-skein groups equipped with a powerful diagrammatic calculus analogous to Richard Thompson's groups F,T,V. We investigate when forest-skein groups have simple derived subgroups and establish two characterisations: a dynamical one and a categorical one. We then construct two classes of examples. The first associates two finitely presented simple groups to every finite binary tree and the second associates two simple groups to every n-ary Higman-Thompson group.</description>

      <title>Realizing Lie groups as automorphism groups of bounded domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a problem whether a given Lie group can be realized as the group of all biholomorphic automorphisms of a bounded domain in ${\mathbb C}^n$. In an earlier paper of 1990, the authors proved the result for connected linear Lie groups. In this paper we give examples of non-linear groups for which the result still holds.</description>

      <title>A Gentle Introduction to CAT(0) Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this project we explore the geometry of general metric spaces, where we do not necessarily have the tools of differential geometry on our side. Some metric spaces (X,d) allow us to define geodesics, permitting us to compare geodesic triangles in (X,d) to geodesic triangles in a so called model space. In Chapters 1 and 2 we first discuss how to define the length of curves, and geodesics on (X,d), and then using these to portray the notion of ``non-positive curvature'' for a metric space. Chapter 3 concerns itself with special cases of such non-positively curved metric spaces, called CAT(0) spaces. These satisfy particularly nice properties, such as being uniquely geodesic, contractible, and having a convex metric, among others.
  We mainly follow the book by Martin R. Bridson and Andr\'e Haefliger, with some differences. Firstly, we restrict ourselves to using the Euclidean plane E^2 as our model space, which is all that is necessary to define CAT(0) spaces. Secondly, we skip many sections of the mentioned book, as many are not relevant for our specific purposes. Finally, we add details to some of the proofs, which can be sparse in details or completely non-existent in the original literature. In this way we hope to create a more streamlined, self-contained, and accessible introduction to CAT(0) spaces.</description>

      <title>The planar $3$-colorable subgroup $\mathcal{E}$ of Thompson's group $F$ and its even part</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.12269v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the planar $3$-colorable subgroup $\mathcal{E}$ of Thompson's group $F$ and its even part $\mathcal{E}_{\rm EVEN}$. The latter is obtained by cutting $\mathcal{E}$ with a finite index subgroup of $F$ isomorphic to $F$, namely the rectangular subgroup $K_{(2,2)}$. We show that the even part $\mathcal{E}_{\rm EVEN}$ of the planar $3$-colorable subgroup admits a description in terms of stabilisers of suitable subsets of dyadic rationals. As a consequence $\mathcal{E}_{\rm EVEN}$ is closed in the sense of Golan and Sapir. We then study three quasi-regular representations associated with $\mathcal{E}_{\rm EVEN}$: two are shown to be irreducible and one to be reducible.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17840v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide examples of groups with transcendental spectral radius. The proofs relies on links between decidability of the Word Problem and semi-computability of the spectral radius, and on classical small-cancellation theory.</description>

      <title>Automatic continuity of pure mapping class groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.02599v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We completely classify the orientable infinite-type surfaces $S$ such that $\operatorname{PMap}(S)$, the pure mapping class group, has automatic continuity. This classification includes surfaces with noncompact boundary. In the case of surfaces with finitely many ends and no noncompact boundary components, we prove the mapping class group $\operatorname{Map}(S)$ does not have automatic continuity. We also completely classify the surfaces such that $\overline{\operatorname{PMap}_c(S)}$, the subgroup of the pure mapping class group composed of elements with representatives that can be approximated by compactly supported homeomorphisms, has automatic continuity. In some cases when $\overline{\operatorname{PMap}_c(S)}$ has automatic continuity, we show any homomorphism from $\overline{\operatorname{PMap}_c(S)}$ to a countable group is trivial.</description>
