      <title>On the Connectivity of Friends-and-strangers Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Friends-and-strangers graphs, coined by Defant and Kravitz, are denoted by $\mathsf{FS}(X,Y)$ where $X$ and $Y$ are both graphs on $n$ vertices. The graph $X$ represents positions and edges mark adjacent positions while the graph $Y$ represents people and edges mark friendships. The vertex set of $\mathsf{FS}(X,Y)$ consists of all one-to-one placements of people on positions, and there is an edge between any two placements if it is possible to swap two people who are friends and on adjacent positions to get from one placement to the other. Previous papers have studied when $\mathsf{FS}(X,Y)$ is connected. In this paper, we consider when $\mathsf{FS}(X,Y)$ is $k$-connected where a graph is $k$-connected if it remains connected after removing any $k-1$ or less vertices. We first consider $\mathsf{FS}(X,Y)$ when $Y$ is a complete graph or star graph. We find tight bounds on their connectivity, proving their connectivity equals their minimum degree. We further consider the size of the connected components of $\mathsf{FS}(X,\mathsf{Star}_n)$ where $X$ is connected. We show that asymptotically similar conditions as the conditions mentioned by Bangachev are sufficient for $\mathsf{FS}(X,Y)$ to be $k$-connected. Finally, we consider when $X$ and $Y$ are independent Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi random graphs on $n$ vertices and edge probability $p_1$ and $p_2,$ respectively. We show that for $p_0 = n^{-1/2+o(1)},$ if $p_1p_2\geq p_0^2$ and $p_1,$ $p_2 \geq w(n) p_0$ where $w(n) \rightarrow 0$ as $n \rightarrow \infty,$ then $\mathsf{FS}(X,Y)$ is $k$-connected with high probability. This is asymptotically tight as we show that below an asymptotically similar threshold $p_0'=n^{-1/2+o(1)}$, the graph $\mathsf{FS}(X,Y)$ is disconnected with high probability if $p_1p_2 \leq (p_0')^2$.</description>

      <title>Lines on digraphs of low diameter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A set of n non-collinear points in the Euclidean plane defines at least n different lines. Chen and Chv\'tal in 2008 conjectured that the same results is true in metric spaces for an adequate definition of line. More recently, it was conjectured in 2018 by Aboulker et al. that any large enough bridgeless graph on n vertices defines a metric space that has at least n lines. We study the natural extension of Aboulker et al.'s conjecture into the context of quasi-metric spaces defined by digraphs of low diameter. We prove that it is valid for quasi-metric spaces defined by bipartite digraphs of diameter at most three, oriented graphs of diameter two and, digraphs of diameter three and directed girth four.</description>

      <title>The length polyhedron of an interval order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The length polyhedron $Q_P$ of an interval order $P$ is the convex hull of integral vectors representing the interval lengths in interval representations of $P$. This polyhedron has been studied by various authors, including Fishburn and Isaak. Notably, $Q_P$ forms a pointed affine cone, a property inherited from being a projection of the representation polyhedron, a structure explored also by Doignon and Pauwels. The apex of the length polyhedron corresponds to Greenough's minimal endpoint representation, which is, in fact, the length vector of the canonical interval representation -- an interval representation that minimizes the sum of the interval lengths.
  Building on a combinatorial perspective of canonical representations, we refine Isaak's graph-theoretical model by introducing a new and simpler directed graph. From directed cycles of this key digraph, we extract a linear system of inequalities that precisely characterizes the length polyhedron $Q_P$. This combinatorial approach also reveals the unique Hilbert basis of the polyhedron. We prove that the intersection graph of the sets corresponding to these binary rays are Berge graphs; therefore they are perfect graphs. As a result, for interval orders with bounded width, the length polyhedron has a polynomial-sized Hilbert basis, which can be computed in polynomial time. We also provide an example of interval orders with a Hilbert basis of exponential size. In a companion paper we determine the Schrijver system for the length polyhedron. We conclude with open problems.</description>

      <title>Structure of Terwilliger algebras of quasi-thin association schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the Terwilliger algebra of a quasi-thin association scheme over a field is always a quasi-hereditary cellular algebra in the sense of Cline-Parshall-Scott and of Graham-Lehrer, repsectively, and that the basic algebra of the Terwilliger algebra is the dual extension of a star with all arrows pointing to its center if the field has characteristic $2$. Thus many homological and representation-theoretic properties of these Terwilliger algebras can be determined completely. For example, the Nakayama conjecture holds for Terwilliger algebras of quasi-thin association schemes.</description>

      <title>Optimization Tools for Computing Colorings of $[1,\cdots ,n]$ with Few Monochromatic Solutions on $3$-variable Linear Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A famous result in arithmetic Ramsey theory says that for many linear homogeneous equations $E$ there is a threshold value $R_k(E)$ (the Rado number of $E$) such that for any $k$-coloring of the integers in the interval $[1,n]$, with $n \ge R_k(E)$, there exists at least one monochromatic solution. But one can further ask, how many monochromatic solutions is the minimum possible in terms of $n$? Several authors have estimated this function before, here we offer new tools from integer and semidefinite optimization that help find either optimal or near optimal 2-colorings minimizing the number of monochromatic solutions of several families of 3-variable non-regular homogeneous linear equations. In the last part of the paper we further extend to three and more colors for the Schur equation, improving earlier work.</description>

      <title>Dual Mixed Volume</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define and study the dual mixed volume rational function of a sequence of polytopes, a dual version of the mixed volume polynomial. This concept has direct relations to the adjoint polynomials and the canonical forms of polytopes. We show that dual mixed volume is additive under mixed subdivisions, and is related by a change of variables to the dual volume of the Cayley polytope. We study dual mixed volume of zonotopes, generalized permutohedra, and associahedra. The latter reproduces the planar $\phi^3$-scalar amplitude at tree level.</description>

      <title>Zero Forcing and Vertex Independence Number on Cubic and Subcubic Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by a conjecture from the automated conjecturing program TxGraffiti, in this paper the relationship between the zero forcing number, $Z(G)$, and the vertex independence number, $\alpha(G)$, of cubic and subcubic graphs is explored. TxGraffiti conjectures that for all connected cubic graphs $G$, that are not $K_4$, $Z(G) \leq \alpha(G) + 1$. This work uses decycling partitions of upper-embeddable graphs to show that almost all cubic graphs satisfy $Z(G) \leq \alpha(G) + 2$, provides an infinite family of cubic graphs where $Z(G) = \alpha(G) + 1$, and extends known bounds to subcubic graphs.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Berge cycle of length $\ell$ in a hypergraph is an alternating sequence of $\ell$ distinct vertices and $\ell$ distinct edges $v_1,e_1,v_2, \ldots, v_\ell, e_{\ell}$ such that $\{v_i, v_{i+1}\} \subseteq e_i$ for all $i$, with indices taken modulo $\ell$. We call an $n$-vertex hypergraph pancyclic if it contains Berge cycles of every length from $3$ to $n$. We prove a sharp Dirac-type result guaranteeing pancyclicity in uniform hypergraphs: for $n \geq 70$, $3 \leq r \leq \lfloor (n-1)/2\rfloor - 2$, if $\cH$ is an $n$-vertex, $r$-uniform hypergraph with minimum degree at least ${\lfloor (n-1)/2 \rfloor \choose r-1} + 1$, then $\cH$ is pancyclic.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe a way to decompose the chromatic symmetric function as a positive sum of smaller pieces. We show that these pieces are $e$-positive for cycles. Then we prove that attaching a cycle to a graph preserves the $e$-positivity of these pieces. From this, we prove an $e$-positive formula for graphs of cycles connected at adjacent vertices. We extend these results to graphs formed by connecting a sequence of cycles and cliques.</description>

      <title>Maximal Independent Sets in Planar Triangulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that every planar triangulation on $n$ vertices has a maximal independent set of size at most $n/3$. This affirms a conjecture by Botler, Fernandes and Guti\'errez [Electron.\ J.\ Comb., 2024], which in turn would follow if an open question of Goddard and Henning [Appl.\ Math.\ Comput., 2020] which asks if every planar triangulation has three disjoint maximal independent sets were answered in the affirmative. Since a maximal independent set is a special type of dominating set (independent dominating set), this is a structural strengthening of a major result by Matheson and Tarjan [Eur.\ J.\ Comb., 1996] that every triangulated disc has a dominating set of size at most $n/3$, but restricted to triangulations.</description>

      <title>The number of arcs in $\mathbb{F}_q^2$ of a given cardinality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A subset of $\mathbb{F}_q^2$ is called an arc if it does not contain three collinear points. We show that there are at most $\binom{(1 + o(1))q}{m}$ arcs of size $m \gg q^{1/2} (\log q)^{3/2}$, nearly matching a trivial lower bound $\binom{q}{m}$. This was previously known to hold for $m \gg q^{2/3} (\log q)^3$, due to Bhowmick and Roche-Newton. The lower bound on $m$ is best possible up to a logarithmic factor.</description>

      <title>Graphs with positive Lin-Lu-Yau curvature without Quadrilateral</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The definition of Ricci curvature on graphs given in Lin-Lu-Yau, Tohoku Math., 2011, which is a variation of Ollivier, J. Funct. Math., 2009. Recently, a powerful limit-free formulation of Lin-Lu-Yau curvature using graph Laplacian was given in M\"{u}nch-Wojciechowski, Adv. Math., 2019. Let $F_k$ be the friendship graph obtained from $k$ triangles by sharing a common vertex and $T$ be the graph obtained from a triangle and $K_{1,3}$ by adding a matching between every leave of $K_{1,3}$ and a vertex of the triangle. In this paper, we classify all of connected $C_4$-free graphs with positive LLY curvature for minimum degree at least 2: the cycles $C_3,C_5$, the friendship graphs $F_2,F_3$ and $T$.</description>

      <title>New bounds of two hypergraph Ramsey problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We focus on two hypergraph Ramsey problems. First, we consider the Erd\H{o}s-Hajnal function $r_k(k+1,t;n)$. In 1972, Erd\H{o}s and Hajnal conjectured that the tower growth rate of $r_k(k+1,t;n)$ is $t-1$ for each $2\le t\le k$. To finish this conjecture, it remains to show that the tower growth rate of $r_4(5,4;n)$ is three. We prove a superexponential lower bound for $r_4(5,4;n)$, which improves the previous best lower bound $r_4(5,4;n)\geq 2^{\Omega(n^2)}$ from Mubayi and Suk (\emph{J. Eur. Math. Soc., 2020}). Second, we prove an upper bound for the hypergraph Erd\H{o}s-Rogers function $f^{(k)}_{k+1,k+2}(N)$ that is an iterated $(k-3)$-fold logarithm in $N$ for each $k\geq 5$. This improves the previous upper bound that is an iterated $(k-13)$-fold logarithm in $N$ for $k\ge14$ due to Mubayi and Suk (\emph{J. London Math. Soc., 2018}), in which they conjectured that $f^{(k)}_{k+1,k+2}(N)$ is an iterated $(k-2)$-fold logarithm in $N$ for each $k\ge3$.</description>

      <title>Two classes of connectivity-related non-Hamiltonian 1-planar perfect graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The existence of Hamiltonian cycles in 1-planar graphs with higher connectivity has attracted considerable attention. Recently, the authors and Dong proved that 4-connected 1-planar chordal graphs are Hamiltonian-connected. In this paper, we investigate the non-Hamiltonicity of a broader class of graphs, specifically perfect graphs, under the constraint of 1-planarity, with a focus on connectivity of at most 5. We also propose some unsolved problems.</description>

Abstract: Graham, R\"odl, and Ruci\'nski originally posed the problem of determining the minimum number of monochromatic Schur triples that must appear in any 2-coloring of the first $n$ integers. This question was subsequently resolved independently by Datskovsky, Schoen, and Robertson and Zeilberger. Here we suggest studying a natural anti-Ramsey variant of this question and establish the first non-trivial bounds by proving that the maximum fraction of Schur triples that can be rainbow in a given $3$-coloring of the first $n$ integers is at least $0.4$ and at most $0.66656$. We conjecture the lower bound to be tight. This question is also motivated by a famous analogous problem in graph theory due to Erd\H{o}s and S\'os regarding the maximum number of rainbow triangles in any $3$-coloring of $K_n$, which was settled by Balogh et al.</description>

      <title>Interplay of Cubic Graphs and Simplicial Surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simplicial surfaces describe the incidence relations between vertices, edges and faces of triangulated 2-dimensional manifolds in a purely combinatorial way. By considering only the incidences of edges and faces, simplicial surfaces are closely related to cubic graphs. In this paper we investigate how properties of simplicial surfaces and cubic graphs can be transferred to each other. Furthermore, we study embeddings of cubic graphs on simplicial surfaces and how they are connected to strong graph embeddings. For instance, 3-connected cubic planar graphs are uniquely embeddable on simplicial spheres, which is a direct consequence of Whitney's embedding theorem. Moreover, 3-connected cubic planar graphs can also be embedded on simplicial surfaces of higher genus. We characterise the properties that a simplicial sphere must possess such that the cubic graph describing its edge-face incidence relation can be embedded on a simplicial surface of non-negative Euler characteristic.</description>

      <title>Irreducibility, Smoothness, and Connectivity of Realization Spaces of Matroids and Hyperplane Arrangements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the realization spaces of matroids and hyperplane arrangements. First, we define the notion of naive dimension for the realization space of matroids and compare it with the expected dimension and the algebraic dimension, exploring the conditions under which these dimensions coincide. Next, we introduce the family of inductively connected matroids and investigate their realization spaces, establishing that they are smooth, irreducible, and isomorphic to a Zariski open subset of a complex space with a known dimension. Furthermore, we present an explicit procedure for computing their defining equations. As corollaries, we identify families of hyperplane arrangements whose moduli spaces are connected. Finally, we apply our results to study the rigidity of matroids. Rigidity, which involves matroids with a unique realization under projective transformations, is key to understanding the connectivity of the moduli spaces of the corresponding hyperplane arrangements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical parking functions are a generalization of permutations that appear in many combinatorial structures. Prime parking functions are indecomposable components such that any classical parking function can be uniquely described as a direct sum of prime ones. In this article, we extend the notion of primeness to three generalizations of classical parking functions: vector parking functions, $(p,q)$-parking functions, and two-dimensional vector parking functions. We study their enumeration by obtaining explicit formulas for the number of prime vector parking functions when the vector is an arithmetic progression, prime $(p,q)$-parking functions, and prime two-dimensional vector parking functions when the weight matrix is an affine transformation of the coordinates.</description>

      <title>Disjoint zero-sum subsets in Abelian groups and its application -- survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a summary of research on disjoint zero-sum subsets in finite Abelian groups, which is a branch of additive group theory and combinatorial number theory. An orthomorphism of a group $\Gamma$ is defined as a bijection $\varphi$ $\Gamma$ such that the mapping $g \mapsto g^{-1}\varphi(g)$ is also bijective. In 1981, Friedlander, Gordon, and Tannenbaum conjectured that when $\Gamma$ is Abelian, for any $k \geq 2$ dividing $|\Gamma| -1$, there exists an orthomorphism of $\Gamma$ fixing the identity and permuting the remaining elements as products of disjoint $k$-cycles. Using the idea of disjoint-zero sum subset we provide a solution of this conjecture for $k=3$ and $|\Gamma|\cong 4\pmod{24}$. We also present some applications of zero-sum sets in graph labeling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper makes some preliminary observations towards an extension of current work on graphs defined on groups to simplicial complexes. I define a variety of simplicial complexes on a group which are preserved by automorphisms of the group, and in many cases have a relation to familiar graphs on the group. The ones which seem to reach deepest into the graph structure are two forms of independence complex, and some results on the class of groups for which these two complexes coincide are given. Other examples are treated more briefly.</description>

Abstract: We provide explicit combinatorial formulas for the Chow polynomial and for the augmented Chow polynomial of uniform matroids, thereby proving a conjecture by Ferroni. These formulas refine existing formulas by Hampe and by Eur, Huh, and Larson, offering a combinatorial interpretation of the coefficients based on Schubert matroids. As a byproduct, we count Schubert matroids by rank, number of loops, and cogirth.</description>

      <title>Cryptarithmically unique terms in integer sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A cryptarithm (or alphametic) is a mathematical puzzle in which numbers are represented with words in such a way that identical letters stand for equal digits and distinct letters for unequal digits. An alphametic puzzle is usually given in the form of an equation that needs to be solved, such as SEND + MORE = MONEY. Alternatively, here we will consider cryptarithms constrained not by an equation but by a particular subsequence of natural numbers, for example perfect squares or primes. Such a cryptarithm has a unique solution if there is exactly one term in the sequence that has the corresponding pattern of digits. We will call such terms cryptarithmically unique. Here we estimate the density of such terms in an arbitrary sequence for which the overall density of terms among integers is known. In particular, among all perfect squares below 10^12, slightly less than one half are cryptarithmically unique, their density increasing toward larger numbers. Cryptarithmically unique prime numbers, however, are initially very scarce. Combinatorial estimates suggest that their density should drop below 10^-300 for decimal lengths of approximately 1829 digits, but then it recovers and is asymptotic to unity for very large primes. Finally, we introduce and discuss primonumerophobic digit patterns that no prime number happens to have.</description>

      <title>On the stability of solutions to random optimization problems under small perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider the Euclidean traveling salesman problem with $n$ random points on the plane. Suppose that one of the points is shifted to a new random location. This gives us a new optimal path. Consider such shifts for each of the $n$ points. Do we get $n$ very different optimal paths? In this article, we show that this is not the case - in fact, the number of truly different paths can be at most $\mathcal{O}(1)$ as $n\to \infty$. The proof is based on a general argument which allows us to prove similar stability results in a number of other settings, such as branching random walk, the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model of mean-field spin glasses, the Edwards-Anderson model of short-range spin glasses, and the Wigner ensemble of random matrices.</description>

      <title>Twisted multiline queues for the steady states of TASEP and TAZRP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define an algorithm on fermionic and bosonic twisted multiline queues that projects to the multispecies totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP) and the totally asymmetric zero range process (TAZRP) on a ring, respectively. Our algorithm on fermionic multiline queues generalizes the Ferrari-Martin algorithm for TASEP, and we show it is equivalent to the algorithm of Arita-Ayyer-Mallick-Prolhac (2011). Our algorithm on bosonic multiline queues is novel and generalizes the corresponding algorithm of Kuniba-Maruyama-Okado (2016) for the TAZRP. We also define a Markov process on bosonic twisted multiline queues that projects to the TAZRP and intertwines with the symmetric group action on the rows of the multiline queues.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The monography presents a new algorithm for finding the clique of maximal length in a nonseparable graph. The algorithm is based on the properties of the representation of a clique as a subset of the set of cycles with a length of three, the ring sum of which is an empty set. As a result of selecting the cycles of the length of three, two vectors are formed: the vector of cycles passing through the edges and the vector of cycles passing through the vertices. The numerical values of the components of these vectors determine the weights of the vertices and edges. The iterative process of constructing the set of vectors of cycles passing through the edges allows identifying the main vector of cycles passing through the edges. In turn, the construction of the main vector allows finding the clicks of the graph. The computational complexity of the presented algorithm is analyzed.</description>

Abstract: We study the problem of partitioning the unit cube $[0,1]^n$ into $c$ parts so that each $d$-dimensional axis-parallel projection has small volume.
  This natural combinatorial/geometric question was first studied by Kopparty and Nagargoje [KN23] as a reformulation of the problem of determining the achievable parameters for seedless multimergers -- which extract randomness from `$d$-where' random sources (generalizing somewhere random sources). This question is closely related to influences of variables and is about a partition analogue of Shearer's lemma.
  Our main result answers a question of [KN23]: for $d = n-1$, we show that for $c$ even as large as $2^{o(n)}$, it is possible to partition $[0,1]^n$ into $c$ parts so that every $n-1$-dimensional axis-parallel projection has volume at most $(1/c) ( 1 + o(1) )$. Previously, this was shown by [KN23] for $c$ up to $O(\sqrt{n})$. The construction of our partition is related to influences of functions, and we present a clean geometric/combinatorial conjecture about this partitioning problem that would imply the KKL theorem on influences of Boolean functions.</description>

      <title>Balanced Bidirectional Breadth-First Search on Scale-Free Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To find a shortest path between two nodes $s_0$ and $s_1$ in a given graph, a classical approach is to start a Breadth-First Search (BFS) from $s_0$ and run it until the search discovers $s_1$. Alternatively, one can start two Breadth-First Searches, one from $s_0$ and one from $s_1$, and alternate their layer expansions until they meet. This bidirectional BFS can be balanced by always expanding a layer on the side that has discovered fewer vertices so far. This usually results in significant speedups in real-world networks, and it has been shown that this indeed yields sublinear running time on scale-free graph models such as Chung-Lu graphs and hyperbolic random graphs.
  We improve this layer-balanced bidirectional BFS approach by using a finer balancing technique. Instead of comparing the size of the two BFS trees after each layer expansion, we perform this comparison after each vertex expansion. This gives rise to two algorithms that run faster than the layer-balanced bidirectional BFS on scale-free networks with power-law exponent $\tau \in (2,3)$. The first one is an approximate shortest-path algorithm that outputs a path of length at most 1 longer than the shortest path in time $n^{(\tau-2)/(\tau-1)+o(1)}$. The second one is an exact shortest-path algorithm running in time $n^{1/2+o(1)}$. These runtime bounds hold with high probability when $s_0$ and $s_1$ are chosen uniformly at random among the $n$ vertices of the graph. We also develop an edge-balanced bidirectional BFS algorithm that works under adversarial conditions. This approximate shortest-path algorithm runs in time $n^{1/2+o(1)}$ with high probability when the adversary is allowed to choose $s_0$ and $s_1$ based on their (expected) degree. We complement our theoretical results with experiments on Chung-Lu graphs, Geometric Inhomogeneous Random Graphs, and real-world networks.</description>

      <title>The fixed point property of a poset and the fixed point property of the poset induced by its extremal points</title>

      <description>arXiv:2107.03122v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a connected finite poset $P$, let $E(P)$ be the poset induced by the extremal points of $P$. We show that the fixed point property of $E(P)$ implies the fixed point property of $P$. On the other hand, we show that a homomorphism $f : E(P) \rightarrow Q$ can be extended to $P$ if $Q$ is a flat poset not containing a 4-crown. We conclude that every retract-crown of $E(P)$ with more than four points is a retract-crown of $P$, too. We see that for $P$ having the fixed point property but $E(P)$ not, every edge of every crown in $E(P)$ must belong to a so-called improper 4-crown, with additional specifications if $P$ has height two. The results provide several sufficient and necessary conditions for $P$ having the fixed point property, and these conditions refer to objects simpler than $P$.</description>

Abstract: A coloring of vertices of a graph is called perfect if, for every vertex, the collection of colors of its neighbors depends only on its own color. The correspondent color partition of vertices is called equitable. We note that a number of bounds (Hoffman bound, Cheeger bound, Bierbrauer--Friedman bound and other) is only reached on perfect $2$-colorings. We show that the Expander Mixing Lemma is another example of an inequality that generates a perfect $2$-coloring. We prove a new upper bound for the size of $S\subset V(G)$ with the fixed average internal degree for an amply regular graph $G$. This bound is reached on the set $S$ if and only if $\{S, V(G)\setminus S\}$ is an equitable partition.</description>

Abstract: The Central Sets Theorem near zero was originally proved by Hindman and Leader. Later a version of Central Sets Theorem was proved by De, Hindman and Strauss known to be the stronger Central Sets Theorem. Subsequently many other versions of Central Sets Theorem came, among which Dev Phulara proved the theorem for a sequence of central sets instead of taking one set. In this paper, we provide various general versions of the theorem along Dev Phulara's way with some Ramsey theoretic applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.03044v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The homotopy type of the complement manifold of a complexified toric arrangement has been investigated by d'Antonio and Delucchi in a paper that shows the minimality of such topological space. In this work we associate to a given toric arrangement a matrix that represents the arrangement over the integers. Then, we consider the family of toric arrangements for which this matrix has maximal rank. Our goal is to prove, by means of basic linear algebra arguments, that the complement manifold of the toric arrangements that belong to this family is diffeomorphic to that of centered toric arrangements and thus it is a minimal topological space, too.</description>

      <title>Dirac-type Problem of Rainbow matchings and Hamilton cycles in Random Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.05477v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a family of graphs $G_1,\dots,G_{n}$ on the same vertex set $[n]$, a rainbow Hamilton cycle is a Hamilton cycle on $[n]$ such that each $G_c$ contributes exactly one edge. We prove that if $G_1,\dots,G_{n}$ are independent samples of $G(n,p)$ on the same vertex set $[n]$, then for each $\varepsilon&gt;0$, whp, every collection of spanning subgraphs $H_c\subseteq G_c$, with $\delta(H_c)\geq(\frac{1}{2}+\varepsilon)np$, admits a rainbow Hamilton cycle. A similar result is proved for rainbow perfect matchings in a family of $n/2$ graphs on the same vertex set $[n]$.</description>

      <title>A note on the random triadic process</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.02001v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a fixed integer $r\geqslant 3$, let $\mathbb{H}_r(n,p)$ be a random $r$-uniform hypergraph on the vertex set $[n]$, where each $r$-set is an edge randomly and independently with probability $p$. The random $r$-generalized triadic process starts with a complete bipartite graph $K_{r-2,n-r+2}$ on the same vertex set, chooses two distinct vertices $x$ and $y$ uniformly at random and iteratively adds $\{x,y\}$ as an edge if there is a subset $Z$ with size $r-2$, denoted as $Z=\{z_1,\cdots,z_{r-2}\}$, such that $\{x,z_i\}$ and $\{y,z_i\}$ for $1\leqslant i\leqslant r-2$ are already edges in the graph and $\{x,y, z_1,\cdots,z_{r-2}\}$ is an edge in $\mathbb{H}_r(n,p)$. The random triadic process is an abbreviation for the random $3$-generalized triadic process. Kor\'{a}ndi et al. proved a sharp threshold probability for the propagation of the random triadic process, that is, if $p= cn^{ - \frac 12}$ for some positive constant $c$, with high probability, the triadic process reaches the complete graph when $c&gt; \frac 12$ and stops at $O(n^{\frac 32})$ edges when $c&lt; \frac 12$. In this note, we consider the final size of the random $r$-generalized triadic process when $p=o( n^{- \frac 12}\log^{ \alpha(3-r)} n)$ with a constant $\alpha&gt; \frac 12$. We show that the generated graph of the process essentially behaves like $\mathbb{G}(n,p)$. The final number of added edges in the process, with high probability, equals $ \frac {1}{2}n^{2}p(1\pm o(1))$ provided that $p=\omega(n^{-2})$. The results partially complement the ones on the case of $r=3$.</description>

      <title>New bijective proofs pertaining to alternating sign matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.00413v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The alternating sign matrices-descending plane partitions (ASM-DPP) bijection problem is one of the most intriguing open problems in bijective combinatorics, which is also relevant to integrable combinatorics. The notion of a signed set and a signed bijection is used in [Fischer, I. \&amp; Konvalinka, M., Electron. J. Comb., 27 (2020) 3-35.] to construct a bijection between $\text{ASM}_n \times \text{DPP}_{n-1}$ and $\text{DPP}_n \times \text{ASM}_{n-1}$. Here, we shall construct a more natural alternative to a signed bijection between alternating sign matrices and shifted Gelfand-Tsetlin patterns which is presented in that paper, based on the notion of compatibility which we introduce to measure the naturalness of a signed bijection. In addition, we give a bijective proof for the refined enumeration of an extension of alternating sign matrices with $n+3$ statistics, first proved in [Fischer, I. \&amp; Schreier-Aigner, F., Advances in Mathematics 413 (2023) 108831.].</description>

      <title>Increasing subsequences, matrix loci, and Viennot shadows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.08718v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathbf{x}_{n \times n}$ be an $n \times n$ matrix of variables and let $\mathbb{F}[\mathbf{x}_{n \times n}]$ be the polynomial ring in these variables over a field $\mathbb{F}$. We study the ideal $I_n \subseteq \mathbb{F}[\mathbf{x}_{n \times n}]$ generated by all row and column variable sums and all products of two variables drawn from the same row or column. We show that the quotient $\mathbb{F}[\mathbf{x}_{n \times n}]/I_n$ admits a standard monomial basis determined by Viennot's shadow line avatar of the Schensted correspondence. As a corollary, the Hilbert series of $\mathbb{F}[\mathbf{x}_{n \times n}]/I_n$ is the generating function of permutations in $\mathfrak{S}_n$ by the length of their longest increasing subsequence. Along the way, we describe a `shadow junta' basis of the vector space of $k$-local permutation statistics. We also calculate the structure of $\mathbb{F}[\mathbf{x}_{n \times n}]/I_n$ as a graded $\mathfrak{S}_n \times \mathfrak{S}_n$-module.</description>

      <title>A Study on Filter Version of Strongly Central Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02020v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the notions of Topological dynamics, H. Furstenberg defined central sets and proved the Central Sets Theorem. Later V. Bergelson and N. Hindman characterized central sets in terms of algebra of the Stone-\v{C}ech compactification of discrete semigroup. They found that central sets are the members of the minimal idempotents of \b{eta}S, the Stone-\v{C}ech compactification of a semigroup (S, .). Hindman and leader introduced the notion of Central set near zero algebraically. Later dynamical and combinatorial characterization have also been established. For any given filter F in S a set A is said to be a F- central set if it is a member of a minimal idempotent of a closed subsemigroup of \b{eta}S, generated by the filter F. In a recent article Bergelson, Hindman and Strauss introduced strongly central and very strongly central sets in [BHS]. They also dynamically characterized the sets in the same paper. In the present article we will characterize the strongly F- central sets dynamically and combinatorially. Here we introduce the filter version of strongly central sets and very strongly central sets. We also provide dynamical and combinatorial characterization of such sets.</description>

      <title>Cop numbers of periodic graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.13616v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A \emph{periodic graph} ${\cal G}=(G_0, G_1, G_2, \dots)$ with period $p$ is an infinite periodic sequence of graphs $G_i = G_{i + p} = (V,E_i)$, where $i \geq 0$. The graph $G=(V,\cup_i E_i)$ is called the footprint of ${\cal G}$. Recently, the arena where the Cops and Robber game is played has been extended from a graph to a periodic graph; in this case, the \emph{cop number} is also the minimum number of cops sufficient for capturing the robber. We study the connections and distinctions between the cop number $c({\cal G})$ of a periodic graph ${\cal G}$ and the cop number $c(G)$ of its footprint $G$ and establish several facts. For instance, we show that the smallest periodic graph with $c({\cal G}) = 3$ has at most $8$ nodes; in contrast, the smallest graph $G$ with $c(G) = 3$ has $10$ nodes.
  We push this investigation by generating multiple examples showing how the cop numbers of a periodic graph ${\cal G}$, the subgraphs $G_i$ and its footprint $G$ can be loosely tied.
  Based on these results, we derive upper bounds on the cop number of a periodic graph from properties of its footprint such as its treewidth.</description>

      <title>Finding $d$-Cuts in Graphs of Bounded Diameter, Graphs of Bounded Radius and $H$-Free Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11389v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $d$-Cut problem is to decide if a graph has an edge cut such that each vertex has at most $d$ neighbours at the opposite side of the cut. If $d=1$, we obtain the intensively studied Matching Cut problem. The $d$-Cut problem has been studied as well, but a systematic study for special graph classes was lacking. We initiate such a study and consider classes of bounded diameter, bounded radius and $H$-free graphs. We prove that for all $d\geq 2$, $d$-Cut is polynomial-time solvable for graphs of diameter $2$, $(P_3+P_4)$-free graphs and $P_5$-free graphs. These results extend known results for $d=1$. However, we also prove several NP-hardness results for $d$-Cut that contrast known polynomial-time results for $d=1$. Our results lead to full dichotomies for bounded diameter and bounded radius and to almost-complete dichotomies for $H$-free graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17349v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rectangulations are decompositions of a square into finitely many axis-aligned rectangles. We describe realizations of $(n-1)$-dimensional polytopes associated with two combinatorial families of rectangulations composed of $n$ rectangles. They are defined as quotientopes of natural lattice congruences on the weak Bruhat order on permutations in $\mathfrak{S}_n$, and their skeleta are flip graphs on rectangulations. We give simple vertex and facet descriptions of these polytopes, in particular elementary formulas for computing the coordinates of the vertex corresponding to each rectangulation, in the spirit of J.-L. Loday's realization of the associahedron.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00745v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the Chow ring and augmented Chow ring of a matroid is equivariant $\gamma$-positivity under the action of any group of automorphisms of the matroid. This verifies a conjecture of Angarone, Nathanson, and Reiner. Our method gives an explicit interpretation to the coefficients of the equivariant $\gamma$-expansion. Applying our theorem to uniform matroids, we extend and recover known results regarding the positivity of the equivariant Charney-Davis quantity of uniform matroids in the author's previous work and the Schur-$\gamma$-positivity of Eulerian and binomial Eulerian quasisymmetric functions first proved by Shareshian and Wachs. In the end, we answer a problem proposed by Athanasiadis about extending the $\gamma$-expansion of the binomial Eulerian polynomial.</description>

      <title>Spectral extremal problems on outerplanar and planar graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18598v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\emph{spex}_{\mathcal{OP}}(n,F)$ and $\emph{spex}_{\mathcal{P}}(n,F)$ be the maximum spectral radius over all $n$-vertex $F$-free outerplanar graphs and planar graphs, respectively. Define $tC_l$ as $t$ vertex-disjoint $l$-cycles, $B_{tl}$ as the graph obtained by sharing a common vertex among $t$ edge-disjoint $l$-cycles %$B_{tl}$ as the graph obtained by connecting all cycles in $tC_l$ at a single vertex, and $(t+1)K_{2}$ as the disjoint union of $t+1$ copies of $K_2$. In the 1990s, Cvetkovi\'c and Rowlinson conjectured $K_1 \vee P_{n-1}$ maximizes spectral radius in outerplanar graphs on $n$ vertices, while Boots and Royle (independently, Cao and Vince) conjectured $K_2 \vee P_{n-2} $ does so in planar graphs. Tait and Tobin [J. Combin. Theory Ser. B, 2017] determined the fundamental structure as the key to confirming these two conjectures for sufficiently large $n.$ Recently, Fang et al. [J. Graph Theory, 2024] characterized the extremal graph with $\emph{spex}_{\mathcal{P}}(n,tC_l)$ in planar graphs by using this key. In this paper, we first focus on outerplanar graphs and adopt a similar approach to describe the key structure of the connected extremal graph with $\emph{spex}_{\mathcal{OP}}(n,F)$, where $F$ is contained in $K_1 \vee P_{n-1}$ but not in $K_{1} \vee ((t-1)K_2\cup(n-2t+1)K_1)$. Based on this structure, we determine $\emph{spex}_{\mathcal{OP}}(n,B_{tl})$ and $\emph{spex}_{\mathcal{OP}}(n,(t+1)K_{2})$ along with their unique extremal graphs for all $t\geq1$, $l\geq3$ and large $n$. Moreover, we further extend the results to planar graphs, characterizing the unique extremal graph with $\emph{spex}_{\mathcal{P}}(n,B_{tl})$ for all $t\geq3$, $l\geq3$ and large $n$.</description>

      <title>Large Cuts in Hypergraphs via Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01682v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A simple probabilistic argument shows that every $r$-uniform hypergraph with $m$ edges contains an $r$-partite subhypergraph with at least $\frac{r!}{r^r}m$ edges. The celebrated result of Edwards states that in the case of graphs, that is $r=2$, the resulting bound $m/2$ can be improved to $m/2+\Omega(m^{1/2})$, and this is sharp. We prove that if $r\geq 3$, then there is an $r$-partite subhypergraph with at least $\frac{r!}{r^r} m+m^{3/5-o(1)}$ edges. Moreover, if the hypergraph is linear, this can be improved to $\frac{r!}{r^r} m+m^{3/4-o(1)},$ which is tight up to the $o(1)$ term. These improve results of Conlon, Fox, Kwan, and Sudakov. Our proof is based on a combination of probabilistic, combinatorial, and linear algebraic techniques, and semidefinite programming.
  A key part of our argument is relating the energy $\mathcal{E}(G)$ of a graph $G$ (i.e. the sum of absolute values of eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix) to its maximum cut. We prove that every $m$ edge multigraph $G$ has a cut of size at least $m/2+\Omega(\frac{\mathcal{E}(G)}{\log m})$, which might be of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07261v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: $n$-circuits are series-parallel networks composed of exactly $n$ unit resistors. This paper is focused on evaluating the mean resistance of all $n$-circuits, $M_n$, establishing that it lies between $1$ and $4.3954$ for all $n$. We ultimately conjecture that $M_n$ converges to $1.25$ as $n$ grows, based on computational analysis and other intuitive arguments. Although the number of $n$-circuits has been explored quite thoroughly, this paper also provides complete proofs of some important results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11804v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For Grassmannians, Lusztig's notion of total positivity coincides with positivity of the Plucker coordinates. This coincidence underpins the rich interaction between matroid theory, tropical geometry, and the theory of total positivity. Bloch and Karp furthermore characterized the (type A) partial flag varieties for which the two notions of positivity similarly coincide. We characterize the symplectic (type C) and odd-orthogonal (type B) partial flag varieties for which Lusztig's total positivity coincides with Plucker positivity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20832v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The celebrated Andr\'{a}sfai--Erd\H{o}s--S\'{o}s Theorem from 1974 shows that every $n$-vertex triangle-free graph with minimum degree greater than $2n/5$ must be bipartite. Its extensions to $3$-uniform hypergraphs without the generalized triangle $F_5 = \{abc, abd, cde\}$ have been explored in several previous works such as~\cite{LMR23unif,HLZ24}, demonstrating the existence of $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ such that for large $n$, every $n$-vertex $F_5$-free $3$-graph with minimum degree greater than $(1/9-\varepsilon) n^2$ must be $3$-partite.
  We determine the optimal value for $\varepsilon$ by showing that for $n \ge 5000$, every $n$-vertex $F_5$-free $3$-graph with minimum degree greater than $4n^2/45$ must be $3$-partite, thus establishing the first tight Andr\'{a}sfai--Erd\H{o}s--S\'{o}s type theorem for hypergraphs. As a corollary, for all positive $n$, every $n$-vertex cancellative $3$-graph with minimum degree greater than $4n^2/45$ must be $3$-partite. This result is also optimal and considerably strengthens prior work, such as that by Bollob\'{a}s~\cite{Bol74} and Keevash--Mubayi~\cite{KM04Cancel}.</description>

      <title>Vertex decomposability and weakly polymatroidal ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.06756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.06756v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $K$ be a field and $R=K[x_1,\ldots, x_n]$ be the polynomial ring in $n$ variables over a field $K$. Let $\Delta$ be a simplicial complex on $n$ vertices and $I=I_{\Delta}$ be its Stanley-Reisner ideal. In this paper, we show that if $I$ is a matroidal ideal then the following conditions are equivalent: $(i)$ $\Delta$ is sequentially Cohen-Macaulay; $(ii)$ $\Delta$ is shellable; $(iii)$ $\Delta$ is vertex decomposable. Also, if $I$ is a minimally generated by $u_1,\ldots,u_s$ such that $s\leq 3$ or ${\rm supp}(u_i)\cup {\rm supp}(u_j)=\{x_1,\ldots,x_n\}$ for all $i\neq j$, then $\Delta$ is vertex decomposable. Furthermore, we prove that if $I$ is a monomial ideal of degree $2$ then $I$ is weakly polymatroidal if and only if $I$ has linear quotients if and only if $I$ is vertex splittable.</description>

      <title>Concatenating Random Matchings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.11596v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the concatenation of $t$ uniformly random perfect matchings on $2n$ vertices, where the operation of concatenation is inspired by the multiplication of generators of the Brauer algebra $\mathfrak{B}_n(\delta)$. For the resulting random string diagram $\mathsf{Br}_n(t)$, we observe a giant component if and only if $n$ is odd, and as $t\to\infty$ we obtain asymptotic results concerning the number of loops, the size of the giant component, and the number of loops of a given shape. Moreover, we give a local description of the giant component. These results mainly rely on the use of renewal theory and the coding of connected components of $\mathsf{Br}_n(t)$ by random vertex-exploration processes.</description>

      <title>ABCD: Algorithm for Balanced Component Discovery in Signed Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00848v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The largest balanced element in signed graphs plays a vital role in helping researchers understand the fundamental structure of the graph, as it reveals valuable information about the complex relationships between vertices in the network. The challenge is an NP-hard problem; there is no current baseline to evaluate state-of-the-art signed graphs derived from real networks. In this paper, we propose a scalable state-of-the-art approach for the maximum balanced sub-graph detection in the network of \emph{any} size. The proposed approach finds the largest balanced sub-graph by considering only the top $K$ balanced states with the lowest frustration index. We show that the ABCD method selects a subset from an extensive signed network with millions of vertices and edges, and the size of the discovered subset is double that of the state-of-the-art in a similar time frame.</description>

      <title>Scaling Frustration Index and Corresponding Balanced State Discovery for Real Signed Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00869v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Structural balance modeling for signed graph networks presents how to model the sources of conflicts. The state-of-the-art focuses on computing the frustration index of a signed graph, a critical step toward solving problems in social and sensor networks and scientific modeling. The proposed approaches do not scale to large signed networks of tens of millions of vertices and edges. In this paper, we propose two efficient algorithms, a tree-based \emph{graphBpp} and a gradient descent-based \emph{graphL}. We show that both algorithms outperform state-of-art in terms of efficiency and effectiveness for discovering the balanced state for \emph{any} size of the network. We introduce the first comparison for large graphs for the exact, tree-based, and gradient descent-based methods. The speedup of the methods is around \emph{300+ times faster} than the state-of-the-art for large signed graphs. We find that the exact method excels at optimally finding the frustration for small graphs only. \emph{graphBpp} scales this approximation to large signed graphs at the cost of accuracy. \emph{graphL} produces a state with a lower frustration at the cost of selecting a proper variable initialization and hyperparameter tuning.</description>

      <title>On Sparse Covers of Minor Free Graphs, Low Dimensional Metric Embeddings, and other applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14060v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a metric space $(X,d_X)$, a $(\beta,s,\Delta)$-sparse cover is a collection of clusters $\mathcal{C}\subseteq P(X)$ with diameter at most $\Delta$, such that for every point $x\in X$, the ball $B_X(x,\frac\Delta\beta)$ is fully contained in some cluster $C\in \mathcal{C}$, and $x$ belongs to at most $s$ clusters in $\mathcal{C}$. Our main contribution is to show that the shortest path metric of every $K_r$-minor free graphs admits $(O(r),O(r^2),\Delta)$-sparse cover, and for every $\epsilon&gt;0$, $(4+\epsilon,O(\frac1\epsilon)^r,\Delta)$-sparse cover (for arbitrary $\Delta&gt;0$). We then use this sparse cover to show that every $K_r$-minor free graph embeds into $\ell_\infty^{\tilde{O}(\frac1\epsilon)^{r+1}\cdot\log n}$ with distortion $3+\epsilon$ (resp. into $\ell_\infty^{\tilde{O}(r^2)\cdot\log n}$ with distortion $O(r)$). Further, among other applications, this sparse cover immediately implies an algorithm for the oblivious buy-at-bulk problem in fixed minor free graphs with the tight approximation factor $O(\log n)$ (previously nothing beyond general graphs was known).</description>

      <title>Mallows Product Measure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09892v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Q-exchangeable ergodic distributions on the infinite symmetric group were classified by Gnedin-Olshanski (2012). In this paper, we study a specific linear combination of the ergodic measures and call it the Mallows product measure. From a particle system perspective, the Mallows product measure is a reversible stationary blocking measure of the infinite-species ASEP and it is a natural multi-species extension of the Bernoulli product blocking measures of the one-species ASEP. Moreover, the Mallows product measure can be viewed as the universal product blocking measure of interacting particle systems coming from random walks on Hecke algebras.
  For the random infinite permutation distributed according to the Mallows product measure we have computed the joint distribution of its neighboring displacements, as well as several other observables. The key feature of the obtained formulas is their remarkably simple product structure. We project these formulas to ASEP with finitely many species, which in particular recovers a recent result of Adams-Balazs-Jay, and also to ASEP(q,M).
  Our main tools are results of Gnedin-Olshanski about ergodic Mallows measures and shift-invariance symmetries of the stochastic colored six vertex model discovered by Borodin-Gorin-Wheeler and Galashin.</description>

      <title>Randomized Greedy Online Edge Coloring Succeeds for Dense and Randomly-Ordered Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13000v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vizing's theorem states that any graph of maximum degree $\Delta$ can be properly edge colored with at most $\Delta+1$ colors. In the online setting, it has been a matter of interest to find an algorithm that can properly edge color any graph on $n$ vertices with maximum degree $\Delta = \omega(\log n)$ using at most $(1+o(1))\Delta$ colors. Here we study the na\"{i}ve random greedy algorithm, which simply chooses a legal color uniformly at random for each edge upon arrival. We show that this algorithm can $(1+\epsilon)\Delta$-color the graph for arbitrary $\epsilon$ in two contexts: first, if the edges arrive in a uniformly random order, and second, if the edges arrive in an adversarial order but the graph is sufficiently dense, i.e., $n = O(\Delta)$. Prior to this work, the random greedy algorithm was only known to succeed in trees.
  Our second result is applicable even when the adversary is adaptive, and therefore implies the existence of a deterministic edge coloring algorithm which $(1+\epsilon)\Delta$ edge colors a dense graph. Prior to this, the best known deterministic algorithm for this problem was the simple greedy algorithm which utilized $2\Delta-1$ colors.</description>
