      <title>Structure-Aware NL-to-SQL for SFC Provisioning via AST-Masking Empowered Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective Service Function Chain (SFC) provisioning requires precise orchestration in dynamic and latency-sensitive networks. Reinforcement Learning (RL) improves adaptability but often ignores structured domain knowledge, which limits generalization and interpretability. Large Language Models (LLMs) address this gap by translating natural language (NL) specifications into executable Structured Query Language (SQL) commands for specification-driven SFC management. Conventional fine-tuning, however, can cause syntactic inconsistencies and produce inefficient queries. To overcome this, we introduce Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)-Masking, a structure-aware fine-tuning method that uses SQL ASTs to assign weights to key components and enforce syntax-aware learning without adding inference overhead. Experiments show that AST-Masking significantly improves SQL generation accuracy across multiple language models. FLAN-T5 reaches an Execution Accuracy (EA) of 99.6%, while Gemma achieves the largest absolute gain from 7.5% to 72.0%. These results confirm the effectiveness of structure-aware fine-tuning in ensuring syntactically correct and efficient SQL generation for interpretable SFC orchestration.</description>

      <title>Efficient Self-Learning and Model Versioning for AI-native O-RAN Edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The AI-native vision of 6G requires Radio Access Networks to train, deploy, and continuously refine thousands of machine learning (ML) models that drive real-time radio network optimization. Although the Open RAN (O-RAN) architecture provides open interfaces and an intelligent control plane, it leaves the life-cycle management of these models unspecified. Consequently, operators still rely on ad-hoc, manual update practices that can neither scale across the heterogeneous, multi-layer stack of Cell-Site, Edge-, Regional-, and Central-Cloud domains, nor across the three O-RAN control loops (real-, near-real-, and non-real-time). We present a self-learning framework that provides an efficient closed-loop version management for an AI-native O-RAN edge. In this framework, training pipelines in the Central/Regional Cloud continuously generate new models, which are cataloged along with their resource footprints, security scores, and accuracy metrics in a shared version repository. An Update Manager consults this repository and applies a self-learning policy to decide when and where each new model version should be promoted into operation. A container orchestrator then realizes these decisions across heterogeneous worker nodes, enabling multiple services (rApps, xApps, and dApps) to obtain improved inference with minimal disruption. Simulation results show that an efficient RL-driven decision-making can guarantee quality of service, bounded latencies while balancing model accuracy, system stability, and resilience.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Model-based Reinforcement Learning for Version Age of Information Scheduling: Average and Tail-Risk-Sensitive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensuring timely and semantically accurate information delivery is critical in real-time wireless systems. While Age of Information (AoI) quantifies temporal freshness, Version Age of Information (VAoI) captures semantic staleness by accounting for version evolution between transmitters and receivers. Existing VAoI scheduling approaches primarily focus on minimizing average VAoI, overlooking rare but severe staleness events that can compromise reliability under stochastic packet arrivals and unreliable channels. This paper investigates both average-oriented and tail-risk-sensitive VAoI scheduling in a multi-user status update system with long-term transmission cost constraints. We first formulate the average VAoI minimization problem as a constrained Markov decision process and introduce a deep diffusion-based Soft Actor-Critic (D2SAC) algorithm. By generating actions through a diffusion-based denoising process, D2SAC enhances policy expressiveness and establishes a strong baseline for mean performance. Building on this foundation, we put forth RS-D3SAC, a risk-sensitive deep distributional diffusion-based Soft Actor-Critic algorithm. RS-D3SAC integrates a diffusion-based actor with a quantile-based distributional critic, explicitly modeling the full VAoI return distribution. This enables principled tail-risk optimization via Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) while satisfying long-term transmission cost constraints. Extensive simulations show that, while D2SAC reduces average VAoI, RS-D3SAC consistently achieves substantial reductions in CVaR without sacrificing mean performance. The dominant gain in tail-risk reduction stems from the distributional critic, with the diffusion-based actor providing complementary refinement to stabilize and enrich policy decisions, highlighting their effectiveness for robust and risk-aware VAoI scheduling in multi-user wireless systems.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Update Broadcasts Over LoRaWAN Downlink via D2D Cooperation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Broadcast distribution of updates (e.g., security patches, machine learning models) from a server to end devices (EDs) is a critical requirement in the Internet of Things (IoT). In this paper, we consider the problem of reliable over-the-air broadcast of updates in Long Range Wide Area Networks (LoRaWANs). Existing broadcast techniques for LoRaWANs suffer from long delivery delays due to low data rates and duty-cycle constraints. We address this problem by proposing a device-level cooperative mechanism, in which updated EDs broadcast a few update fragments to accelerate delivery to their neighbors. We demonstrate large reductions in the delivery time compared to conventional methods. For instance, in a 400-node network spanning 1 km radius and operating at 1% duty-cycle, the proposed scheme reduces the time required to deliver a 10 kilobyte update to an ED at the network's edge from 42 hours to 45 minutes. The proposed solution thus provides a pathway toward improved security and efficient realization of edge intelligence in LoRaWAN IoT.</description>

      <title>Contact Plan Design For Optical Interplanetary Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Space exploration missions generate rapidly increasing volumes of scientific telemetry that far exceed the capacity of today's manually scheduled, RF-based deep-space infrastructure. Free-space optical (FSO) communications promise orders of magnitude higher throughput, but their narrow beams require precise pointing, acquisition, and tracking (PAT) for link establishment and tightly synchronized contact schedules. Critically, no existing contact plan design (CPD) framework accounts for optical head retargeting delay, the time spent during coarse pointing and link acquisition before data transmission begins, which directly reduces usable contact time. Retargeting delay is the dominant impairment unique to optical networks, which induces a seconds-to-minutes-long mechanical pointing process for an optical terminal's laser from its current partner to the next receiver. This paper introduces the first PAT-aware CPD framework for optical interplanetary backhaul networks. The model captures directional temporal flows across both direct-to-Earth optical links and two-hop relay paths using delay/disruption-tolerant networking (DTN) satellites. We also introduce an optical network duty-cycle metric that quantifies the proportion of time spent transmitting to the contact window duration, exposing capacity lost to retargeting delay. Our results show that our MILP scheduler delivers over 30 percent higher network capacity than a greedy algorithm. More importantly, the results uncover a fundamental behavioral shift: when retargeting delays are modeled accurately, optimal schedules favor fewer but longer optical links that maximize throughput while minimizing retargeting overhead. These findings demonstrate that zero-delay assumptions substantially overestimate achievable performance and yield unrealistic contact plans.</description>

      <title>A Mechanical Wi-Fi Antenna Device for Automatic Orientation Tuning with Bayesian Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wi-Fi access points have been widely deployed in homes, offices, and public spaces. Some APs allow users to adjust the antenna orientation to improve communication performance by optimizing antenna polarization. However, it is difficult for non-expert users to determine the optimal orientation, and users often leave the antenna orientation in ineffective positions. To address this issue, we developed a mechanical Wi-Fi antenna device capable of automatically tuning its orientation. Experimental results show that antenna orientation could cause a throughput variation of approximately 70 Mbps under line-of-sight conditions. Furthermore, Bayesian optimization identified better configurations than random search, demonstrating its effectiveness for orientation tuning.</description>

      <title>CovertComBench: The First Domain-Specific Testbed for LLMs in Wireless Covert Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into wireless networks presents significant potential for automating system design. However, unlike conventional throughput maximization, Covert Communication (CC) requires optimizing transmission utility under strict detection-theoretic constraints, such as Kullback-Leibler divergence limits. Existing benchmarks primarily focus on general reasoning or standard communication tasks and do not adequately evaluate the ability of LLMs to satisfy these rigorous security constraints. To address this limitation, we introduce CovertComBench, a unified benchmark designed to assess LLM capabilities across the CC pipeline, encompassing conceptual understanding (MCQs), optimization derivation (ODQs), and code generation (CGQs). Furthermore, we analyze the reliability of automated scoring within a detection-theoretic ``LLM-as-Judge'' framework. Extensive evaluations across state-of-the-art models reveal a significant performance discrepancy. While LLMs achieve high accuracy in conceptual identification (81%) and code implementation (83%), their performance in the higher-order mathematical derivations necessary for security guarantees ranges between 18% and 55%. This limitation indicates that current LLMs serve better as implementation assistants rather than autonomous solvers for security-constrained optimization. These findings suggest that future research should focus on external tool augmentation to build trustworthy wireless AI systems.</description>

      <title>Integrating HAPS, LEO, and Terrestrial Networks: A Cost-Performance Study for IoT Connectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work evaluates the potential of High-Altitude Platform Stations (HAPS) and Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites as alternative or complementary systems to enhance Internet of Things (IoT) connectivity. We first analyze the transmission erasure probability under different connectivity configurations, including only HAPS or LEO satellites, as well as hybrid architectures that integrate both aerial/spatial and terrestrial infrastructures. To make the analysis more realistic, we considered movement of LEO satellites regarding a fixed region, elevation angle between gateway and devices, and different fading models for terrestrial and non-terrestrial communication. We also analyze LR-FHSS (Long-Range Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum) random access uplink technology as a potential use case for IoT connectivity, showing the scalability impact of the scenarios. The simulation results demonstrate that HAPS can effectively complement sparse terrestrial networks and improve the performance of satellite-based systems in specific scenarios. Furthermore, considering the deployment and operational costs, respectively, CAPEX and OPEX, the economic analysis reveals that although HAPS exhibits higher costs, these remain within a comparable order of magnitude to LEO and terrestrial deployments. In addition, specific use cases, such as natural disasters, transform HAPS into a competitive technology for conventional infrastructures.</description>

      <title>An LLM-Agent-Based Framework for Age of Information Optimization in Heterogeneous Random Access Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT) and heterogeneous wireless networks, the Age of Information (AoI) has emerged as a critical metric for evaluating the performance of real-time and personalized systems. While AoI-based random access is essential for next-generation applications such as the low-altitude economy and indoor service robots, existing strategies, ranging from rule-based protocols to learning-based methods, face critical challenges, including idealized model assumptions, slow convergence, and poor generalization. In this article, we propose Reflex-Core, a novel Large Language Model (LLM) agent-based framework for AoI-driven random access in heterogeneous networks. By devising an "Observe-Reflect-Decide-Execute" closed-loop mechanism, this framework integrates Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to enable optimal, autonomous access control. Based on the Reflex-Core framework, we develop a Reflexive Multiple Access (RMA) protocol and a priority-based RMA variant for intelligent access control under different heterogeneous network settings. Experimental results demonstrate that in the investigated scenarios, the RMA protocol achieves up to a 14.9% reduction in average AoI compared with existing baselines, while the priority-based version improves the convergence rate by approximately 20%.</description>

      <title>COMETS: Coordinated Multi-Destination Video Transmission with In-Network Rate Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale video streaming events attract millions of simultaneous viewers, stressing existing delivery infrastructures. Client-driven adaptation reacts slowly to shared congestion, while server-based coordination introduces scalability bottlenecks and single points of failure. We present COMETS, a coordinated multi-destination video transmission framework that leverages information-centric networking principles such as request aggregation and in-network state awareness to enable scalable, fair, and adaptive rate control. COMETS introduces a novel range-interest protocol and distributed in-network decision process that aligns video quality across receiver groups while minimizing redundant transmissions. To achieve this, we develop a lightweight distributed optimization framework that guides per-hop quality adaptation without centralized control. Extensive emulation shows that COMETS consistently improves bandwidth utilization, fairness, and user-perceived quality of experience over DASH, MoQ, and ICN baselines, particularly under high concurrency. The results highlight COMETS as a practical, deployable approach for next-generation scalable video delivery.</description>

      <title>An ISAC-ready Full-Duplex Backscatter Architecture for the mmWave IoT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving long-range, high-rate, concurrent two-way mmWave communication with power-constrained IoT devices is fundamental to scaling future ubiquitous sensing systems, yet the substantial power demands and high cost of mmWave hardware have long stood in the way of practical deployment. This paper presents the first mmWave full-duplex backscatter tag architecture, charting a genuinely low-cost path toward high-performance mmWave connectivity and localization for ISAC systems. The proposed tag operates at ranges beyond 45m on the uplink and beyond 200m on the downlink, delivering 20x the reach of state-of-the-art systems while being over 100x cheaper than existing mmWave backscatter platforms. Enabling this leap is a novel low-power regenerative amplifier that provides 30 dB of gain while consuming only 30 mW, paired with a regenerative rectifier that achieves state-of-the-art sensitivity down to -60 dBm. We integrate our circuits on a compact PCB and evaluate it across diverse uplink and downlink scenarios, where it achieves an downlink BER of $10^{-1}$ at 200 meters and a uplink BER of $10^{-2}$ at 45 meters, demonstrating resilient, high-quality communication even at extended ranges.</description>

      <title>AstroTimer: Rethinking Non-Access Stratum Timers in LEO Constellations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) constellations expand 5G coverage to remote regions but differ fundamentally from terrestrial networks due to rapidly changing topologies, fluctuating delays, and constrained onboard resources. Existing 3GPP Non-Access Stratum (NAS) timers, inherited from terrestrial and geostationary (GEO) or medium Earth orbit (MEO) systems, fail to accommodate these dynamics, leading to signaling storms and inefficiency. This paper introduces AstroTimer, a lightweight, adaptive framework for sizing NAS timers based on LEO-specific parameters such as link variability, processing delays, and network-function placement. AstroTimer derives a closed-form timer model with low computational cost and optimizes both watchdog and backoff timers for the 5G registration procedure. Simulation results demonstrate that AstroTimer significantly reduces registration time, retry frequency, and user equipment (UE) energy consumption compared to 3GPP defaults, while preventing signaling overloads. The proposed approach provides an operator-ready foundation for reliable, efficient, and scalable non-terrestrial 5G/6G deployments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.17355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Improvements in software defined networking allow for policy to be informed and modified by data-driven applications that can adjust policy to accommodate fluctuating requirements at line speed. However, there is some concern that over-correction can occur and cause unintended consequences depending on the data received. This is particularly problematic for network security features, such as machine-learning intrusion detection systems. We present Safeguard, a rule-based policy that overlaps a data-driven policy to prevent unintended responses for edge cases in network traffic. We develop a reference implementation of a network traffic classifier that enforces firewall rules for malicious traffic, and show how additional rulesets to allow known-good traffic are essential in utilizing a data-driven network policy.</description>

      <title>Constrained Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm Variants for Design and Optimization of Tri-Band Microstrip Patch Antenna loaded CSRR for IoT Applications: A Comparative Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an automated antenna design and optimization framework employing multi-objective genetic algorithms (MOGAs) to investigate various evolutionary optimization approaches, with a primary emphasis on multi-band frequency optimization. Five MOGA variants were implemented and compared: the Pareto genetic algorithm (PGA), non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm with niching (NSGA-I), non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm with elitism (NSGA-II), non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm using reference points (NSGA-III), and strength Pareto evolutionary algorithm (SPEA). These algorithms are employed to design and optimize microstrip patch antennas loaded with complementary split-ring resonators (CSRRs). A weighted-sum scalarization approach was adopted within a single-objective genetic algorithm framework enhanced with domain-specific constraint handling mechanisms. The optimization addresses the conflicting objectives of minimizing the return loss ($S_{11} &lt; -10$~dB) and achieving multi-band resonance at 2.4~GHz, 3.6~GHz, and 5.2~GHz. The proposed method delivers a superior overall performance by aggregating these objectives into a unified fitness function encompassing $S_{11}$(2.4~GHz), $S_{11}$(3.6~GHz), and $S_{11}$(5.2~GHz). This approach effectively balances all three frequency bands simultaneously, rather than exploring trade-off solutions typical of traditional multi-objective approaches. The antenna was printed on a Rogers RT5880 substrate with a dielectric constant of 2.2 , loss tangent of 0.0009 , and thickness of 1.57~mm . Scalarization approach achieved return loss values of $-21.56$~dB, $-16.60$~dB, and $-27.69$~dB, with corresponding gains of 1.96~dBi, 2.6~dB, and 3.99~dBi at 2.4~GHz, 3.6~GHz, and 5.2~GHz, respectively.</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent Collaborative Intrusion Detection for Low-Altitude Economy IoT: An LLM-Enhanced Agentic AI Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid expansion of low-altitude economy Internet of Things (LAE-IoT) networks has created unprecedented security challenges due to dynamic three-dimensional mobility patterns, distributed autonomous operations, and severe resource constraints. Traditional intrusion detection systems designed for static ground-based networks prove inadequate for tackling the unique characteristics of aerial IoT environments, including frequent topology changes, real-time detection requirements, and energy limitations. In this article, we analyze the intrusion detection requirements for LAE-IoT networks, complemented by a comprehensive review of evaluation metrics that cover detection effectiveness, response time, and resource consumption. Then, we investigate transformative potential of agentic artificial intelligence (AI) paradigms and introduce a large language model (LLM)-enabled agentic AI framework for enhancing intrusion detection in LAE-IoT networks. This leads to our proposal of a novel multi-agent collaborative intrusion detection framework that leverages specialized LLM-enhanced agents for intelligent data processing and adaptive classification. Through experimental validation, our framework demonstrates superior performance of over 90\% classification accuracy across multiple benchmark datasets. These results highlight the transformative potential of combining agentic AI principles with LLMs for next-generation LAE-IoT security systems.</description>

      <title>Vision-Language-Model-Guided Differentiable Ray Tracing for Fast and Accurate Multi-Material RF Parameter Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate radio-frequency (RF) material parameters are essential for electromagnetic digital twins in 6G systems, yet gradient-based inverse ray tracing (RT) remains sensitive to initialization and costly under limited measurements. This paper proposes a vision-language-model (VLM) guided framework that accelerates and stabilizes multi-material parameter estimation in a differentiable RT (DRT) engine. A VLM parses scene images to infer material categories and maps them to quantitative priors via an ITU-R material table, yielding informed conductivity initializations. The VLM further selects informative transmitter/receiver placements that promote diverse, material-discriminative paths. Starting from these priors, the DRT performs gradient-based refinement using measured received signal strengths. Experiments in NVIDIA Sionna on indoor scenes show 2-4$\times$ faster convergence and 10-100$\times$ lower final parameter error compared with uniform or random initialization and random placement baselines, achieving sub-0.1\% mean relative error with only a few receivers. Complexity analyses indicate per-iteration time scales near-linearly with the number of materials and measurement setups, while VLM-guided placement reduces the measurements required for accurate recovery. Ablations over RT depth and ray counts confirm further accuracy gains without significant per-iteration overhead. Results demonstrate that semantic priors from VLMs effectively guide physics-based optimization for fast and reliable RF material estimation.</description>

      <title>Validation of a Software-Defined 100-Gb/s RDMA Streaming Architecture for Ultrafast Optoacoustic and Ultrasound Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optoacoustic (OA) imaging has emerged as a powerful investigation tool, with demonstrated applicability in oncology, neuroscience, and cardiovascular biology. However, its clinical translation is limited with the existing OA systems, which often rely on bulky and expensive acquisition hardware mainly optimized for pulse-echo ultrasound (US) imaging. Despite the fact that OA imaging has different requirements for receive bandwidths and timing synchronization with external laser sources, there is a strong need for unified OA-US imaging platforms, as pulse-echo US remains the standard tool for visualizing soft tissues. To address these challenges, we propose a new data acquisition architecture for ultrafast OA and US imaging that fully covers the requirements for large channel counts, wide bandwidth, and software-defined operation. LtL combines state-of-the-art wideband analog front-ends, a Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC integrating FPGA fabric with an Application Processing Unit, and a 100 GbE Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) backend enabling raw-data streaming at up to 95.6 Gb/s. The architecture avoids local buffers followed by burst transfers, which commonly constrain sustainable frame rate and recording intervals, thus achieving true continuous and sustained streaming of raw data. We validate the core elements of the LtL architecture using a 16-channel demonstration system built from commercial evaluation boards. We further verify the signal chain for up to 256-channel scalability, confirming the wide bandwidth capabilities to support state-of-the-art data transmission speeds.</description>

      <title>On the Bandwidth Consumption of Blockchains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the advent of blockchain technology, the number of proposals has boomed. The network traffic imposed by these blockchain proposals increases the cost of hosting nodes. Unfortunately, as of today, we are not aware of any comparative study of the bandwidth consumption of blockchains.
  In this paper, we propose the first empirical comparison of blockchain bandwidth consumption. To this end, we measure the network traffic of blockchain network nodes of five blockchain protocols: Algorand, Aptos, Avalanche, Redbelly and Solana. We study the variation over time, differentiate the receiving and sending traffic and analyze how this traffic varies with the number of nodes and validators.
  We conclude that the transport protocol is the main factor impacting the network traffic, segregating node roles helps reduce traffic and different blockchains are differently impacted by the network size.</description>

      <title>AI-Driven Fuzzing for Vulnerability Assessment of 5G Traffic Steering Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traffic Steering (TS) dynamically allocates user traffic across cells to enhance Quality of Experience (QoE), load balance, and spectrum efficiency in 5G networks. However, TS algorithms remain vulnerable to adversarial conditions such as interference spikes, handover storms, and localized outages. To address this, an AI-driven fuzz testing framework based on the Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) is proposed to systematically expose hidden vulnerabilities. Using NVIDIA Sionna, five TS algorithms are evaluated across six scenarios. Results show that AI-driven fuzzing detects 34.3% more total vulnerabilities and 5.8% more critical failures than traditional testing, achieving superior diversity and edge-case discovery. The observed variance in critical failure detection underscores the stochastic nature of rare vulnerabilities. These findings demonstrate that AI-driven fuzzing offers an effective and scalable validation approach for improving TS algorithm robustness and ensuring resilient 6G-ready networks.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Machine Learning Models for IoT Malware Detection under Data Scarcity and Drift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT) in domains such as smart cities, transportation, and industrial systems has heightened the urgency of addressing their security vulnerabilities. IoT devices often operate under limited computational resources, lack robust physical safeguards, and are deployed in heterogeneous and dynamic networks, making them prime targets for cyberattacks and malware applications. Machine learning (ML) offers a promising approach to automated malware detection and classification, but practical deployment requires models that are both effective and lightweight. The goal of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of four supervised learning models (Random Forest, LightGBM, Logistic Regression, and a Multi-Layer Perceptron) for malware detection and classification using the IoT-23 dataset. We evaluate model performance in both binary and multiclass classification tasks, assess sensitivity to training data volume, and analyze temporal robustness to simulate deployment in evolving threat landscapes. Our results show that tree-based models achieve high accuracy and generalization, even with limited training data, while performance deteriorates over time as malware diversity increases. These findings underscore the importance of adaptive, resource-efficient ML models for securing IoT systems in real-world environments.</description>

      <title>A Modular DTaaS Architecture for Predictive Slice Management in 6G Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01989v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The sixth generation (6G) of wireless networks will require fundamentally new orchestration paradigms to meet stringent requirements for ultra-low latency, high reliability, and pervasive intelligence. Network slicing emerges as a key enabler to support diverse services with customized quality-of-service (QoS) guarantees. However, dynamic and fine-grained slice management poses significant challenges in terms of real-time provisioning, SLA assurance, and cross-layer observability. In this paper, we propose a novel Digital Twin as a Service (DTaaS) framework that embeds per-slice digital twins (SDTs) into the orchestration loop. Each SDT maintains a synchronized, real-time representation of its slice, leveraging multi-domain telemetry and deep sequential models to predict traffic evolution and SLA risks. The framework introduces modular intelligence layers, programmable interfaces, and edge-embedded decision-making to enable proactive provisioning, adaptive scaling, and closed-loop SLA assurance. Mathematical formulations for fidelity measurement, predictive control, and optimization objectives are provided to ensure rigor and transparency. Evaluation results demonstrate that DTaaS significantly improves SLA compliance ratio, reduces resource over-provisioning, and lowers average SLA violation probability, offering a scalable and reliable orchestration approach for 6G networks.</description>

      <title>An O-RAN Framework for AI/ML-Based Localization with OpenAirInterface and FlexRIC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19233v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Localization is increasingly becoming an integral component of wireless cellular networks. The advent of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) based localization algorithms presents potential for enhancing localization accuracy. Nevertheless, current standardization efforts in the third generation partnership project (3GPP) and the O-RAN Alliance do not support AI/ML-based localization. In order to close this standardization gap, this paper describes an O-RAN framework that enables the integration of AI/ML-based localization algorithms for real-time deployments and testing. Specifically, our framework includes an O-RAN E2 Service Model (E2SM) and the corresponding radio access network (RAN) function, which exposes the Uplink Sounding Reference Signal (UL-SRS) channel estimates from the E2 agent to the Near real-time RAN Intelligent Controller (Near-RT RIC). Moreover, our framework includes, as an example, a real-time localization external application (xApp), which leverages the custom E2SM-SRS in order to execute continuous inference on a trained Channel Charting (CC) model, which is an emerging self-supervised method for radio-based localization. Our framework is implemented with OpenAirInterface (OAI) and FlexRIC, democratizing access to AI-driven positioning research and fostering collaboration. Furthermore, we validate our approach with the CC xApp in real-world conditions using an O-RAN based localization testbed at EURECOM. The results demonstrate the feasibility of our framework in enabling real-time AI/ML localization and show the potential of O-RAN in empowering positioning use cases for next-generation AI-native networks.</description>

      <title>SLIDE: Simultaneous Model Downloading and Inference at the Wireless Network Edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20946v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To support on-device inference, the next-generation mobile networks are expected to support real-time model downloading services to mobile users. However, powerful AI models typically have large model sizes, resulting in excessive end-to-end (E2E) downloading-and-inference (DAI) latency. To address this issue, we propose a simultaneous model downloading and inference (SLIDE) framework, which allows users to perform inference with downloaded layers while simultaneously receiving the remaining layers of the model. To this end, we formulate a task throughput maximization problem by jointly optimizing model provisioning, spectrum bandwidth allocation, and computing resource allocation for multi-user downlink systems. Unlike traditional DAI frameworks, SLIDE introduces recursive dependencies across layers, where inference latency depends recursively on the downloading bandwidth and computing resource allocation for each of the preceding layers. To solve this challenging problem, we design an efficient algorithm that acquires the optimal solution with polynomial-time complexity. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed SLIDE framework significantly improves task throughput under latency and communication resource constraints compared with the conventional model downloading schemes.</description>

      <title>Multiconnectivity for SAGIN: Current Trends, Challenges, AI-driven Solutions, and Opportunities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.21717v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Space-air-ground-integrated network (SAGIN)-enabled multiconnectivity (MC) is emerging as a key enabler for next-generation networks, enabling users to simultaneously utilize multiple links across multi-layer non-terrestrial networks (NTN) and multi-radio access technology (multi-RAT) terrestrial networks (TN). However, the heterogeneity of TN and NTN introduces complex architectural challenges that complicate MC implementation. Specifically, the diversity of link types, spanning air-to-air, air-to-space, space-to-space, space-to-ground, and ground-to-ground communications, renders optimal resource allocation highly complex. Recent advancements in reinforcement learning (RL) and agentic artificial intelligence (AI) have shown remarkable effectiveness in optimal decision-making in complex and dynamic environments. In this paper, we review the current developments in SAGIN-enabled MC and outline the key challenges associated with its implementation. We further highlight the transformative potential of AI-driven approaches for resource optimization in a heterogeneous SAGIN environment. To this end, we present a case study on resource allocation optimization enabled by agentic RL for SAGIN-enabled MC involving diverse radio access technologies (RATs). Results show that learning-based methods can effectively handle complex scenarios and substantially enhance network performance in terms of latency and capacity while incurring a moderate increase in power consumption as an acceptable tradeoff. Finally, open research problems and future directions are presented to realize efficient SAGIN-enabled MC.</description>

      <title>Scheduling for TWDM-EPON-Based Fronthaul Without a Dedicated Registration Wavelength</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00661v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The adoption of Centralized Radio Access Network (C-RAN) architectures requires fronthaul systems capable of carrying large volumes of radio data while meeting stringent delay and jitter requirements. Ethernet Passive Optical Networks (EPONs) have emerged as a promising fronthaul solution due to their cost efficiency and compatibility with existing infrastructure. However, the traditional registration process for EPON systems halts the ongoing data transmissions during the registration period, thereby violating the enhanced Common Public Radio Interface (eCPRI) delay and jitter requirements. This limitation has been acknowledged by the ITU-T, which recommends the use of a dedicated wavelength channel for registration, leading to inefficient bandwidth utilization. In this paper, we propose a novel scheduling framework for a Time and Wavelength Division Multiplexed (TWDM) EPON-based fronthaul that enables periodic registration without wasting an additional wavelength channel. Performance evaluation demonstrates that the proposed method achieves up to a 71\% increase in the number of Radio Units (RUs) supported for a given number of wavelength channels, compared to a baseline scheme employing a dedicated registration wavelength.</description>

      <title>LiQSS: Post-Transformer Linear Quantum-Inspired State-Space Tensor Networks for Real-Time 6G</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12375v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Proactive and agentic control in Sixth-Generation (6G) Open Radio Access Networks (O-RAN) requires control-grade prediction under stringent Near-Real-Time (Near-RT) latency and computational constraints. While Transformer-based models are effective for sequence modeling, their quadratic complexity limits scalability in Near-RT RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC) analytics. This paper investigates a post-Transformer design paradigm for efficient radio telemetry forecasting. We propose a quantum-inspired many-body state-space tensor network that replaces self-attention with stable structured state-space dynamics kernels, enabling linear-time sequence modeling. Tensor-network factorizations in the form of Tensor Train (TT) / Matrix Product State (MPS) representations are employed to reduce parameterization and data movement in both input projections and prediction heads, while lightweight channel gating and mixing layers capture non-stationary cross-Key Performance Indicator (KPI) dependencies. The proposed model is instantiated as an agentic perceive-predict xApp and evaluated on a bespoke O-RAN KPI time-series dataset comprising 59,441 sliding windows across 13 KPIs, using Reference Signal Received Power (RSRP) forecasting as a representative use case. Our proposed Linear Quantum-Inspired State-Space (LiQSS) model is 10.8x-15.8x smaller and approximately 1.4x faster than prior structured state-space baselines. Relative to Transformer-based models, LiQSS achieves up to a 155x reduction in parameter count and up to 2.74x faster inference, without sacrificing forecasting accuracy.</description>

      <title>Resource Allocation and Sharing for UAV-Assisted Integrated TN-NTN with Multi-Connectivity</title>

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with multi-connectivity (MC) capabilities efficiently and reliably transfer data between terrestrial networks (TNs) and non-terrestrial networks (NTNs). However, optimally sharing and allocating spectrum and power resources to maintain MC while ensuring reliable connectivity and optimal performance remains challenging in such networks. Channel variations induced by mobility in UAV networks, coupled with the varying quality of service (QoS) demands of heterogeneous devices, resource sharing, and fairness requirements in capacity distribution pose challenges to optimal resource allocation. Thus, this paper investigates resource allocation for QoS-constrained, MC-enabled, dynamic UAVs in an integrated TN-NTN environment with spectrum sharing and fairness considerations. To this end, we consider three types of links: UAV-to-radio base station (RBS), UAV-to-UAV, and UAV-to-HAP. We also assume two types of UAVs with diverse QoS requirements to reflect a practical scenario. Consequently, we propose two algorithms. The first algorithm maximizes the capacity of UAVs-RBS and UAVs-HAP links while ensuring the reliability of the UAV-UAV link. To achieve this, the algorithm maximizes the collective throughput of the UAVs by optimizing the sum capacity of all the UAV-RBS and UAV-HAP links. Next, to provide constant capacity to all links and ensure fairness, we propose another algorithm that maximizes the minimum capacity across all links. We validate the performance of both algorithms through simulation</description>

Abstract: Delay-coupled systems often require low-latency decisions from sparse telemetry, where dense fixed-step neural inference is wasteful and can degrade near stability margins. We introduce Network-Optimised Spiking (NOS), a trainable two-state event-driven dynamical unit for delayed, graph-coupled streams, whose states map to a fast load variable and a slower recovery resource. NOS uses bounded excitability for finite buffers, explicit leak terms for service and damping, and graph-local coupling with per-link gates and communication delays, with differentiable resets compatible with surrogate-gradient training and neuromorphic execution. We prove existence and uniqueness of subthreshold equilibria, derive Jacobian-based stability conditions, and obtain a scalar network stability threshold that separates topology from node dynamics via a Perron-mode spectral condition. A stochastic arrival model aligned with telemetry smoothing explains increased variability as systems approach stability boundaries. On delayed graph forecasting and early-warning tasks from queue telemetry, NOS improves detection F1 and detection latency over MLP, RNN/GRU, and temporal GNN baselines under a common residual-based protocol, while providing calibration rules for resource-constrained deployments.

      <title>Reexamining Paradigms of End-to-End Data Movement</title>

Abstract: The pursuit of high-performance data transfer often focuses on raw network bandwidth, where international links of 100 Gbps or higher are frequently considered the primary enabler. While necessary, this network-centric view is incomplete. It equates provisioned link speeds with practical, sustainable data movement capabilities. It is a common observation that lower-than-desired data rates manifest even on 10 Gbps links and commodity hardware, with higher-speed networks only amplifying their visibility. We investigate six paradigms -- from network latency and TCP congestion control to host-side factors such as CPU performance and virtualization -- that critically impact data movement workflows. These paradigms represent widely \enquote{accepted} engineering assumptions that inform system design, procurement decisions, and operational practices in production data movement environments. We introduce the \enquote{Drainage Basin Pattern} conceptual model for reasoning about end-to-end data flow constraints across heterogeneous hardware and software components at varying desired data rates to address the fidelity gap between raw bandwidth and application-level throughput. Our findings are validated through rigorous production-scale deployments, from 10 Gbps links to U.S. DOE ESnet technical evaluations and transcontinental production trials over 100 Gbps operational links. The results demonstrate that principal bottlenecks often reside outside the network core, and that a holistic hardware-software co-design enables consistent, predictable performance for moving data at scale and speed.</description>
