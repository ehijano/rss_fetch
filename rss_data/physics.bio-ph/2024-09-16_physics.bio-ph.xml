      <title>Control, bi-stability and preference for chaos in time-dependent vaccination campaign</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, effects of constant and time-dependent vaccination rates on the Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered-Susceptible (SEIRS) seasonal model are studied. Computing the Lyapunov exponent, we show that typical complex structures, such as shrimps, emerge for given combinations of constant vaccination rate and another model parameter. In some specific cases, the constant vaccination does not act as a chaotic suppressor and chaotic bands can exist for high levels of vaccination (e.g., $&gt; 0.95$). Moreover, we obtain linear and non-linear relationships between one control parameter and constant vaccination to establish a disease-free solution. We also verify that the total infected number does not change whether the dynamics is chaotic or periodic. The introduction of a time-dependent vaccine is made by the inclusion of a periodic function with a defined amplitude and frequency. For this case, we investigate the effects of different amplitudes and frequencies on chaotic attractors, yielding low, medium, and high seasonality degrees of contacts. Depending on the parameters of the time-dependent vaccination function, chaotic structures can be controlled and become periodic structures. For a given set of parameters, these structures are accessed mostly via crisis and in some cases via period-doubling. After that, we investigate how the time-dependent vaccine acts in bi-stable dynamics when chaotic and periodic attractors coexist. We identify that this kind of vaccination acts as a control by destroying almost all the periodic basins. We explain this by the fact that chaotic attractors exhibit more desirable characteristics for epidemics than periodic ones in a bi-stable state.</description>

      <title>Light-induced cortical excitability reveals programmable shape dynamics in starfish oocytes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chemo-mechanical waves on active deformable surfaces are a key component for many vital cellular functions. In particular, these waves play a major role in force generation and long-range signal transmission in cells that dynamically change shape, as encountered during cell division or morphogenesis. Reconstituting and controlling such chemically controlled cell deformations is a crucial but unsolved challenge for the development of synthetic cells. Here, we develop an optogenetic method to elucidate the mechanism responsible for coordinating surface contraction waves that occur in oocytes of the starfish Patiria miniata during meiotic cell division. Using spatiotemporally-patterned light stimuli as a control input, we create chemo-mechanical cortical excitations that are decoupled from meiotic cues and drive diverse shape deformations ranging from local pinching to surface contraction waves and cell lysis. We develop a quantitative model that entails the hierarchy of chemical and mechanical dynamics, which allows to relate the variety of mechanical responses to optogenetic stimuli. Our framework systematically predicts and explains transitions of programmed shape dynamics. Finally, we qualitatively map the observed shape dynamics to elucidate how the versatility of intracellular protein dynamics can give rise to a broad range of mechanical phenomenologies. More broadly, our results pave the way toward real-time control over dynamical deformations in living organisms and can advance the design of synthetic cells and life-like cellular functions.</description>

      <title>Influence of cell density and in-vivo aging on erythrocyte aggregability: Dissociation dynamics in extensional flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blood rheology and microcirculation are strongly influenced by red blood cell (RBC) aggregation. The aggregability of RBCs can vary significantly due to factors such as their mechanical and membrane surface properties, which are affected by cell aging in vivo. In this study, we investigate RBC aggregability as a function of their density, a marker of cell age and mechanical properties, by separating RBCs from healthy donors into different density fractions using Percoll density gradient centrifugation. We examine the dissociation rates of aggregates in a controlled medium supplemented with Dextran, employing an extensional flow technique based on hyperbolic microfluidic constrictions and image analysis, assisted by a convolutional neural network (CNN). In contrast to other techniques, our microfluidic experimental approach highlights the behavior of RBC aggregates in dynamic flow conditions relevant to microcirculation. Our results demonstrate that aggregate dissociation is strongly correlated with cell density and that aggregates formed from the denser fractions of RBCs are significantly more robust than those from the average cell population. This study provides insight into the effect of RBC aging in vivo on their mechanical properties and aggregability, underscoring the importance of further exploration of RBC aggregation in the context of cellular senescence and its potential implications for hemodynamics. Additionally, it suggests that this technique can complement existing methods for improved evaluation of RBC aggregability in health and disease.</description>

      <title>Water surface swimming dynamics in lightweight centipedes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.09570v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Study of the locomotion of a centipede (L. forficatus) at the air-water interface reveals that it does not predominantly use its 14 leg pairs to locomote; unlike most swimmers which propagate head-to-tail body bending waves, this species propels via tail-to-head waves. Its low mass and body-fluid contact yield locomotion dynamics in which fluid wave drag forces dominate inertia. Microorganism-inspired wave drag resistive force theory captures swimming performance of the macroscale animal, motivating a control hypothesis for the animals self-propulsion body and limb kinematics.</description>

      <title>Integrating Chemical Language and Molecular Graph in Multimodal Fused Deep Learning for Drug Property Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17495v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurately predicting molecular properties is a challenging but essential task in drug discovery. Recently, many mono-modal deep learning methods have been successfully applied to molecular property prediction. However, the inherent limitation of mono-modal learning arises from relying solely on one modality of molecular representation, which restricts a comprehensive understanding of drug molecules and hampers their resilience against data noise. To overcome the limitations, we construct multimodal deep learning models to cover different molecular representations. We convert drug molecules into three molecular representations, SMILES-encoded vectors, ECFP fingerprints, and molecular graphs. To process the modal information, Transformer-Encoder, bi-directional gated recurrent units (BiGRU), and graph convolutional network (GCN) are utilized for feature learning respectively, which can enhance the model capability to acquire complementary and naturally occurring bioinformatics information. We evaluated our triple-modal model on six molecule datasets. Different from bi-modal learning models, we adopt five fusion methods to capture the specific features and leverage the contribution of each modal information better. Compared with mono-modal models, our multimodal fused deep learning (MMFDL) models outperform single models in accuracy, reliability, and resistance capability against noise. Moreover, we demonstrate its generalization ability in the prediction of binding constants for protein-ligand complex molecules in the refined set of PDBbind. The advantage of the multimodal model lies in its ability to process diverse sources of data using proper models and suitable fusion methods, which would enhance the noise resistance of the model while obtaining data diversity.</description>
