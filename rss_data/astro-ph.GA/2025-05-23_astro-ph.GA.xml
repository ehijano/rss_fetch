      <title>The Lyman-alpha Halos of Galaxies at z=2-3 in the Keck Baryonic Structure Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the large-scale spatial Lya profiles of galaxies from the Keck Baryonic Structure Survey (KBSS) at 2&lt;z&lt;3. This work also describes the Lya imaging for the KBSS-Lya survey for the first time. Our sample includes 734 Lya-selected galaxies and 119 continuum-selected galaxies with Lya narrow-band imaging, and we measure the spatial morphology of Lya and continuum emission for stacked subsamples of these two populations. These samples allow us to study the variation in Lya emission profiles over a broad range of UV continuum luminosities and Lya equivalent widths (EW_Lya), including systems with net Lya absorption in slit spectroscopy. We characterize the spatial profiles using two techniques: directly fitting an exponential function to the stacked profile, and a multi-component forward-modeling technique using the empirical large-scale PSF. We find that both methods yield similar results and that the forward-modeling technique self-consistently fits profiles exhibiting central Lya emission or Lya absorption, with the spatial scale of central Lya approximately matching that of the continuum emission. We also find extended Lya emission such that all our subsamples -- including central Lya absorbers -- are net Lya emitters on scales comparable to the circumgalactic medium (R &gt; 50 kpc, theta &gt; 6''). We find that the scale length of the Lya halo is not strongly dependent on the properties of the central galaxy, including its net continuum luminosity or EW_Lya, although we find a possible weak tendency of continuum-faint, high-EW_Lya galaxies to exhibit larger Lya halos in contrast with previous work.</description>

      <title>GAMA 526784: the progenitor of a globular cluster-rich ultra-diffuse galaxy? I. Star clusters, stellar body and ionised gas properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs) are an intriguing population of galaxies. Despite their dwarf-like stellar masses and low surface brightness, they have large half-light radii and exhibit a diverse range of globular cluster (GC) populations. Some UDGs host many GCs while others have none, raising questions about the conditions under which star clusters (SC) form in dwarfs. GAMA526784, an isolated UDG with both an old stellar body and an extended star-forming (SF) front, including many young SCs, provides an exceptional case to explore the link between UDG evolution and star cluster formation. Aims. This study investigates the stellar populations, SCs, ionised gas, and kinematics of GAMA526784, focusing on its potential to form massive GCs and its connection to broader UDG formation scenarios. Methods. Imaging from HST and Subaru/HSC, alongside MUSE spectroscopy, were used to analyse the galaxy's morphology, chemical composition, and kinematics. A combination of SED fitting and full spectral fitting was applied. Results. GAMA526784's central stellar body exhibits a low-metallicity ([M/H] ~ -1.0 dex) and an old age (~9.9 Gyr). The outskirts are much younger (~0.9 Gyr), but slightly more metal-poor ([M/H] ~ -1.2 dex). The stellar kinematics show low velocity dispersions (~10 km/s) and a coherent rotational field, while the ionised gas exhibits higher dispersions (~50 km/s), a misaligned rotation axis (~20 deg) and localised SF, what could be suggestive of a recent interaction. The young SCs span ages of 8-11 Myr and masses of log(M*/Mo)~5.0, while the old GCs have ~9 Gyr and stellar masses of log(M*/Mo)~5.5. Conclusions. GAMA526784's properties point to interactions that triggered localised SF, leading to the formation of young SCs. Future observations of its molecular and neutral gas will help assess its environment, and the trigger of this SF episode.</description>

      <title>Discovery and characterization of 25 new quasars at 4.6 &lt; z &lt; 6.9 from wide-field multi-band surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Luminous quasars at $z&gt;4$ provide key insights into the early Universe. Their rarity necessitates wide-field multi-band surveys to efficiently separate them from the main astrophysical contaminants (i.e., ultracool dwarfs). To expand the sample of high-$z$ quasars, we conducted targeted selections using optical, infrared, and radio surveys, complemented by literature-based quasar candidate catalogs. In this paper, we report the discovery of \nqsos\ new quasars at $4.6&lt;z&lt;6.9$ (six at $z\geq6.5$), with $M_{1450}$ between $-$25.4 and $-$27.0. We also present new spectra of six $z&gt;6.5$ quasars we selected, but whose independent discovery has already been published in the literature. Three of the newly discovered quasars are strong radio emitters (L$_{1.4~\rm GHz}$$=0.09-1.0\times$10$^{34}$erg s$^{-1}$ Hz$^{-1}$). Among them, one source at $z=4.71$ exhibits typical blazar-like properties, including a flat radio spectrum, radio-loudness $\sim$1000, and multi-frequency variability. It is also detected by SRG/eROSITA X-ray telescope (f$_{\rm 0.2-2.3keV} \sim 1.3\times10^{-13}$erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$). In addition, for seven $6.3&lt;z&lt;6.9$ quasars we present near-infrared spectroscopy and estimate the central black hole mass from their C$\rm IV$ and Mg$\rm II$ broad emission lines.Their masses (log[M$_{\rm BH,MgII}$]$=8.58-9.14~\rm M_{\odot}$) and Eddington ratios ($\lambda_{\rm Edd,MgII}=0.74-2.2$) are consistent with other $z&gt;6$ quasars reported in the literature. A $z = 6.3$ quasar exhibits a velocity difference of approximately $9000$ km s$^{-1}$ between the C$\rm IV$ and Mg$\rm II$ emission lines, making it one of the most extreme C$\rm IV$ outflows currently known. Additionally, the sample includes three high-ionization broad absorption line quasars. One of these quasars shows potential evidence of an extremely fast outflow feature, reaching $48000$ km s$^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Chemical Abundances in the Milky Way's Nuclear Stellar Disc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Nuclear Stellar Disc (NSD) is a rotating, disc-like structure in the Galactic Center, believed to have a distinct star formation. However, its formation history and evolutionary links to other structures in the Galactic Center remain uncertain. This study aims to present the first comprehensive chemical census of the NSD by deriving abundance trends for 18 elements in 9 M giants in the metallicity range of -1.0 &lt;[Fe/H]&lt; 0.5. By comparing these trends with those of other Galactic populations we seek to understand the chemical relationships between these structures. We obtained high-resolution H- and K-band spectra of NSD stars using the IGRINS spectrometer mounted on the Gemini South telescope. The giants were analyzed consistently with stars from a comparison populations to minimize systematic uncertainties. The abundance trends of NSD stars exhibit similarities with those of the inner-bulge and Nuclear Star Cluster (NSC) populations across a broad range of elements with different chemical evolution histories. The trends for 17 elements align closely with the local thick-disc behaviour at subsolar metallicities. At super-solar metallicities, most elements follow the NSC and inner-bulge trends. Sodium is the only element exhibiting a distinct trend, with enhanced abundances in the NSD and NSC compared to both thin-disc and inner-bulge stars. The chemical similarity suggests that the NSD likely shares an evolutionary history with the NSC and possibly the inner-disc sequence. Further studies are required to determine potential evolutionary links to Liller 1 and metal-rich globular clusters. We find no evidence of typical globular cluster abundance signatures in our NSD stars with subsolar metallicities. Our study demonstrates the feasibility of obtaining high-quality abundance data even in highly dust-obscured regions of the Milky Way, paving the way for future surveys.</description>

      <title>MeerKAT Discovery of an Infalling Cold Gas Tail onto the Nearby Barred Spiral Galaxy, NGC 5643</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detailed study of gas flows in local Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) is essential for understanding the regulation of star formation and black hole growth, which are fundamental to galaxy evolution. One such AGN case study is NGC 5643, a nearby ($D_{L}\sim17.3$ Mpc) star-forming, late-type, Seyfert galaxy, where inflows and outflows have been observed in detail. NGC 5643 has been studied at multiple wavelengths, however, a key missing component is sensitive, high-resolution neutral hydrogen ($\mathrm{H\,I}$) observations. We present 21-cm observations of NGC 5643 with MeerKAT, revealing six low-$\mathrm{H\,I}$ mass ($M_{\text{$\mathrm{H\,I}$}}\sim10^{7} M_\odot$) sources surrounding NGC 5643 and $\mathrm{H\,I}$ in IC 4444, $\sim230$ kpc north of NGC 5643. In NGC 5643, $\mathrm{H\,I}$ extends beyond the stellar disk with several morphological and kinematical asymmetries. North of the disk is an extended 30 kpc tail with counter-rotating velocities. This is $\mathrm{H\,I}$ gas accreting onto the regularly rotating disk of NGC 5643 from the environment. Within the spiral arms of the disk, we identify extraplanar gas components, tracing galactic fountains driven by star formation regions. These fountains have a molecular gas component and show an increased $\mathrm{H}_2$/$\mathrm{H\,I}$ ratio. In the circum-nuclear region, we observe spatially unresolved $\mathrm{H\,I}$ absorption that is slightly blue-shifted ($\sim72$ \kms) with an $\mathrm{H\,I}$ emission counterpart at redshifted velocities. These MeerKAT observations provide a complete census of the $\mathrm{H\,I}$ in and around this nearby Seyfert galaxy, providing missing information on the cold gas flows fuelling the star formation and nuclear activity.</description>

      <title>Distance estimation of the high-velocity cloud Anti-Center Shell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-velocity clouds (HVCs) are interstellar gas clouds whose velocities are incompatible with Galactic rotation. Since the first discovery of HVCs in 1963, their origins have been debated for decades but are still not settled down, because of the lack of vital parameters of HVCs, e.g., the distance. In this work, we determined the distance to the high-velocity cloud, namely the Anti-Center Shell (ACS). We trace the ACS with extinction derived from K-giant stars with known distances and with the diffuse interstellar band (DIB) feature at 5780 $\text{{\AA}}$ fitted on spectra of O- and B-type stars with distance. As a result, we provide a lower limit distance of ACS as $\sim$8 kpc, which extends the lower limit outward by approximately 4 kpc compared to previous work. A byproduct of the DIB method is that we detected a bar-shaped structure with a unusually high positive line-of-sight velocity. Its shape extends along the (l,b)=(155,-5)$^{\circ}$ sight-line and shows a slightly increasing trend in equivalent width and velocity as the distance increases.</description>

      <title>The Peekaboo galaxy: new SALT spectroscopy and implications of archive HST data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dwarf galaxy Peekaboo was recently identified as a Local Volume (LV) gas-rich and 'eXtremely Metal-Poor' (XMP) dIrr. Its gas metallicity is Z~Zsun/50, with +/-1$\sigma$ uncertainty range of [Zsun/72-Zsun/35]). Its the "Tip of Red Giant Stars" (TRGB)-based distance is of 6.8$\pm$0.7 Mpc. HST data for its individual stars reveal that its older RGB stars comprise a smaller part, while the majority of visible stars have ages of less than one to a few Gyr. Thus, Peekaboo dwarf can be considered as the nearest record-low-Z dwarf. As such, the galaxy deserves a deeper multi-method study, including properties of both, young massive stars and the fainter older population, and its ionised gas and the dominant baryonic component of HI gas. We use the direct (Te) method for the east HII region, in which the [OIII]4363A line is well detected, to estimate its parameter 12+log(O/H). Since in the west HII region the line [OIII]4363A is not detected, its O/H is estimated via the empirical "strong-line" method. The resulting value of O/H is very close to that in the east HII region. The new spectroscopy of Peekaboo dwarf allows us to improve substantially the accuracy of its direct O/H estimate, which appears of 12+log(O/H) = 6.99$\pm$0.06. The new data reveal that emission lines in the E region consist of two components with the velocity difference of ~65 km/s. The fainter, approaching, component can be related to a fast-moving WR star thrown from a cluster or a binary system. Using the HST $V$ magnitudes and colour $V-I$, we identify tentative O-type and very hot candidate WO stars, which are likely the ionising stars of the studied HII regions. With the new optical spectra, the Peekaboo galaxy is confirmed as the lowest-metallicity dwarf in the Local Volume and the valuable object for indeep multi-method studies.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic study of globular and fuzzy clusters in Lenticular galaxy NGC 1023</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We here report the results from spectroscopic observations of a sample of 26 globular cluster (GC) and 21 faint fuzzy (FF) candidates in the lenticular galaxy NGC 1023 using the 10.4-m Gran Telescopio Canarias. Using the recessional velocities and stellar absorption features, we determine that 18 and 9 of the observed candidates are bona fide GCs and FFs, respectively. The majority of the rejected FF candidates are background emission line galaxies for which we determine their redshifts. We used the spectroscopic data to determine velocity, age, metallicity and extinction of all bona fide clusters. We find that FFs are clearly younger (age = 7-9 Gyr) than GCs (age &gt; 10 Gyr). Both kind of clusters in this galaxy are metal-rich ([Fe/H] = -0.58 $\pm$ 0.33). The ages and metallicities of individual FFs reported here are the first such measurements in any galaxy and agree with the previously-reported measurement on stacked spectrum. The kinematical analysis reaffirms that the FFs belong to the disk of the galaxy, suggesting that their progenitors are most likely massive, compact disk clusters that have been able to survive for long timescales. We propose that the fuzzy appearance of FFs as compared to the GCs is a consequence of the dynamical evolution of their progenitor super star clusters in the disks of low-mass galaxies.</description>

      <title>Confirming HSC strong lens candidates with DESI Spectroscopy. I. Project Overview</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate redshift determinations of both lenses and sources are critical for confirming strong-lens systems and fully realizing their scientific value. However, the thousands of strong-lens candidates now routinely discovered in wide-field imaging surveys make one-by-one follow-up observations impractical. In this work, we investigate the capability and efficiency of large-scale spectroscopic surveys in confirming strong-lens systems. As a case study, we cross-match strong lens candidates identified from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program with Data Release 1 of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). We find that DESI DR1 serendipitously observed putative lenses and/or lensed images in approximately 50\% of these candidates. Analyzing the DESI spectra for $\approx 500$ matched candidates that meet our specific interests, we determine both lens and source redshifts for 27 systems. Additionally, 76 candidate systems feature lensing galaxies at $z &gt; 0.8$, and one candidate system contains a quasar within its lensing galaxy. Applying this approach to other strong-lens candidates will yield numerous additional confirmations, with a further several-fold increase anticipated from the final DESI data release. Our results highlight the growing importance of large-scale spectroscopic surveys in advancing strong lensing discoveries and investigations.</description>

      <title>Investigating the chemical link between H$_2$CO and CH$_3$OH within the CMZ of NGC 253</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Formaldehyde (H$_2$CO) and methanol (CH$_3$OH) have served as traditional tracers of the star formation process for decades. Studies of the environments which produce these species, though, have pointed to significant differences in the physical environments within which each molecule resides. In this paper we investigate the physical and chemical conditions which give rise to formaldehyde and methanol emission in the nearby starburst galaxy NGC 253. We employ high spatial (1.$''$6 or $\sim28$ pc) and spectral ($\sim10$ km/s) imaging of the NGC 253 central molecular zone (CMZ) from the ALCHEMI Large Program to constrain radiative transfer models of the dense gas volume density, and temperature, molecular species column density, and source filling factor within eight giant molecular clouds (GMCs). We also measure the relative abundances of the two nuclear spin isomers of CH$_3$OH to investigate its formation history. The physical and chemical conditions derived clearly indicate that H$_2$CO and CH$_3$OH originate from distinct physical environments. H$_2$CO traces low volume density and high kinetic temperatures, while CH$_3$OH traces high volume density and low kinetic temperatures. The H$_2$CO abundances are constant, though poorly constrained, within the eight NGC 253 GMCs analyzed, while the CH$_3$OH abundance shows a radial gradient from low to high values within the NGC 253 CMZ. Our findings highlight the complex chemical and physical differentiation of CH$_3$OH and H$_2$CO in the starburst environment of NGC 253. Methanol formation appears to be influenced by warm, dynamic processes rather than cold cloud chemistry, while formaldehyde primarily forms via gas-phase reactions. These results challenge the assumption of a direct chemical link between CH$_3$OH and H$_2$CO and underscores the impact of starburst-driven shocks, turbulence, and cosmic rays on molecular gas chemistry.</description>

      <title>Selection of Dwarf Galaxies Hosting AGNs: A Measure of Bias and Contamination using Unsupervised Machine Learning Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying AGNs in dwarf galaxies is critical for understanding black hole formation but remains challenging due to their low luminosities, low metallicities, and star formation-driven emission that can obscure AGN signatures. Machine learning (ML) techniques, particularly unsupervised methods, offer new ways to address these challenges by uncovering patterns in complex data. In this study, we apply Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) to explore the SED manifold of dwarf galaxies and evaluate AGN selection biases across diagnostics. We train a 51 by 51 SOM on 30,344 dwarf galaxies (redshift less than 0.055 and stellar mass below 10 to the 9.5 solar masses) from the NSA catalog using nine-band photometry from near-UV to mid-infrared. A set of 438 previously identified dwarf AGNs, selected via various methods, was mapped onto the SOM. AGNs identified by different methods occupy distinct and partially overlapping regions in SED space, reflecting selection biases tied to host properties. BPT selected AGNs cluster in higher-mass regions, while X-ray and variability-selected AGNs show broader distributions. WISE-selected AGNs are concentrated in lower-mass regions and form two clumps: one associated with bluer, starburst-like systems and the other with redder, more AGN-like SEDs. This separation may help distinguish true AGN hosts from starburst contaminants in WISE-selected samples. AGNs selected via traditional emission-line, broad-line, and WISE methods tend to avoid SOM regions linked to strong star formation. In contrast, a subset of AGNs in low-mass galaxies occupy regions indicative of high AGN luminosity relative to stellar content, highlighting luminous AGNs in faint hosts. These results demonstrate the utility of manifold learning for improving AGN selection in the low-mass regime.</description>

      <title>Influence of Bar Formation on Star Formation Segregation and Stellar Migration: Implications for Variations in the Age Distribution of Milky Way Disk Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a chemo-dynamical $N$-body/hydrodynamic simulation of an isolated Milky Way-like galaxy to investigate how bar formation influences star formation rates, stellar migration, and the resulting age and metallicity distributions of disk stars. Focusing on the transient epoch of bar formation, a phase that triggers gas inflows, enhances local star formation, and drives significant orbital migration, we find that the star formation rate in the inner disk exhibits a pronounced peak during this period. This behavior arises from the combined effect of vigorous star formation driven by strong spiral arms prior to bar formation and the subsequent suppression of star formation once the bar is established. In contrast, star formation in the outer disk persists after bar formation at modest levels, and enhanced outward migration of stars originally formed in the inner regions gives rise to a pronounced peak in the outer disk's stellar age distribution corresponding to the bar formation epoch. Moreover, stars formed during this epoch tend to exhibit higher gas-phase metallicities, reflecting their origin in more metal-rich inner regions. Although our model does not capture every detail of the Milky Way's complex evolution, our results highlight the dominant role of bar driven migration in segregating star formation activity and in shaping the long-term chemical and age structure of the Galactic disk. Recent observational studies suggest that the Milky Way's bar is approximately 8 Gyr old; therefore, our findings imply that the age distribution of stars in the solar circle and outer disk should show a corresponding peak around that age.</description>

      <title>Denoising Milky Way stellar survey data with normalizing flow models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Gaia dataset has revealed many intricate Milky Way substructures in exquisite detail, including moving groups and the phase spiral. Precise characterisation of these features and detailed comparisons to theoretical models require engaging with Gaia's heteroscedastic noise model, particularly in more distant parts of the Galactic disc and halo. We propose a general, novel machine-learning approach using normalizing flows for denoising density estimation, with particular focus on density estimation from stellar survey data such as that from Gaia. Normalizing flows transform a simple base distribution into a complex target distribution through bijective transformations resulting in a highly expressive and flexible model. The denoising is performed using importance sampling. We demonstrate that this general procedure works excellently on Gaia data by reconstructing detailed local velocity distributions artificially corrupted with noise. For example, we show the multiple branches of the Hercules stream and the phase-space spiral can both be well captured by our model. We discuss hyperparameter choice to optimally recover substructure and compare our approach to extreme deconvolution. The model therefore promises to be a robust tool for studying the Milky Way's kinematics in Galactic locations where the noise from Gaia is significant.</description>

      <title>The S-PLUS Fornax Project (S+FP): Mapping H$\alpha$+[NII] emission in 77 Fornax galaxy members reaching $\sim$4 Rvir</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Fornax cluster, the second-largest galaxy cluster within 20 Mpc, presents an ideal environment for studying environmental effects on galaxy evolution. Utilizing data from the Southern Photometric Local Universe Survey (S-PLUS), this study explores the H$\alpha$+[NII] emission maps across an area of approximately 208 square degrees around NGC 1399. For such, a dedicated semi-automated pipeline, Pixel-to-Pixel Emission Line Estimate (PELE), was developed to generate emission line maps by processing S-PLUS images using the Three Filter Method. A morphological analysis was conducted using the ASTROMORPHLIB package to determine whether H$\alpha$+[NII] emitters exhibit perturbed features. The study successfully detected 77 H$\alpha$+[NII] emitters with $r&lt;18$ mag, extending to four times the virial radius of the Fornax cluster. PELE demonstrated its ability to recover flux down to 2e-17 erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ when compared to H$\alpha$ maps from MUSE/VLT. Among the emitters, 25% are early-type galaxies (ETG) and 75% late-type galaxies (LTG). Signs of morphological perturbation or merger activity are observed in 44% of the LTG and in three ETG located beyond the cluster's virial radius. A significant fraction (91%) of the emitters are identified as recent infallers, primarily located in the northwestern region of the cluster, while others are associated with the infalling group Fornax A in the southwest. Disturbed, low-mass galaxies at larger cluster-centric distances provide evidence of galaxies begin transforming before entering the main cluster. This study demonstrates S-PLUS's effectiveness in detecting emitters, whose distribution reflects the Fornax cluster's assembly history, with LTG linked to recent infall from the field, possibly along a Fornax-Eridanus filament, and ETG may have evolved prior to entry.</description>

      <title>Non-Parametric Attenuation Curves in Local Star-Forming Galaxies: Geometry Effect, Dust Evolution, and ISS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a non-parametric approach, the Stellar Population Synthesis with Equivalent Widths (SEW) method, to reconstruct spectral-resolution wavelength-dependent attenuation curves for 169,568 star-forming galaxies from the SDSS DR7. Composite attenuation curves, stacked across stellar mass and inclination bins, reveal systematic trends: higher stellar mass correlates with steeper attenuation slopes (lower $R_V$), while edge-on galaxies exhibit flatter curves due to geometric saturation effects. Radiative transfer modelling under a uniform dust-star mixture confirms that the observed slope evolution with inclination comes from the galaxy geometry; the slope evolution with stellar mass arises from intrinsic dust property variations, linked to mass-dependent grain processing mechanisms. Additionally, intermediate-scale structures (ISS) at 4870, 6370, and 7690 \r{A} are tentatively detected. These findings underscore the interplay between dust geometry, grain evolution, and galactic environment, offering new insights into dust lifecycle models.</description>

      <title>Fully non-linear simulations of galaxy intrinsic alignments for weak lensing with the MillenniumTNG lightcone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a complete forward model of a realistic weak lensing galaxy catalogue based on the 740 Mpc hydrodynamical MillenniumTNG (MTNG) simulation. Starting with a complete particle and cell lightcone covering one octant of the sky with redshift range 0 &lt; $z$ &lt; 1.5, we apply a group and subhalo finder to generate the corresponding galaxy catalogue for a fiducial observer. For all galaxies, we compute both their intrinsic and lensing-induced shear. The intrinsic component is derived from the luminosity-weighted inertia tensor of stellar particles, while the extrinsic (gravitational) shear is obtained through full-sky ray-tracing on the same lightcone. This allows us to directly predict the impact of intrinsic alignment (IA) of galaxies on the shear correlation function and popular convergence statistics in a fully non-linear forward model. We find that IA modifies the convergence power spectrum at all angular scales by up to 20%, it significantly impacts the PDF, altering its tails by 10-20%, and distorts peak and minimum counts up to 30%, depending on redshift and scale. We also evaluate the impact of the IA signal on the shear correlation function finding that, along with a redshift dependence, the signal strongly increases for higher galaxy stellar mass cuts applied to the catalogue. Notably, with the highest stellar mass cut we apply, the intrinsic shear autocorrelation can become comparable to the gravitational shear component on small angular scales. Our results highlight the importance of accurately modeling IA for precision weak lensing cosmology with upcoming Stage IV surveys.</description>

      <title>A magnitude-limited catalogue of unresolved white dwarf-main sequence binaries from Gaia DR3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Binary stars containing a white dwarf and a main-sequence star, WDMS binaries, can be used to study a wide range of aspects of stellar astrophysics. We build a magnitude-limited sample of unresolved WDMS binaries from Gaia DR3 to enlarge these studies. We look for WDMS with available spectra whose location in the Gaia colour-magnitude diagram bridges between the evolutionary sequences of single white dwarfs and the main-sequence. To exclude spurious sources we apply quality cuts on the Gaia photometry and astrometry and we fit the SED (spectral energy distribution) of the objects with VOSA (Virtual Observatory SED Analyser) to exclude single sources. We further clean the sample via visual inspection of the Gaia spectra and publicly available images of the objects. We re-fit the SEDs of the finally selected WDMS with VOSA using composite models to measure their stellar parameters and we search for eclipsing systems by inspecting available ZTF and CRTS light curves. The catalogue consists of 1312 WDMS and we manage to derive stellar parameters for 435. This is because most WDMS are dominated by the main-sequence companions, making it hard to derive parameters for the white dwarfs. We also identify 67 eclipsing systems and estimate a lower limit to the completeness of the sample to be ~50% (~5% if we consider that not all WDMS in the studied region have Gaia spectra). Our catalogue increases by one order of magnitude the volume-limited sample we presented in our previous work. Despite the fact that the sample is incomplete and suffers from heavy observational biases, it is well characterised and can therefore be used to further constrain binary evolution by comparing the observed properties to those from synthetic samples obtained modeling the WDMS population in the Galaxy, taking into account all selection effects.</description>

      <title>The CMB optical depth constrains the duration of reionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, it was pointed out that invoking a large value of the CMB optical depth, $\tau_{\rm CMB} = 0.09$, could help resolve tensions between DESI DR2 BAO data and the CMB. This is larger than the value of $\tau_{\rm CMB} = 0.058$ measured from the Planck low-$\ell$ polarization data. Traditionally, $\tau_{\rm CMB}$ is thought of as a constraint on reionization's midpoint. However, recent observations and modeling of the Ly$\alpha$ forest of high-$z$ quasars at $5 &lt; z &lt; 6$ have tightly constrained the timing of the last $10-20\%$ of reionization, adding nuance to this interpretation. Here, we point out that fixing reionization's endpoint, in accordance with the latest Ly$\alpha$ forest constraints, renders $\tau_{\rm CMB}$ a sensitive probe of the duration of reionization, as well as its midpoint. We compare low and high values of $\tau_{\rm CMB}$ to upper limits on the patchy kinematic Sunyaev-Zeldovich (pkSZ) effect, another CMB observable that constrains reionization's duration, and find that a value of $\tau_{\rm CMB} = 0.09$ is in $\approx 2\sigma$ tension with existing limits on the pkSZ from the South Pole Telescope.</description>

      <title>The alternating 'changing-look' blazar OQ 334 (B2 1420+32): New observational clues to the blazar state transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The high-luminosity blazar OQ 334 is a leading exponent of the intriguing rare phenomenon of alternating between a flat-spectrum radio quasar (FSRQ) and a BL Lac (BLL) states. Its two optical continuum outbursts observed during the $\sim$ 1.5-year long time span, starting Jan 2018, had been shown to coincide with transition from the FSRQ to BLL state, manifested by a sharp drop in the equivalent width of MgII broad emission-line. Recently, a continuous monitoring of its blazar state, over a much longer duration (past $\sim$ 5 years) has become possible by deploying the observed $\gamma-ray$ spectral slope ($\Gamma_{\gamma}$) as a diagnostic. This opens prospects of making a much less biased and statistically more robust check on the association of optical flaring with FSRQ $\rightarrow$ BLL transition. We find that all 4 such transitions ($\Gamma_{\gamma}$ becoming &lt; 2.0), observed during the past $\sim$ 5 years, were accompanied by an optical flare. While this appears consistent with the transition to BL Lac state happening purely due to an enhanced optical continuum (flaring) swamping out the broad emission-lines, this simple scheme may need additional ingredients, considering the hint found for a day-like offset between the flaring and the state transition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Binary systems of compact objects in close orbit around a supermassive black hole (SMBH) may form in galactic nuclei, providing a unique environment to probe strong-gravity tidal effects on the binary's dynamics. In this work, we investigate precession resonances arising between the periastron precession frequency of a binary system and its orbital frequencies around the SMBH. By modeling the SMBH as a Schwarzschild black hole, we find that relativistic effects in the tidal field give rise to a significantly richer resonance spectrum compared to the Newtonian case. This result is supported by both perturbative and numerical analyses of the quadrupolar tidal interaction in the strong-gravity regime. Our results reveal new signatures for strong-gravity effects in such triple systems, with potential implications for gravitational-wave astronomy.</description>

      <title>Early Stellar Flybys are Unlikely: Improved Constraints from Sednoids and Large-$q$ TNOs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sedna-like objects (a.k.a. sednoids) are transneptunian objects (TNOs) characterized by large semimajor axes and exceptionally high perihelia. Their high-$q$ orbits are detached from the influence of the four giant planets and need extra perturbation to form. One hypothesis posits that close stellar flybys could have perturbed objects from the primordial scattering disk, generating the sednoid population. In this study, we run N-body simulations with different stellar encounter configurations to explore whether such a close stellar flyby can satisfy new constraints identified from sednoid (and detached extreme TNO) observation, including the low-inclination ($i&lt;30^\circ$) profile and primordial orbital alignment. Our results suggest that flybys with field stars are unable to generate a sufficient population, whereas flybys within the birth cluster fail to produce the primordial orbital alignment. To meet the inclination constraint of detached extreme TNOs, flybys have to be either coplanar ($i_\star \sim 0^\circ$) or symmetric about the ecliptic plane ($\omega_\star \sim 0^\circ, i_\star \sim 90^\circ$). After taking into account their occurrence rate at the early stage of the Solar System, we conclude that close-in stellar flybys ($q_\star \le 1000$~au) that satisfy all constraints are unlikely to happen ($\lesssim$5\%). Future discoveries of additional sednoids with precise orbital determinations are crucial to confirm the existence of the low-inclination tendency and the primordial alignment, and to further constrain the early dynamical evolution of the Solar System.</description>

      <title>A neural network approach to determining photometric metallicities of M-type dwarf stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: M dwarfs are the most abundant stars in the Galaxy and serve as key targets for stellar and exoplanetary studies. It is particularly challenging to determine their metallicities because their spectra are complex. For this reason, several authors have focused on photometric estimates of the M-dwarf metallicity. Although artificial neural networks have been used in the framework of modern astrophysics, their application to a photometric metallicity estimate for M dwarfs remains unexplored. We develop an accurate method for estimating the photometric metallicities of M dwarfs using artificial neural networks to address the limitations of traditional empirical approaches. We trained a neural network on a dataset of M dwarfs with spectroscopically derived metallicities. We used eight absolute magnitudes in the visible and infrared from Gaia, 2MASS, and WISE as input features. Batch normalization and dropout regularization stabilized the training and prevented overfitting. We applied the Monte Carlo dropout technique to obtain more robust predictions. The neural network demonstrated a strong performance in estimating photometric metallicities for M dwarfs in the range of -0.45&lt;[Fe/H]&lt;0.45dex and for spectral types as late as M5.0V. On the test sample, the predictions showed uncertainties down to 0.08dex. This surpasses the accuracy of previous methods. We further validated our results using an additional sample of 46 M dwarfs in wide binary systems with FGK-type primary stars with well-defined metallicities and achieved an excellent predictive performance that surpassed the 0.1dex error threshold. This study introduces a ML-based framework for estimating the photometric metallicities of M dwarfs and provides a scalable data-driven solution for analyzing large photometric surveys. The results outline the potential of artificial neural networks to enhance the determination of stellar parameters.</description>

      <title>Trumpler's Radial Velocities of Stars in Galactic Star Clusters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We assess the accuracy of radial velocities of 671 stars located near Galactic clusters, measured by Robert Trumpler between 1924 and 1947 using the Lick Observatory 36 inch refractor equipped with prism spectrometers. We find that Trumpler's velocities share the same zero-point and scale as modern IAU radial velocity standards. Their accuracy ranges from 2 to 7 km/s. We also provide star identifications, B-band photometry, and notes for many stars. We provide a link to an online PDF that contains all 3,782 of Trumpler's individual stellar radial velocities and associated Julian dates. Trumpler's velocities provide a century-long baseline for detecting long-period stellar companions, gravitational perturbations from passing massive objects, and accelerations due to cluster and Galactic dynamics.</description>

      <title>High angular resolution near-ultraviolet polarization imaging of the Herbig Ae/Be star LK-H{\alpha}-233</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Herbig Ae/Be stars are young, pre-main-sequence stars that provide critical insights into the processes of stellar formation, early stellar evolution and protoplanetary disks.Two of the key features of such stars are their circumstellar dusty disk and bipolar ionized outflows, which are key components for understanding planet formation processes and energy/matter deposition in the interstellar medium, respectively. In this context, imaging polarimetry is probably the sharpest tool to characterize the various structures and dynamics around the central star, due to the sensitivity of polarization to the morphology of the emitting, scattering and absorbing media. We take advantage of never published, near-ultraviolet polarimetric data of LK-H{\alpha}-233 taken by the Faint Object Camera aboard the Hubble Space Telescope in 1991, 1994 and 1995, which remained dormant in the archives despite their quality. Using the most recent and robust reduction pipeline for this instrument, we obtained high spatial resolution (0.0287 x 0.0287 arcsecond2) maps of this object at 4118 {\AA}, together with polarimetric measurements. A dark lane, bisecting the approaching and receding polar outflows, suggests the presence of a circumstellar disk or dust torus, obscuring the pre-main sequence star and collimating the ejecta. Polarization reveals that the outflows have an X-shape structure with a significant centro-symmetric pattern in polarization angle, indicating that the outflows are both hollow and scattering the emission from the buried star. We constrain the half-opening angle of both the outflows and circumstellar disk, determine the inclination of the system and estimate the obscured star's intrinsic flux. This study highlights the importance of high-resolution polarimetric observations in understanding the complex environment around Herbig Ae/Be stars and advocates for future similar instruments.</description>

      <title>Periodic Variability in Space Photometry of 181 New Supermassive Black Hole Binary Candidates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robust detections of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) are essential to unravel the role of galaxy mergers in galaxy evolution and for identifying potential sources of low-frequency gravitational waves. One of the most commonly used observational signatures of SMBHBs is periodic variability in the light curves of active galactic nuclei (AGN), which may arise from accretion rate modulation or relativistic Doppler boosting due to binary orbital motion. However, intrinsic stochastic AGN variability can mimic such periodic signals, complicating robust identification. We report the discovery of 181 new SMBHB candidates from a sample of approximately 770,000 AGN observed by the Gaia space observatory. Periodic signals were identified using a novel and computationally efficient Bayesian model selection framework, enabling unbiased source selection and quantifying the likelihood of periodicity over stochastic variability. These candidates nearly double the known SMBHB population and provide a prioritized target list for next-generation time-domain surveys.</description>

      <title>The 3D Kinematics of the Orion Nebula Cluster II: Mass-dependent Kinematics of the Inner Cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04751v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the kinematic analysis of $246$ stars within $4\mbox{$^\prime$}$ from the center of Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC), the closest massive star cluster with active star formation across the full mass range, which provides valuable insights into the formation and evolution of star clusters on an individual-star basis. High-precision radial velocities and surface temperatures are retrieved from spectra acquired by the NIRSPEC instrument used with adaptive optics (NIRSPAO) on the Keck II 10-m telescope. A three-dimensional kinematic map is then constructed by combining with the proper motions previously measured by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) ACS/WFPC2/WFC3IR and Keck II NIRC2. The measured root-mean-squared velocity dispersion is $2.26\pm0.08~\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, significantly higher than the virial equilibrium's requirement of $1.73~\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, suggesting that the ONC core is supervirial, consistent with previous findings. Energy equipartition is not detected in the cluster. Most notably, the velocity of each star relative to its neighbors is found to be negatively correlated with stellar mass. Low-mass stars moving faster than their surrounding stars in a supervirial cluster suggest that the initial masses of forming stars may be related to their initial kinematic states. Additionally, a clockwise rotation preference is detected. A weak sign of inverse mass segregation is also identified among stars, excluding the Trapezium stars, though it could be a sample bias. Finally, this study reports the discovery of four new candidate spectroscopic binary systems.</description>

      <title>Galaxy Rest-Frame UV Colors at z ~ 2-4 with HST UVCANDELS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20901v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an analysis of rest-frame UV colors of 17,243 galaxies at $z\sim2-4$ in the HST UVCANDELS fields: GOODS-N, GOODS-S, COSMOS, and EGS. Here, we study the rest-frame UV spectral slope, $\beta$, measured via model spectra obtained via spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting, $\beta_{SED}$, and explore its correlation with various galaxy parameters (photometric redshift, UV magnitude, stellar mass, dust attenuation, star formation rate [SFR], and specific SFR) obtained via SED fitting with Dense Basis. We also obtain measurements for $\beta$ via photometric power-law fitting and compare them to our SED-fit-based results, finding good agreement on average. While we find little evolution in $\beta$ with redshift from $z=2-4$ for the full population, there are clear correlations between $\beta$ (and related parameters) when binned by stellar mass. For this sample, lower stellar mass galaxies (log[$M_*$] = 7.5-8.5 $M_\odot$) are typically bluer ($\beta_{SED}=-2.0\pm 0.2$ / $\beta_{PL} = -2.1\pm0.4$), fainter ($MUV = -17.8^{+0.7}_{-0.6}$) less dusty ($A{v}=0.4\pm0.1$ mag), exhibit lower rates of star formation (log[SFR]=$0.1\pm0.2 M_\odot/$ yr) and higher specific star formation rates (log[sSFR]=$-8.2\pm0.2 \ \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$) than their high-mass counterparts. Higher-mass galaxies (log[$M_*$] $=10.0-12.0 \ M_\odot$) are on average redder ($\beta_{SED}=-0.9^{+0.8}_{-0.5}$ / $\beta_{PL}=-1.0^{+0.8}_{-0.5}$), brighter ($MUV=-19.6^{+1.0}_{-1.2}$), dustier ($Av = 0.9^{+0.5}_{-0.4}$ mag), have higher SFRs (log[SFR]=$1.2^{+0.6}_{-1.1} M_\odot$ yr), and lower sSFRs (log[sSFR]=$-9.1^{+0.5}_{-1.1} {yr}^{-1}$). This study's substantial sample size provides a benchmark for demonstrating that the rest-frame UV spectral slope correlates with stellar mass-dependent galaxy characteristics at $z\sim2-4$, a relationship less discernible with smaller datasets typically available at higher redshifts.</description>

      <title>The JWST EXCELS survey: direct estimates of C, N, and O abundances in two relatively metal-rich galaxies at $\mathbf{z\simeq5}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10557v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a spectroscopic analysis of two star-forming galaxies at $z\simeq5$ observed with JWST/NIRSpec as part of the EXCELS survey. The detection of the CIII]~$\lambda\lambda$1906,09, [OII] $\lambda\lambda$3726,29, [OIII] $\lambda\lambda$4363,5007, and [NII] $\lambda$6584 emission lines enables an investigation of the $\mathrm{C/O}$, $\mathrm{N/O}$, and $\mathrm{C/N}$ abundance ratios using the temperature-sensitive method. The galaxies have stellar masses of ${\mathrm{log}(M_{\star}/\mathrm{M}_{\odot}) = 8.09^{+\, 0.24}_{-0.15}}$ and ${\mathrm{log}(M_{\star}/\mathrm{M}_{\odot}) = 8.02^{+\, 0.06}_{-0.08}}$ with metallicities of $Z \simeq 0.2 \, \rm{Z_{\odot}}$ and $Z \simeq 0.3 \, \rm{Z_{\odot}}$. These metallicities are somewhat higher than is typical for other $z\gtrsim 5$ galaxies with similar stellar mass and are comparable to $z \simeq 0$ analogues. Both galaxies display evidence for elevated N/O ratios with respect to the typical star-forming galaxies at $z\simeq0$, with ${\mathrm{log(N/O)} = -1.07^{+\,0.17}_{-0.13}}$ and ${\mathrm{log(N/O)} = -0.86^{+\,0.15}_{-0.11}}$ respectively. In contrast, we find low C abundances, with ${\mathrm{log(C/O)}=-0.82\pm0.22}$ and ${\mathrm{log(C/O)}=-1.02\pm0.22}$, consistent with the predicted yields of core-collapse supernovae. Following the trend observed in other high-redshift sources, we find that the $\mathrm{C/N}$ ratios are lower at fixed $\mathrm{O/H}$ compared to the majority of local galaxies. Via a comparison to detailed chemical evolution models, we find that a standard or bottom-heavy IMF can explain the observed abundance ratios where the N-enrichment comes from intermediate mass ($\simeq 4-7 \, \mathrm{M}_{\odot}$) stars. Our results demonstrate that robust measurements of CNO abundances with \emph{JWST} can reveal unique enrichment pathways in galaxies as a function of both metallicity and redshift.</description>

      <title>Ion densities of cold clouds driven by galactic outflows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09083v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Observations of the circumgalactic medium (CGM) often display coincident absorption from species with widely varying ionization states, providing direct evidence for complex, multiphase interactions. Motivated by these measurements, we perform a series of cloud-crushing simulations that model cold clouds traveling through the hot CGM. We analyze the ion distributions of these clouds, generate mock absorption spectra, and study their implications on quasar (QSO) absorption observations. Our results show interesting multiphase features, in which ions with significantly different ionization potentials exist in the same absorber and share similar spectral features. However, our simulations are unable to explain high ions like O \textsc{vi} and their coexistence with lower ions that appear in many observed QSO absorption systems.</description>

      <title>A pioneering experiment combining single-antenna and aperture-synthesis data to measure Faraday rotation with GMIMS and the CGPS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10623v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Structures in the magnetoionic medium exist across a wide range of angular sizes owing to large-scale magnetic fields coherent over the Galactic spiral arms combined with small-scale fluctuations in the magnetic field and electron density resulting from energy injection processes such as supernovae. For the first time, we produce diffuse Galactic synchrotron emission Faraday rotation maps covering all spatial scales down to $3'$ resolution for magnetic field studies. These maps complement total and polarized intensity maps combining single-antenna and interferometric data that have been produced, such as the Canadian Galactic Plane Survey (CGPS). Combined maps have sensitivity to large scales from the single-antenna component and angular resolution from the interferometric component. We combine Global Magneto-Ionic Medium Survey High-Band North single-antenna and CGPS aperture-synthesis polarization data after spatial filtering, producing Stokes $Q$ and $U$ maps for the four CGPS frequency channels. We calculate rotation measures (RMs) for all pixels using a linear fit to polarization angle versus wavelength squared. Smooth polarized emission regions require the large-scale sensitivity of the single-antenna to illuminate the Faraday rotation, while aperture synthesis reveals small-scale RM variability. While these maps show magnetic field structures on the full range of spatial scales they probe, the RM values should be interpreted with caution, as the narrow $\lambda^2$ coverage limits sensitivity to Faraday complexity. Despite this limitation of the CGPS 35 MHz bandwidth, we demonstrate that useful Faraday rotation information can be obtained from the combined dataset, highlighting the important synergy between future broadband interferometric and single-antenna polarization surveys.</description>

      <title>Luminous Mid-IR Selected Type-2 Quasars at Cosmic Noon in SDSS Stripe82 I: Selection, Composite Photometry, and Spectral Energy Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14026v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze 23 spectroscopically confirmed Type-2 quasars (QSOs) selected from the WISE 22$\rm \mu$m band in the SDSS Stripe 82 region, focusing on their multi-band photometry and spectral energy distributions (SEDs). These objects were selected to be IR-luminous ($\rm flux_{W4} &gt; 5mJy$, i.e., $12.62 &lt; W4 &lt; 14.62 \rm\ AB \, magnitude$), optically faint ($r &gt; 23$) or with red color ($r - W4 &gt;8.38$). Gemini/GNIRS observations were conducted for all 24 candidates, and 18/24 were also observed with Keck/LRIS. The observations confirm 23 to be real Type-2 QSOs in the redshift range $0.88 - 2.99$ (12 are at $z&gt;2$). We collect multi-band photometry and conduct SED fitting. The composite photometry probes the wavelength from 0.1$\rm \mu$m to 10$\rm \mu$m at the rest frame. The IR emission is dominated by dust torus implying an average torus luminosity for the sample of $L_{\rm torus} 10^{46.84} \rm erg/s$. The origin of the rest-UV/optical light is not definitive, but we present three possible scenarios: scattered light, stellar emission, and the reddened accretion disk. Assuming an obscured:unobscured ratio of approximately 1:1, our targets have $L_{\rm bol} = 10^{46.28} \rm erg \,s^{-1} - 10^{47.49} \rm erg \,s^{-1}$ and around SMBH masses $\rm 10^{8.18} M_{\odot} - 10^{9.39} M_{\odot}$, assuming they accreate at the Eddington limit. Compared to previous Type-2 AGN SEDs, our targets have a brighter dust torus and redder optical-IR color. By comparing the SED to the results from JWST `little red dots' (LRDs), we find that these IR-selected Type-2 QSOs have similar SED shapes to the LRDs. This pilot Type-2 QSO survey demonstrates that mid-IR selection is an efficient way to find luminous Type-2 QSOs at $z&gt;2$. Finally, the composite photometry and Type-2 QSOs SED model generated by this sample provide a guide for finding more Type-2 QSOs at higher redshift.</description>

      <title>DESI Data Release 1: Stellar Catalogue</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14787v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we present the stellar Value-Added Catalogue (VAC) based on the DESI Data Release 1. This VAC contains stellar parameter, abundance and radial velocity measurements for more than 4 million stars. It also contains, for the first time, measurements from individual epochs for more than a million stars with at least two observations. The main contribution to the catalogue comes from the bright program of the main survey, which includes $\sim $2.5 million stars, and the backup program, which includes $\sim $ 1 million stars. The combined magnitude range for the stars in the catalogue extends from Gaia G $\sim 12$ to G $\sim 21$. For the magnitude range $17.5&lt;G&lt;21$ this catalogue represents a factor of 10 increase in the number of stars with radial velocity and abundance measurements compared to existing surveys. Despite DESI's resolution (R $\sim 2500-5000$), the median radial velocity random error for stars in the catalogue is better than 1 km s$^{-1}$. The stellar parameters and abundances of stars in DESI are measured by two independent pipelines, and after applying a temperature-dependent calibration, [Fe/H] abundances of high signal-to-noise stars are accurate to better than $\sim$ 0.1 dex when compared to high-resolution surveys. The catalogue probes different Galactic components including a particularly large number of distant stars: tens of thousands of stars further than 10 kpc, and thousands further than 50 kpc. The catalogue also contains several thousand extremely metal-poor stars with ${\rm [Fe/H]}&lt;-3$. The released sample of stars includes measurements for thousands of stars that are members of dwarf galaxies, open and globular clusters as well as members of several dozen stellar streams. The next public DESI data release is expected in two years and will contain three times as many stars as DR1.</description>

      <title>Effects of black hole environments on extreme mass-ratio hyperbolic encounters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03095v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extreme mass-ratio hyperbolic encounters (EMRHEs) around the supermassive black holes will be observable at the future gravitational-wave (GW) detectors in space, such as LISA and Taiji. Here we consider such EMRHEs in the presence of surrounding matter distribution including baryonic accretion disk and dark matter (DM) spike, and estimate their effects on the orbital evolution and GW waveforms. We find that large possible impacts come from the gravitational potential of accretion disk, while the influence of DM spike is small. We also illustrate that environments can leave distinctive imprints on the GW waveforms, but resolving such modifications is found to be challenging for LISA-like detectors in the near future.</description>

      <title>On the low-energy limit of stationary and axisymmetric solutions in General Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08598v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the low-energy limit of General Relativity in the presence of stationarity and axial symmetry, coupled to dust. Specifically, we demonstrate that differences between the dynamics of General Relativity and those of Newtonian gravity persist even in the weak-field and slow-motion regime. Notably, these differences are driven by dragging terms that are not necessarily small, as is typically the case in the well-known gravitomagnetic limit. To highlight this distinction, we use the concept of strong gravitomagnetism that we introduced in previous works. We provide a pedagogical discussion of how these discrepancies arise and outline a systematic procedure to solve the equations of motion for such systems. Furthermore, we present analytical results for specific cases and also give the general solution for the vacuum case. A particularly notable result is our demonstration of how General Relativity can naturally account for a Tully-Fisher-like relation.</description>

Abstract: We present a novel method that enables us to estimate the acceleration of individual millisecond pulsars (MSPs) using only their spin period and its time derivative. For our binary MSP sample, we show that one can obtain an empirical calibration of the magnetic braking term that relies only on observed quantities. We find that such a model for magnetic braking is only valid for MSPs with small surface magnetic field strengths ($&lt;3\times10^8$ G) and large characteristic ages ($&gt;$ 5 Gyr). With this method we are able to effectively double the number of pulsars with line-of-sight acceleration measurements, from 27 to 53 sources. This expanded dataset leads to an updated measurement of the total density in the midplane, which we find to be $\rho_0$ = 0.108 $\pm$ 0.008 \textit{stat}. $\pm$ 0.011 \textit{sys} M$_\odot$/pc$^3$, and the first $&gt;3\sigma$ measurement of the local dark matter density from direct acceleration measurements, which we calculate to be $\rho_{0,\mathrm{DM}}$ = 0.0098 $\pm$ 0.0025 \textit{stat.} $\pm$ 0.0003 \textit{sys}. M$_\odot$/pc$^3$ (0.37 $\pm$ 0.10 GeV/cm$^3$). This updated value for $\rho_{0,\mathrm{DM}}$ is in good agreement with literature values derived from kinematic estimates. The pulsar accelerations are very asymmetric above and below the disk; we show that the shape and size of this asymmetry can be largely explained by the north-south asymmetry of disk star counts and the offset in the Milky Way disk and halo centers of mass due to the Large Magellanic Cloud.</description>

      <title>Methods to Test the Source of the Extreme Gas Motions in WS 35</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13626v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present theoretical arguments toward the plausibility of a stellar wind}to explain the 16000\,km\,$s^{-1}$ line broadening in the optical spectra of WS 35, the central star in the Pa 30 nebula. The wind model is discussed in the context of super-Eddington flows. We argue that WS 35 potentially occupies a new regime of wind driving theory as the first metal-only wind. While this framework provides a promising avenue for explaining the high speed flow, questions remain about the source's true nature. We further describe how future radio observations can provide an independent test of the spherical wind scenario. A magnetically channeled wind would likely produce a relatively flat and bright radio spectral energy distributions. By contrast a spherical wind should result in a thermal radio spectrum with a canonical continuum slope of $\nu^{0.6}$, and a brightness level consistent with the currently predicted mass-loss rate.</description>
