      <title>Groups with ET0L co-word problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study groups whose co-word problems are ET0L languages, which we call coET0L groups, using an automaton based model due to van Leeuwen, and recently studied by Bishop and Elder. In particular we prove a number of closure results for the class of groups with co-word problems in a subclass of `special' ET0L languages; that class of groups contains all groups that we know at the time of writing to be co-ET0L, including all groups that were proved by Holt and R\"over to be stack groups, and hence co-indexed. It includes virtually free groups, bounded automata groups, and the Higman-Thompson groups, together with groups constructed from those using finitely generated subgroups, finite extension, free and direct products, and by taking the restricted standard wreath product of a co-\E group by a finitely generated virtually free top group.</description>

      <title>On the Boone--Higman Conjecture for groups acting on locally finite trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a method for proving the Boone--Higman Conjecture for groups acting on locally finite trees. As a consequence, we prove the Boone--Higman Conjecture for all Baumslag--Solitar groups and for all free(finite rank)-by-cyclic groups, solving it in two cases that have been raised explicitly by Belk, Bleak, Matucci and Zaremsky. We also illustrate that our method has applications beyond these cases and can for instance be used to prove the Boone--Higman Conjecture for the Leary--Minasyan groups.</description>

      <title>Isbell's subfactor projections in a noetherian form</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we revisit the 1979 work of Isbell on subfactors of groups and their projections, which he uses to establish a stronger formulation of the butterfly lemma and its consequence, the refinement theorem for subnormal series of subgroups. We point out an error in the second part of Isbell's refinement theorem, but show that the rest of his results can be extended to the general self-dual context of a noetherian form, which includes in its scope all semi-abelian categories as well as all Grandis exact categories. Furthermore, we show that Isbell's formulations of the butterfly lemma and the refinement theorem amount to canonicity of isomorphisms established in these results.</description>

      <title>On the growth and integral (co)homology of free regular star-monoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The free regular $\star$-monoid of rank $r$ is the freest $r$-generated regular monoid $\mathbf{F}_r^\star$ in which every element $m$ has a distinguished pseudo-inverse $m^\star$ satisfying $mm^\star m = m$ and $(m^\star)^\star = m$. We study the growth rate of the monogenic regular $\star$-monoid $\mathbf{F}_1^\star$, and prove that this growth rate is intermediate. In particular, we deduce that $\mathbf{F}_r^\star$ is not rational or automatic for any $r \geq 1$, yielding the analogue of a result of Cutting &amp; Solomon for free inverse monoids. Next, for all ranks $r \geq 1$ we determine the integral homology groups $H_\ast(\mathbf{F}_r^\star, \mathbb{Z})$, and by constructing a collapsing scheme prove that they vanish in dimension $3$ and above. As a corollary, we deduce that the free regular $\star$-monoid $\mathbf{F}_r^\star$ of rank $r \geq 1$ does not have the homological finiteness property $\operatorname{FP}_2$, yielding the analogue of a result of Gray &amp; Steinberg for free inverse monoids.</description>

      <title>On $e$-local structures for $\mathbb{Z}_\ell$-spetses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $q$ be a prime power, $\ell$ a prime not dividing $q$, and $e$ the order of $q$ modulo $\ell$. We show that the geometric realisation of the nerve of the transporter category of $e$-split Levi subgroups of a finite reductive group $G$ over $\mathbb{F}_q$ is homotopy equivalent to the classifying space $BG$ up to $\ell$-completion. We suggest a generalisation of this equivalence to the setting of $\mathbb{Z}_\ell$-reflection cosets and establish a related fact involving the associated orbit spaces. We also establish a Dade-like formula for unipotent characters of $\mathbb{Z}_\ell$-spetses inspired by a question of Brou\'e.</description>

      <title>Rota-Baxter operators, differential operators, pre- and Novikov structures on groups and Lie algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rota-Baxter operators on various structures have found important applications in diverse areas, from renormalization of quantum field theory to Yang-Baxter equations. Relative Rota-Baxter operators on Lie algebras are closely related to pre-Lie algebras and post-Lie algebras. Some of their group counterparts have been introduced to study post-groups, skew left braces and set-theoretic solutions of Yang-Baxter equations, but searching suitable notions of relative Rota-Baxter operators on groups with weight zero and pre-groups has been challenging and has been the focus of recent studies, by provisionally imposing an abelian condition.
  Arising from the works of Balinsky-Novikov and Gelfand-Dorfman, Novikov algebras and their constructions from differential commutative algebras have led to broad applications. Finding their suitable counterparts for groups and Lie algebras has also attracted quite much recent attention.
  This paper uses one-sided-inverse pairs of maps to give a perturbative approach to a general notion of relative Rota-Baxter operators and differential operators on a group and a Lie algebra with limit-weight. With the extra condition of limit-abelianess on the group or Lie algebra, we give an interpretation of relative Rota-Baxter and differential operators with weight zero. These operators motivate us to define pre-groups and Novikov groups respectively as the induced structures. The tangent maps of these operators are shown to give Rota-Baxter and differential operators with weight zero on Lie algebras. The tangent spaces of the pre-Lie and Novikov Lie groups are pre-Lie algebras and Novikov Lie algebras, fulfilling the expected property. Furthermore, limit-weight relative Rota-Baxter operators on groups give rise to skew left braces and then set-theoretic solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation.</description>

      <title>Webb's conjecture and generalised Harish-Chandra theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Webb's conjecture states that the orbit space of the Brown complex of a finite group at any given prime $\ell$ is contractible. This conjecture was proved by Symonds in 1998. In this paper, we suggest a generalisation of Webb's conjecture for finite reductive groups. This is done by associating to each irreducible character a new simplicial complex defined in terms of Deligne--Lusztig theory. We then show that our conjecture follows from a condition, called ($e$-HC-conj) below, related to generalised Harish-Chandra theory. In particular, using earlier results of the author, we prove our conjecture and recover Symonds result for finite reductive groups under mild restrictions on the prime $\ell$. Finally, we show that the condition ($e$-HC-conj) is implied by the contractibility of the orbit spaces associated to our newly defined complex offering an unexplored topological approach to proving the uniqueness of $e$-cuspidal pairs up to conjugation.</description>

      <title>The Bieri-Neumann-Strebel sets of quasi-projective groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a smooth complex quasi-projective variety and $\Gamma=\pi_1(X)$. Let $\chi \colon \Gamma \to \mathbb{R}$ be an additive character. We prove that the ray $[\chi]$ does not belong to the BNS set $\Sigma(\Gamma)$ if and only if it comes as a pullback along an algebraic fibration $f \colon X \to \mathcal{C}$ over a quasi-projective hyperbolic orbicurve $\mathcal{C}$. We also prove that if $\pi_1(X)$ admits a solvable quotient which is not virtually nilpotent, there exists a finite \'etale cover $X_1 \to X$ and a fibration $f \colon X_1 \to \mathcal{C}$ over a quasi-projective hyperbolic orbicurve $\mathcal{C}$. Both of these results were proved by Delzant in the case when $X$ is a compact K\"ahler manifold. We deduce that $\Gamma$ is virtually solvable if and only if it is virtually nilpotent, generalising the theorems of Delzant and Arapura-Nori. We give two applications of our results. First, we strengthen the recent theorem of Cadorel-Deng-Yamanoi on virtual nilpotency of fundamental groups of quasi-projective $h$-special and weakly special manifolds. Second, we prove the sharpness of Suciu's tropical bound for the fundamental groups of smooth quasi-projective varieties and answer a question of Suciu on the topology of hyperplane arrangements.</description>

      <title>Cayley Automatic Groups and Numerical Characteristics of Turing Transducers</title>

      <description>arXiv:1606.08357v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the problem of finding characterizations for Cayley automatic groups. The concept of Cayley automatic groups was recently introduced by Kharlampovich, Khoussainov and Miasnikov. We address this problem by introducing three numerical characteristics of Turing transducers: growth functions, Folner functions and average length growth functions. These three numerical characteristics are the analogs of growth functions, Folner functions and drifts of simple random walks for Cayley graphs of groups. We study these numerical characteristics for Turing transducers obtained from automatic presentations of labeled directed graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.15752v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We answer a question of Bardakov (Kourovka Notebook, Problem 19.8) which asks for the existence of a pair of natural numbers $(c, m)$ with the property that every element in the free group on the two-element set $\{a, b\}$ can be represented as a concatenation of $c$, or fewer, $m$-almost-palindromes in letters $a^{\pm 1}, b^{\pm 1}$. Here, an $m$-almost-palindrome is a word which can be obtained from a palindrome by changing at most $m$ letters. We show that no such pair $(c, m)$ exists. In fact, we show that the analogous result holds for all non-abelian free groups.</description>

Abstract: We introduce an extension of the fellow traveler property which allows fellow travelers to be at distance bounded from above by a function $f(n)$ growing slower than any linear function. We study normal forms satisfying this extended fellow traveler property and certain geometric constraints that naturally generalize two fundamental properties of an automatic normal form - the regularity of its language and the bounded length difference property. We show examples of such normal forms and prove some non-existence theorems.</description>

Abstract: As a result of impressive research arXiv:2106.07231, D. Garc\'{\i}a-Lucas, \'{A}. del R\'{i}o and L. Margolis defined an infinite series of non-isomorphic $2$-groups $G$ and $H$, whose group algebras $\mathbb{F}G$ and $\mathbb{F}H$ over the field $\mathbb{F}=\mathbb{F}_2$ are isomorphic, solving negatively the long-standing Modular Isomorphism Problem (MIP). In this note we give a different perspective on their examples and show that they are special cases of a more general construction. We also show that this type of construction for $p&gt;2$ does not provide a similar counterexample to the MIP.</description>

Abstract: Random groups of density d&lt;\frac{1}{2} are infinite hyperbolic, and of density d&gt;\frac{1}{2} are finite. We prove that for any given system of equations \Sigma, all the solutions of \Sigma over a random group of density d&lt;\frac{1}{2} are projected from solutions of \Sigma over the free group F_{k}, with overwhelming probability, where k is the rank of the group. We conclude that any given sentence in the Boolean algebra of universal sentences, is a truth sentence over F_{k} if and only if it is a truth sentence over random groups of density d&lt;\frac{1}{2}, with overwhelming probability.</description>

Abstract: Random groups of density d&lt;\frac{1}{2} are infinite hyperbolic, and of density d&gt;\frac{1}{2} are finite. We prove the existence of a uniform quantifier elimination procedure for formulas of minimal rank (probably the superstable part of the theory). Namely, given a minimal rank formula V(p), we prove the existence of a formula \varphi(p) that belongs to the Boolean algebra of two quantifiers, so that the two formulas V(p) and \varphi(p) define the same set over the free group F_{k} and over a random group of density d&lt;\frac{1}{2}. We conclude that any given sentence of minimal rank is a truth sentence over the free group F_{k} if and only if it is a truth sentence over random groups of density d&lt;\frac{1}{2}.</description>

      <title>Co-Engel graphs of certain finite non-Engel groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03879v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a group. Associate a graph $\mathcal{E}_G$ (called the co-Engel graph of $G$) with $G$ whose vertex set is $G$ and two distinct vertices $x$ and $y$ are adjacent if $[x, {}_k y] \neq 1$ and $[y, {}_k x] \neq 1$ for all positive integer $k$. This graph, under the name ``Engel graph'', was introduced by Abdollahi. Let $L(G)$ be the set of all left Engel elements of $G$. In this paper, we realize the induced subgraph of co-Engel graphs of certain finite non-Engel groups $G$ induced by $G \setminus L(G)$. We write $\mathcal{E}^-(G)$ to denote the subgraph of $\mathcal{E}_G$ induced by $G \setminus L(G)$. We also compute genus, various spectra, energies and Zagreb indices of $\mathcal{E}^-(G)$ for those groups. As a consequence, we determine (up to isomorphism) all finite non-Engel group $G$ such that the clique number is at most $4$ and $\mathcal{E}^-$ is toroidal or projective. Further, we show that $\coeng{G}$ is super integral and satisfies the E-LE conjecture and the Hansen--Vuki{\v{c}}evi{\'c} conjecture for the groups considered in this paper.</description>

Abstract: Let $T_X$ be the full transformation monoid over a finite set $X$, and fix some $a\in T_X$ of rank $r$. The variant $T_X^a$ has underlying set $T_X$, and operation $f\star g=fag$. We study the congruences of the subsemigroup $P=Reg(T_X^a)$ consisting of all regular elements of $T_X^a$, and the lattice $Cong(P)$ of all such congruences. Our main structure theorem ultimately decomposes $Cong(P)$ as a specific subdirect product of $Cong(T_r)$ and the full equivalence relation lattices of certain combinatorial systems of subsets and partitions. We use this to give an explicit classification of the congruences themselves, and we also give a formula for the height of the lattice.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14343v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give an alternate proof of the left-orderability of the mapping class group of a connected oriented infinite-type surface with a non-empty boundary. Our main strategy involves the inductive construction of a countable stable Alexander system for the surface using a carefully chosen exhaustion by finite-type subsurfaces. In fact, we prove that a generalised ideal arc system for the surface also induces a left-ordering on the big mapping class group. We then prove that two generalised ideal arc systems determine the same left-ordering if and only if they are loosely isotopic. Finally, we prove that the topology on the big mapping class group is the same as the order topology induced by a left-ordering corresponding to an inductively constructed ideal arc system.</description>

Abstract: There are many ways to embed the Lie groups of the Standard Model of Particle Physics in a Lie group of type $E_8$, but so far there is no convincing demonstration that the finite symmetries (and asymmetries) of weak hypercharge, three generations of electrons, three quarks in a proton, and photon polarisation can also be embedded correctly. I show that there is a unique way to embed these finite symmetries consistently, and that the gauge groups of the Standard Model are then uniquely determined. The model is automatically chiral, and the generation symmetry acts as a rotation in a real 2-space, so that the spinors for three generations have only twice as many degrees of freedom in total as the spinors for a single generation. In fact, two distinct generation symmetries arise from the restriction to the Standard Model, related by the CKM and/or PMNS matrices. It therefore appears that these two matrices are not independent. I further speculate on the implications for quantum gravity.</description>
