      <title>CLUE: Safe Model-Based RL HVAC Control Using Epistemic Uncertainty Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model-Based Reinforcement Learning (MBRL) has been widely studied for Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) control in buildings. One of the critical challenges is the large amount of data required to effectively train neural networks for modeling building dynamics. This paper presents CLUE, an MBRL system for HVAC control in buildings. CLUE optimizes HVAC operations by integrating a Gaussian Process (GP) model to model building dynamics with uncertainty awareness. CLUE utilizes GP to predict state transitions as Gaussian distributions, effectively capturing prediction uncertainty and enhancing decision-making under sparse data conditions. Our approach employs a meta-kernel learning technique to efficiently set GP kernel hyperparameters using domain knowledge from diverse buildings. This drastically reduces the data requirements typically associated with GP models in HVAC applications. Additionally, CLUE incorporates these uncertainty estimates into a Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) algorithm, enabling the selection of safe, energy-efficient control actions. This uncertainty-aware control strategy evaluates and selects action trajectories based on their predicted impact on energy consumption and human comfort, optimizing operations even under uncertain conditions. Extensive simulations in a five-zone office building demonstrate that CLUE reduces the required training data from hundreds of days to just seven while maintaining robust control performance. It reduces comfort violations by an average of 12.07% compared to existing MBRL methods, without compromising on energy efficiency.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Reachability of Stochastic Control Systems: A Contraction-Based Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a framework for studying the probabilistic reachability of stochastic control systems. Given a stochastic system, we introduce a separation strategy for reachability analysis that decouples the effect of deterministic input/disturbance and stochastic uncertainty. A remarkable feature of this separation strategy is its ability to leverage any deterministic reachability framework to capture the effect of deterministic input/disturbance. Furthermore, this separation strategy encodes the impact of stochastic uncertainty on reachability analysis by measuring the distance between the trajectories of the stochastic system and its associated deterministic system. Using contraction theory, we provide probabilistic bounds on this trajectory distance and estimate the propagation of stochastic uncertainties through the system. By combining this probabilistic bound on trajectory distance with two computationally efficient deterministic reachability methods, we provide estimates for probabilistic reachable sets of the stochastic system. We demonstrate the efficacy of our framework through numerical experiments on a feedback-stabilized inverted pendulum.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The urgency of the energy transition requires improving the performance and longevity of hydrogen technologies. AlphaPEM is a dynamic one-dimensional (1D) physics-based PEM fuel cell system simulator, programmed in Python and experimentally validated. It offers a good balance between accuracy and execution speed. The modular architecture allows for addition of new features, and it has a user-friendly graphical interface. An automatic calibration method is proposed to match the model to the studied machine. The software provides information on the internal states of the system in response to any current density and can produce polarization and EIS curves. AlphaPEM facilitates the use of a model in embedded conditions, allowing real-time modification of the fuel cell's operating conditions.</description>

      <title>Shackling Uncertainty using Mixed Criticality in Monte-Carlo Tree Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the world of embedded systems, optimizing actions with the uncertain costs of multiple resources is a complex challenge. Existing methods include plan building based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), an approach that thrives in multiple online planning scenarios. However, these methods often overlook uncertainty in worst-case cost estimations. A system can fail to operate before achieving a critical objective when actual costs exceed optimistic worst-case estimates. Conversely, a system based on pessimistic worst-case estimates would lead to resource over-provisioning even for less critical objectives. To solve similar issues, the Mixed Criticality (MC) approach has been developed in the real-time systems community. In this paper, we propose to extend the MCTS heuristic in three directions.
  Firstly, we reformulate the concept of MC to account for uncertain worst-case costs. High-criticality tasks must be executed regardless of their uncertain costs. Low-criticality tasks are either executed in low-criticality mode utilizing resources up-to their optimistic worst-case estimates, or executed in high-criticality mode by degrading them, or discarded when resources are scarce.
  Secondly, although the MC approach was originally developed for real-time systems, focusing primarily on worst-case execution time as the only uncertain resource, our approach extends the concept of resources to deal with several resources at once, such as the time and energy required to perform an action.
  Finally, we propose an extension of MCTS with MC concepts, which we refer to as $(MC)^2TS$, to efficiently adjust resource allocation to uncertain costs according to the criticality of actions. We demonstrate our approach in an active perception scenario. Our evaluation shows $(MC)^2TS$ outperforms the traditional MCTS regardless of whether the worst case estimates are optimistic or pessimistic.</description>

      <title>Effects of dynamic power electronic load models on power systems analysis using ZIP-E loads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Power grids are seeing more devices connected at the load level in the form of power electronics: e.g., data centers, electric vehicle chargers, and battery storage facilities. Therefore it is necessary to perform power system analyses with load models that capture these loads' behavior, which has historically not been done. To this end, we propose ZIP-E loads, a composite load model that has a ZIP load with a dynamic power electronic, or E, load model. We perform small signal and transient analysis of the IEEE WSCC 9 Bus test case with ZIP and ZIP-E load models. For small signals, we conclude that ZIP loads destabalize networks significantly faster than corresponding ZIP-E loads. In stable cases, transient results showed significantly larger oscillations for ZIP loads. Further, we find that a higher network loading condition is correlated with a higher sensitivity to load model choice. These results suggests that the constant power portion of the ZIP load has a large destabilizing effect and can generally overestimate instability, and that attention should be drawn to load model choice if operating near a stability boundary.</description>

      <title>Pointwise-Sparse Actuator Scheduling for Linear Systems with Controllability Guarantee</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we address optimal scheduling of control inputs given a hard constraint on the number of input channels active at any time. For a sparsely controllable system, we characterize the sparse actuator schedules that make the system controllable, and then devise a greedy selection algorithm that guarantees controllability while heuristically providing low control effort. We further show how to enhance our greedy algorithm via Markov chain Monte Carlo-based optimization.</description>

      <title>Information Compression in Dynamic Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the reasons why stochastic dynamic games with an underlying dynamic system are challenging is since strategic players have access to enormous amount of information which leads to the use of extremely complex strategies at equilibrium. One approach to resolve this challenge is to simplify players' strategies by identifying appropriate compression of information maps so that the players can make decisions solely based on the compressed version of information, called the information state. For finite dynamic games with asymmetric information, inspired by the notion of information state for single-agent control problems, we propose two notions of information states, namely mutually sufficient information (MSI) and unilaterally sufficient information (USI). Both these information states are obtained with information compression maps independent of the strategy profile. We show that Bayes-Nash Equilibria (BNE) and Sequential Equilibria (SE) exist when all players use MSI-based strategies. We prove that when all players employ USI-based strategies the resulting sets of BNE and SE payoff profiles are the same as the sets of BNE and SE payoff profiles resulting when all players use full information-based strategies. We prove that when all players use USI-based strategies the resulting set of weak Perfect Bayesian Equilibrium (wPBE) payoff profiles can be a proper subset of all wPBE payoff profiles. We identify MSI and USI in specific models of dynamic games in the literature. We end by presenting an open problem: Do there exist strategy-dependent information compression maps that guarantee the existence of at least one equilibrium or maintain all equilibria that exist under perfect recall? We show, by a counterexample, that a well-known strategy-dependent information compression map used in the literature does not possess any of the properties of MSI or USI.</description>

      <title>Energy-Aware UAV-Enabled Target Tracking: Online Optimization with Location Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) trajectory design, the total propulsion energy consumption and initial-final location constraints are practical factors to consider. However, unlike traditional offline designs, these two constraints are non-trivial to concurrently satisfy in online UAV trajectory designs for real-time target tracking, due to the undetermined information. To address this issue, we propose a novel online UAV trajectory optimization approach for the weighted sum-predicted posterior Cram\'er-Rao bound (PCRB) minimization, which guarantees the feasibility of satisfying the two mentioned constraints. Specifically, our approach designs the UAV trajectory by solving two subproblems: the candidate trajectory optimization problem and the energy-aware backup trajectory optimization problem. Then, an efficient solution to the candidate trajectory optimization problem is proposed based on Dinkelbach's transform and the Lasserre hierarchy, which achieves the global optimal solution under a given sufficient condition. The energy-aware backup trajectory optimization problem is solved by the successive convex approximation method. Numerical results show that our proposed UAV trajectory optimization approach significantly outperforms the benchmark regarding sensing performance and energy utilization flexibility.</description>

      <title>Optimal Control for Clutched-Elastic Robots: A Contact-Implicit Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intrinsically elastic robots surpass their rigid counterparts in a range of different characteristics. By temporarily storing potential energy and subsequently converting it to kinetic energy, elastic robots are capable of highly dynamic motions even with limited motor power. However, the time-dependency of this energy storage and release mechanism remains one of the major challenges in controlling elastic robots. A possible remedy is the introduction of locking elements (i.e. clutches and brakes) in the drive train. This gives rise to a new class of robots, so-called clutched-elastic robots (CER), with which it is possible to precisely control the energy-transfer timing. A prevalent challenge in the realm of CERs is the automatic discovery of clutch sequences. Due to complexity, many methods still rely on pre-defined modes. In this paper, we introduce a novel contact-implicit scheme designed to optimize both control input and clutch sequence simultaneously. A penalty in the objective function ensures the prevention of unnecessary clutch transitions. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method on a double pendulum equipped with two of our newly proposed clutch-based Bi-Stiffness Actuators (BSA).</description>

      <title>Distilling Tiny and Ultra-fast Deep Neural Networks for Autonomous Navigation on Nano-UAVs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nano-sized unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are ideal candidates for flying Internet-of-Things smart sensors to collect information in narrow spaces. This requires ultra-fast navigation under very tight memory/computation constraints. The PULP-Dronet convolutional neural network (CNN) enables autonomous navigation running aboard a nano-UAV at 19 frame/s, at the cost of a large memory footprint of 320 kB -- and with drone control in complex scenarios hindered by the disjoint training of collision avoidance and steering capabilities. In this work, we distill a novel family of CNNs with better capabilities than PULP-Dronet, but memory footprint reduced by up to 168x (down to 2.9 kB), achieving an inference rate of up to 139 frame/s; we collect a new open-source unified collision/steering 66 k images dataset for more robust navigation; and we perform a thorough in-field analysis of both PULP-Dronet and our tiny CNNs running on a commercially available nano-UAV. Our tiniest CNN, called Tiny-PULP-Dronet v3, navigates with a 100% success rate a challenging and never-seen-before path, composed of a narrow obstacle-populated corridor and a 180{\deg} turn, at a maximum target speed of 0.5 m/s. In the same scenario, the SoA PULP-Dronet consistently fails despite having 168x more parameters.</description>

      <title>UAV-Assisted Space-Air-Ground Integrated Networks: A Technical Review of Recent Learning Algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.14931v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent technological advancements in space, air, and ground components have made possible a new network paradigm called space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN). Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) play a key role in SAGINs. However, due to UAVs' high dynamics and complexity, real-world deployment of a SAGIN becomes a significant barrier to realizing such SAGINs. UAVs are expected to meet key performance requirements with limited maneuverability and resources with space and terrestrial components. Therefore, employing UAVs in various usage scenarios requires well-designed planning in algorithmic approaches. This paper provides an essential review and analysis of recent learning algorithms in a UAV-assisted SAGIN. We consider possible reward functions and discuss the state-of-the-art algorithms for optimizing the reward functions, including Q-learning, deep Q-learning, multi-armed bandit, particle swarm optimization, and satisfaction-based learning algorithms. Unlike other survey papers, we focus on the methodological perspective of the optimization problem, applicable to various missions on a SAGIN. We consider real-world configurations and the 2-dimensional (2D) and 3-dimensional (3D) UAV trajectories to reflect deployment cases. Our simulations suggest the 3D satisfaction-based learning algorithm outperforms other approaches in most cases. With open challenges discussed at the end, we aim to provide design and deployment guidelines for UAV-assisted SAGINs.</description>

Abstract: Structural global parameter identifiability indicates whether one can determine a parameter's value in an ODE model from given inputs and outputs. If a given model has parameters for which there is exactly one value, such parameters are called globally identifiable. Given an ODE model involving not globally identifiable parameters, first we transform the system into one with locally identifiable parameters. As a main contribution of this paper, then we present a procedure for replacing, if possible, the ODE model with an equivalent one that has globally identifiable parameters. We first derive this as an algorithm for one-dimensional ODE models and then reuse this approach for higher-dimensional models.</description>

      <title>Learning-assisted Stochastic Capacity Expansion Planning: A Bayesian Optimization Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10451v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solving large-scale capacity expansion problems (CEPs) is central to cost-effective decarbonization of regional-scale energy systems. To ensure the intended outcomes of CEPs, modeling uncertainty due to weather-dependent variable renewable energy (VRE) supply and energy demand becomes crucially important. However, the resulting stochastic optimization models are often less computationally tractable than their deterministic counterparts. Here, we propose a learning-assisted approximate solution method to tractably solve two-stage stochastic CEPs. Our method identifies low-cost planning decisions by constructing and solving a sequence of tractable temporally aggregated surrogate problems. We adopt a Bayesian optimization approach to searching the space of time series aggregation hyperparameters and compute approximate solutions that minimize costs on a validation set of supply-demand projections. Importantly, we evaluate solved planning outcomes on a held-out set of test projections. We apply our approach to generation and transmission expansion planning for a joint power-gas system spanning New England. We show that our approach yields an estimated cost savings of up to 3.8% in comparison to benchmark time series aggregation approaches.</description>

      <title>An L-BFGS-B approach for linear and nonlinear system identification under $\ell_1$- and group-Lasso regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03827v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a very efficient numerical method based on the L-BFGS-B algorithm for identifying linear and nonlinear discrete-time state-space models, possibly under $\ell_1$- and group-Lasso regularization for reducing model complexity. For the identification of linear models, we show that, compared to classical linear subspace methods, the approach often provides better results, is much more general in terms of the loss and regularization terms used (such as penalties for enforcing system stability), and is also more stable from a numerical point of view. The proposed method not only enriches the existing set of linear system identification tools but can also be applied to identifying a very broad class of parametric nonlinear state-space models, including recurrent neural networks. We illustrate the approach on synthetic and experimental datasets and apply it to solve a challenging industrial robot benchmark for nonlinear multi-input/multi-output system identification. A Python implementation of the proposed identification method is available in the package jax-sysid, available at https://github.com/bemporad/jax-sysid.</description>

      <title>Implementation of soft-constrained MPC for Tracking using its semi-banded problem structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04601v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a popular control approach due to its ability to consider constraints, including input and state restrictions, while minimizing a cost function. However, in practice, these constraints can result in feasibility issues, either because the system model is not accurate or due to the existence of external disturbances. To mitigate this problem, a solution adopted by the MPC community is the use of soft constraints. In this article, we consider a not-so-typical methodology to encode soft constraints in a particular MPC formulation known as MPC for Tracking (MPCT), which has several advantages when compared to standard MPC formulations. The motivation behind the proposed encoding is to maintain the semi-banded structure of the ingredients of a recently proposed solver for the considered MPCT formulation, thus providing an efficient and fast solver when compared to alternative approaches from the literature. We show numerical results highlighting the benefits of the formulation and the computational efficiency of the solver.</description>

      <title>On the Solution Uniqueness of Data-Driven Modeling of Flexible Loads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15029v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This letter first explores the solution uniqueness of the data-driven modeling of price-responsive flexible loads (PFL). The PFL on the demand side is critical in modern power systems. An accurate PFL model is fundamental for system operations. Yet, whether the PFL model can be uniquely and correctly identified from operational data remains unclear. To address this, we analyze the structural and practical identifiability of the PFL model, deriving the condition for the solution unique-ness. Besides, we point out the practical implications of the results. Numerical tests validate this work.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Online Model Update Algorithm for Predictive Control in Networked Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00637v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we introduce an adaptive online model update algorithm designed for predictive control applications in networked systems, particularly focusing on power distribution systems. Unlike traditional methods that depend on historical data for offline model identification, our approach utilizes real-time data for continuous model updates. This method integrates seamlessly with existing online control and optimization algorithms and provides timely updates in response to real-time changes. This methodology offers significant advantages, including a reduction in the communication network bandwidth requirements by minimizing the data exchanged at each iteration and enabling the model to adapt after disturbances. Furthermore, our algorithm is tailored for non-linear convex models, enhancing its applicability to practical scenarios. The efficacy of the proposed method is validated through a numerical study, demonstrating improved control performance using a synthetic IEEE test case.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Model Predictive Control for Autonomous Vehicle Steering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08401v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the development of autonomous driving technology, there are increasing demands for vehicle control, and MPC has become a widely researched topic in both industry and academia. Existing MPC control methods based on vehicle kinematics or dynamics have challenges such as difficult modeling, numerous parameters, strong nonlinearity, and high computational cost. To address these issues, this paper proposes a Data-Driven MPC control method for autonomous vehicle steering. This method avoids the need for complex vehicle system modeling and achieves trajectory tracking with relatively low computational time and small errors. We validate the control effectiveness of our algorithm in specific scenario through CarSim-Simulink simulation and perform comparative analysis with PID and vehicle kinematics MPC, confirming the feasibility and superiority of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Euclidean and non-Euclidean Trajectory Optimization Approaches for Quadrotor Racing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.07262v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present two quadrotor raceline optimization approaches which differ in using Euclidean or non-Euclidean geometry to describe vehicle position. Both approaches use high-fidelity quadrotor dynamics and avoid the need to approximate gates using waypoints. We demonstrate both approaches on simulated racetracks with realistic vehicle parameters where we demonstrate 100x faster compute time than comparable published methods and improved solver convergence. We then extend the non-Euclidean approach to compute racelines in the presence of numerous static obstacles.</description>

      <title>A Novel Center-of-Mass Displacing Aerial Manipulation Platform: Design, Modeling, and Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01110v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Aerial manipulators can serve contact-based industrial applications, where fundamental tasks like drilling and grinding often necessitate aerial platforms to handle heavy tools and high loads (i.e., forces and torques). These tasks are frequently performed on non-horizontal surfaces. Current multirotor platforms, which have a fixed CoM (Center of Mass) within the rotor-defined area, typically exhibit a large moment arm between the EE (End-Effector) tip and the system's CoM. This configuration can result in instability and potential damage during physical interactions. In this letter, we present the system design, modeling, and control of a novel aerial vehicle tailored to tool manipulation on non-horizontal surfaces. This platform adapts the form of an H-shaped coaxial octocopter with tiltable back rotors; it can carry heavy components (e.g., the manipulator and battery) on a movable plate within the rotor-defined area during free flight. When interacting with surfaces, the platform actively shifts the plate toward the work surface while preserving the system orientation thanks to the tiltable back rotors. This leads to a displaced CoM location and a reduced moment arm. We use simulations that closely capture the built physical prototype to validate our proposed concepts for complex and risky working scenarios. Moreover, early-stage physical experiments were conducted to evaluate the developed system for free flights and a pushing task.</description>

      <title>A Modular Pragmatic Architecture for Multiuser MIMO with Array-Fed RIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00572v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a power- and hardware-efficient, pragmatic, modular, multiuser/multibeam array-fed RIS architecture particularly suited to operate in very high frequency bands (high mmWave and sub-THz), where channels are typically sparse in the beamspace and line-of-sight (LOS) is required to achieve an acceptable received signal level. The key module is an active multi-antenna feeder (AMAF) with a small number of active antennas placed in the near field of a RIS with a much larger number of passive controllable reflecting elements. We propose a pragmatic approach to obtain a steerable beam with high gain and very low sidelobes. Then, $K$ independently controlled beams can be achieved by stacking $K$ of such AMAF-RIS modules. Our analysis takes in full account: 1) the near-end crosstalk (NEXT) between the modules, 2) the far-end crosstalk (FEXT) due to the sidelobes; 3) a thorough energy efficiency comparison with respect to conventional {\em active arrays} with the same beamforming performance. Overall, we show that the proposed architecture is very attractive in terms of spectral efficiency, ease of implementation (hardware complexity), and energy efficiency.</description>

      <title>Mobius Transformation-Based Circular Motion Control for Unicycle Robots in Nonconcentric Circular Geofences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06989v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonuniform motion constraints are ubiquitous in robotic applications. Geofencing control is one such paradigm where the motion of a robot must be constrained within a predefined boundary. This paper addresses the problem of stabilizing a unicycle robot around a desired circular orbit while confining its motion within a nonconcentric external circular boundary. Our solution approach relies on the concept of the so-called Mobius transformation that, under certain practical conditions, maps two nonconcentric circles to a pair of concentric circles, and hence, results in uniform spatial motion constraints. The choice of such a Mobius transformation is governed by the roots of a quadratic equation in the post-design analysis that decides how the regions enclosed by the two circles are mapped onto the two planes. We show that the problem can be formulated either as a trajectory-constraining problem or an obstacle-avoidance problem in the transformed plane, depending on these roots. Exploiting the idea of the barrier Lyapunov function, we propose a unique control law that solves both these contrasting problems in the transformed plane and renders a solution to the original problem in the actual plane. By relating parameters of two planes under Mobius transformation and its inverse map, we further establish a connection between the control laws in two planes and determine the control law to be applied in the actual plane. Simulation and experimental results are provided to illustrate the key theoretical developments.</description>

      <title>Combining Federated Learning and Control: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11069v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This survey provides an overview of combining Federated Learning (FL) and control to enhance adaptability, scalability, generalization, and privacy in (nonlinear) control applications. Traditional control methods rely on controller design models, but real-world scenarios often require online model retuning or learning. FL offers a distributed approach to model training, enabling collaborative learning across distributed devices while preserving data privacy. By keeping data localized, FL mitigates concerns regarding privacy and security while reducing network bandwidth requirements for communication. This survey summarizes the state-of-the-art concepts and ideas of combining FL and control. The methodical benefits are further discussed, culminating in a detailed overview of expected applications, from dynamical system modeling over controller design, focusing on adaptive control, to knowledge transfer in multi-agent decision-making systems.</description>
