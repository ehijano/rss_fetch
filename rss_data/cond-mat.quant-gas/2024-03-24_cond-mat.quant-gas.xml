      <title>Closed-channel parameters of Feshbach resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the work of Phys. Rev. A 100, 042710 (2019), it was argued that the general description of two-body Feshbach resonances requires "closed-channel parameters" related to the bare bound state causing the resonance. The present work shows that once the resonance theory is renormalised (i.e. its parameters are expressed in terms of physical observables) the dependence of two-body observables on the closed-channel parameters disappears when the inter-channel coupling is localised in a region where the wave functions are energy independent. In such a regime, the resulting quantum defect theory is surprisingly independent of the bare bound state energy. This result highlights a qualitative difference between resonances in this regime, such as magnetic resonances in ultracold atoms, and other kinds of resonances, such as hadron resonances. Although the closed-channel parameters of magnetic resonances do not affect two-body observables, it is suggested that they could be evidenced experimentally from short-distance probing and three-body observables.</description>

      <title>Atom Number Fluctuations in Bose Gases -- Statistical analysis of parameter estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The investigation of the fluctuations in interacting quantum systems at finite temperatures showcases the ongoing challenges in understanding complex quantum systems. Recently, atom number fluctuations in weakly interacting Bose-Einstein condensates were observed, motivating an investigation of the thermal component of partially condensed Bose gases. Here, we present a combined analysis of both components, revealing the presence of fluctuations in the thermal component. This analysis includes a comprehensive statistical evaluation of uncertainties in the preparation and parameter estimation of partially condensed Bose gases. Using Monte Carlo simulations of optical density profiles, we estimate the noise contributions to the atom number and temperature estimation of the condensed and thermal cloud, which is generally applicable in the field of ultracold atoms. Furthermore, we investigate the specific noise contributions in the analysis of atom number fluctuations and show that preparation noise in the total atom number leads to an important technical noise contribution. Subtracting all known noise contributions from the variance of the atom number in the BEC and thermal component allows us to improve the estimate of the fundamental peak fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Spread complexity and dynamical transition in two-mode Bose-Einstein condensations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the spread complexity in two-mode Bose-Einstein condensations and unveil that the long-time average of the spread complexity $\overline{C}_{K}$ can probe the dynamical transition from self-trapping to Josephson oscillation. When the parameter $\omega$ increases over a critical value $\omega_c$, we reveal that the spread complexity exhibits a sharp transition from lower to higher value, with the corresponding phase space trajectory changing from self-trapping to Josephson oscillation. Moreover, we scrutinize the eigen-spectrum and uncover the relation between the dynamical transition and the excited state quantum phase transition, which is characterized by the emergence of singularity in the density of states at critical energy $E_{c}$. In the thermodynamical limit, the cross point of $E_{c}(\omega)$ and the initial energy $E_{0}(\omega)$ determines the dynamical transition point $\omega_c$. Finally, we show that the different dynamical behavior for the initial state at a fixed point can be distinguished by the long-time average of the spread complexity, when the fixed point changes from unstable to stable.</description>

      <title>Quantum nonlinear optics on the edge of small lattice fractional quantum Hall fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10598v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the quantum dynamics of the edge modes of lattice fractional quantum Hall liquids in response to time-dependent external potentials. We show that the nonlinear chiral Luttinger liquid theory provides a quantitatively accurate description even for the small lattice geometries away from the continuum limit that are available in state-of-the-art experiments. Experimentally accessible signatures of the quantized value of the bulk transverse Hall conductivity are identified both in the linear and the non-linear response to an external excitation. The strong nonlinearity induced by the open boundaries is responsible for sizable quantum blockade effects, leading to the generation of nonclassical states of the edge modes.</description>

      <title>Contact interactions, self-adjoint extensions, and low-energy scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-energy scattering is well described by the effective-range expansion. In quantum mechanics, a tower of contact interactions can generate terms in this expansion after renormalization. Scattering parameters are also encoded in the self-adjoint extension of the Hamiltonian. We briefly review this well-known result for two particles with s-wave interactions using impenetrable self-adjoint extensions, including the case of harmonically trapped two-particle states. By contrast, the one-dimensional scattering problem is surprisingly intricate. We show that the families of self-adjoint extensions correspond to a coupled system of symmetric and antisymmetric outgoing waves, which is diagonalized by an SU(2) transformation that accounts for mixing and a relative phase. This is corroborated by an effective theory computation that includes all four energy-independent contact interactions. The equivalence of various one-dimensional contact interactions is discussed and scrutinized from the perspective of renormalization. As an application, the spectrum of a general point interaction with a harmonic trap is solved in one dimension.</description>

      <title>Mott insulating states of the anisotropic SU(4) Dirac fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.11791</link>
      <description>arXiv:1912.11791v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We employ the large-scale quantum Monte-Carlo simulations to investigate the Mott-insulating states of the half-filled SU(4) Hubbard model on the square lattice with a staggered-flux pattern. The noninteracting band structure that evolves from a nested Fermi surface at zero flux to isotropic Dirac cones at $\pi$ flux, exhibits anisotropic Dirac cones as the flux varies in between. Our simulations show transitions between the three phases of Dirac semimetal, antiferromagnet and valence-bond solid. A direct continuous transition between the antiferromagnetic phase and the valence-bond-solid phase is realized via varying the flux in the Mott regime. The simulated critical exponents remarkably agree with those of SU(4) $J$-$Q$ model. Inside the valence-bond-solid phase induced by the flux, the plaquette valence-bond state with vanishing single-particle gap is identified. At strong coupling, the valence-bond-solid phase disappears and the Mott-insulating state is always accompanied by antiferromagnetic ordering, regardless of the magnitude of the flux.</description>

      <title>Weakly interacting Bose gas with two-body losses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.10427v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the many-body dynamics of weakly interacting Bose gases with two-particle losses. We show that both the two-body interactions and losses in atomic gases may be tuned by controlling the inelastic scattering process between atoms by an optical Feshbach resonance. Interestingly, the low-energy behavior of the scattering amplitude is governed by a single parameter, i.e. the complex $s$-wave scattering length $a_c$. The many-body dynamics are thus described by a Lindblad master equation with complex scattering length. We solve this equation by applying the Bogoliubov approximation in analogy to the closed systems. Various peculiar dynamical properties are discovered, some of them may be regarded as the dissipative counterparts of the celebrated results in closed Bose gases. For example, we show that the next-order correction to the mean-field particle decay rate is to the order of $|n a_c^{3}|^{1/2}$, which is an analogy of the Lee-Huang-Yang correction of Bose gases. It is also found that there exists a dynamical symmetry of symplectic group Sp$(4,\mathbb{C})$ in the quadratic Bogoliubov master equation, which is an analogy of the SU(1,1) dynamical symmetry of the corresponding closed system. We further confirmed the validity of the Bogoliubov approximation by comparing its results with a full numerical calculation in a double-well toy model. Generalizations of other alternative approaches such as the dissipative version of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation and hydrodynamic theory are also discussed in the last.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Quantum Otto Engine Performance in Generalized External Potential on Bose-Einstein Condensation Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.01805v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine a quantum Otto engine using both Bose-Einstein Condensation (BEC) and normal Bose gas as working medium trapped in generalized external potential. We treated the engine quasi-statically and endoreversibly. Since the expansion and compression in both quasi-static and endoreversible take place isentropic, the expression of efficiency is similar. However, the power output in the quasi-static cycle is zero due to infinite and long stroke time. In contrast, with an endoreversible cycle, thermalization with two reservoirs takes place at a finite time. We use Fourier's law in conduction to formulate the relation between temperature of medium and reservoir, making work depend on heating and cooling stroke time. Moreover, we maximized the power with respect to compression ratio $\kappa$ to obtain efficiency at maximum power (EMP). We found that EMP is significantly higher when using BEC as a working medium, meanwhile EMP with normal Bose gas is just Curzon-Ahlborn efficiency. We also investigate the effect of thermal contact time $\tau$ with hot $(\tau_{h})$ and cold $(\tau_{l})$ reservoir on EMP. We found that when complete thermalization, $\tau_{h}=\tau_{l}$, stroke time occurs, there are no significant differences. Nevertheless, while incomplete thermalization arise, by adjusting various cooling and heating stroke time, provides a significant result on EMP, which is much higher at $\tau_{h}&lt;\tau_{l}$ stroke time whilst lower at $\tau_{h}&gt;\tau_{l}$ stroke time. We conclude this incomplete thermalization leads to the condition where residual coherence emerges which enhances the EMP of the engine.</description>

      <title>Effective light cone and digital quantum simulation of interacting bosons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.14736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.14736v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The speed limit of information propagation is one of the most fundamental features in non-equilibrium physics. The region of information propagation by finite-time dynamics is approximately restricted inside the effective light cone that is formulated by the Lieb-Robinson bound. To date, extensive studies have been conducted to identify the shape of effective light cones in most experimentally relevant many-body systems. However, the Lieb-Robinson bound in the interacting boson systems, one of the most ubiquitous quantum systems in nature, has remained a critical open problem for a long time. This study reveals a tight effective light cone to limit the information propagation in interacting bosons, where the shape of the effective light cone depends on the spatial dimension. To achieve it, we prove that the speed for bosons to clump together is finite, which in turn leads to the error guarantee of the boson number truncation at each site. Furthermore, we applied the method to provide a provably efficient algorithm for simulating the interacting boson systems. The results of this study settle the notoriously challenging problem and provide the foundation for elucidating the complexity of many-body boson systems.</description>

Abstract: Eigenvector continuation is a computational method for parametric eigenvalue problems that uses subspace projection with a basis derived from eigenvector snapshots from different parameter sets. It is part of a broader class of subspace-projection techniques called reduced-basis methods. In this colloquium article, we present the development, theory, and applications of eigenvector continuation and projection-based emulators. We introduce the basic concepts, discuss the underlying theory and convergence properties, and present recent applications for quantum systems and future prospects.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous symmetry breaking in spontaneous Floquet states: Floquet-Nambu-Goldstone modes, Floquet thermodynamics, and the time operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10784v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study simultaneous symmetry-breaking in a spontaneous Floquet state, focusing on the specific case of an atomic condensate. We first describe the quantization of the Nambu-Goldstone (NG) modes for a stationary state simultaneously breaking several symmetries of the Hamiltonian by invoking the generalized Gibbs ensemble, which enables a thermodynamical description of the problem. The quantization procedure involves a Berry-Gibbs connection, which depends on the macroscopic conserved charges associated to each broken symmetry and is not invariant under generalized gauge transformations. We extend the formalism to Floquet states simultaneously breaking several symmetries, finding that Goldstone theorem translates into the emergence of Floquet-Nambu-Goldstone (FNG) modes with zero quasi-energy. In the case of a spontaneous Floquet state, there is a genuine temporal FNG mode arising from the continuous time-translation symmetry breaking, whose quantum amplitude provides a rare realization of a time operator in Quantum Mechanics. Furthermore, since they conserve energy, spontaneous Floquet states can be shown to possess a conserved Floquet charge. Nevertheless, these also admit a thermodynamic description in terms of the Floquet enthalpy, the Legendre transform of the energy with respect to the Floquet charge. We apply our formalism to a particular realization of spontaneous Floquet state, the CES state, which breaks $U(1)$ and time-translation symmetries, representing a time supersolid. Using the Truncated Wigner method, we numerically compute its quantum fluctuations, which are theoretically predicted to be dominated by the temporal FNG mode at long times, observing a remarkable agreement between simulation and theory. Based on these results, we propose a feasible experimental scheme to observe the temporal FNG mode of the CES state.</description>
