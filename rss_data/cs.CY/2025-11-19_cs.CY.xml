      <title>Modeling Fairness in Recruitment AI via Information Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Avoiding bias and understanding the real-world consequences of AI-supported decision-making are critical to address fairness and assign accountability. Existing approaches often focus either on technical aspects, such as datasets and models, or on high-level socio-ethical considerations - rarely capturing how these elements interact in practice. In this paper, we apply an information flow-based modeling framework to a real-world recruitment process that integrates automated candidate matching with human decision-making. Through semi-structured stakeholder interviews and iterative modeling, we construct a multi-level representation of the recruitment pipeline, capturing how information is transformed, filtered, and interpreted across both algorithmic and human components. We identify where biases may emerge, how they can propagate through the system, and what downstream impacts they may have on candidates. This case study illustrates how information flow modeling can support structured analysis of fairness risks, providing transparency across complex socio-technical systems.</description>

      <title>GAEA: Experiences and Lessons Learned from a Country-Scale Environmental Digital Twin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper describes the experiences and lessons learned after the deployment of a country-scale environmental digital twin on the island of Cyprus for three years. This digital twin, called GAEA, contains 27 environmental geospatial services and is suitable for urban planners, policymakers, farmers, property owners, real-estate and forestry professionals, as well as insurance companies and banks that have properties in their portfolio. This paper demonstrates the power, potential, current and future challenges of geospatial analytics and environmental digital twins on a large scale.</description>

      <title>Introducing AI to an Online Petition Platform Changed Outputs but not Outcomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid integration of AI writing tools into online platforms raises critical questions about their impact on content production and outcomes. We leverage a unique natural experiment on Change.org, a leading social advocacy platform, to causally investigate the effects of an in-platform ''write with AI'' tool. To understand the impact of the AI integration, we collected 1.5 million petitions and employed a difference-in-differences analysis. Our findings reveal that in-platform AI access significantly altered the lexical features of petitions and increased petition homogeneity, but did not improve petition outcomes. We confirmed the results in a separate analysis of repeat petition writers who wrote petitions before and after introduction of the AI tool. The results suggest that while AI writing tools can profoundly reshape online content, their practical utility for improving desired outcomes may be less beneficial than anticipated, and introduce unintended consequences like content homogenization.</description>

      <title>Can Artificial Intelligence Accelerate Technological Progress? Researchers' Perspectives on AI in Manufacturing and Materials Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) raises expectations of substantial increases in rates of technological and scientific progress, but such anticipations are often not connected to detailed ground-level studies of AI use in innovation processes. Accordingly, it remains unclear how and to what extent AI can accelerate innovation. To help to fill this gap, we report results from 32 interviews with U.S.-based academic manufacturing and materials sciences researchers experienced with AI and machine learning (ML) techniques. Interviewees primarily used AI for modeling of materials and manufacturing processes, facilitating cheaper and more rapid search of design spaces for materials and manufacturing processes alike. They report benefits including cost, time, and computation savings in technology development. However, interviewees also report that AI/ML tools are unreliable outside design spaces for which dense data are already available; that they require skilled and judicious application in tandem with older research techniques; and that AI/ML tools may detrimentally circumvent opportunities for disruptive theoretical advancement. Based on these results, we suggest there is reason for optimism about acceleration in sustaining innovations through the use of to AI/ML; but that support for conventional empirical, computational, and theoretical research is required to maintain the likelihood of further major advances in manufacturing and materials science.</description>

      <title>DiverseClaire: Simulating Students to Improve Introductory Programming Course Materials for All CS1 Learners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although CS programs are booming, introductory courses like CS1 still adopt a one-size-fits-all formats that can exacerbate cognitive load and discourage learners with autism, ADHD, dyslexia and other neurological conditions. These call for compassionate pedagogies and Universal Design For Learning (UDL) to create learning environments and materials where cognitive diversity is welcomed. To address this, we introduce DiverseClaire a pilot study, which simulates students including neurodiverse profiles using LLMs and diverse personas. By leveraging Bloom's Taxonomy and UDL, DiverseClaire compared UDL-transformed lecture slides with traditional formats. To evaluate DiverseClaire controlled experiments, we used the evaluation metric the average score. The findings revealed that the simulated neurodiverse students struggled with learning due to lecture slides that were in inaccessible formats. These results highlight the need to provide course materials in multiple formats for diverse learner preferences. Data from our pilot study will be made available to assist future CS1 instructors.</description>

      <title>CAPIRE: Modelling the Impact of Teacher Strikes and Inflation on Student Trajectories in Engineering Education</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study extends the CAPIRE framework with a macro-shock module to analyse the impact of teacher strikes and inflation on student trajectories in engineering education. Using data from 1,343 students across 15 cohorts (2004-2019) in a public engineering faculty in Argentina, we construct a leak-aware, multilevel feature set that incorporates national inflation indicators, lagged exposure to teacher strikes, and interaction terms between macro shocks and curriculum friction. Random Forest models with cohort-based validation demonstrate that macro features provide stable, non-trivial gains in early-semester dropout prediction (improvement in Macro F1 from 0.73 to 0.78), with inflation volatility at entry and a strike-weighted basic-cycle friction index amongst the most influential variables. Lag analysis reveals that strike exposure exerts its strongest association with dropout two to three semesters after the disruption (OR = 2.34), and that effects are concentrated in early, high-friction semesters. We then embed these empirical patterns into an agent-based model, defining scenarios for inflation-only, strikes-only, and combined crisis. Simulations reproduce three stylised facts: delayed strike effects, basic-cycle vulnerability, and non-linear amplification when inflation and strikes co-occur, with combined shocks generating dropout levels 18-23% higher than the sum of individual effects. We argue that teacher strikes and inflation operate as structurally mediated educational disruptors, acting through curriculum design and financial resilience rather than as isolated events. The framework contributes to multilevel dropout theory by demonstrating how macro-level shocks propagate through institutional structures to shape individual trajectories and provides empirically grounded tools for scenario planning in macroeconomically unstable contexts.</description>

      <title>When AI Democratizes Exploitation: LLM-Assisted Strategic Manipulation of Fair Division Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fair resource division algorithms, like those implemented in Spliddit platform, have traditionally been considered difficult for the end users to manipulate due to its complexities. This paper demonstrates how Large Language Models (LLMs) can dismantle these protective barriers by democratizing access to strategic expertise. Through empirical analysis of rent division scenarios on Spliddit algorithms, we show that users can obtain actionable manipulation strategies via simple conversational queries to AI assistants. We present four distinct manipulation scenarios: exclusionary collusion where majorities exploit minorities, defensive counterstrategies that backfire, benevolent subsidization of specific participants, and cost minimization coalitions. Our experiments reveal that LLMs can explain algorithmic mechanics, identify profitable deviations, and generate specific numerical inputs for coordinated preference misreporting--capabilities previously requiring deep technical knowledge. These findings extend algorithmic collective action theory from classification contexts to resource allocation scenarios, where coordinated preference manipulation replaces feature manipulation. The implications reach beyond rent division to any domain using algorithmic fairness mechanisms for resource division. While AI-enabled manipulation poses risks to system integrity, it also creates opportunities for preferential treatment of equity deserving groups. We argue that effective responses must combine algorithmic robustness, participatory design, and equitable access to AI capabilities, acknowledging that strategic sophistication is no longer a scarce resource.</description>

      <title>Can LLMs Create Legally Relevant Summaries and Analyses of Videos?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the legally relevant factual basis of an event and conveying it through text is a key skill of legal professionals. This skill is important for preparing forms (e.g., insurance claims) or other legal documents (e.g., court claims), but often presents a challenge for laypeople. Current AI approaches aim to bridge this gap, but mostly rely on the user to articulate what has happened in text, which may be challenging for many. Here, we investigate the capability of large language models (LLMs) to understand and summarize events occurring in videos. We ask an LLM to summarize and draft legal letters, based on 120 YouTube videos showing legal issues in various domains. Overall, 71.7\% of the summaries were rated as of high or medium quality, which is a promising result, opening the door to a number of applications in e.g. access to justice.</description>

      <title>Human-Centered Threat Modeling in Practice: Lessons, Challenges, and Paths Forward</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human-centered threat modeling (HCTM) is an emerging area within security and privacy research that focuses on how people define and navigate threats in various social, cultural, and technological contexts. While researchers increasingly approach threat modeling from a human-centered perspective, little is known about how they prepare for and engage with HCTM in practice. In this work, we conduct 23 semi-structured interviews with researchers to examine the state of HCTM, including how researchers design studies, elicit threats, and navigate values, constraints, and long-term goals. We find that HCTM is not a prescriptive process but a set of evolving practices shaped by relationships with participants, disciplinary backgrounds, and institutional structures. Researchers approach threat modeling through sustained groundwork and participant-centered inquiry, guided by values such as care, justice, and autonomy. They also face challenges including emotional strain, ethical dilemmas, and structural barriers that complicate efforts to translate findings into real-world impact. We conclude by identifying opportunities to advance HCTM through shared infrastructure, broader recognition of diverse contributions, and stronger mechanisms for translating findings into policy, design, and societal change.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Study of Implicit and Explicit Biases in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) inherit explicit and implicit biases from their training datasets. Identifying and mitigating biases in LLMs is crucial to ensure fair outputs, as they can perpetuate harmful stereotypes and misinformation. This study highlights the need to address biases in LLMs amid growing generative AI. We studied bias-specific benchmarks such as StereoSet and CrowSPairs to evaluate the existence of various biases in multiple generative models such as BERT and GPT 3.5. We proposed an automated Bias-Identification Framework to recognize various social biases in LLMs such as gender, race, profession, and religion. We adopted a two-pronged approach to detect explicit and implicit biases in text data. Results indicated fine-tuned models struggle with gender biases but excelled at identifying and avoiding racial biases. Our findings illustrated that despite having some success, LLMs often over-relied on keywords. To illuminate the capability of the analyzed LLMs in detecting implicit biases, we employed Bag-of-Words analysis and unveiled indications of implicit stereotyping within the vocabulary. To bolster the model performance, we applied an enhancement strategy involving fine-tuning models using prompting techniques and data augmentation of the bias benchmarks. The fine-tuned models exhibited promising adaptability during cross-dataset testing and significantly enhanced performance on implicit bias benchmarks, with performance gains of up to 20%.</description>

      <title>A Longitudinal Study on the Attitudes of Gay Men in Beijing Towards Gay Social Media Platforms: Lonely Souls in the Digital Concrete Jungle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the past decade, specialized social networking applications have become a cornerstone of life for many gay men in China. This paper employs a longitudinal mixed-methods approach to investigate how Chinese men who have sex with men (MSM) have shifted their attitudes toward these platforms between approximately 2013 and 2023. Drawing on archival analysis of online discourses, a quantitative survey of 412 participants, and in-depth semi-structured interviews with 32 participants, we trace the complex trajectory of this evolution. Our findings reveal a clear pattern: from the initial embrace of these applications as revolutionary tools for community building and identity affirmation (2014--2017), to a period of growing ambivalence and critique centered on commercialization, ``hookup culture,'' and multiple forms of discrimination (2017--2020), and finally to the present era (2020--2023), characterized by pragmatic, fragmented, yet simultaneously critical and reconstructive uses. Today, users strategically employ a repertoire of applications -- including global platforms (e.g., Grindr and Tinder), domestic mainstream platforms (e.g., Blued), and niche alternatives (e.g., Aloha) -- to fulfill differentiated needs. We develop a detailed temporal framework to capture this attitudinal evolution and discuss its design implications for creating more supportive, secure, and community-oriented digital environments for marginalized groups.</description>

      <title>Report on the Scoping Workshop on AI in Science Education Research 2025</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14318v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This report summarizes the outcomes of a two-day international scoping workshop on the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in science education research. As AI rapidly reshapes scientific practice, classroom learning, and research methods, the field faces both new opportunities and significant challenges. The report clarifies key AI concepts to reduce ambiguity and reviews evidence of how AI influences scientific work, teaching practices, and disciplinary learning. It identifies how AI intersects with major areas of science education research, including curriculum development, assessment, epistemic cognition, inclusion, and teacher professional development, highlighting cases where AI can support human reasoning and cases where it may introduce risks to equity or validity. The report also examines how AI is transforming methodological approaches across quantitative, qualitative, ethnographic, and design-based traditions, giving rise to hybrid forms of analysis that combine human and computational strengths. To guide responsible integration, a systems-thinking heuristic is introduced that helps researchers consider stakeholder needs, potential risks, and ethical constraints. The report concludes with actionable recommendations for training, infrastructure, and standards, along with guidance for funders, policymakers, professional organizations, and academic departments. The goal is to support principled and methodologically sound use of AI in science education research.</description>

      <title>Context-aware, Ante-hoc Explanations of Driving Behaviour</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous vehicles (AVs) must be both safe and trustworthy to gain social acceptance and become a viable option for everyday public transportation. Explanations about the system behaviour can increase safety and trust in AVs. Unfortunately, explaining the system behaviour of AI-based driving functions is particularly challenging, as decision-making processes are often opaque. The field of Explainability Engineering tackles this challenge by developing explanation models at design time. These models are designed from system design artefacts and stakeholder needs to develop correct and good explanations. To support this field, we propose an approach that enables context-aware, ante-hoc explanations of (un)expectable driving manoeuvres at runtime. The visual yet formal language Traffic Sequence Charts is used to formalise explanation contexts, as well as corresponding (un)expectable driving manoeuvres. A dedicated runtime monitoring enables context-recognition and ante-hoc presentation of explanations at runtime. In combination, we aim to support the bridging of correct and good explanations. Our method is demonstrated in a simulated overtaking.</description>

      <title>Artificial Intelligence Tools Expand Scientists' Impact but Contract Science's Focus</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07727v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Development in Artificial Intelligence (AI) has accelerated scientific discovery. Alongside recent AI-oriented Nobel prizes, these trends establish the role of AI tools in science. This advancement raises questions about the potential influences of AI tools on scientists and science as a whole, and highlights a potential conflict between individual and collective benefits. To evaluate, we used a pretrained language model to identify AI-augmented research, with an F1-score of 0.875 in validation against expert-labeled data. Using a dataset of 41.3 million research papers across natural science and covering distinct eras of AI, here we show an accelerated adoption of AI tools among scientists and consistent professional advantages associated with AI usage, but a collective narrowing of scientific focus. Scientists who engage in AI-augmented research publish 3.02 times more papers, receive 4.84 times more citations, and become research project leaders 1.37 years earlier than those who do not. By contrast, AI adoption shrinks the collective volume of scientific topics studied by 4.63% and decreases scientist's engagement with one another by 22.00%. Thereby, AI adoption in science presents a seeming paradox -- an expansion of individual scientists' impact but a contraction in collective science's reach -- as AI-augmented work moves collectively toward areas richest in data. With reduced follow-on engagement, AI tools appear to automate established fields rather than explore new ones, highlighting a tension between personal advancement and collective scientific progress.</description>

      <title>A Framework for Developing University Policies on Generative AI Governance: A Cross-national Comparative Study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02636v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As generative AI (GAI) becomes more integrated into higher education, universities are actively exploring its governance and issuing guidelines to promote responsible use, reflecting varied stages of adoption and orientations. This study undertakes a comparative analysis of current GAI guidelines issued by leading universities in the United States, Japan, and China. Based on these findings, the study proposes a University Policy Development Framework for GAI (UPDF-GAI) to provide both theoretical insights and practical guidance for universities in developing and refining their GAI policies. This study adopts five domains from the extended Technology Acceptance Model. A qualitative content analysis of 124 policy documents from 110 universities was conducted, employing thematic coding to synthesize 20 key themes. These domains and themes form the foundation of the UPDF-GAI framework. The analysis reveals varying priorities and focus of GAI policy of universities in different countries. U.S. universities emphasize faculty autonomy, practical application, and policy adaptability, shaped by cutting-edge research and peer collaboration. Japanese universities take a government-regulated approach, prioritizing ethics and risk management, but provide limited support for AI implementation and flexibility. Chinese universities follow a centralized, government-led model, focusing on technology application over early policy development, while actively exploring GAI integration in education and research. The framework facilitates universities in formulating GAI policies by balancing its values and risks, providing multi-level support, proactively responding to societal impacts, and strengthening self-efficacy. In doing so, it enables the development of sustainable and context-sensitive policies that enhance digital competitiveness and advance preparedness for AI-driven education.</description>

      <title>The EU AI Act, Stakeholder Needs, and Explainable AI: Aligning Regulatory Compliance in a Clinical Decision Support System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20311v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) is a promising route to comply with the EU AI Act, the first multinational AI regulation. XAI enhances transparency and human oversight of AI systems, especially ''black-box`` models criticized as incomprehensible. Yet discourse about the AI Act's stakeholders and XAI remains disconnected: XAI increasingly prioritizes end users' needs, while the AI Act focuses on providers' and deployers' obligations. We aim to bridge this divide and offer practical guidance on their relationship. Through interdisciplinary discussion in a cross functional team of XAI, AI Act, legal, and requirements-engineering experts, we outline steps to analyze an AI-based clinical decision support system, clarify end-user needs, and assess AI Act applicability. Using an AI system under development as a case study, we show how XAI techniques can help reconcile stakeholder needs with AI Act requirements and fill gaps between usability and regulatory demands. We compare similarities and differences between legal obligations and end-user needs, identify tensions, and point to concrete design choices and trade-offs. We invite researchers and practitioners in XAI to reflect on their role relative to the AI Act and to develop mutual understanding across disciplines. While XAI can help implement core AI Act principles such as transparency and human oversight, it should be considered one element of a broader compliance strategy that also requires standardization, legal interpretation, documentation, organizational processes, governance, testing, and ongoing monitoring and auditing practices. Our findings yield actionable recommendations for integrating XAI into product development, compliance workflows, and stakeholder communication, informing policy-making and standards development.</description>

      <title>Generative AI for Multiple Choice STEM Assessments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02094v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) technology enables a range of enhancements in computer-aided instruction, from accelerating the creation of teaching materials to customizing learning paths based on learner outcomes. However, ensuring the mathematical accuracy and semantic integrity of generative AI output remains a significant challenge, particularly in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) disciplines. In this study, we explore the use of generative AI in which "hallucinations", typically viewed as undesirable inaccuracies, can instead serve a pedagogical purpose. Specifically, we investigate the generation of plausible but incorrect alternatives for multiple choice assessments, where credible distractors are essential for effective assessment design. We describe the Moebius platform for online instruction, with particular focus on its architecture for handling mathematical elements through specialized semantic packages that support dynamic, parameterized STEM content. We examine methods for crafting prompts that interact effectively with these mathematical semantics to guide the AI in generating high-quality multiple choice distractors. Finally, we demonstrate how this approach reduces the time and effort associated with creating robust teaching materials while maintaining academic rigor and assessment validity.</description>

      <title>Theories of "Sexuality" in Natural Language Processing Bias Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22481v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, significant advancements in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) have positioned commercialized language models as wide-reaching, highly useful tools. In tandem, there has been an explosion of multidisciplinary research examining how NLP tasks reflect, perpetuate, and amplify social biases such as gender and racial bias. A significant gap in this scholarship is a detailed analysis of how queer sexualities are encoded and (mis)represented by both NLP systems and practitioners. Following previous work in the field of AI fairness, we document how sexuality is defined and operationalized via a survey and analysis of 55 articles that quantify sexuality-based NLP bias. We find that sexuality is not clearly defined in a majority of the literature surveyed, indicating a reliance on assumed or normative conceptions of sexual/romantic practices and identities. Further, we find that methods for extracting biased outputs from NLP technologies often conflate gender and sexual identities, leading to monolithic conceptions of queerness and thus improper quantifications of bias. With the goal of improving sexuality-based NLP bias analyses, we conclude with recommendations that encourage more thorough engagement with both queer communities and interdisciplinary literature.</description>

      <title>Embedding Explainable AI in NHS Clinical Safety: The Explainability-Enabled Clinical Safety Framework (ECSF)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11590v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly embedded in NHS workflows, but its probabilistic and adaptive behaviour conflicts with the deterministic assumptions underpinning existing clinical-safety standards. DCB0129 and DCB0160 provide strong governance for conventional software yet do not define how AI-specific transparency, interpretability, or model drift should be evidenced within Safety Cases, Hazard Logs, or post-market monitoring. This paper proposes an Explainability-Enabled Clinical Safety Framework (ECSF) that integrates explainability into the DCB0129/0160 lifecycle, enabling Clinical Safety Officers to use interpretability outputs as structured safety evidence without altering compliance pathways. A cross-regulatory synthesis mapped DCB clauses to principles from Good Machine Learning Practice, the NHS AI Assurance and T.E.S.T. frameworks, and the EU AI Act. The resulting matrix links regulatory clauses, principles, ECSF checkpoints, and suitable explainability outputs. ECSF introduces five checkpoints: global transparency for hazard identification, case-level interpretability for verification, clinician usability for evaluation, traceable decision pathways for risk control, and longitudinal interpretability monitoring for post-market surveillance. Techniques such as SHAP, LIME, Integrated Gradients, saliency mapping, and attention visualisation are mapped to corresponding DCB artefacts. ECSF reframes explainability as a core element of clinical-safety assurance, bridging deterministic risk governance with the probabilistic behaviour of AI and supporting alignment with GMLP, the EU AI Act, and NHS AI Assurance principles.</description>

      <title>Can Machines Think Like Humans? A Behavioral Evaluation of LLM Agents in Dictator Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21359v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents increasingly engage with human society, how well do we understand their prosocial behaviors? We (1) investigate how LLM agents' prosocial behaviors can be induced by different personas and benchmarked against human behaviors; and (2) introduce a social science approach to evaluate LLM agents' decision-making. We explored how different personas and experimental framings affect these AI agents' altruistic behavior in dictator games and compared their behaviors within the same LLM family, across various families, and with human behaviors. The findings reveal that merely assigning a human-like identity to LLMs does not produce human-like behaviors. These findings suggest that LLM agents' reasoning does not consistently exhibit textual markers of human decision-making in dictator games and that their alignment with human behavior varies substantially across model architectures and prompt formulations; even worse, such dependence does not follow a clear pattern. As society increasingly integrates machine intelligence, "Prosocial AI" emerges as a promising and urgent research direction in philanthropic studies.</description>

      <title>MCTSr-Zero: Self-Reflective Psychological Counseling Dialogues Generation via Principles and Adaptive Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23229v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The integration of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with Large Language Models (LLMs) has demonstrated significant success in structured, problem-oriented tasks. However, applying these methods to open-ended dialogues, such as those in psychological counseling, presents unique challenges. Unlike tasks with objective correctness, success in therapeutic conversations depends on subjective factors like empathetic engagement, ethical adherence, and alignment with human preferences, for which strict "correctness" criteria are ill-defined. Existing result-oriented MCTS approaches can therefore produce misaligned responses. To address this, we introduce MCTSr-Zero, an MCTS framework designed for open-ended, human-centric dialogues. Its core innovation is "domain alignment", which shifts the MCTS search objective from predefined end-states towards conversational trajectories that conform to target domain principles (e.g., empathy in counseling). Furthermore, MCTSr-Zero incorporates "Regeneration" and "Meta-Prompt Adaptation" mechanisms to substantially broaden exploration by allowing the MCTS to consider fundamentally different initial dialogue strategies. We evaluate MCTSr-Zero in psychological counseling by generating multi-turn dialogue data, which is used to fine-tune an LLM, PsyLLM. We also introduce PsyEval, a benchmark for assessing multi-turn psychological counseling dialogues. Experiments demonstrate that PsyLLM achieves state-of-the-art performance on PsyEval and other relevant metrics, validating MCTSr-Zero's effectiveness in generating high-quality, principle-aligned conversational data for human-centric domains and addressing the LLM challenge of consistently adhering to complex psychological standards.</description>

      <title>Revisiting (Un)Fairness in Recourse by Minimizing Worst-Case Social Burden</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04128v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning based predictions are increasingly used in sensitive decision-making applications that directly affect our lives. This has led to extensive research into ensuring the fairness of classifiers. Beyond just fair classification, emerging legislation now mandates that when a classifier delivers a negative decision, it must also offer actionable steps an individual can take to reverse that outcome. This concept is known as algorithmic recourse. Nevertheless, many researchers have expressed concerns about the fairness guarantees within the recourse process itself. In this work, we provide a holistic theoretical characterization of unfairness in algorithmic recourse, formally linking fairness guarantees in recourse and classification, and highlighting limitations of the standard equal cost paradigm. We then introduce a novel fairness framework based on social burden, along with a practical algorithm (MISOB), broadly applicable under real-world conditions. Empirical results on real-world datasets show that MISOB reduces the social burden across all groups without compromising overall classifier accuracy.</description>

      <title>Proportionate Cybersecurity for Micro-SMEs: A Governance Design Model under NIS2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02898v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Micro and small enterprises (SMEs) remain structurally vulnerable to cyber threats while facing capacity constraints that make formal compliance burdensome. This article develops a governance design model for proportionate SME cybersecurity, grounded in an awareness-first logic and informed by the EU Squad 2025 experience. Using a qualitative policy-analysis and conceptual policy-design approach, we reconstruct a seven-dimension preventive architecture: awareness and visibility, human behaviour, access control, system hygiene, data protection, detection and response, and continuous review, and justify each dimension's contribution to proportionality and risk reduction. We then map the model's regulatory scope and limits against the NIS2 Directive, Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2024/2690, the Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA), the Cyber Resilience Act (CRA), and the EU Action Plan on Cybersecurity for Hospitals, clarifying which obligations are supported and which require complementary governance (e.g. role accountability, incident timelines, statements of applicability, sector-specific testing and procurement). The analysis argues that raising awareness is the fastest, scalable lever to increase cyber-risk sensitivity in micro-SMEs and complements, rather than replaces, formal compliance. We conclude with policy implications for EU and national programmes seeking practical, proportionate pathways to SME cyber resilience under NIS2.</description>

      <title>Deploying Rapid Damage Assessments from sUAS Imagery for Disaster Response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03132v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the first AI/ML system for automating building damage assessment in uncrewed aerial systems (sUAS) imagery to be deployed operationally during federally declared disasters (Hurricanes Debby and Helene). In response to major disasters, sUAS teams are dispatched to collect imagery of the affected areas to assess damage; however, at recent disasters, teams collectively delivered between 47GB and 369GB of imagery per day, representing more imagery than can reasonably be transmitted or interpreted by subject matter experts in the disaster scene, thus delaying response efforts. To alleviate this data avalanche encountered in practice, computer vision and machine learning techniques are necessary. While prior work has been deployed to automatically assess damage in satellite imagery, there is no current state of practice for sUAS-based damage assessment systems, as all known work has been confined to academic settings. This work establishes the state of practice via the development and deployment of models for building damage assessment with sUAS imagery. The model development involved training on the largest known dataset of post-disaster sUAS aerial imagery, containing 21,716 building damage labels, and the operational training of 91 disaster practitioners. The best performing model was deployed during the responses to Hurricanes Debby and Helene, where it assessed a combined 415 buildings in approximately 18 minutes. This work contributes documentation of the actual use of AI/ML for damage assessment during a disaster and lessons learned to the benefit of the AI/ML research and user communities.</description>

      <title>Leveraging LLM-based agents for social science research: insights from citation network simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03758v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrates their potential to encapsulate the logic and patterns inherent in human behavior simulation by leveraging extensive web data pre-training. However, the boundaries of LLM capabilities in social simulation remain unclear. To further explore the social attributes of LLMs, we introduce the CiteAgent framework, designed to generate citation networks based on human-behavior simulation with LLM-based agents. CiteAgent successfully captures predominant phenomena in real-world citation networks, including power-law distribution, citational distortion, and shrinking diameter. Building on this realistic simulation, we establish two LLM-based research paradigms in social science: LLM-SE (LLM-based Survey Experiment) and LLM-LE (LLM-based Laboratory Experiment). These paradigms facilitate rigorous analyses of citation network phenomena, allowing us to validate and challenge existing theories. Additionally, we extend the research scope of traditional science of science studies through idealized social experiments, with the simulation experiment results providing valuable insights for real-world academic environments. Our work demonstrates the potential of LLMs for advancing science of science research in social science.</description>

      <title>LocalBench: Benchmarking LLMs on County-Level Local Knowledge and Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10459v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely evaluated on macro-scale geographic tasks, such as global factual recall, event summarization, and regional reasoning. Yet, their ability to handle hyper-local knowledge remains poorly understood. This gap is increasingly consequential as real-world applications, from civic platforms to community journalism, demand AI systems that can reason about neighborhood-specific dynamics, cultural narratives, and local governance. Existing benchmarks fall short in capturing this complexity, often relying on coarse-grained data or isolated references. We present LocalBench, the first benchmark designed to systematically evaluate LLMs on county-level local knowledge across the United States. Grounded in the Localness Conceptual Framework, LocalBench includes 14,782 validated question-answer pairs across 526 U.S. counties in 49 states, integrating diverse sources such as Census statistics, local subreddit discourse, and regional news. It spans physical, cognitive, and relational dimensions of locality. Using LocalBench, we evaluate 13 state-of-the-art LLMs under both closed-book and web-augmented settings. Our findings reveal critical limitations: even the best-performing models reach only 56.8% accuracy on narrative-style questions and perform below 15.5% on numerical reasoning. Moreover, larger model size and web augmentation do not guarantee better performance, for example, search improves Gemini's accuracy by +13.6%, but reduces GPT-series performance by -11.4%. These results underscore the urgent need for language models that can support equitable, place-aware AI systems: capable of engaging with the diverse, fine-grained realities of local communities across geographic and cultural contexts.</description>

      <title>SpiderGen: Towards Procedure Generation For Carbon Life Cycle Assessments with Generative AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10684v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Investigating the effects of climate change and global warming caused by GHG emissions have been a key concern worldwide. These emissions are largely contributed to by the production, use and disposal of consumer products. Thus, it is important to build tools to estimate the environmental impact of consumer goods, an essential part of which is conducting Life Cycle Assessments (LCAs). LCAs specify and account for the appropriate processes involved with the production, use, and disposal of the products. We present SpiderGen, an LLM-based workflow which integrates the taxonomy and methodology of traditional LCA with the reasoning capabilities and world knowledge of LLMs to generate graphical representations of the key procedural information used for LCA, known as Product Category Rules Process Flow Graphs (PCR PFGs). We additionally evaluate the output of SpiderGen by comparing it with 65 real-world LCA documents. We find that SpiderGen provides accurate LCA process information that is either fully correct or has minor errors, achieving an F1-Score of 65% across 10 sample data points, as compared to 53% using a one-shot prompting method. We observe that the remaining errors occur primarily due to differences in detail between LCA documents, as well as differences in the "scope" of which auxiliary processes must also be included. We also demonstrate that SpiderGen performs better than several baselines techniques, such as chain-of-thought prompting and one-shot prompting. Finally, we highlight SpiderGen's potential to reduce the human effort and costs for estimating carbon impact, as it is able to produce LCA process information for less than \$1 USD in under 10 minutes as compared to the status quo LCA, which can cost over \$25000 USD and take up to 21-person days.</description>

      <title>MajinBook: An open catalogue of digital world literature with likes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11412v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This data paper introduces MajinBook, an open catalogue designed to facilitate the use of shadow libraries--such as Library Genesis and Z-Library--for computational social science and cultural analytics. By linking metadata from these vast, crowd-sourced archives with structured bibliographic data from Goodreads, we create a high-precision corpus of over 539,000 references to English-language books spanning three centuries, enriched with first publication dates, genres, and popularity metrics like ratings and reviews. Our methodology prioritizes natively digital EPUB files to ensure machine-readable quality, while addressing biases in traditional corpora like HathiTrust, and includes secondary datasets for French, German, and Spanish. We evaluate the linkage strategy for accuracy, release all underlying data openly, and discuss the project's legal permissibility under EU and US frameworks for text and data mining in research.</description>

      <title>Learning Fair Representations with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11767v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite recent advances in fairness-aware machine learning, predictive models often exhibit discriminatory behavior towards marginalized groups. Such unfairness might arise from biased training data, model design, or representational disparities across groups, posing significant challenges in high-stakes decision-making domains such as college admissions. While existing fair learning models aim to mitigate bias, achieving an optimal trade-off between fairness and accuracy remains a challenge. Moreover, the reliance on black-box models hinders interpretability, limiting their applicability in socially sensitive domains. To circumvent these issues, we propose integrating Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) within a fair adversarial learning framework. Leveraging the adversarial robustness and interpretability of KANs, our approach facilitates stable adversarial learning. We derive theoretical insights into the spline-based KAN architecture that ensure stability during adversarial optimization. Additionally, an adaptive fairness penalty update mechanism is proposed to strike a balance between fairness and accuracy. We back these findings with empirical evidence on two real-world admissions datasets, demonstrating the proposed framework's efficiency in achieving fairness across sensitive attributes while preserving predictive performance.</description>

      <title>Fairness-Aware Graph Representation Learning with Limited Demographic Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13540v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ensuring fairness in Graph Neural Networks is fundamental to promoting trustworthy and socially responsible machine learning systems. In response, numerous fair graph learning methods have been proposed in recent years. However, most of them assume full access to demographic information, a requirement rarely met in practice due to privacy, legal, or regulatory restrictions. To this end, this paper introduces a novel fair graph learning framework that mitigates bias in graph learning under limited demographic information. Specifically, we propose a mechanism guided by partial demographic data to generate proxies for demographic information and design a strategy that enforces consistent node embeddings across demographic groups. In addition, we develop an adaptive confidence strategy that dynamically adjusts each node's contribution to fairness and utility based on prediction confidence. We further provide theoretical analysis demonstrating that our framework, FairGLite, achieves provable upper bounds on group fairness metrics, offering formal guarantees for bias mitigation. Through extensive experiments on multiple datasets and fair graph learning frameworks, we demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in both mitigating bias and maintaining model utility.</description>
