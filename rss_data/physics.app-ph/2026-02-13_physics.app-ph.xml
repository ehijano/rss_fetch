      <title>Experimental setup for the combined study of spin ensembles and superconducting quantum circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A hybrid quantum computing architecture combining quantum processors and quantum memory units allows for exploiting each component's unique properties to enhance the overall performance of the total system. However, superconducting qubits are highly sensitive to magnetic fields, while spin ensembles require finite fields for control, creating a major integration challenge. In this work, we demonstrate the first experimental setup that satisfies these constraints and provides verified qubit stability. Our cryogenic setup comprises two spatially and magnetically decoupled sample volumes inside a single dilution refrigerator: one hosting flux-tunable superconducting qubits and the other a spin ensemble equipped with a superconducting solenoid generating fields up to 50 mT. We show that several layers of Cryophy shielding and an additional superconducting aluminum shield suppress magnetic crosstalk by more than eight orders of magnitude, ensuring stability of the qubit's performance. Moreover, the operation of the solenoid adds minimal thermal load on the relevant stages of the dilution refrigerator. Our results enable scalable hybrid quantum architectures with low-loss integration, marking a key step toward scalable hybrid quantum computing platforms.</description>

      <title>Single-exposure holographic lithography of ultra-high aspect-ratio microstructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Volumetric lithography offers a path to scalable fabrication of complex three-dimensional (3D) micro- and nanoscale architectures, yet existing approaches are limited by quasi-two-dimensional exposure physics or slow serial writing. We present a single-exposure volumetric fabrication strategy that enables creation of ultrahigh-aspect-ratio 3D structures with 6 um minimum features. An inverse-designed volumetric (holographic) phase mask generates an extended-depth-of-field intensity distribution inside a photoresist volume while preserving high transverse resolution, enabling uniform polymerization of the full volume in a single exposure. With exposure times of approximately 20 s, we fabricate lattices, Penrose tilings, and micromechanical elements with feature sizes down to 6 um over volumes up to 800 x 800 x 720 um^3, achieving aspect ratios exceeding 120:1. Quantitative analysis of capillary flow in hollow lattices demonstrates controlled fluid transport with an effective capillary transport coefficient of 176.3 um/(ms)^(1/2). In situ nanoindentation-based micro-compression reveals that the printed 3D hexagonal close-packed lattices exhibit a well-defined linear elastic regime with an effective Young's modulus of 5.7 GPa, followed by progressive buckling and densification characteristic of mechanically robust cellular architectures. Overlapping, tilted and multi-mask exposures further enable quasi-3D complex geometries with potential for reconfigurability. This approach establishes a new regime of high-throughput volumetric fabrication.</description>

      <title>Nonmonotonic Magnetic Friction from Collective Rotor Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Amontons' law postulates a monotonic relationship between frictional force and the normal load applied to a sliding contact. This empirical rule, however, fails in systems where internal degrees of freedom - such as structural or electronic order - play a central role. Here, we demonstrate that friction can emerge entirely from magnetically driven configurational dynamics in the absence of physical contact. Using a two-dimensional array of rotatable magnetic dipoles sliding over a commensurate magnetic substrate, we observe a pronounced non-monotonic dependence of friction on the interlayer separation, and thus on the effective load. The friction peaks at an intermediate distance where competing ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions induce dynamical frustration and hysteretic torque cycles during sliding. Molecular dynamics simulations and a simplified two-sublattice model confirm that energy dissipation is governed by collective magnetic reorientations and their hysteresis. Our results establish the occurrence of sliding-induced changes in collective magnetic order, which has a strong impact on friction, and thus open new possibilities for contactless friction control, magnetic sensing, and the design of reconfigurable, wear-free frictional interfaces and metamaterials.</description>

      <title>Unconditional full vector magnetometry using spin selectivity in Nitrogen Vacancy centers in diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum sensors based on nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond have been a central topic in the sensing community for more than a decade. The extraordinary properties at room temperature of the spin system in diamond have made it one of the most prominent quantum platforms for the development of commercial quantum sensors. In particular, the sensitivity of the electronic spin in NV centers has made diamond-based magnetic sensors of special interest for their potential application in medical, industrial or navigation solutions. However, the use of these sensors for universal vector magnetometry was constrained by the need for previous knowledge on the field being measured to fully exploit their benefits. In this work, we show a method to perform unconditional vector magnetometry without the need of external information on the magnetic field, based only on the spatial arrangement of the diamond and the microwave antenna combination. While previous NV-based vector magnetometry methods require partial knowledge of the magnetic field (e.g. a calibrated bias field), we exploit the possibilities of selecting particular directions of the spins in the diamond with elliptically polarized microwave fields. We prove that our method allows to estimate both magnitude and direction of external magnetic fields without further assumptions or constraints.</description>

      <title>Improving terahertz-detection sensitivity of 8x8 FET arrays through liquid-nitrogen cooling in a compact low-noise cryostat</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15323v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the sensitivity of antenna-coupled field-effect transistors (FETs) to terahertz (THz) radiation improves continuously with decreasing temperature. The noise-equivalent power (NEP) of 540 GHz patch-antenna-coupled FETs decreases as temperature reduces to 20 K. We project NEP values approaching 1 to 2 pW/sqrt(Hz) under efficient power coupling conditions (e.g., using a superstrate Si-lens), which is comparable to superconducting niobium transition-edge sensors (TESs) at 4 K. Building on these findings, a compact, low-noise, liquid-nitrogen-cooled (77 K) FET-based direct (incoherent) THz-power sensing system} for spectroscopy applications was realized. Here, an 8x8 pixel-binned detector array fabricated in a commercial 65-nm Si-CMOS process, was optimized for operation in the 2.85 to 3.4 THz band. Characterization was performed in the focal plane of a 2.85-THz quantum-cascade laser delivering approx. 2~mW of THz power. A linear dynamic range exceeding 67 dB was achieved without saturation (for 1~Hz-detection bandwidth). The system provides a -3 dB readout bandwidth of 5 MHz, exceeding that of conventional thermal detectors (typically 1 kHz). Combined with its broad temperature operability 20 K to 300 K and compact design, the system is particularly well suited for space- and payload-constrained platforms such as balloon- and satellite-based missions, where deep cryogenic cooling is impractical.</description>

      <title>Controller-decoder system requirements derived by implementing Shor's algorithm with surface code</title>

Abstract: Quantum Error Correction (QEC) is regarded as the most promising path to quantum advantage. The success of QEC relies on achieving quantum gate fidelities below the error threshold of the QEC code, while accurately decoding errors through classical processing of the QEC stabilizer measurements. In this paper, we uncover the critical system-level requirements from a controller-decoder system (CDS) necessary to successfully execute the next milestone in QEC: a non-Clifford circuit. Using a representative non-Clifford circuit, of Shor factorization algorithm for the number 21, we convert the logical-level circuit to a QEC surface code circuit and finally to the physical level circuit. By taking into account realistic implementation aspects using typical superconducting qubit processor parameters, we reveal a broad range of core requirements from any CDS aimed at performing error corrected quantum computation. Our findings indicate that the controller-decoder closed-loop latency must remain within tens of microseconds, achievable by distributing decoding data into several decoders while ensuring fast communication between decoders and with the controller. By extending existing simulation techniques, we simulate the complete fault-tolerant factorization circuit at the physical level, demonstrating that near-term hardware performance in the scale of 0.1% physical error rates and 1000 qubits, are sufficient for a successful circuit execution. Overall, the requirements outlined here set the stage for near- and medium-term experimental realizations of non-Clifford QEC circuits.</description>

      <title>Edge-of-chaos enhanced quantum-inspired algorithm for combinatorial optimization</title>

Abstract: Nonlinear dynamical systems with continuous variables can be used for solving combinatorial optimization problems with discrete variables. Numerical simulations of them are also useful as heuristic algorithms with a desirable property, namely, parallelizability, which allows us to execute them in a massively parallel manner, leading to ultrafast performance. However, the dynamical-system approaches with continuous variables are usually less accurate than conventional approaches with discrete variables such as simulated annealing. To improve the solution accuracy of a quantum-inspired algorithm called simulated bifurcation (SB), which was found from classical simulation of a quantum nonlinear oscillator network exhibiting quantum bifurcation, here we generalize it by introducing nonlinear control of individual bifurcation parameters and show that the generalized SB (GSB) can achieve surprisingly high performance, namely, almost 100% success probabilities for some large-scale problems. As a result, the time to solution for a 2,000-variable problem is shortened to 10 ms by a GSB-based machine, which is two orders of magnitude shorter than the best known value, 1.3 s, previously obtained by an SB-based machine. To examine the reason for the ultrahigh performance, we investigated chaos in the GSB changing the nonlinear-control strength and found that the dramatic increase of success probabilities happens near the edge of chaos. That is, the GSB can find a solution with high probability by harnessing the edge of chaos. This finding suggests that dynamical-system approaches to combinatorial optimization will be enhanced by harnessing the edge of chaos, opening a broad possibility for physics-inspired approaches to combinatorial optimization.</description>
