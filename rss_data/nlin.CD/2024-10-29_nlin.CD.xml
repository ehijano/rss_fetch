      <title>Fundamental performance bounds on time-series generation using reservoir computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reservoir computing (RC) harnesses the intrinsic dynamics of a chaotic system, called the reservoir, to perform various time-varying functions. An important use-case of RC is the generation of target temporal sequences via a trainable output-to-reservoir feedback loop. Despite the promise of RC in various domains, we lack a theory of performance bounds on RC systems. Here, we formulate an existence condition for a feedback loop that produces the target sequence. We next demonstrate that, given a sufficiently chaotic neural network reservoir, two separate factors are needed for successful training: global network stability of the target orbit, and the ability of the training algorithm to drive the system close enough to the target, which we term `reach'. By computing the training phase diagram over a range of target output amplitudes and periods, we verify that reach-limited failures depend on the training algorithm while stability-limited failures are invariant across different algorithms. Finally, we leverage dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) to provide an analytical amplitude-period bound on achievable outputs by RC networks and propose a way of enhancing algorithm reach via forgetting. The resulting mechanistic understanding of RC performance can guide the future design and deployment of reservoir networks.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing dynamics from sparse observations with no training on target system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In applications, an anticipated situation is where the system of interest has never been encountered before and sparse observations can be made only once. Can the dynamics be faithfully reconstructed from the limited observations without any training data? This problem defies any known traditional methods of nonlinear time-series analysis as well as existing machine-learning methods that typically require extensive data from the target system for training. We address this challenge by developing a hybrid transformer and reservoir-computing machine-learning scheme. The key idea is that, for a complex and nonlinear target system, the training of the transformer can be conducted not using any data from the target system, but with essentially unlimited synthetic data from known chaotic systems. The trained transformer is then tested with the sparse data from the target system. The output of the transformer is further fed into a reservoir computer for predicting the long-term dynamics or the attractor of the target system. The power of the proposed hybrid machine-learning framework is demonstrated using a large number of prototypical nonlinear dynamical systems, with high reconstruction accuracy even when the available data is only 20% of that required to faithfully represent the dynamical behavior of the underlying system. The framework provides a paradigm of reconstructing complex and nonlinear dynamics in the extreme situation where training data does not exist and the observations are random and sparse.</description>

      <title>Dynamical transitions and aging in the superdiffusive Pomeau-Manneville map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.09458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.09458v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Pomeau-Manneville map is a paradigmatic intermittent dynamical system exhibiting weak chaos and anomalous dynamics. In this paper we analyse the parameter dependence of superdiffusion for the map lifted periodically onto the real line. From numerical simulations we compute the generalised diffusion coefficient (GDC) of this model as a function of the map's nonlinearity parameter. We identify two singular dynamical transitions in the GDC, one where it diverges to infinity, and a second one where it is fully suppressed. Using the continuous-time random walk theory of L\'evy walks we calculate an analytic expression for the GDC and show that it qualitatively reproduces these two transitions. Quantitatively it systematically deviates from the deterministic dynamics for small parameter values, which we explain by slow decay of velocity correlations. Interestingly, imposing aging onto the dynamics in simulations eliminates the dynamical transition that led to suppression of the GDC, thus yielding a non-trivial change in the parameter dependence of superdiffusion. This also applies to a respective intermittent model of subdiffusive dynamics displaying a related transition.</description>

      <title>Complexity of two-level systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05557v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Complexity of two-level systems, e.g. spins, qubits, magnetic moments etc, are analysed based on the so-called correlational entropy in the case of pure quantum systems and the thermal entropy in case of thermal equilibrium that are suitable quantities essentially free from basis dependence. The complexity is defined as the difference between the Shannon-entropy and the second order R\'enyi-entropy, where the latter is connected to the traditional participation measure or purity. It is shown that the system attains maximal complexity for special choice of control parameters, i.e. strength of disorder either in the presence of noise of the energy states or the presence of disorder in the off diagonal coupling. It is shown that such a noise or disorder dependence provides a basis free analysis and gives meaningful insights. We also look at similar entropic complexity of spins in thermal equilibrium for a paramagnet at finite temperature, $T$ and magnetic field $B$, as well as the case of an Ising model in the mean-field approximation. As a result all examples provide important evidence that the investigation of the entropic complexity parameters help to get deeper understanding in the behavior of these systems.</description>

      <title>Variational data assimilation in wall turbulence: From outer observations to wall stress and pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09916v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Estimation of near-wall turbulence in channel flow from outer observations is investigated using adjoint-variational data assimilation. We first consider fully resolved velocity data, starting at a distance from the wall. By enforcing the estimated flow to exactly satisfy the Navier-Stokes equations, we seek a statistically stationary turbulent state that reproduces the instantaneous outer measurements. Such an estimated state provides full access to the unknown near-wall turbulence, including the wall shear stresses and pressure. When the first observation is within fifty viscous units from the wall, the correlation coefficient between the true and estimated state exceeds 95%. As the observations are further separated from the wall, at ninety viscous units, the accuracy of the assimilated wall stresses decreases to 40% at the wall. This trend is nearly independent of the Reynolds number. The Fourier spectrum of the estimation error is qualitatively consistent with the coherence spectrum between the outer and the inner state variables: observed long wavelength structures in the outer flow have deeper coherence into the unobserved near-wall region, and therefore the error is lowest at large scales. Nevertheless, the adjoint-variational approach provides a more rigorous quantification of the capacity to accurately predict the instantaneous near-wall turbulence from outer measurements. Lastly, we demonstrate the robustness of the estimation accuracy using filtered and sub-sampled outer observations.</description>
