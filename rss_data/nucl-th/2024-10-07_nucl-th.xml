      <title>Kubo formula for spin hydrodynamics: spin chemical potential as leading order in gradient expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a first-order dissipative spin hydrodynamic framework, where the spin chemical potential $\omega^{\mu\nu}$ is treated as the leading term in the hydrodynamic gradient expansion, i.e., $\omega^{\mu\nu}\sim \mathcal{O}(1)$. We argue that for the consistency of the theoretical framework, the energy-momentum tensor needs to be symmetric at least up to order $\mathcal{O}(\partial)$. We consider the phenomenological form of the spin tensor, where it is anti-symmetric in the last two indices only. A comprehensive analysis of spin hydrodynamics is conducted using both macroscopic entropy current analysis and microscopic Kubo formalism, establishing consistency between the two approaches. A key finding is the entropy production resulting from spin-orbit coupling, which alters the traditional equivalence between the Landau and Eckart fluid frames. Additionally, we identify cross-diffusion effects, where vector dissipative currents are influenced by gradients of both spin chemical potential and chemical potential corresponding to the conserved charge through off-diagonal transport coefficients. Two distinct methods for decomposing the spin tensor are proposed, and their equivalence is demonstrated through Kubo relations.</description>

      <title>Peak of sound velocity, scale symmetry and nuclear force in baryonic matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sound velocity in homogeneous matter has its fundamental significance as it relates to the stiffness of the equation of state of massive compact stars. In this work, we investigate the density evolution of the sound velocity in homogeneous dense baryonic matter by using an effective theory implemented with a conformal compensator -- the nonlinear realization of scale symmetry -- regarded as the source of the lightest scalar meson. We find that the peak of sound velocity emerges naturally in the intermediate density region -- $(1\sim 2.5)n_0$ -- without retrospect to the transition from hadron to exotic configuration. This phenomenon is not found in the Walecka-type models where the sigma meson is included in the linear-type approach, therefore, it is an intrinsic character of the dilaton compensator approach through the matching of QCD trace anomaly. In addition, these observations shed light on how the hidden scale symmetry manifests in nuclear medium from the unitarity limit in dilute matter to dilaton limit in compact star matter.</description>

      <title>Phase Diagrams of Relativistic Selfinteracting Boson System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the Canonical Ensemble, we investigate a system of interacting relativistic bosons at finite temperatures and finite isospin densities in a mean-field approach. The mean field contains both attractive and repulsive terms. Temperature and isospin-density dependencies of thermodynamic quantities were obtained. It is shown that in the case of attraction between particles in a bosonic system, a liquid-gas phase transition develops against the background of the Bose-Einstein condensate. The corresponding phase diagrams are given. We explain the reasons why the presence of a Bose condensate significantly increases the critical temperature of the liquid-gas phase transition compared to that obtained for the same system within the framework of the Boltzmann statistics. Our results may have implications for the interpretation of experimental data, in particular, how sensitive the critical point of the mixed phase is to the presence of the Bose-Einstein condensate.</description>

      <title>Probing for an IR-fixed Point in QCD by Superallowed Gamow-Teller Transitions in Doubly Magic Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This brief note is to point out that the recent measurements at GSI and RIKEN of the superallowed Gamow-Teller transition in the doubly magic closed-shell nucleus $^{100}$Sn could give an indication for a possibly important {\it fundamental} quenching, thus-far unrecognized, of $g_A$, unambiguously distinct from nuclear correlation effects in the framework of nuclear effective field theory. The result, either confirmed or ruled out both experimentally and theory, can have strong impacts on nuclear physics vis-\`a-vis with nuclear effective field theory as well as on particle physics relevant for going beyond the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>How the HESS J1731-347 event could be explained using $\bf{K^{-}}$ condensation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent observation of a compact star with a mass of $M=0.77^{+0.20}_{-0.17}~{\rm M_{\odot}}$ and a radius of $R=10.4^{+0.86}_{-0.78}$ km, located within the supernova remnant HESS J1731-347, has substantially reinforced the evidence for the presence of exotic matter in neutron stars core. This finding has markedly enhanced our comprehension of the equation of state for dense nuclear matter. In the present work, we investigate the possible existence of a kaon condensation in hadronic neutron stars by employing and comparing two theoretical frameworks: the Relativistic Mean Field model with first order kaon condensate and the Momentum-Dependent Interaction model complemented by chiral effective theory. To the best of our knowledge, this represents a first alternative attempt aimed to explain the bulk properties of the specific event with the inclusion of a kaon condensation in dense nuclear matter. The application of two different models enriches the research, providing insights from the aspect of different theoretical frameworks that accurately predict the existence of HESS J1731-347. In both cases significant insights are extracted for the parameter space of both models, emphasizing to those concerning the nucleon-kaon potential, the threshold density for the appearance of a kaon condensation, as well as the parameter $a_{3}m_{s}$ which is related to the strangeness content of the proton. Concluding, the present research indicates that a more systematic investigation of similar events could offer valuable constraints on the properties of dense nuclear matter.</description>

      <title>Accessing Generalized Parton Distributions through $2 \to 3$ exclusive processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review our results on a new class of $2 \to 3$ exclusive processes, as a probe of both chiral-even and chiral-odd quark GPDs. We consider the exclusive photoproduction of a photon-meson pair, in the kinematics where the pair has a large invariant mass, described in the collinear factorization framework. We cover the whole kinematical range from medium energies in fixed target experiments to very large energies of colliders, by considering the experimental conditions of JLab 12-GeV, COMPASS, future EIC and LHC (in ultra-peripheral collisions) cases. Our analysis covers neutral and charged rho-mesons, as well as charged pions. The case of the rho-meson, depending on its polarization, provides access to either chiral-even or chiral-odd GPDs, at leading twist. We find that the order of magnitude of the obtained cross sections are sufficiently large for a dedicated experimental analysis to be performed, especially at JLab. Furthermore, we compute the linear photon beam polarization asymmetry, which we find to be sizeable, in the case of a longitudinally polarized $\rho$-meson or of a charged pion. These predictions are obtained for both asymptotic distribution amplitude (DA) and holographic DA.</description>

      <title>Impressions of Parton Distribution Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parton distribution functions (DFs) have long been recognised as key measures of hadron structure. Today, theoretical prediction of such DFs is becoming possible using diverse methods for continuum and lattice analyses of strong interaction (QCD) matrix elements. Recent developments include a demonstration that continuum and lattice analyses yield mutually consistent results for all pion DFs, with behaviour on the far valence domain of light-front momentum fraction that matches QCD expectations. Theory is also delivering an understanding of the distributions of proton mass and spin amongst its constituents, which varies, of course, with the resolving scale of the measuring probe. Aspects of these developments are sketched herein.</description>

      <title>Detecting spacelike vacuum entanglement at all distances and promoting negativity to a necessary and sufficient entanglement measure in many-body regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Though known to be present, the accessibility of spacelike vacuum entanglement capable of being a fundamental resource for quantum information processing has remained in question at distances beyond the scale of vacuum fluctuations in massive fields. For a broad subclass of physical many-body mixed Gaussian states, including the free scalar field vacuum, the logarithmic negativity is here shown to be a necessary and sufficient measure of entanglement and to be entirely accessible by pairs of single-mode detectors in the continuum. By deriving exact and optimal detection profiles, entanglement resources in the massive field are demonstrated to be available at all distances.</description>

      <title>Effect of $f(R,T)$ theory of gravity on the properties of strange quark stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate strange quark stars within the framework of modified $f(R,T)$ gravity, where $R$ represents the Ricci scalar and $T$ denotes the trace of the energy-momentum tensor, specifically defined as $ f(R,T) = R + 2\chi T $. The equation of state is obtained with the different forms of the MIT bag model and quark mass model with medium effects and self-consistent thermodynamical treatment. We find that negative values of $\chi$ significantly increase both the mass and radius of the quark star. The inclusion of $\chi$ helps to satisfy recent the astrophysical constraints on the mass-radius relationship. We have also constrained the values of $\chi$ for each EoS, based on the observed maximum mass and corresponding radius, demonstrating that the inclusion of this parameter helps to address the challenges posed by both the GW190814 event and NICER observations of PSR J0030+0451. We also observe that the inclusion of $f(R,T)$ gravity leads to an increase in both the maximum mass, by about $ (0.23- 0.27)~M_{\odot}$, and the corresponding radius, by approximately (1.5-2.0)~\text{km}, depending on the chosen equation of state.</description>

      <title>Persistence of charmed hadrons in QGP from lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the nature of charm degrees of freedom near the chiral crossover based on lattice QCD calculations of the second and fourth-order cumulants of charm fluctuations, and their correlations with net baryon number, electric charge, and strangeness fluctuations. We show that below the chiral crossover temperature, $T_{pc}$, the thermodynamics of charm can be very well understood in terms of charmed hadrons. We present evidence that above $T_{pc}$, however, charm quark-like excitations emerge as new degrees of freedom contributing to the partial charm pressure. Nonetheless, up to temperatures as high as 175 MeV, charmed hadron-like excitations significantly contribute to the partial charm pressure.</description>

      <title>Azimuthal Anisotropy Scaling for Identified Mesons and Baryons: Insights into Medium Transport Properties, Equation of State and Hadronic Re-scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Azimuthal anisotropy scaling functions for identified mesons and baryons are derived from species-dependent measurements of the azimuthal anisotropy coefficients \(v_2(p_T, \text{cent})\) and \(v_3(p_T, \text{cent})\), in Pb+Pb collisions at \(\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 2.76\) TeV and 5.02 TeV, Xe+Xe collisions at \(\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 5.44\) TeV, and Au+Au collisions at \(\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 0.2\) TeV. The scaling functions capture species-specific responses to radial flow and hadronic re-scattering, demonstrating consistency across flow- and jet-quenching-dominated \(p_T\) regions. These results provide robust constraints on fundamental transport properties of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP), including the specific shear viscosity \(\eta/s\) and the jet-quenching parameter \(\hat{q}\), as well as insight into the centrality-dependent evolution of radial flow, a vital aspect of the system's dynamics. The findings reveal minimal influence from hadronic re-scattering at high beam energies and significant influence from re-scattering at lower energies. The centrality-dependent evolution of radial flow and the beam energy dependence of \(\eta/s\) offer new constraints on the equation of state (EOS) of the QGP, with important implications for advancing studies of QGP transport properties and heavy-ion collision dynamics.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the Energy-Energy Correlators for Heavy Flavor Tagged Jets in pp, p+Pb and Pb+Pb Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, energy-energy correlator (EEC) distributions for the $\rm D^0$, $\rm B^0$-tagged, inclusive, and the PYTHIA generated pure quark jets are computed in pp, p+Pb, and Pb+Pb collisions at \sqrts =5.02 TeV for a same jet transverse momentum interval 15-30 GeV. We find the number of particles per jet determines the height of the EEC distribution in pp baseline. The averaged energy weight distribution resulted in a shift of the originally larger angular distributed particle distribution to a smaller RL, thereby obtaining an EEC distribution. The EEC distributions for all quark-tagged jets in A+A exhibit a noticeable shift towards larger RL region, suggesting that the jets will be more widely distributed compared to those in pp collisions. The jet quenching effect will cause the pair angular distribution to shift towards larger values and increase the number of particles per jet. This redistribution of energy within the jets suggests that the already reduced jet energy is redistributed among a larger number of particles, leading to a reduced energy weight per pair. The enhancement of the number of particles per jet and the reduced averaged energy weight interplay with each other to form the medium modification of EEC.</description>

      <title>New Skyrme parametrizations to describe finite nuclei and neutron star matter with realistic effective masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15916v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The phenomenological Skyrme energy density functional theory is one of the most popular theories for dealing with finite nuclei and infinite nuclear matter, including neutron star matter. However, the density dependence of the effective masses of common Skyrme parametrizations is completely different from the one found in microscopic calculations. This can have drastic consequences. For instance, in a recent study we reported that in many Skyrme functionals, the neutron Fermi velocity exceeds the speed of light at densities that exist in neutron-star cores. To solve this problem, we try to construct new Skyrme parametrizations by including constraints from microscopic calculations of the effective mass in addition to binding energies and charge radii of finite nuclei and different microscopic equations of state of pure neutron matter. We give the parameters of the new Skyrme forces and show that our new effective interactions can successfully describe properties of finite nuclei and nuclear matter (including pure neutron matter, symmetric nuclear matter, and neutron star matter).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19281v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the first \textit{ab initio} calculation of the nuclear-structure-dependent radiative correction $ \delta_{ \mathrm{NS} } $ to the $ {}^{10}\mathrm{C} \rightarrow {}^{10}\mathrm{B} $ superallowed transition, computed with the no-core shell model and chiral effective field theory. We obtain $\delta_{ \mathrm{NS} } = - 0.422 (29)_{ \mathrm{nuc} } (12)_{ n,\mathrm{el} } $ with a $1.6$-times reduction in the total uncertainty when compared to the current literature estimate based on the shell model and Fermi gas picture. This work paves the way for a precise determination of $V_{ud}$ from superallowed beta decays within a systematically improvable framework.</description>

Abstract: Recent measurements of high-momentum correlated neutron-proton pairs
  at JLab suggest that the dense nucleonic component of the compact
  stars contains a fraction of high-momentum neutron-proton pairs that
  is not accounted for in the familiar Fermi-liquid theory of the
  neutron-proton fluid mixture. We compute the rate of the Urca
  process in compact stars taking into account the non-Fermi liquid
  contributions to the proton's spectral widths induced by short-range
  correlations. The Urca rate differs strongly from the Fermi-liquid
  prediction at low temperatures, in particular, the high threshold on
  the proton fraction precluding the Urca process in neutron stars is
  replaced by a smooth increase with the proton fraction. This observation
  may have a profound impact on the theories of cooling of compact
  stars.</description>

      <title>Towards Hypernuclei from Nuclear Lattice Effective Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17638v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the strong interactions within baryonic systems beyond the up and down quark sector is pivotal for a comprehensive description of nuclear forces. This study explores the interactions involving hyperons, particularly the $\Lambda$ particle, within the framework of nuclear lattice effective field theory (NLEFT). By incorporating $\Lambda$ hyperons into the NLEFT framework, we extend our investigation into the $S = -1$ sector, allowing us to probe the third dimension of the nuclear chart. We calculate the $\Lambda$ separation energies ($B_{\Lambda}$) of hypernuclei up to the medium-mass region, providing valuable insights into hyperon-nucleon ($YN$) and hyperon-nucleon-nucleon ($YNN$) interactions. Our calculations employ high-fidelity chiral interactions at N${}^3$LO for nucleons and extend it to $\Lambda$ hyperons with leading-order S-wave $YN$ interactions as well as $YNN$ forces constrained only by the $A=4,5$ systems. Our results contribute to a deeper understanding of the SU(3) symmetry breaking and establish a foundation for future improvements in hypernuclear calculations.</description>

      <title>Competing shape evolution, crossing configurations and single particle levels in nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00967v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The evolution of shape in the even-even zirconium (Zr) isotopes has been the subject of study for many years. However, the odd-mass isotopes have not been investigated as extensively due to limited experimental accessibility and computational challenges. This work, employing the interacting boson-fermion model with configuration mixing, examines the effect of rapid shape evolution and normal-intruder configuration crossing -- both identified as quantum phase transitions -- alongside evolution in single particle energies, on the positive-parity spectrum of odd-mass $^\text{93-103}$Zr isotopes. Calculated energy levels, magnetic moments, $B(E2)$ values, and quadrupole moments are compared to experimental data, showing good agreement. The special case of $^{99}$Zr, which lies near the critical point of both quantum phase transitions, is also addressed, offering a new interpretation to the $7/2^+_1$ isomeric state and the occurrence of the type II shell evolution, in light of recent debates.</description>

      <title>Fuzzy logic for reconstructing arbitrary moments of multiplicity distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09814v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Identity Method is a statistical technique developed to reconstruct moments of multiplicity distributions of particles produced in high-energy nuclear collisions. The method leverages principles from fuzzy logic, allowing for a more nuanced representation of particle identification by assigning degrees of membership to different particle types based on detector signals. In this contribution, a new framework, based on a multivariate moment generation function, is developed that allows the derivation of the formulas used in the Identity Method in a more robust way. Moreover, within the introduced framework, the Identity Method is easily extended to cope with arbitrarily higher-order moments. The techniques developed here offer significant potential for improving the accuracy of multiplicity distribution analyses in high-energy nuclear collisions. While the primary focus of the work presented is on applications in high-energy particle and nuclear physics, it can also be applied in other areas where signal identification is probabilistic and data are noisy, such as in medical imaging, remote sensing, and various other fields of experimental science.</description>

      <title>BHAC-QGP: three-dimensional MHD simulations of relativistic heavy-ion collisions, II. Application to Au-Au collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08669v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present BHAC-QGP, a new numerical code to simulate the evolution of matter created in heavy-ion collisions. BHAC-QGP is based on the Black Hole Accretion Code (BHAC), which has been designed to model astrophysical processes through the solution of the equations of general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics. Like the mother code, BHAC-QGP uses Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR), which allows for a dynamic adjustment of the resolution in regions of the computational domain where a particularly high accuracy is needed. We here discuss a number of applications of BHAC-QGP to Au-Au collisions at Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider (RHIC) energies and show that the code is able to reproduce results of other simulations of these scenarios, but with much higher accuracy.</description>

      <title>Effects of Dark Matter on $f$-mode oscillations of Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18740v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The effect of dark matter (DM) on $f$-mode oscillations in DM admixed neutron stars (NSs) is investigated in a comprehensive analysis with particular attention to the role of the nuclear equation of state. Hadronic matter is modeled by the relativistic mean field model and the DM model is based on the neutron decay anomaly. The non-radial $f$-mode oscillations for such DM admixed NS are studied in a full general relativistic framework. We investigate the impact of DM, DM self-interaction, and DM fraction on the $f$-mode characteristics. We derive relations encoding the effect of DM on $f$-mode parameters. We then perform a systematic study by varying all the model parameters within their known uncertainty range and obtain a universal relation for the DM fraction based on the total mass of the star and DM self-interaction strength. We also perform a correlation study among model parameters, NS observables, in particular, $f$-mode parameters. Finally, we check the $f$-mode universal relations (URs) for the case of DM admixed NSs and demonstrate the existence of a degeneracy between purely hadronic NSs and DM admixed NSs.</description>

      <title>Quasiparton distributions in massive QED2: Toward quantum computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05112v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the quasi-parton distributions of the lightest $\eta'$ meson in massive two-dimensional Quantum electrodynamics (QED2) by performing a digital quantum simulation on a classical computer (exact diagonalization). The Hamiltonian and boost operators are mapped onto spin qubits in a spatial lattice with open boundary conditions. The lowest excited state in the exact diagonalization is shown to interpolate continuously between an anomalous $\eta'$ state at strong coupling,and a non-anomalous heavy meson at weak coupling, with a cusp at the critical point. The boosted $\eta'$ state follows relativistic kinematics but with large deviations in the luminal limit. The spatial quasi-parton distribution function and amplitude for the $\eta'$ state are computed numerically for increasing rapidity both at strong and weak coupling, and compared to the exact light front results. The numerical results from the boosted form of the spatial parton distributions, compare fairly with the inverse Fourier transformation of the luminal parton distributions, derived in the lowest Fock space approximation. Our analysis points out some of the limitations facing the current lattice program for the parton distributions.</description>

      <title>Real-time chiral dynamics at finite temperature from quantum simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21496v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we explore the real-time dynamics of the chiral magnetic effect (CME) at a finite temperature in the (1+1)-dimensional QED, the massive Schwinger model. By introducing a chiral chemical potential $\mu_5$ through a quench process, we drive the system out of equilibrium and analyze the induced vector currents and their evolution over time. The Hamiltonian is modified to include the time-dependent chiral chemical potential, thus allowing the investigation of the CME within a quantum computing framework. We employ the quantum imaginary time evolution (QITE) algorithm to study the thermal states, and utilize the Suzuki-Trotter decomposition for the real-time evolution. This study provides insights into the quantum simulation capabilities for modeling the CME and offers a pathway for studying chiral dynamics in low-dimensional quantum field theories.</description>

      <title>A note on the canonical approach to hydrodynamics and linear response theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10698v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This note provides a comprehensive examination of the various approaches to formulating relativistic hydrodynamics, with a particular emphasis on the canonical approach. Relativistic hydrodynamics plays a crucial role in understanding the behavior of fluids in high-energy astrophysical phenomena and heavy-ion collisions. The canonical approach is explored in detail, highlighting its foundational principles, mathematical formulations, and practical implications in modeling relativistic fluid dynamics. Following this, we delve into the linear response theory, elucidating its relevance in the context of hydrodynamics. We analyze the response of relativistic fluids to external perturbations, discussing the theoretical framework and key results. This dual focus aims to bridge the gap between theoretical foundations and practical applications, offering a robust perspective on the dynamic interplay between relativistic hydrodynamics and linear response theory.</description>

      <title>Updated implementation of next-to-leading order transversity evolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00221v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide code to solve the Dokshitzer-Gribov-Lipatov-Altarelli-Parisi (DGLAP) evolution equations for the nucleon transversity parton distribution functions (PDFs), which encode nucleon transverse spin structure. Though codes are widely available for the evolution of unpolarized and polarized PDFs, there are few codes publicly available for the transversity PDF. Here, we present Python code which implements two methods of solving the leading order (LO) and next-to-leading order (NLO) approximations of the DGLAP equations for the transversity PDF, and we highlight the theoretical differences between the two.</description>

      <title>Nucleon Gravitational Form Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15547v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A symmetry-preserving analysis of strong interaction quantum field equations is used to complete a unified treatment of pion, kaon, nucleon electromagnetic and gravitational form factors. Findings include a demonstration that the pion near-core pressure is roughly twice that in the proton, so both are significantly greater than that of a neutron star; parton species separations of the nucleon's three gravitational form factors, in which, inter alia, the glue-to-quark ratio for each form factor is seen to take the same constant value, independent of momentum transfer; and a determination of proton radii orderings, with the mechanical (normal force) radius being less than the mass-energy radius, which is less than the proton charge radius. This body of predictions should prove useful in an era of anticipated experiments that will enable them to be tested.</description>
