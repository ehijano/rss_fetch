      <title>The role of the Look Elsewhere Effect in determining the significance of an oscillation disappearance search for a light sterile neutrino</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the ongoing vibrant experimental quest to assess whether the numerous indications for a light sterile neutrino are only experimental fluctuations or the manifestations of a profound and real underlying effect, one aspect which has recently attracted a specific interest is the statistical treatment of the data. Especially in cases of supposed positive hints, the correct statistical assessment of their significance is of paramount importance, to avoid that potential overstatements lead to a wrong understanding of the real status of the experimental investigation in the field. In this work I show how latest crucial advancements in the statistical data processing for the interpretation of the output of a sterile search can be effectively put and understood in the context of the Look Elsewhere Effect phenomenon, developed and now of routine usage for results interpretation in other areas of HEP research.</description>

      <title>Assessing the similarity of real matrices with arbitrary shape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Assessing the similarity of matrices is valuable for analyzing the extent to which data sets exhibit common features in tasks such as data clustering, dimensionality reduction, pattern recognition, group comparison, and graph analysis. Methods proposed for comparing vectors, such as cosine similarity, can be readily generalized to matrices. However, this approach usually neglects the inherent two-dimensional structure of matrices. Here, we propose singular angle similarity (SAS), a measure for evaluating the structural similarity between two arbitrary, real matrices of the same shape based on singular value decomposition. After introducing the measure, we compare SAS with standard measures for matrix comparison and show that only SAS captures the two-dimensional structure of matrices. Further, we characterize the behavior of SAS in the presence of noise and as a function of matrix dimensionality. Finally, we apply SAS to two use cases: square non-symmetric matrices of probabilistic network connectivity, and non-square matrices representing neural brain activity. For synthetic data of network connectivity, SAS matches intuitive expectations and allows for a robust assessment of similarities and differences. For experimental data of brain activity, SAS captures differences in the structure of high-dimensional responses to different stimuli. We conclude that SAS is a suitable measure for quantifying the shared structure of matrices with arbitrary shape.</description>

      <title>Effective Lagrangian Morphing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.13612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.13612v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the LHC entering the precision era, focus on interpreting the measurements performed in an effective field theory holds key to testing the Standard Model. An effective field theory provides a well-defined theoretical formalism which extends the Standard Model by introduce new terms with free coefficients that can be measured with experimental data. Constructing models parametric in these new coefficients is achieved by virtue of combining predictions from Monte Carlo generators for different interactions. This paper builds upon earlier works and describes a state-of-the-art approach to build multidimensional parametric models for new physics using effective Lagrangians. Documentation and tutorials for an associated toolkit that have been contributed to the ROOT data analysis software framework is included.</description>

      <title>Simplex path integral and simplex renormalization group for high-order interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.01895v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern theories of phase transitions and scale-invariance are rooted in path integral formulation and renormalization groups (RG). Despite the applicability of these approaches on simple systems with only pairwise interactions, they are less effective on complex systems with un-decomposable high-order interactions (i.e., interactions among arbitrary sets of units). To precisely characterize the universality of high-order interacting systems, we propose simplex path integral and simplex renormalization group (SRG) as the generalizations of classic approaches to arbitrary high-order and heterogeneous interactions. We first formalize the trajectories of units governed by high-order interactions to define path integrals on corresponding simplexes based on a high-order propagator. Then we develop a method to integrate out short-range high-order interactions in the momentum space, accompanied by a coarse graining procedure functioning on the simplex structure generated by high-order interactions. The proposed SRG, equipped with a divide-and-conquer framework, can deal with the absence of ergodicity arised from the sparse distribution of high-order interactions and renormalize a system with intertwined high-order interactions on $p$-order according to its properties on $q$-order ($p\leq q$). The associated scaling relation and its corollaries support to differentiate among scale-invariant, weakly scale-invariant, and scale-dependent systems across different orders. We have validated our theory in multi-order scale-invariance verification, topological invariance discovery, organizational structure identification, and information bottleneck analysis to demonstrate its capacity for identifying intrinsic properties of high-order interacting systems during system reduction.</description>

      <title>Inverse Uncertainty Quantification by Hierarchical Bayesian Modeling and Application in Nuclear System Thermal-Hydraulics Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.16622v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inverse Uncertainty Quantification (IUQ) method has been widely used to quantify the uncertainty of Physical Model Parameters (PMPs) in nuclear Thermal Hydraulics (TH) systems. This paper introduces a novel hierarchical Bayesian model which aims to mitigate two existing challenges in IUQ: the high variability of PMPs under varying experimental conditions, and unknown model discrepancies or outliers causing over-fitting issues.
  The proposed hierarchical model is compared with the conventional single-level Bayesian model using TRACE code and the measured void fraction data in the BFBT benchmark. A Hamiltonian Monte Carlo Method - No U-Turn Sampler (NUTS) is used for posterior sampling. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed hierarchical model in providing better estimates of the posterior distributions of PMPs and being less prone to over-fitting. The proposed method also demonstrates a promising approach for generalizing IUQ to larger databases with broad ranges of experimental conditions.</description>

      <title>First Digit Distributions of Gamma-Ray Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10609v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The occurrence of the first significant digits from real world sources is usually not equally distributed, but is consistent with a logarithmic distribution instead, known as Benford's law. In this work, we perform a comprehensive investigation on the first digit distributions of the duration, fluence, and energy flux of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) for the first time. For a complete GRB sample detected by the Fermi satellite, we find that the first digits of the duration and fluence adhere to Benford's law. However, the energy flux shows a significant departure from this law, which may be due to the fact that a considerable part of the energy flux measurements are restricted by lack of spectral information. Based on the conventional duration classification scheme, we also check if the durations and fluences of long and short GRBs (with duration $T_{90}&gt;2$ s and $T_{90}\leq2$ s, respectively) obey Benford's law. We find that the fluences of both long and short GRBs still agree with the Benford distribution, but their durations do not follow Benford's law. Our results hint that the long--short GRB classification scheme does not directly represent the intrinsic physical classification scheme.</description>
