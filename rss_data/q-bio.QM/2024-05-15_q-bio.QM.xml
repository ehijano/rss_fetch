      <title>A Dynamical Systems Approach to Predicting Patient Outcome after Cardiac Arrest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aim: Approximately six million people suffer cardiac arrests worldwide per year with very low survival rates (&lt;1%). Thus, the aim of this study is to estimate the probability of a poor outcome after cardiac arrest. Accurate outcome predictions avoid removing care too soon for patients with potentially good outcomes or continuing care for patients with likely poor outcomes. Method: The method is based on dynamical systems embedding theorems that show that a reconstructed phase space (RPS) topologically equivalent to an underlying system can be constructed from measured signals. Here the underlying system is the human brain after a cardiac arrest, and the signals are the EEG channels. We model the RPS with a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and ensemble the output of the RPS-GMM with clinical data via XGBoost. Results: As team Blue and Gold in the Predicting Neurological Recovery from Coma After Cardiac Arrest: The George B. Moody PhysioNet Challenge 2023, our RPS-GMM-XGBoost method obtained a test set competition score of 0.426 and rank of 24/36.</description>

      <title>Impact of Hypoglycemia on Glucose Variability Over Time for Individuals with Open Source Automated Insulin Delivery Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: This study investigates glucose conditions preceding and following various hypoglycemia levels in individuals with type 1 diabetes using open-source automated insulin delivery (AID) systems. It also seeks to evaluate relationships between hypoglycemia and subsequent glycemic variability. Methods: Analysis of continuous glucose monitor (CGM) data from 122 individuals with type 1 diabetes using open-source AID from the OpenAPS Data Commons was conducted. The study comprehensively analyzed the effects of hypoglycemia on glycemic variability, covering time periods before and after hypoglycemia. Results: Glucose variability normalization post-hypoglycemia can take up to 48 hours, with severe hypoglycemia (40-50 mg/dL) linked to prolonged normalization. A cyclical pattern was observed where hypoglycemia predisposes individuals to further hypoglycemia, even with AID system use. A rise in glucose levels often precedes hypoglycemia, followed by an elevated mean time above range (TAR) post-severe hypoglycemia, indicating a 'rebound' effect. Different hypoglycemia categorization approaches did not show significant differences in glycemic variability outcomes. The level of hypoglycemia does influence the pattern of subsequent glucose fluctuations. Conclusion: Hypoglycemia, especially at lower levels, significantly impact subsequent glycemic variability, even with use of AID systems. This should be studied further with a broader set of commercial AID systems to understand if these patterns are true of all types of AID systems. If these patterns occur in all types of AID systems, it underscores potential opportunities for enhancements in AID algorithms and highlights the importance of educating healthcare providers and people with diabetes about post-hypoglycemia glucose variability.</description>

      <title>drGAT: Attention-Guided Gene Assessment of Drug Response Utilizing a Drug-Cell-Gene Heterogeneous Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Drug development is a lengthy process with a high failure rate. Increasingly, machine learning is utilized to facilitate the drug development processes. These models aim to enhance our understanding of drug characteristics, including their activity in biological contexts. However, a major challenge in drug response (DR) prediction is model interpretability as it aids in the validation of findings. This is important in biomedicine, where models need to be understandable in comparison with established knowledge of drug interactions with proteins. drGAT, a graph deep learning model, leverages a heterogeneous graph composed of relationships between proteins, cell lines, and drugs. drGAT is designed with two objectives: DR prediction as a binary sensitivity prediction and elucidation of drug mechanism from attention coefficients. drGAT has demonstrated superior performance over existing models, achieving 78\% accuracy (and precision), and 76\% F1 score for 269 DNA-damaging compounds of the NCI60 drug response dataset. To assess the model's interpretability, we conducted a review of drug-gene co-occurrences in Pubmed abstracts in comparison to the top 5 genes with the highest attention coefficients for each drug. We also examined whether known relationships were retained in the model by inspecting the neighborhoods of topoisomerase-related drugs. For example, our model retained TOP1 as a highly weighted predictive feature for irinotecan and topotecan, in addition to other genes that could potentially be regulators of the drugs. Our method can be used to accurately predict sensitivity to drugs and may be useful in the identification of biomarkers relating to the treatment of cancer patients.</description>
