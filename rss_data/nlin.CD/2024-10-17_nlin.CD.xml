      <title>Using Intermittent Chaotic Clocks to Secure Cryptographic Chips</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter proposes using intermittent chaotic clocks, generated from chaotic maps, to drive cryptographic chips running the Advanced Encryption Standard as a countermeasure against Correlation Power Analysis attacks. Five different chaotic maps -- namely: the Logistic map, the Bernoulli shift map, the Henon map, the Tent map, and the Ikeda map -- are used in this work to generate chaotic clocks. The performance of these chaotic clocks is evaluated in terms of timing overhead and the resilience of the driven chip against Correlation Power Analysis attacks. All proposed chaotic clocking schemes successfully protect the driven chip against attacks, with the clocks produced by the optimized Ikeda, Henon, and Logistic maps achieving the lowest timing overhead. These optimized maps, due to their intermittent chaotic behavior, exhibit lower timing overhead compared to previous work. Notably, the chaotic clock generated by the optimized Ikeda map approaches the theoretical limit of timing overhead, i.e., half the execution time of a reference periodic clock.</description>

      <title>Automated Discovery of Continuous Dynamics from Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamical systems form the foundation of scientific discovery, traditionally modeled with predefined state variables such as the angle and angular velocity, and differential equations such as the equation of motion for a single pendulum. We propose an approach to discover a set of state variables that preserve the smoothness of the system dynamics and to construct a vector field representing the system's dynamics equation, automatically from video streams without prior physical knowledge. The prominence and effectiveness of the proposed approach are demonstrated through both quantitative and qualitative analyses of various dynamical systems, including the prediction of characteristic frequencies and the identification of chaotic and limit cycle behaviors. This shows the potential of our approach to assist human scientists in scientific discovery.</description>

      <title>A Numerical Study of Chaotic Dynamics of K-S Equation with FNOs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solving non-linear partial differential equations which exhibit chaotic dynamics is an important problem with a wide-range of applications such as predicting weather extremes and financial market risk. Fourier neural operators (FNOs) have been shown to be efficient in solving partial differential equations (PDEs). In this work we demonstrate simulation of dynamics in the chaotic regime of the two-dimensional (2d) Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation using FNOs. Particularly, we analyze the effect of Fourier mode cutoff on the results obtained by using FNOs vs those obtained using traditional PDE solvers. We compare the outputs using metrics such as the 2d power spectrum and the radial power spectrum. In addition we propose the normalised error power spectrum which measures the percentage error in the FNO model outputs. We conclude that FNOs capture the dynamics in the chaotic regime of the 2d K-S equation, provided the Fourier mode cutoff is kept sufficiently high.</description>

      <title>Semiclassical study of diagonal and offdiagonal functions in the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.13183v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The so-called eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), which has been tested in various manybody models by numerical simulations, supplies a way of understanding eventual thermalization and is believed to be important for understanding processes of thermalization. Two functions play important roles in the application of ETH, one for averaged diagonal elements and the other for the variance of offdiagonal elements of an observable addressed by ETH on the energy basis. For the former function, a semiclassical expression is known of the zeroth order of hbar, while, little is known analytically for the latter. In this paper, a semiclassical expression is derived for the former function, which includes higher-order contributions of hbar. And, a semiclassical approximation is derived for the latter function, under the assumption of negligible correlations among energy eigenfuntions on an action basis. Relevance of the analytical predictions are tested numerically in the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model.</description>

      <title>Orbital dynamics in galactic potentials under mass transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16367v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time-dependent potentials are common in galactic systems that undergo significant evolution, interactions, or encounters with other galaxies, or when there are dynamic processes like star formation and merging events. Recent studies show that an ensemble approach along with the so-called snapshot framework in dynamical system theory provide a powerful tool to analyze time dependent dynamics.
  In this work, we aim to explore and quantify the phase space structure and dynamical complexity in time-dependent galactic potentials consisting of multiple components. We apply the classical method of Poincar\'e-surface of section to analyze the phase space structure in a chaotic Hamiltonian system subjected to parameter drift. This, however, makes sense only when the evolution of a large ensemble of initial conditions is followed. Numerical simulations explore the phase space structure of such ensembles while the system undergoes a continuous parameter change. The pair-wise average distance of ensemble members allows us to define a generalized Lyapunov-exponent, that might also be time dependent, to describe the system stability. We provide a comprehensive dynamical analysis of the system under circumstances where linear mass transfer undergoes between the disk and bulge components of the model.</description>
