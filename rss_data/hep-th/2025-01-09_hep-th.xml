      <title>Remarks on ghost resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study various aspects of ghost resonances: the resummation that leads to the dressed propagator, the poles locations, the analytic continuation into the second Riemann sheet and the spectral representations in both first and second sheets. In particular, we show that for real masses above the multiparticle threshold the ghost propagator has a pair of complex conjugate poles in the first sheet, unlike the case of an ordinary unstable resonance which has no pole in the first sheet but a complex conjugate pair in the second sheet. Mathematical and physical implications of this feature are discussed. We also clarify an important point regarding the two absorptive contributions of a ghost propagator in the narrow-width approximation. Furthermore, we argue that finite-time quantum field theories are needed to consistently derive the dressed ghost propagator and capture the true physical properties of ghost resonances. Throughout the work, different prescriptions to define the ghost propagator on the real axis are considered: Feynman, anti-Feynman and fakeon prescriptions.</description>

      <title>Five-brane webs, 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ theories and quantum curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a relation between the brane configurations consisting of D3-branes and 5-brane webs which realize 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric Chern-Simons theories and quantum curves by focusing on the $S^{3}$ partition functions. In particular, we conjecture that the Newton polygons of the quantum curves are equal to the toric diagrams which are dual to the 5-brane webs. For brane configurations whose worldvolume theories have Lagrangian descriptions, we show an explicit derivation of the relation by using the supersymmetric localization and the Fermi gas formalism. We also provide some evidence of the conjecture for non-Lagrangian theories. We see that our conjecture gives us new matrix models for 5-brane webs including a $\left(p,q\right)$5-brane with arbitrary $p$. This leads to explicit relations between the brane configurations, the matrix models and genus one quantum curves.</description>

      <title>Duality of spin-2 and spin-3 models invariant under transverse diffeomorphisms and the tensionless limit of string theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we investigate a general class of massless local theories of spin-2 and spin-3 both invariant under generalized transverse diffeomorphisms (TDiff). We identify the ghost free region in their parameters space and show the relationship of those models with the ``doublet'' action stemming from the tensionless limit of the open bosonic string field theory (for symmetric tensors). The connection is implemented via a non local field redefinition which introduces a Stuckelberg-like field of rank-0 (rank-1) for the spin-2 (spin-3) case. An apparent mismatch between most of the TDiff models and the ``doublet'' action has led us to prove a nontrivial duality within the TDiff models which restores the equivalence. Any point in the parameters subspace of ghost free TDiff models is equivalent to any other one within that subspace. In particular, they are all physically equivalent to their simplest version known as Maxwell-like models. So the physical TDiff models seem to differ from each other by a BRST cohomologically trivial term.</description>

      <title>Corrections to the Black hole entropy from a Bose Einstein condensate: a semi-classical phenomenological approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we obtain logarithmic corrections to the black hole entropy. Motivated by our recent proposal concerning the nature of the degrees of freedom leading to the black hole entropy in terms of a Bose Einstein (BEC) condensate of gravitons, we study how to introduce logarithmic corrections. In fact we show that, after modifying the internal energy by means of simple by physically sound arguments dictated by ordinary quantum mechanics and possible non-commutative effects at Planckian scales, a logarithmic term does appear in the Bekenstein Hawking entropy law. We also obtain that the entropy $S_{BH}$ of a ball of Planckian areal radius is $2\pi K_B$, i.e. $S_{BH}(R=L_P)=2\pi K_B$. Our approach show that the possibility that the interior of a black hole is composed with a BEC of gravitons is a viable physically motivated possibility.</description>

      <title>Lorentzian OPE Inversion Formula: A Geometric Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a new perspective on the Lorentzian OPE inversion formula of arXiv:1703.00278, building on arXiv:2302.06469. We introduce an ``auxiliary'' fourpoint function that can be related to the traditionally defined ones via a Radon transform. The Mellin amplitudes associated with this auxiliary function can be shown to be equivalent to the conventional partial wave amplitudes. This has the intuitive geometrical meaning of a generalization of the Projection-Slice Theorem.</description>

      <title>Hot wormholes and chaos dynamics in a two-coupled SYK model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of chaos across the phase transition in a 2-coupled Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, with a focus on the unstable "hot wormhole" phase. Using the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism, we employ two non-equilibrium protocols that allow access to this phase, which is inaccessible through equilibrium simulations: one involves cooling the system via a coupling to a thermal bath, while in the other we periodically drive the coupling parameter between the two sides. We numerically compute the Lyapunov exponents of the hot wormhole for the two cases. Our results uncover a rich structure within this phase, including both thermal and non-thermal solutions. These behaviors are analyzed in detail, with partial insights provided by the Schwarzian approximation, which captures certain but not all aspects of the observed dynamics.</description>

      <title>Generalized Uncertainty Principle theories and their classical interpretation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we show that it is possible to define a classical system associated with a Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) theory via the implementation of a consistent symplectic structure. This provides a solid framework for the classical Hamiltonian formulation of such theories and the study of the dynamics of physical systems in the corresponding deformed phase space. By further characterizing the functions that govern non-commutativity in the configuration space using the algebra of angular momentum, we determine a general form for the rotation generator in these theories and crucially, we show that, under these conditions, unlike what has been previously found in the literature at the quantum level, this requirement does not lead to the superselection of GUP models at the classical level. Finally, we demonstrate that a properly defined GUP theory can be correctly interpreted classically if and only if the corresponding quantum commutators satisfy the Jacobi identities.</description>

      <title>A non-semisimple non-invertible symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the action of a non-semisimple, non-invertible symmetry on spin chains, whose topological defects encode the category of modules over the Taft algebra of dimension 4. Sacrificing Hermiticity, we construct several symmetric, frustration-free, gapped Hamiltonians with real spectra and analyse their ground state subspaces. Our study reveals two intriguing phenomena. First, we identify an $\mathbb{S}^1$-parametrised family of symmetric states, all of which belong to the same gapped phase with respect to the invertible subsymmetry, yet transform inequivalently under the non-semisimple symmetry. Second, we find a model where a product state and the so-called W state spontaneously break the symmetry. We further relate the indistinguishability of these two states in the infinite-volume limit to the notion that they are associated with a simple object and its projective cover, respectively, in a non-semisimple module category.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that bi-frequency solitary waves are generically present in fermionic systems with scalar self-interaction, such as the Dirac--Klein--Gordon system and the Soler model. We develop the approach to stability properties of such waves and use the radial reduction to show that indeed the (linear) stability is available. We conjecture that stable bi-frequency modes serve as storages of the Dark Matter.</description>

      <title>A novel BPS bound with a first order BPS system in the $2D$ Gross-Pitaevskii equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A novel BPS bound for the Gross-Pitaevskii equations in two spatial dimensions is presented. The energy can be bound from below in terms of the combination of two boundary terms, one related to the vorticity (but ``dressed'' by the condensate profile) and the second to the ``skewness'' of the configurations. The bound is saturated by configurations which satisfy a system of two first-order PDE: when such BPS system is satisfied, the Gross-Pitaevskii equations are satisfied as well. The analytic solutions of this BPS system constructed in the present manuscript represent configurations with fractional vorticity living in an annulus. Using these techniques, we present the first analytic examples of this kind. The hydrodynamical interpretation of the BPS system is discussed. The implications of these results are outlined.</description>

      <title>Dephasing-tolerant quantum sensing for transverse magnetic fields with spin qudits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a dephasing-tolerant protocol for quantum sensing of transverse magnetic fields which exploits spin qudit sensors with embedded fault-tolerant (FT) quantum error correction. By exploiting longitudinal drives, the transverse field induces logical Rabi oscillations between encoded states, whose frequency is linear in the transverse field to be probed. Numerical simulations show that the present FT protocol enables the detection of very small fields, orders of magnitudes below the limit imposed by the coherence time.</description>

Abstract: We unveil the impact of the $\theta$-angle on the QCD phase diagram at nonzero isospin and strangeness chemical potentials for three light flavors and different quark mass ratios. We establish the phase boundaries as well as the nature of the associated phase transitions. The order parameters and the physical spectrum in the different phases are determined. We further elucidate the physics around $\theta=\pi$ where we discover a novel parity-preserving superfluid phase. Finally, we comment on Dashen's phenomenon in the superfluid phases when varying the number of light flavors.</description>

      <title>The probability for chiral oscillation of Majorana neutrino in Quantum Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the probability for chiral oscillation of Majorana neutrinos based on quantum field theory. Since the Hamiltonian under the Majorana mass term does not conserve lepton number, the eigenstates of lepton number change continuously over time. Therefore, the transition amplitude is described by the inner product of the eigenstates of lepton number at the time of the neutrino production and the detection. With the Bogoliubov transformation, we successfully relates the lepton number eigenstates at different times. This method enables us to understand the time variation of lepton number induced by chiral oscillations in terms of transition probabilities. We also present the physical picture that emerges through the Bogoliubov transformation.</description>

      <title>The effective phase space and $e$-folding of the Starobinsky and extended Starobinsky model of inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For zero spatial curvature, cosmological phase space of Starobinsky and extended Starobinsky inflationary model show three apparent attractors; the fixed angle attractor in the large field limit, the final attractor representing reheating phase in the small field region, and the apparent attractor corresponding to the slow-roll condition connecting between the large-field and small-field region. To consider the total $e$-folding likelihood of the model, Remmen-Carroll conserved measure is constructed and normalized. Using the measure, the total e-folding number $N$ and its expectation value $\left\langle N \right\rangle$ are calculated. We found that $\left\langle N \right\rangle = 62.37$ for ultraviolet cutoff $\phi_{\rm UV}=50 M^{*}_{\rm Pl}$ in the Starobinsky model. For extended Starobinsky model with additional $R^3$ term parametrized by a coupling $\alpha$, the expectation value shifted to lower values $\left\langle N \right\rangle = 4.03, 61.4$ for $\alpha = 10^{-4},10^{-35}$ respectively.</description>

      <title>Reflections of topological properties in the planar-Hall response for semimetals carrying pseudospin-1 quantum numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We continue our investigations of the nature of the linear-response tensors in planar-Hall and planar-thermal Hall configurations, involving three-dimensional nodal-point semimetals, by considering here nodes hosting pseudospin-1 quasiparticles. Such systems exemplify multifold semimetals, as they have three bands crossing at a nodal point. We derive the explicit expressions of the electric, thermoelectric, and thermal coefficients, when the nodes are subjected to the combined influence of an electric field (and/or temperature gradient) and a weak (i.e., nonquantizing) magnetic field. In order to have a complete description, we consider the effects of the Berry curvature and the orbital magnetic moment on an equal footing, both of which originate from the underlying topological features of the bandstructure. Going beyond our previous works, we determine the out-of-plane response comprising the intrinsic anomalous-Hall and the Lorentz-force-contributed currents, and chalk out the effects of internode-scatterings as well. Our theoretical explorations shed light on the mechanisms of transport in multifold semetals, which are being investigated in contemporary experiments.</description>

      <title>Effective action for relativistic hydrodynamics from Crooks fluctuation theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new effective theory framework for fluctuating hydrodynamics in the relativistic regime is derived using standard thermodynamical principles and general properties of non-equilibrium stochastic dynamics. For the first time, we establish clear and concise conditions for ensuring that the resulting effective theories are causal, stable, and well-posed within general relativity. These properties are independent of spacetime foliation and are valid in the full nonlinear regime. Out-of-equilibrium fluctuations are constrained by a relativistically covariant version of Crooks fluctuation theorem, which determines how the entropy production is distributed even when the system is driven by an external force. This leads to an emerging $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry responsible for imposing fluctuation-dissipation relations for n-point correlation functions, which matches the standard constraints for the Schwinger-Keldysh effective action.</description>

      <title>Resistive relativistic magnetohydrodynamics without Amperes Law</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Resistive magnetohydrodynamics is thought to play a key role in transient astrophysical phenomena such as black hole flares and neutron star magnetospheres. When performing numerical simulations of resistive magnetohydrodynamics, one is faced with the issue that Amperes law becomes stiff in the high conductivity limit which poses challenges to the numerical evolution. We show that using a description of resistive magnetohydrodynamics based on higher form symmetry, one can perform simulations with a generalized dual Faraday tensor without having to use Amperes Law, thereby avoiding the stiffness problem. We also explain the relation of this dual model to a traditional description of resistive magnetohydrodynamics and how causality is guaranteed by introducing second order corrections.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Perturbations from a New Approach to Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a previous paper we proposed a new approach to the beginning of inflation -- a lingering universe. The universe begins in a lingering state with a nearly vanishing Hubble parameter. This calls into question the absolute age of the universe, as the Hubble time can be nearly infinite. It also provides promise for addressing the initial singularity of inflation and issues with quantum field theory in de Sitter space-time. Such models arise in classical cosmologies with non-vanishing spatial curvature (inspired by PLANCK 2018 data), and independently by models that arise in string cosmology. In this paper, we consider the importance of cosmological perturbations for the stability of the lingering phase and how this influences cosmological observations. Our goal is to establish observables in this new paradigm for the origin of inflation which is in contrast to eternal inflation and cyclic cosmologies. We also address questions of stability and the transition to inflation.</description>

Abstract: We study some aspects of the de Sitter version of Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity. Though we do not have propagating gravitons, we have a boundary mode when we compute observables with a fixed dilaton and metric at the boundary. We compute the no-boundary wavefunctions and probability measures to all orders in perturbation theory. We also discuss contributions from different topologies, borrowing recent results by Saad, Shenker and Stanford. We discuss how the boundary mode leads to gravitational corrections to cosmological observables when we add matter. Finally, starting from a four dimensional gravity theory with a positive cosmological constant, we consider a nearly extremal black hole and argue that some observables are dominated by the two dimensional nearly de Sitter gravity dynamics.</description>

      <title>Type-B Anomaly Matching and the 6D (2,0) Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.05827</link>
      <description>arXiv:1911.05827v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study type-B conformal anomalies associated with $\frac{1}{2}$-BPS Coulomb-branch operators in 4D $\mathcal N=2$ superconformal field theories. When the vacuum preserves the conformal symmetry these anomalies coincide with the two-point function coefficients in the Coulomb-branch chiral ring. They are non-trivial functions of exactly-marginal couplings that can be determined from the $S^4$ partition function. In this paper, we examine the fate of these anomalies in vacua of the Higgs-branch moduli space, where conformal symmetry is spontaneously broken. We argue non-perturbatively that these anomalies are covariantly constant on conformal manifolds. In some cases, this can be used to show that they match in the broken and unbroken phases. Thus, we uncover a new class of data on the Higgs branch of 4D $\mathcal N=2$ conformal field theories that are exactly computable. An interesting application of this matching occurs in $\mathcal N=2$ circular quivers that deconstruct the 6D (2,0) theory on a torus. In that context, we argue that 4D supersymmetric localisation can be used to calculate non-trivial data involving $\frac{1}{2}$-BPS operators of the 6D theory as exact functions of the complex structure of the torus.</description>

      <title>(Mis-)Matching Type-B Anomalies on the Higgs Branch</title>

      <description>arXiv:2009.08375v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Building on arXiv:1911.05827, we uncover new properties of type-B conformal anomalies for Coulomb-branch operators in continuous families of 4D $\mathcal{N}=2$ SCFTs. We study a large class of such anomalies on the Higgs branch, where conformal symmetry is spontaneously broken, and compare them with their counterpart in the CFT phase. In Lagrangian theories, the non-perturbative matching of the anomalies can be determined with a weak coupling Feynman diagram computation involving massive multi-loop banana integrals. We extract the part corresponding to the anomalies of interest. Our calculations support the general conjecture that the Coulomb-branch type-B conformal anomalies always match on the Higgs branch. On the other hand, we argue that the potential mismatch of anomalies implies the existence of a second covariantly constant metric on the conformal manifold (other than the Zamolodchikov metric), which would impose restrictions on its holonomy group.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.10891v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Operators with integer scaling dimensions in even-dimensional conformal field theories exhibit well-known type-B Weyl anomalies. In general, these anomalies depend non-trivially on exactly marginal couplings. We study the corresponding fully covariantised anomaly functional on conformal manifolds in several examples. We show that a natural consequence of the Wess-Zumino consistency condition is that the anomalies are covariantly constant with respect to the exactly marginal couplings. The argument is general and applies even when the conformal symmetry is spontaneously broken on moduli spaces of vacua.</description>

      <title>Landau Theory of Causal Dynamical Triangulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.11043v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the continuum limit of a theory of discrete random geometries is a beautiful but difficult challenge. In this optic, we review here the insights that can be obtained for Causal Dynamical Triangulations (CDT) by employing the Landau approach to critical phenomena. In particular, concentrating on the cases of two and three dimensions, we will make the case that the configuration of the volume of spatial slices effectively plays the role of an order parameter, helping us to understand the phase structure of CDT. Moreover, consistency with numerical simulations of CDT provides hints that the effective field theory of the model lives in the space of theories invariant under foliation-preserving diffeomorphisms. Among such theories, Horava-Lifshitz gravity has the special status of being a perturbatively renormalizable theory, while General Relativity sits in a subspace with enhanced symmetry. In order to reach either of them, one would likely need to fine tune some of the parameters in the CDT action, or additional ones from some generalization thereof.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.17126v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a general formula for higher order corrections to the value of the Hagedorn temperature of a class of holographic confining gauge theories in the strong coupling expansion. Inspired by recent proposals in the literature, the formula combines the sigma-model string expansion with an effective approach. In particular, it includes the sigma-model contributions to the Hagedorn temperature at next-to-next-to leading order, which are computed in full generality. For ${\cal N}=4$ SYM on $S^3$ our result agrees with numerical field theory estimates with excellent precision. We use the general formula to predict the value of the Hagedorn temperature for ABJM on $S^2$ and for the dual of purely RR global $AdS_3$.</description>

Abstract: We provide an account of the issue of Gibbons-Hawking-York-like boundary terms for a gravity theory defined on a Riemman-Cartan spacetime. We further discuss different criteria for introducing boundary terms in some familiar first-order gravity theories with both on-shell vanishing and non-vanishing torsion, along with considerations regarding the thermodynamics of black holes and profiles of the End-of-the-World branes. Our analysis confirms the expected geodesic profile of the End-of-the-World brane in the BF formulation of Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity. Finally, we present the first realisation of the AdS/BCFT duality for spacetime with torsion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04393v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deformations of the heterotic superpotential give rise to a topological holomorphic theory with similarities to both Kodaira-Spencer gravity and holomorphic Chern-Simons theory. Although the action is cubic, it is only quadratic in the complex structure deformations (the Beltrami differential). Treated separately, for large fluxes, or alternatively at large distances in the background complex structure moduli space, these fields can be integrated out to obtain a new field theory in the remaining fields, which describe the complexified hermitian and gauge degrees of freedom. We investigate properties of this new holomorphic theory, and in particular connections to the swampland distance conjecture in the context of heterotic string theory. In the process, we define a new type of symplectic cohomology theory, where the background complex structure Beltrami differential plays the role of the symplectic form.</description>

Abstract: In contradistinction to the case of massive excitations, the connection between integrability and the tree-level massless scattering matrix of integrable $\sigma$-models is lost. Namely, in well-known 2-d integrable models the tree-level massless S-matrix exhibits particle production and fails to factorise. This is conjectured to happen due to IR ambiguities in the massless tree-level amplitudes. We present a definition of the massless S-matrix which has all the nice properties of integrable theories, there is no particle production and the S-matrix factorises. As an example, we present in detail the case of the $SU(2)$ principal chiral model (PCM).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07464v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we explore the transformation of $D_p$-branes to $D_{p-1}$-branes under T-duality when the $D$-brane is embedded in a spacetime with a boundary. Our goal is to derive the higher-derivative corrections to the Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) Lagrangian for both the bulk and boundary terms.
  For the bulk terms, we calculate the $\alpha'$ corrections for the massless open string fields, up to the 8th order in the dimensionless Maxwell field strength. We demonstrate that the bulk Lagrangian can satisfy the T-duality constraint without residual total derivative terms in the base space. This determines the most general independent couplings of the massless open string fields in the bulk Lagrangian, encompassing 145 coupling constants, up to three parameters. Two of these parameters are physical and are determined by disk-level S-matrix elements, while the third is unphysical and can be eliminated by field redefinitions and integration by parts. The final result for the bulk Lagrangian consists of 49 couplings.
  For the boundary terms, applying T-duality symmetry to the massless open string field allows us to extend the DBI Lagrangian to incorporate the extrinsic curvature of the boundary.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07350v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We illustrate the main points behind the computation of the gravitational wave spectrum originated from a phase in the early universe where the energy density is dominated by highly excited fundamental string degrees of freedom - a Hagedorn phase. This phase is described using the Boltzmann equation approach to string thermodynamics, which we illustrate via a toy model which permits analytic computations for the evolution of perturbations. This window into the out-of-equilibrium regime allows us to compute equilibration rates and conclude that, in realistic scenarios, long, open strings dominate the ensemble, source gravitational waves and provide a succesful reheating. Furthermore, we compare the results against the Standard Model prediction for a gravitational wave background of thermal origin and conclude that the string prediction is larger. This is one of the few cases in which a signal of stringy origin dominates over the field theory analogue. This work is based on arXiv:2310.11494 and arXiv:2408.13803 and is a contribution to the Proceedings of the 29th symposium on Particles, Strings and Cosmology (PASCOS 2024).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09406v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of \textit{left-right relative entropy} as a measure of distinguishability within the space of boundary states. We compute the left-right relative entropy for reduced density matrices by tracing over either the right- or left-moving modes, deriving a universal formula for two arbitrary, regularized boundary states in conformal field theories (CFTs) on a circle. Furthermore, we provide a detailed expression of the left-right relative entropy for diagonal CFTs with specific boundary state choices, utilizing the theory's modular $\mathcal{S}$ matrix. We also present a general formula for the left-right sandwiched R\'enyi relative entropy and the left-right quantum fidelity. Through explicit calculations in specific models, including the Ising model, the tricritical Ising model, and the $\widehat{su}(2)_{\tilde{k}}$ WZW model, we have made an intriguing finding: zero left-right relative entropy between certain boundary states, despite their apparent differences. Notably, we introduce the concept of the \textit{relative entanglement sector}, representing the set of boundary states with zero left-right relative entropy. Our findings suggest a profound connection between the relative entanglement sector and the underlying symmetry properties of the boundary states, offering the relative entanglement sector transforms as NIM-reps of a global symmetry of the underlying theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11626v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider two supersymmetric M5 brane probe solutions in $\textrm{AdS}_7 \times S^4$ and one in $\textrm{AdS}_4 \times S^7$ that all have the $\textrm{AdS}_3 \times S^3$ world-volume geometry. The values of the classical action of the first two M5 probes (with $S^3$ in $\textrm{AdS}_7$ or in $S^4$) are related to the leading $N^2$ parts in the anomaly b-coefficient in the (2,0) theory corresponding to a spherical surface defect in symmetric or antisymmetric $SU(N)$ representations. We present a detailed computation of the corresponding one-loop M5 brane partition functions finding that they vanish (in a particular regularization). This implies the vanishing of the order $N^0$ part in the b-anomaly coefficients, in agreement with earlier predictions for their exact values. It remains, however, a puzzle of how to reproduce the non-vanishing order $N$ terms in these coefficients within the semiclassical M5-brane probe setup.</description>

Abstract: The IR dynamics of SYK is that of the Schwarzian theory, the effective theory of broken reparametrization invariance. In the double scaling limit, SYK is completely solvable by chord diagrams, whose generating functional is a bilocal Liouville theory. At low temperatures a set of modes in this description becomes soft. We interpret them as reparametrization of some twisted time coordinates, and show explicitly that they lead to the nonlinear Schwarzian theory. We further consider deformations of the theory in the double scaling limit, giving rise to diagrams with multiple species of chords, and show that the generating functional is now a Liouville theory with multiple fields. These deformations can be tracked to the IR and we discuss how they affect the Schwarzian.</description>

      <title>Schwinger particle production: Rapid switch off of the external field versus dynamical assistance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.15626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.15626v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the process of electron-positron pair production in the presence of strong electric backgrounds being rapidly switched on and off and examine the total particle yield. For sufficiently sharp field profiles, the particle number can be substantially enhanced. It is demonstrated that this enhancement is quite similar to the phenomenon of dynamical assistance by a weak high-frequency field superimposed on a strong background. Both these mechanisms are analyzed by means of exact numerical computations, worldline instanton approach, and the locally-constant field approximation. We identify the time scale of the switching profile leading to the pair-production enhancement and argue that the particle yield is highly unlikely to be increased by shaping the switch off of realistic laser pulses. On the other hand, we confirm that it is feasible to observe the dynamically assisted Schwinger effect by adding a rapidly oscillating field to a strong electric background.</description>

      <title>From vertex operator superalgebras to graded-local conformal nets and back</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.14263v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We generalize the Carpi-Kawahigashi-Longo-Weiner correspondence between vertex operator algebras and conformal nets to the case of vertex operator superalgebras and graded-local conformal nets by introducing the notion of strongly graded-local vertex operator superalgebra. Then we apply our machinery to a number of well-known examples including superconformal field theory models. We also prove that all lattice VOSAs are strongly graded-local. Furthermore, we prove strong graded-locality of the super-Moonshine VOSA, whose group of automorphisms preserving the superconformal structure is isomorphic to Conway's largest sporadic simple group, and of the shorter Moonshine VOSA, whose automorphisms group is isomorphic to the direct product of the baby Monster with a cyclic group of order two.</description>

      <title>Quantum complexity phase transitions in monitored random circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.15475v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, the dynamics of quantum systems that involve both unitary evolution and quantum measurements have attracted attention due to the exotic phenomenon of measurement-induced phase transitions. The latter refers to a sudden change in a property of a state of $n$ qubits, such as its entanglement entropy, depending on the rate at which individual qubits are measured. At the same time, quantum complexity emerged as a key quantity for the identification of complex behaviour in quantum many-body dynamics. In this work, we investigate the dynamics of the quantum state complexity in monitored random circuits, where $n$ qubits evolve according to a random unitary circuit and are individually measured with a fixed probability at each time step. We find that the evolution of the exact quantum state complexity undergoes a phase transition when changing the measurement rate. Below a critical measurement rate, the complexity grows at least linearly in time until saturating to a value $e^{\Omega(n)}$. Above, the complexity does not exceed $\operatorname{poly}(n)$. In our proof, we make use of percolation theory to find paths along which an exponentially long quantum computation can be run below the critical rate, and to identify events where the state complexity is reset to zero above the critical rate. We lower bound the exact state complexity in the former regime using recently developed techniques from algebraic geometry. Our results combine quantum complexity growth, phase transitions, and computation with measurements to help understand the behavior of monitored random circuits and to make progress towards determining the computational power of measurements in many-body systems.</description>

Abstract: The index bundle of a family of Dirac operators associated to an instanton on a multi-Taub-NUT space forms a bow representation. We prove that the gauge equivalence classes of solutions of this bow representation are in one-to-one correspondence with the instantons.
  We also prove that this correspondence establishes an isometry of the bow and instanton moduli spaces.</description>

      <title>Quantum Modularity for a Closed Hyperbolic 3-Manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.03265v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proves quantum modularity of both functions from $\mathbb{Q}$ and $q$-series associated to the closed manifold obtained by $-\frac{1}{2}$ surgery on the figure-eight knot, $4_1(-1,2)$. In a sense, this is a companion to work of Garoufalidis-Zagier, where similar statements were studied in detail for some simple knots. It is shown that quantum modularity for closed manifolds provides a unification of Chen-Yang's volume conjecture with Witten's asymptotic expansion conjecture. Additionally we show that $4_1(-1,2)$ is a counterexample to previous conjectures of Gukov-Manolescu relating the Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev invariant and the $\widehat{Z}(q)$ series. This could be reformulated in terms of a "strange identity", which gives a volume conjecture for the $\widehat{Z}$ invariant. Using factorisation of state integrals, we give conjectural but precise $q$-hypergeometric formulae for generating series of Stokes constants of this manifold. We find that the generating series of Stokes constants is related to the 3d index of $4_1(-1,2)$ proposed by Gang-Yonekura. This extends the equivalent conjecture of Garoufalidis-Gu-Mari\~no for knots to closed manifolds. This work appeared in a similar form in the author's Ph.D. Thesis.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Implications of the Kerr Multipole Moments for Spinning Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18421v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Previously the linearized stress tensor of a stationary Kerr black hole has been used to determine some of the values of gravitational couplings for a spinning black hole to linear order in the Riemann tensor in the action (worldline or quantum field theory). In particular, the couplings on operators containing derivative structures of the form $(S\cdot\nabla)^n$ acting on the Riemann tensor were fixed, with $S^\mu$ the spin vector of the black hole. In this paper we find that the Kerr solution determines all of the multipole moments in the sense of Dixon of a stationary spinning black hole and that these multipole moments determine all linear in $R$ couplings. For example, additional couplings beyond the previously mentioned are fixed on operators containing derivative structures of the form $S^{2n}(p\cdot\nabla)^{2n}$ acting on the Riemann tensor with $p^\mu$ the momentum vector of the black hole. These additional operators do not contribute to the three-point amplitude, and so do no contribute to the linearized stress tensor for a stationary black hole. However, we find that they do contribute to the Compton amplitude. Additionally, we derive formal expressions for the electromagnetic and gravitational Compton amplitudes of generic spinning bodies to all orders in spin in the worldline formalism and evaluated expressions for these amplitudes to order $S^3$ in electromagnetism and order $S^5$ in gravity.</description>

      <title>Exact quantization of topological order parameter in SU($N$) spin models, $N$-ality transformation and ingappabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05407v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the ground-state expectation value of twisting operator is a topological order parameter for $\text{U}(1)$- and $\mathbb{Z}_{N}$-symmetric symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases in one-dimensional "spin" systems -- it is quantized in the thermodynamic limit and can be used to identify different SPT phases and to diagnose phase transitions among them. We prove that this (non-local) order parameter must take values in $N$-th roots of unity, and its value can be changed by a generalized lattice translation acting as an $N$-ality transformation connecting distinct phases. This result also implies the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis ingappability for SU($N$) spins if we further impose a general translation symmetry. Furthermore, our exact result for the order parameter of SPT phases can predict a large number of LSM ingappabilities by the general lattice translation. We also apply the $N$-ality property to provide an efficient way to construct possible multi-critical phase transitions starting from a single Hamiltonian with a unique gapped ground state.</description>

      <title>On the singular position-dependent mass</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05899v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Revisiting the issue associated with Position-Dependent Mass (PDM), we reaffirm that the appropriate framework for addressing a generic PDM is the symmetrization proposed by BenDaniel and Duke. To accomplish this result adopts the effective mass Hamiltonian proposed by von Roos, corrected by a symmetrized kinematic term. After verifying the appropriate ordering to approach the PDM issue, one investigates a crystalline lattice with a defect described by a singular PDM. The singular mass profile proves intriguing as it yields an atom's cluster in the neighborhood of the singularity. Considering that a restoring force acts on the atoms, one notes that the confluent Heun function describes the quantum states. Furthermore, one highlights that when the effective mass distribution tends to a constant profile, we recover a system similar to the harmonic oscillator.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic and observational constraints on black holes with primary hair in Beyond Horndeski Gravity: Stability and shadows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07312v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we find that unlike in General Relativity, the shift-symmetric subclass of Beyond Horndeski theories permits black holes with primary hair that are thermodynamically stable and align with current Event Horizon Telescope observations of the M87* and Sgr A* black holes. This work begins by investigating thermodynamic properties, analyzing how primary hair influences thermodynamic quantities and local stability, which imposes strict constraints on the allowed range of primary hair values. The null geodesics near this black hole are then examined, demonstrating how scalar hair affects the shadow diameter. Specifically, when the parameter of the Beyond Horndeski function $F_4$ is negative, increasing scalar hair enlarges the shadow; in contrast, when this parameter is positive, greater scalar hair reduces the shadow size. Further constraints on the scalar hair are derived using observational data, highlighting its sensitivity to other black hole parameters. To explore additional observational features, face-on two-dimensional images of spherically infalling accretion disks are simulated, revealing how primary scalar hair shapes the black hole's shadow. Finally, all relevant constraints are combined to identify black holes that are both stable and consistent with observational data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19109v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Effective String Theory (EST) is a powerful tool used to study confinement in pure gauge theories by modeling the confining flux tube connecting a static quark-anti-quark pair as a thin vibrating string. Recently, flow-based samplers have been applied as an efficient numerical method to study EST regularized on the lattice, opening the route to study observables previously inaccessible to standard analytical methods. Flow-based samplers are a class of algorithms based on Normalizing Flows (NFs), deep generative models recently proposed as a promising alternative to traditional Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods in lattice field theory calculations. By combining NF layers with out-of-equilibrium stochastic updates, we obtain Stochastic Normalizing Flows (SNFs), a scalable class of machine learning algorithms that can be explained in terms of stochastic thermodynamics. In this contribution, we outline EST and SNFs, and report some numerical results for the shape of the flux tube.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00091v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Direct searches for sub-GeV dark matter are limited by the intrinsic quantum properties of the target material. In this proof-of-concept study, we argue that this problem is particularly well suited for machine learning. We demonstrate that a simple neural architecture consisting of a variational autoencoder and a multi-layer perceptron can efficiently generate unique molecules with desired properties. In specific, the energy threshold and signal (quantum) efficiency determine the minimum mass and cross section to which a detector can be sensitive. Organic molecules present a particularly interesting class of materials with intrinsically anisotropic electronic responses and $\mathcal{O}$(few) eV excitation energies. However, the space of possible organic compounds is intractably large, which makes traditional database screening challenging. We adopt excitation energies and proxy transition matrix elements as target properties learned by our network. Our model is able to generate molecules that are not in even the most expansive quantum chemistry databases and predict their relevant properties for high-throughput and efficient screening. Following a massive generation of novel molecules, we use clustering analysis to identify some of the most promising molecular structures that optimise the desired molecular properties for dark matter detection.</description>

      <title>Effective field theories for dark matter pairs in the early universe: Debye mass effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03327v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In some scenarios for the early universe, non-relativistic thermal dark matter chemically decouples from the thermal environment once the temperature drops well below the dark matter mass. The value at which the energy density freezes out depends on the underlying model. In a simple setting, we provide a comprehensive study of heavy fermionic dark matter interacting with the light degrees of freedom of a dark thermal sector whose temperature $T$ decreases from an initial value close to the freeze-out temperature. Different temperatures imply different hierarchies of energy scales. By exploiting the methods of non-relativistic effective field theories at finite $T$, we systematically determine the thermal and in-vacuum interaction rates. In particular, we address the impact of the Debye mass on the observables and ultimately on the dark matter relic abundance. We numerically compare the corrections to the present energy density originating from the resummation of Debye mass effects with the corrections coming from a next-to-leading order treatment of the bath-particle interactions. We observe that the fixed-order calculation of the inelastic heavy-light scattering at high temperatures provides a larger dark matter depletion, and hence an undersized yield for given benchmark points in the parameter space, with respect to the calculation where Debye mass effects are resummed.</description>
