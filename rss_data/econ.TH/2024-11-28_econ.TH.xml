      <title>Independence and indifferent points imply continuity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The expected utility theorem of von Neumann and Morgenstern (1947) has been a milestone in economics, describing rational behavior by two axioms on a weak preference on lotteries on a finite set of outcomes: the Independence Axiom and the Continuity Axiom. For a weak preference fulfilling the Independence Axiom, I prove that continuity is equivalent to the existence of a set indifferent lotteries spanning a hyperplane.</description>

      <title>Remote Surgery with 5G or 6G: Knowledge Production and Diffusion Globally and in the German Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is a comprehensive exploring of technology capability in 5G/6G TIS, explicitly focusing on the potential of remote surgery globally and in Germany. The paper's main contribution is its ability to anticipate new debates on the interplay between TIS and contexts, with particular emphasis on the national and international levels. Our findings, derived from a Bibliometrics study of industry-academic relationships, highlight crucial collaborations in Germany, positioning the country as a strategic actor in international TIS and, by extension, in applying 5G/6G technological systems to remote surgery due to its knowledge production capability. We propose policies that can stimulate interaction between smaller suppliers and larger companies, which can act as intermediaries and provide access to international markets.</description>

      <title>Household Resource Allocation Dynamics and Policies: Integrating Future Earnings of Children, Fertility, Pension, Health, and Education</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a model that examines how families make decisions about having children, managing resources, and planning for their financial security in light of social and economic factors. It explores the balance between the number of children and the quality of life parents wish to provide, including education and future income prospects. By considering parents' expectations about their children's future earnings, the model gives new insights into how families allocate their resources. It also looks at how decisions about savings and pensions are connected to daily spending and family planning, showing the complex links between these factors. The findings offer valuable guidance for policies that address these interrelated challenges and better support families in managing their resources.</description>

      <title>Temporary exclusion in repeated contests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06257v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider a population of agents who repeatedly compete for awards, as in the case of researchers annually applying for grants. Noise in the selection process may encourage entry of low quality proposals, forcing the principal to commit large resources to reviewing applications and further increasing award misallocation. A \emph{temporary exclusion} policy prohibits an agent from applying in the current period if they were rejected in the previous. We compare the steady state equilibria of the games with and without exclusion. Whenever the benefit from winning is sufficiently large exclusion results in more self-selection, eliminating entry of low quality applications. We extend the analysis to more general exclusion policies. We also show that exclusion has a distributional effect, where better able agents exhibit more self-selection.</description>

      <title>When is Trust Robust?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12917v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine an economy in which interactions are more productive if agents can trust others to refrain from cheating. Some agents are scoundrels, who cheat at every opportunity, while others cheat only if the cost of cheating, a decreasing function of the proportion of cheaters, is sufficiently low. The economy exhibits multiple equilibria. As the proportion of scoundrels in the economy declines, the high-trust equilibrium can be disrupted by arbitrarily small perturbations or by arbitrarily small infusions of low-trust agents, while the low-trust equilibrium becomes impervious to perturbations and infusions of high-trust agents. Scoundrels may thus have the effect of making trust more robust.</description>
