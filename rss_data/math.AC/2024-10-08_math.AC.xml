      <title>On $\phi$-Pr\"ufer like conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the question of when a $\phi$-ring is $\phi$-Pr\"ufer using two types of techniques: first, by analysing the lattice structure of the nonnil ideals of $\phi$-rings; and secondly, by considering content ideal techniques which were developed to study Gaussian polynomials. In particular, we conclude that every Gaussian $\phi$-ring is $\phi$-Pr\"ufer. Key concepts such as $\phi$-weak global dimension, primary ideals and irreducible ideals are discussed, along with their hereditary properties in $\phi$-Pr\"ufer rings. We also prove that any semi-local $\phi$-Pr\"ufer ring is a $\phi$-B\'ezout ring. This paper includes several theorems and examples that provide insights into the $\phi$-Pr\"ufer rings and their implications in the field of ring theory.</description>

      <title>An Effective Positivstellensatz over the Rational Numbers for Finite Semialgebraic Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of representing multivariate polynomials with rational coefficients, which are nonnegative and strictly positive on finite semialgebraic sets, using rational sums of squares.
  We focus on the case of finite semialgebraic sets S defined by equality constraints, generating a zero-dimensional ideal I, and by nonnegative sign constraints.
  First, we obtain existential results. We prove that a strictly positive polynomial f with coefficients in a subfield K of R has a representation in terms of weighted Sums-of-Squares with coefficients in this field, even if the ideal I is not radical. We generalize this result to the case where f is nonnegative on S and (f ) + (I : f ) = 1. We deduce that nonnegative polynomials with coefficients in K can be represented in terms of Sum-of-Squares of polynomials with coefficients in K, when the ideal is radical.
  Second, we obtain degree bounds for such Sums-of-Squares representations, which depend linearly on the regularity of the ideal and the degree of the defining equations, when they form a graded basis.
  Finally, we analyze the bit complexity of the Sums-of-Squares representations for polynomials with coefficients in Q, in the case the ideal is radical. The bitsize bounds are quadratic or cubic in the Bezout bound, and linear in the regularity, generalizing and improving previous results obtained for special zero dimensional ideals.
  As an application in the context of polynomial optimization, we retrieve and improve results on the finite convergence and exactness of the moment/Sums-of-Squares hierarchy.</description>

      <title>Primitive Divisors of Lucas Sequences in Polynomial Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is known that all terms $U_n$ of a classical regular Lucas sequence have a primitive prime divisor if $n&gt;30$. In addition, a complete description of all regular Lucas sequences and their terms $U_n$, $2\leq n\leq 30$, which do not have a primitive divisor is also known. Here, we prove comparable results for Lucas sequences in polynomial rings, correcting some previous theorem on the same subject. The first part of our paper develops some elements of Lucas theory in several abstract settings before proving our main theorem in polynomial rings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the chain algebra of a finite distributive lattice introduced in \cite{GN} to that of a finite pure poset. We prove that such an algebra is also normal and then present an explicit description of its canonical module. Additionally, we provide a formula for its Krull dimension, thereby extending one of main results of \cite{GN}. For a pure poset $P$ of width 2, we compute the regularity of the chain algebra of $P$ and describe the conditions under which it is either Gorenstein or nearly Gorenstein.</description>

      <title>Finitistic dimensions over commutative DG-rings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2204.06865v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study the finitistic dimensions of commutative noetherian non-positive DG-rings with finite amplitude. We prove that any DG-module $M$ of finite flat dimension over such a DG-ring satisfies $\mathrm{projdim}_A(M) \leq \mathrm{dim}(\mathrm{H}^0 (A)) - \inf(M)$. We further provide explicit constructions of DG-modules with prescribed projective dimension and deduce that the big finitistic projective dimension satisfies the bounds $\mathrm{dim}(\mathrm{H}^0 (A)) - \mathrm{amp}(A) \leq \mathsf{FPD}(A) \leq \mathrm{dim}(\mathrm{H}^0(A))$. Moreover, we prove that DG-rings exist which achieve either bound. As a direct application, we prove new vanishing results for the derived Hochschild (co)homology of homologically smooth algebras.</description>

      <title>Differentiably simple rings and ring extensions defined by $p$-basis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.09125v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We review the concept of differentiably simple ring and we give a new proof of Harper's Theorem on the characterization of Noetherian differentiably simple rings in positive characteristic. We then study flat families of differentiably simple rings, or equivalently, finite flat extensions of rings which locally admit $p$-basis. These extensions are called "Galois extensions of exponent one". For such an extension $A\subset C$, we introduce an $A$-scheme, called the "Yuan scheme", which parametrizes subextensions $A\subset B\subset C$ such that $B\subset C$ is Galois of a fixed rank. So, roughly, the Yuan scheme can be thought of as a kind of Grassmannian of Galois subextensions. We finally prove that the Yuan scheme is smooth and compute the dimension of the fibers.</description>

      <title>K\"ahler differentials of extensions of valuation rings and deeply ramified fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.04967v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Assume that $(L,v)$ is a finite Galois extension of a valued field $(K,v)$. We give an explicit construction of the valuation ring $\mathcal O_L$ of $L$ as an $\mathcal O_K$-algebra, and an explicit description of the module of relative K\"ahler differentials $\Omega_{\mathcal O_L|\mathcal O_K}$ when $L|K$ is a Kummer extension of prime degree or an Artin-Schreier extension, in terms of invariants of the valuation and field extension. The case when this extension has nontrivial defect was solved in a recent paper by the authors with Anna Rzepka. The present paper deals with the complementary (defectless) case. The results are known classically for (rank 1) discrete valuations, but our systematic approach to non-discrete valuations (even of rank 1) is new. We also show that the annihilator of $\Omega_{\mathcal O_L|\mathcal O_K}$ can only be equal to the maximal ideal $\mathcal M_L$ of $\mathcal O_L$ if the extension is defectless and $\mathcal M_L$ is principal.
  Using our results from the prime degree case, we characterize when $\Omega_{\mathcal O_L|\mathcal O_K}=0$ holds for an arbitrary finite Galois extension of valued fields. As an application of these results, we give a simple proof of a theorem of Gabber and Ramero, which characterizes when a valued field is deeply ramified. We further give a simple characterization of deeply ramified fields with residue fields of characteristic $p&gt;0$ in terms of the K\"ahler differentials of Galois extensions of degree $p$.</description>

      <title>On circuit binomials of toric ideals of weighted oriented graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16841v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we classify the circuit binomials of any weighted oriented graph $D$ and we explicitly compute the circuit binomials of $D$ in terms of the minors of the incidence matrix of $D$. We show that the circuit binomials of any weighted oriented graph $D$ are the primitive binomials corresponding to one of the classes: (i) a balanced cycle, (ii) two unbalanced cycles sharing a vertex, (iii) two unbalanced cycles connected by a path, (iv) two unbalanced cycles sharing a path. We explicitly prove a formula for the primitive binomial generator of the toric ideal $I_D$ in terms of the minors of the incidence matrix of $D$, where $D$ is as in (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv). Thus we explicitly compute all the circuit binomials $\C_D$ of any weighted oriented graph $D$. If $D$ is a weighted oriented graph which has at most two unbalanced cycles such that no two balanced cycles share a path in $D$ and no balanced cycle in $D$ shares an edge with the path which connects the two unbalanced cycles in $D$ if it exists, then we show that $I_D$ is a strongly robust circuit ideal and it has complete intersection initial ideal. For this class of ideals, we explicitly compute the Betti numbers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02041v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let \( R \) be a commutative ring with identity, and let \( S \) be a multiplicative subset of \( R \). In this paper, we introduce the notion of \( S \)-injective modules as a weak version of injective modules. Among other results, we provide an \( S \)-version of Baer's characterization of injective modules. We also present an \( S \)-version of Lambek's characterization of flat modules: an \( R \)-module \( M \) is \( S \)-flat if and only if its character, \( \text{Hom}_{\mathbb{Z}}(M, \mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}) \), is an \( S \)-injective \( R \)-module. As applications, we establish, under certain conditions, \( S \)-counterparts of the Cartan--Eilenberg-Bass and Cheatham--Stone characterizations of Noetherian rings.</description>

      <title>Purely Inseparable ring extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01056v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the concept of special algebras, also known as \textit{purely inseparable ring extensions}. This concept extends the notion of purely inseparable field extensions to the more general context of extensions of commutative rings. We use differential operators methods to provide a characterization for a ring extension to be purely inseparable in terms of a condition on certain modules of differential operators associated to the ring extension. This approach is also used to recover an already known characterization involving the modules of principal parts.
  Next, given a purely inseparable ring extension $A\subset C$, we aim to understand which intermediate rings $A\subset B\subset C$ satisfy the property that both $A\subset B$ and $B\subset C$ are both flat extensions by considering only the subalgebra $\operatorname{End}_B(C)$ of $\operatorname{End}_A(C)$. To achieve this, we prove a generalization of the Jacobson-Bourbaki theorem on Galois correspondence for field extensions to the setting of commutative ring extensions with homeomorphic spectra.
  Finally, given a tower of ring extensions $A\subset B\subset C$, we consider the question of whether the fact that two of the three extensions $A\subset C$, $A\subset B$, and $B\subset C$ are purely inseparable implies that the third one is also purely inseparable.</description>

      <title>Symbolic-numeric algorithm for parameter estimation in discrete-time models with $\exp$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.16220v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dynamic models describe phenomena across scientific disciplines, yet to make these models useful in application the unknown parameter values of the models must be determined. Discrete-time dynamic models are widely used to model biological processes, but it is often difficult to determine these parameters. In this paper, we propose a symbolic-numeric approach for parameter estimation in discrete-time models that involve univariate non-algebraic (locally) analytic functions such as exp. We illustrate the performance (precision) of our approach by applying our approach to two archetypal discrete-time models in biology (the flour beetle 'LPA' model and discrete Lotka-Volterra competition model). Unlike optimization-based methods, our algorithm guarantees to find all solutions of the parameter values up to a specified precision given time-series data for the measured variables provided that there are finitely many parameter values that fit the data and that the used polynomial system solver can find all roots of the associated polynomial system with interval coefficients.</description>
