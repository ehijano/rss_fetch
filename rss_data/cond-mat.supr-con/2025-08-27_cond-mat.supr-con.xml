      <title>High-throughput superconducting $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ predictions through density of states rescaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: First principles computational methods can predict the superconducting critical temperature $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ of conventional superconductors through the electron-phonon spectral function. Full convergence of this quantity requires Brillouin zone integration on very dense grids, presenting a bottleneck to high-throughput screening for high $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ systems. In this work, we show that an electron-phonon spectral function calculated at low cost on a coarse grid yields accurate $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ predictions, provided the function is rescaled to correct for the inaccurate value of the density of states at the Fermi energy on coarser grids. Compared to standard approaches, the method converges rapidly and improves the accuracy of predictions for systems with sharp features in the density of states. This approach can be directly integrated into existing materials screening workflows, enabling the rapid identification of promising candidates that might otherwise be overlooked.</description>

      <title>Why Compressed Metal Hydrides are Near-room-temperature Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This contribution provides a partial response to the titular statement since, it will be claimed,the ``why'' is not yet understood, but there is a pathway for achieving a more complete understanding. The sense of the community has been that, given a prospective metal hydride and pressure, the energy landscape can be surveyed computationally for thermodynamic and dynamic stability, the Eliashberg spectral function with its required input (energy bands, phonon modes, coupling matrix elements) can be calculated, and the critical temperature T$_c$ obtained. Satisfyingly large values of the electron-phonon coupling strength $\lambda$=2-3 at high mean frequency are obtained, giving very reasonable agreement with existing high T$_c$ hydrides. Typically 80-85\% of $\lambda$ is attributable to high frequency H vibrations. This much was envisioned by Ashcroft two decades ago, so why should there be any angst? This paper addresses more specifically the question {\it why hydrogen?} Light mass is indeed a factor, but with possibilities not yet explored. This paper provides a concise overview of related formal developments occurring sporadically over several decades that, when implemented, could resolve the question of {\it why hydrogen, why so high T$_c$.} The dearth of success of numerous high throughput searches proposing higher T$_c$ materials, especially hydrides, is touched on briefly. Based on as yet unapplied developments in simplifying effects of atomic displacement, it is proposed that there is a straightforward path toward a deeper understanding of ``metallic hydrogen superconductivity" in conjunction with added computational efficiency, and that some human-learning should assist in focusing the search for higher T$_c$ superconductors.</description>

      <title>Single-Photon Detection in Few-Layer NbSe$_2$ Superconducting Nanowires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting Nanowire Single-Photon Detectors (SNSPDs) are key building blocks for photonic quantum technologies due to their ability to detect single photons with ultra-high efficiency, low dark counts and fast temporal resolution. Superconducting materials exhibiting high uniformity, large absorption cross-section and atomic-scale thickness are desirable to extend single-photon detection from the near-infrared up to the terahertz regime, where existing material choices are especially constrained. Substrate independence would further open the way to integrate detectors onto functional materials and heterostructures, enhancing performance and enabling proximal read-out of a wide range of individual excitations. Here, we top-down shape the prototypical two-dimensional superconductor niobium diselenide (NbSe$_2$) into few-layer nanowires less than 100 nm wide and demonstrate single-photon detection at 780 and 1550 nm. At the same time, the dark-count rate remains below 1 Hz up to the switching current and we achieve a timing jitter below 50 ps. We use a diffusive hot-spot model to estimate a theoretical cut-off wavelength that surpasses the millimetre range. Our results open up routes toward quantum limited detectors integrated into quantum-photonic circuits and quantum devices, with the potential for novel detection capabilities and unprecedented energy sensitivity.</description>

      <title>Tsunami Solitons Emerging from Superconducting Gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18311v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a classical integrable system exhibiting the tsunami-like solitons with rocky-desert-like disordered stationary background. One of the Lax operators describing this system is interpretable as a Bogoliubov-de Gennes Hamiltonian in parity-mixed superconductor. The family of integrable equations is generated from this seed operator by Krichever's method, whose pure $s$-wave limit includes the coupled Schr\"odinger-Boussinesq hierarchy applied to plasma physics. A linearly unstable finite background with superconducting gap supports the tsunami-soliton solution, where the propagation of the step structure turns back at a certain moment, accompanied with the oscillation on the opposite side. In addition, the equation allows inhomogeneous stationary solutions with arbitrary number of bumps at arbitrary positions, which we coin \textit{the KdV rocks}. In the Zakharov-Shabat scheme, the tsunami solitons are created from the Bogoliubov quasiparticles in energy gap and the KdV rocks from normal electrons/holes. The unexpected large space of stationary solutions comes from the non-coprime Lax pair and the multi-valued Baker-Akhiezer functions on the Riemann surface, formulated in terms of higher-rank holomorphic bundles by Krichever and Novikov. Furthermore, the concept of \textit{isodispersive phases} is introduced to characterize quasiperiodic multi-tsunami backgrounds and consider its classification.</description>

      <title>Scalable Effective Models for Superconducting Nanostructures: Applications to Double, Triple, and Quadruple Quantum Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a versatile and scalable framework for constructing effective models of superconducting (SC) nanostructures described by the generalized SC Anderson impurity model with multiple quantum dots and leads. Our Chain Expansion (ChE) method maps each SC lead onto a finite tight-binding chain with parameters obtained from Pad\'e approximants of the tunneling self-energy. We provide an explicit algorithm for the general case as well as simple analytical expressions for the chain parameters in the wide-band and infinite-chain limits. This mapping preserves low-energy physics while enabling efficient simulations: short chains are tractable with exact diagonalization, and longer ones with density matrix renormalization group methods. The approach remains reliable and computationally efficient across diverse geometries, both in and out of equilibrium. We use ChE to map the ground-state phase diagrams of double, triple, and quadruple quantum dots coupled to a single SC lead. While half-filled symmetric systems show similar overall diagrams, the particular phases differ substantially with dot number. Here, large parameter regions are entirely missed by the widely used zero-bandwidth approximation but are captured by ChE. Away from half-filling, additional dots markedly increase diagram complexity, producing a rich variety of stable phases. These results demonstrate ChE as a fast, accurate, and systematically improvable tool for exploring complex SC nanostructures.</description>

      <title>Weighted Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov method for interacting fermions: An application to ultracold Fermi superfluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For several decades it has been known that divergences arise in the ground-state energy and chemical potential of unitary superfluids, where the scattering length diverges, due to particle-hole scattering. Leading textbooks and research articles recognize that there are serious issues but ignore them due to the lack of an approach that can regularize these divergences. We find a solution to this difficulty by proposing a general method, called the weighted Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov theory, to handle multiple decomposition channels originating from the same interaction. We distribute the interaction in weighted channels determined by minimization of the action, and we apply this idea to unpolarized Fermi superfluids. Using our method, we solve a long-standing difficulty in the partitioning of the interaction into Hartree, Fock, and Bogoliubov channels for Fermi superfluids, and we obtain a phase diagram at the saddle-point level, which contains multichannel nonperturbative corrections. In particular, we find a previously overlooked superfluid phase for weak interactions, which is dominated by particle-hole processes, in addition to the usual superfluid phase only containing particle-particle physics.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity from incoherent Cooper pairs in the strong-coupling regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.04508v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a scenario for superconductivity at strong electron-electron attractive interaction, in the case when the increase of the interaction strength promotes the nucleation of the local Cooper pairs and forms a state with a spatially phase incoherent Cooper pair order parameter. We show that this state can be characterized by a pseudogap which is determined by the electron scattering by phase fluctuations. At low temperatures, however, long-range correlations between the regions with different phases become important and establish global phase coherence and hence superconductivity in the system. We develop a mean-field theory to describe a phase transition between the preformed Cooper pair and superconducting states. This scenario of superconductivity applies not only to conductors with parabolic bands but also to the flat-band systems in which flat and dispersive bands coexist and are responsible for the formation of Cooper pairs as well as their phase synchronization.</description>

      <title>Phonon-mediated spin-polarized superconductivity in altermagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08704v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the possibility of phonon-mediated unconventional superconductivity in a recently discovered new class of antiferromagnets, dubbed altermagnets. Within a weak-coupling approach, and using a minimal Lieb lattice model for altermagnets, we find a dominant superconducting instability odd in momentum and even in spin with spin-polarized Cooper pairs. We discuss the origin of this unusual result in terms of the spin-structure of the altermagnetic Fermi surface, in combination with the momentum-space structure of the effective phonon-mediated electron-electron interactions on the Fermi surface.</description>

      <title>Quantized resonant tunneling effect in Josephson junctions with ferromagnetic bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20366v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Josephson effect in one-dimensional SF$_1$F$_2$S junctions, which consist of conventional s-wave superconductors (S) connected by two ferromagnetic layers (F$_1$ and F$_2$). At low temperatures, the potential barrier at the F$_1$/F$_2$ interface can induce a quantized resonant tunneling effect. This effect not only modifies the amplitude of the critical current but also affects the phase of the Josephson current. As the exchange fields ($h_1$, $h_2$) and thicknesses ($d_1$, $d_2$) of the F$_1$ and F$_2$ layers vary, the critical current displays periodic resonance peaks. These peaks occur under the quantization conditions $Q_{1(2)} d_{1(2)} = \left(n_{1(2)} + 1/2\right) \pi$, where $Q_{1(2)} = 2h_{1(2)}/(\hbar v_F)$ is the center-of-mass momentum carried by Cooper pairs, with $v_F$ being the Fermi velocity, and $n_{1(2)} = 0, 1, 2, \cdots$. It can be inferred that the potential barrier suppresses the transport of spin-singlet pairs while allowing spin-triplet pairs with zero spin projection along the magnetization axis to pass through. As these spin-triplet pairs traverse the F$_1$ and F$_2$ layers, the total phase they acquire determines the ground state of the Josephson junction. At the resonance peaks, the Josephson current primarily arises from the first harmonic in both the parallel and antiparallel magnetization configurations. However, in perpendicular configurations, the second harmonic becomes more significant. In scenarios where both ferromagnetic layers have identical exchange fields and thicknesses, the potential barrier selectively suppresses the current in the 0-state while allowing it to persist in the $\pi$-state for parallel configurations. Conversely, in antiparallel configurations, the current in the 0-state is consistently preserved.</description>

      <title>Enhanced superconductivity in PbTe-In hybrids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04024v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the realization of epitaxial indium thin films on PbTe nanowires. The film is continuous and forms an atomically sharp interface with PbTe. Tunneling devices reveal a hard superconducting gap. The gap size, 1.08 to 1.18 meV, is twice as large as bulk indium's ($\sim$ 0.5 meV), due to the presence of PbTe. A similar enhancement is also observed in the critical temperature of In on a PbTe substrate. Subgap peaks appear at finite magnetic fields. The effective $g$-factor (15-45) is notably enhanced compared to bare PbTe wires ($&lt;$ 10) due to the presence of In, differing from Al-hybrids. Josephson devices exhibit gate-tunable supercurrents. The PbTe-In hybrid enhances the properties of both, the superconductivity of In and g-factors of PbTe, and thus may enable exotic phases of matter such as topological superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Exploring d-Wave Magnetism in Cuprates from Oxygen Moments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11922v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The antiferromagnetic parent phase of high-T$_c$ cuprates has been established as a N\'eel state of copper moments, but early work pointed out the important role of ligand oxygen orbitals. Using the three-orbital Emery model, we explore how, and under which conditions, doping-induced antiferromagnetic ordering of weak magnetic moments on the oxygen sites can lead to unconventional d-wave magnetism with spin-split electronic bands. The mechanism for forming such altermagnetic (AM) states in cuprates does not rely on a lowering of the crystal symmetry but rather on interaction-induced formation of magnetic moments on directional oxygen orbitals within the crystallographic unit cell. Therefore, we obtain two different types of AM, namely a (0,0)-AM and a ($\pi$,$\pi$)-AM. We explore different regimes and challenges for realizing oxygen AM supported by Hartree-Fock calculations and complementary exact diagonalization of small clusters. While the region of interacting parameters needed to realize these states may be difficult to achieve in known high-T$_c$ cuprates, we propose a scenario to realize AM induced by oxygen magnetic moments in a cuprate-based candidate compound using density functional theory and discuss experimental implications.</description>

      <title>Non-Fermi-liquid transport phenomena in bilayer nickelates: Impact of quasi-quantum metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17668v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently discovered high-$T_c$ superconductivity in thin-film bilayer nickelates La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under ambient pressure has attracted great interest. Non-Fermi-liquid transport behaviors, such as $T$-linear resistivity and positive Hall coefficient increasing at low temperatures, have been reported in this system. In this study, we analyze the non-Fermi-liquid transport phenomena in the thin-film bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ using a multiorbital tight-binding model. In La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, the orbital-selective cold spots composed of Ni $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital emerge since the spin fluctuations cause stronger quasi-particle damping $\gamma$ in the Ni $d_{z^2}$ orbital. Notably, in the present study, we derive a rigorous formula for the Hall coefficient $R_H$ incorporating the $\gamma$ in the quasi-quantum metric (qQM) term. We discover that the $T$-dependence of $\gamma$ in the qQM term is important in determining $R_H$, and that the qQM term is inevitably enhanced by the nearly degenerate bands at the orbital-selective cold spots located around $(\pi/4,\pi/4)$. Moreover, the qQM term plays an essential role in describing the Nernst coefficient and other transport phenomena involving the second derivative velocity $v^{\mu\nu}$. La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ provides a novel platform for exploring the physics of the qQM.</description>
