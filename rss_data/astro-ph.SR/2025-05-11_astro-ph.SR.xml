      <title>A Random Forest spectral classification of the Gaia 500-pc white dwarf population</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The third Gaia Data Release has provided the astronomical community with astrometric data of more than 1.8 billion sources, and low resolution spectra for 220 million. Such a large amount of data is difficult to handle by means of visual inspection. In this work, we present a spectral analysis of the Gaia white dwarf population up to 500 pc from the Sun based on artificial intelligence algorithms to classify the sample into their main spectral types and subtypes. In order to classify the sample, which consists of 78 920 white dwarfs with available Gaia spectra, we have applied a Random Forest algorithm to the Gaia spectral coefficients. We used the Montreal White Dwarf Database of already labeled objects as our training sample. The classified sample is compared with other already published catalogs and with our own higher resolution Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC) spectra, enabling the construction of a golden sample of well-classified objects. The Random Forest spectral classification of the 500-pc white dwarf population achieves an excellent global accuracy of 0.91 and an F1-score of 0.88 for the DA versus non-DA classification. In addition, we obtain a very high accuracy of 0.76 and a global F1-score of 0.62 for the non-DA subtype classification. In particular, our classification shows an excellent recall for DAs, DBs and DCs and a very good precision for DQs, DZs and DOs. The use of machine learning techniques, particularly the Random Forest algorithm, has enabled us to spectrally classify 78,920 white dwarfs with reasonable accuracy. Having an estimate of the spectral type for the vast majority of white dwarfs up to 500 pc provides the possibility of making better estimates of cooling ages, star formation rates, and stellar evolution processes, among other fundamental aspects for the study of the white dwarf population.</description>

      <title>The structure and evolution of a high-mass stellar merger in the Hertzsprung gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Post-main-sequence binary mergers are a common evolutionary pathway for massive stars, but the effects of merging on the long-term structure and evolution of the resulting star are a matter of active debate. Furthermore, the way in which merger products are modeled in 1D is not uniform. We present the evolution of an 11 M$_\odot$ and 6.6 M$_\odot$ binary on an 11 day orbit, that merges while the primary is crossing the Hertzsprung gap. We construct the merger product either by rapidly accreting the secondary onto the surface of the primary or by injecting material from the secondary deeper into the primary via entropy sorting. We then evolve them to carbon ignition, comparing their interior structures at this stage. We find that all merger products experience an extended blue supergiant phase and have undermassive helium cores and low carbon mass fractions compared to single and stripped stars. However, the evolution of central density, temperature, and composition in the entropy-sorted model is distinct from those of the rapid-accretion models.</description>

      <title>The internal kinematics of NGC 2808 and its multiple populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use new HST observations coupled with archival data spanning a total temporal baseline of 17 years to study the internal kinematics of the multiple populations in the globular cluster NGC 2808 from its center out to ~8 half-light radii (r_h). We detect different kinematical behaviors between the first- and second-generation populations. This is especially evident towards the external regions of the cluster, where second-generation stars are increasingly more radially anisotropic. Our results are in agreement with theoretical simulations that predict that second-generation stars, initially more concentrated in the inner regions, gradually diffuse outward and develop a stronger radially anisotropic velocity distribution with respect to the first-generation stars. We find the central regions of the cluster to exhibit a higher degree of energy equipartition than the outskirts; our analysis reveals similar levels of energy equipartition in the radial and tangential components of the motion within about 4 r_h, while outside 4 r_h the data suggest that the equipartition level of the radial component of the velocity dispersion is slightly higher than that of the tangential component. Finally, we measured the dispersion of the angular momentum L_z for the three main subpopulations along the main sequence, which provides further evidence of the differences in the velocity anisotropy of 1G and 2G stars and shows marginal evidence for the most extreme second-generation subpopulation being slightly more radially anisotropic than the other second-generation subpopulation.</description>

      <title>TESS data mining and UVES espectral analysis of CP star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photometric data from TESS were analyzed to obtain the light curve, confirming that the orbital period (P = 11.307 $\pm$ 0.005 days) remains constant. A wavelet analysis was applied to detect temporal anomalies. The photometric effective temperature of HD 72968 was estimated through colorimetry, comparing it with main-sequence stars. UVES spectra were analyzed, Doppler-corrected, and normalized using Chebyshev functions. A theoretical spectral grid generated with SPECTRUM and ATLAS9 was fitted using the chi-squared method. A comparison with UVES-ESO spectra refined the temperature estimate of HD 72968. The analysis of the spectral energy distribution (SED) enabled the derivation of stellar parameters, validating the models employed. These results provide new insights into the atmosphere and variability of HD 72968 and motivate further spectral studies for improved stellar modeling.</description>

      <title>Population synthesis of hot subdwarf B stars with COMPAS: on the observed Galactic population</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hot subdwarf B stars (sdBs) are helium-burning stars with thin hydrogen-rich envelopes. Their most widely accepted formation channels involve binary evolution and progenitors near the tip of the red giant branch, thus studying these objects improves our knowledge of complicated astrophysical processes such as common envelope evolution and the helium flash. In this work, we compare the observed sdB population with a synthetic Galactic population generated through the binary population synthesis code COMPAS, which allows us to estimate the physical properties of the current-day Galactic sdB population. We show that our synthetic sdB population matches the general properties of the observations quite well in the Kiel diagram when either a normal or lognormal distribution is assumed for the assignment of hydrogen-rich envelope masses. We also find that the canonical mass assumption should only be confidently assumed for specific system configurations and that the estimated number of sdBs found within 500 pc of the Sun in our model is at least four times higher than the observational one. We recover the observational P-q relation for sdBs plus main-sequence companions, while a similar relation between sdBs and helium white dwarf companions is rather complicated. We conclude that a better understanding of hydrogen-rich envelopes is needed, as well as an observational characterization of the sdB plus main-sequence companions earlier than spectral type $~$F. These issues aside, atmospheric properties, companion types, period, and mass distributions are in good agreement with observational and theoretical studies available in the literature.</description>

      <title>P-CORONA: A New Tool for Calculating the Intensity and Polarization of Coronal Lines in 3D Models of the Solar Corona</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The critical need to study the magnetic field in the solar corona is highlighted by recent observational facilities, such as DKIST and Aditya-L1. A powerful tool for probing the magnetism of the solar corona is forward modeling of the intensity and polarization of coronal emission lines in three-dimensional (3D) magnetohydrodynamic models. Here we present P-CORONA, a new spectral synthesis code designed to calculate the intensity and polarization of coronal lines in 3D models of the solar corona, taking into account the symmetry breaking induced by magnetic and velocity fields. P-CORONA allows the calculation of the on-disk and off-limb intensity and polarization of forbidden and permitted coronal lines, thus facilitating a wide range of investigations. Applying the quantum theory of atom-photon interactions, P-CORONA accounts for the spectral line polarization caused by anisotropic radiation pumping and the Hanle and Zeeman effects, making it a valuable tool for investigating coronal magnetic fields. This paper details the code's theoretical formulation, the implementation, and illustrative results of calculations in different 3D coronal models (MURaM and Predictive Science Inc.), including the impact of the Zeeman effect from the transverse magnetic field component on selected coronal forbidden lines. P-CORONA is now accessible to the research community on GitLab and Zenodo, providing a resource to facilitate research aimed at advancing our understanding of coronal magnetism and dynamics.</description>

      <title>XUE. JWST spectroscopy of externally irradiated disks around young intermediate-mass stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most young stars and therefore planetary systems form in high-mass star forming regions and are exposed to ultraviolet radiation, affecting the protoplanetary disk. These regions are located at large distances and only now with JWST become accessible to study the inner disks surrounding young stars. We present the eXtreme UV Environments (XUE) program, which provides the first detailed characterization of the physical and chemical properties of the inner disks around young intermediate-mass stars exposed to external irradiation from nearby massive stars. We present high signal to noise MIRI-MRS spectroscopy of 12 disks located in three sub-clusters of the high-mass star-forming region NGC 6357. Based on their mid-infrared spectral energy distribution, we classify the XUE sources into Group I and II based on the Meeus scheme. We analyze their molecular emission features, and compare their spectral indices and 10 $\mu$m silicate emission profiles to those of nearby Herbig and intermediate T Tauri disks. Despite being more massive, the XUE stars host disks with molecular richness comparable to isolated T Tauri systems. The 10 $\mu$m silicate features show lower F$_{11.3}$/F$_{9.8}$ ratios at a given F$_{\mathrm{peak}}$, but current uncertainties prevent conclusions about their inner disk properties. Most disks display water emission from the inner disk, suggesting that even in these extreme environments rocky planets can form in the presence of water. The absence of strong line fluxes and other irradiation signatures suggests that the XUE disks have been truncated by external UV photons. However, this truncation does not appear to significantly impact the chemical richness of their inner regions. These findings indicate that even in extreme environments, IMTT disks can retain the ingredients necessary for rocky planet formation.</description>

      <title>OTI on FIRE: Testing the Efficacy of Orbital Torus Imaging to Recover the Galactic Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Orbital Torus Imaging (OTI) is a dynamical inference method for determining the Milky Way's gravitational potential using stellar survey data. OTI uses gradients in stellar astrophysical quantities, such as element abundances, as functions of dynamical quantities, like orbital actions or energy, to estimate the Galactic mass distribution, assuming axisymmetry and steady-state of the system. While preliminary applications have shown promising outcomes, its sensitivity to disequilibrium effects is unknown. Here, we apply OTI to a benchmark Feedback in Realistic Environments (FIRE-2) cosmological hydrodynamic simulation, m12i, which enables a comparative analysis between known FIRE-2 vertical acceleration profiles and total surface mass densities to the analogous OTI-inferred results. We quantify OTI's accuracy within solar-analog volumes embedded in the simulated galactic disk. Despite a dynamically-evolving system, we find that OTI recovers the known vertical acceleration profiles within 3 sigma/1 sigma errors for 94%/75% of the volumes considered. We discuss the method's sensitivity to the local, instantaneous structure of the disk, reporting a loss in accuracy for volumes that have large (&gt;1.5 kpc) scale heights and low total density at z=1.1 kpc. We present realistic OTI error bars from both MCMC sampling and bootstrapping the FIRE-2 simulated data, which provides a touchstone for interpreting results obtained from current and forthcoming surveys such as SDSS-V, Gaia, WEAVE, and 4MOST.</description>

      <title>Screening Mechanisms on White Dwarfs: Symmetron &amp; Dilaton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work provides the first comparison of the symmetron and dilaton fields in white dwarfs. We show how these screening mechanisms behave inside {such stars} and their impact on stellar properties. Employing a custom-developed shooting method, we solve the scalar-tensor equilibrium equations in the Newtonian approximation. We consider a Chandrasekhar equation of state and examine a range of potential mass scales and coupling strengths for both fields. Both fields enhance the pressure drop in low-density white dwarfs, leading to smaller stellar masses, radii, and luminosities. Unlike chameleon models, their effects are suppressed in more massive stars, with symmetron fields fully decoupling and dilaton fields weakening but not vanishing. Consequently, no mass-radius curve for screened white dwarfs exceeds the Newtonian prediction in any of these three mechanisms. The mass-radius deviations are generally more pronounced at lower densities, depending on model parameters. Due to their common runaway potential, we confirm that dilaton and chameleon fields display similar field and gradient profiles. In contrast, due to their environment-dependent coupling, the dilaton and symmetron mechanisms exhibit stronger density-dependent screening effects. These findings highlight both phenomenological differences and theoretical similarities among these mechanisms, motivating asteroseismology studies to constrain the symmetron and dilaton parameter spaces.</description>

      <title>Shadow-Based Framework for Estimating Transition Disk Geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Some transition disks host misaligned inner disks with radii of several au. Understanding the geometric and physical properties of these misaligned disks is essential for advancing terrestrial planet formation models. This study introduces a novel method to infer the three-dimensional structures of both inner and outer disks by analyzing non-axisymmetric shadows and the horizon in optical and infrared scattered light images of the outer disk. This method was applied to the HD 100453 system, in which infrared scattered light images from the Very Large Telescope revealed disk shadows. These results indicate that the inner disk is misaligned by $\sim$70$^{\circ}$ relative to the outer disk, which is consistent with the results of previous studies. The aspect ratio of the inner disk surface was estimated to be 0.17, which may reflect the surface height of the optically thick dusty component due to vertical lofting by MHD winds or turbulence. In addition, the surface height distribution of the outer disk was characterized, providing novel insights into its vertical structure.</description>

      <title>A Machine-Learning Compositional Study of Exoplanetary Material Accreted Onto Five Helium-Atmosphere White Dwarfs with $\texttt{cecilia}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first application of the Machine Learning (ML) pipeline $\texttt{cecilia}$ to determine the physical parameters and photospheric composition of five metal-polluted He-atmosphere white dwarfs without well-characterised elemental abundances. To achieve this, we perform a joint and iterative Bayesian fit to their $\textit{SDSS}$ (R=2,000) and $\textit{Keck/ESI}$ (R=4,500) optical spectra, covering the wavelength range from about 3,800\r{A} to 9,000\r{A}. Our analysis measures the abundances of at least two $-$and up to six$-$ chemical elements in their atmospheres with a predictive accuracy similar to that of conventional WD analysis techniques ($\approx$0.20 dex). The white dwarfs with the largest number of detected heavy elements are SDSS J0859$+$5732 and SDSS J2311$-$0041, which simultaneously exhibit O, Mg, Si, Ca, and Fe in their $\textit{Keck/ESI}$ spectra. For all systems, we find that the bulk composition of their pollutants is largely consistent with those of primitive CI chondrites to within 1-2$\sigma$. We also find evidence of statistically significant ($&gt;2\sigma$) oxygen excesses for SDSS J0859$+$5732 and SDSS J2311$-$0041, which could point to the accretion of oxygen-rich exoplanetary material. In the future, as wide-field astronomical surveys deliver millions of public WD spectra to the scientific community, $\texttt{cecilia}$ aspires to unlock population-wide studies of polluted WDs, therefore helping to improve our statistical knowledge of extrasolar compositions.</description>

      <title>Can Dark Stars account for the star formation efficiency excess at very high redshifts?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07119v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has recently conducted observations of massive galaxies at high redshifts, revealing a notable anomaly in their star formation efficiency (SFE). Motivated by the recent identification of three $\sim 10^{6}M_\odot$ dark star candidates, we investigate whether dark stars can be the origin of the SFE excess. It turns out that the excess can be reproduced by a group of dark stars with $M \gtrsim 10^{3}\, \rm M_{\odot}$, because of their domination in generating primary UV radiation in high-redshift galaxies. The genesis of these dark stars is attributed to the capture of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) within a mass range of tens of GeV to a few TeV. However, if the top-heavy initial mass function of dark stars holds up to $\sim 10^{5}M_\odot$, the relic black holes stemming from their collapse would be too abundant to be consistent with the current observations of Massive Compact Halo Objects (MACHOs). We thus suggest that just a small fraction of SFE excess may be contributed by the very massive dark stars and the majority likely originated from other reasons such as the Population III stars in view of their rather similar UV radiation efficiencies.</description>

Abstract: There is a candidate electromagnetic (EM) counterpart to the binary black hole merger GW190521, identified as ZTF19abanrhr within active galactic nuclei (AGN) J124942.3 + 344929. Additionally, GW190514 is proposed as a plausible precursor merger to GW190521 within a hierarchical merger scenario. In this study, we investigate the potential association between GW190514 and GW190521 as a hierarchical triple merger associated with ZTF19abanrhr, taking into account of the sky position, distance, and mass of the sources using a Bayesian criterion. Our analysis reveals that the association is favored over a random coincidence, with a log Bayes factor of 16.8, corresponding to an odds ratio of $\sim$$199:1$, assuming an astrophysical prior odds of $10^{-5}$. Notably, when accounting for the primary masses of the two gravitational-wave events as potential products of mergers in the AGN formation channel, the Bayes factor increases significantly, further enhancing the preference for this association by a factor of $\sim$$10^2$, corresponding to a log Bayes factor of 21.5 and an odds ratio of $\sim$$2\times10^4:1$. Our results suggest strong evidence for the first hierarchical triple merger associated with an EM counterpart in the AGN formation channel. This work is crucial for understanding the formation mechanisms of massive black holes, the role of AGNs in hierarchical mergers, and the implications of multimessenger astronomy.</description>
