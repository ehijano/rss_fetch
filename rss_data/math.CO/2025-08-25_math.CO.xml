      <title>Source characterization of the hypergraphic posets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a hypergraph $\mathbb{H}$ on $[n]$, the hypergraphic poset $P_\mathbb{H}$ is the transitive closure of the oriented $1$-skeleton of the hypergraphic polytope $\Delta_\mathbb{H}$. In a recent paper, N. Bergeron and V. Pilaud provided a characterization of $P_\mathbb{H}$ based on the sources of acyclic orientations for interval hypergraphs. The goal of this work is to extend this source characterization of $P_\mathbb{H}$ for arbitrary hypergraphs on $[n]$.</description>

      <title>Exhaustive Generation of Pattern-Avoiding s-Words</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The most well-known Gray code of permutations is plain changes. It was discovered in the 1600s by bell-ringers who wished to order the permutations of [n] by swaps (e.g., 123, 132, 312, 321, 231, 213 for n = 3). In other words, plain changes traces a Hamilton path in the permutohedron. In 2013 it was shown that plain changes can be generated by a greedy algorithm: swap the largest value. Algorithm J replaces the swap operation with the jump operation (which moves a larger digit past one or more smaller digits) and forms the basis of the wildly successful Combinatorial Generation via Permutation Languages series of papers.
  Here we further generalize this line of research to languages of s-words (i.e., multiset permutations). We generalize jumps to bumps, which moves a sequential run of the same larger digit past one or more smaller digits. Algorithm B greedily applies minimum-length bumps prioritized by largest value, then largest index, then rightward before leftward (e.g. 1122, 1221, 1212, 2112, 2121, 2211 for s = (2, 2)).
  We show that the algorithm works for s-word languages avoiding a wide variety of tame patterns. Specific applications include efficient algorithm for generating s-Stirling words (which avoid 121) and new Gray codes for various s-Catalan objects (which avoid 132 and 121). The former result leads to Hamilton paths in every s-permutahedron.</description>

      <title>Acyclic and complete coloring of digraphs with the minimum and maximum possible numbers of colors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dichromatic and diachromatic numbers of a digraph are the minimum and maximum numbers of colors, respectively, in acyclic and complete colorings of the digraph. In this paper, we construct, for all $r \leq t$, non-symmetric digraphs with dichromatic number $r$ and diachromatic number $t$. Moreover, we discuss the existence of asymmetric digraphs with dichromatic number $ r $ and diachromatic number $ t \geq r $, establishing a quadratic upper bound $ b(r) \leq t $.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional Yang-Mills theory via integrable probability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we review the construction and large $N$ study of the continuous two-dimensional Yang-Mills theory with gauge group $\mathrm{U}(N)$ through probability, combinatorics and representation theory. In a first part, we define the continuous Yang-Mills measure using Markovian holonomy fields, following a construction by L{\'e}vy, then we show in a second part how to derive Migdal's character expansion of the partition function for any compact structure group from this setting. We continue with two developments obtained in the last few years by Dahlqvist, Lemoine, L{\'e}vy and Ma{\"i}da with similar approaches with respect to the partition function: its large $N$ asymptotics on all compact surfaces for the structure group $\mathrm{U}(N)$, and its $\frac{1}{N}$ expansion on a torus with an interpretation in terms of random surfaces.</description>

      <title>Longest odd cycles in non-bipartite $C_{2k+1}$-free graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In strengthening a result of Andr\'asfai, Erd\H{o}s and S\'os in 1974, H\"{a}ggkvist proved that if $G$ is an $n$-vertex $C_{2k+1}$-free graph with minimum degree $\delta(G)&gt;\frac{2n}{2k+3}$ and $n&gt;\binom{k+2}{2}(2k+3)(3k+2)$, then $G$ contains no odd cycle of length greater than $\frac{k+1}{2}$. This result has many applications.In this paper, we consider a similar problem by replacing minimum degree condition with edge number condition. We prove that for integers $n,k,r$ with $k\geq 2,3\leq r\leq 2k$ and $n \geq 2\left(r+2\right)\left(r+1\right)\left(r+2k\right)$, if $G$ is an $n$-vertex $C_{2k+1}$-free graph with $e(G) \geq \left\lfloor\frac{(n-r+1)^2}{4}\right\rfloor+\binom{r}{2}$, then $G$ contains no odd cycle of length greater than $r$. The construction shows that the result is best possible. This extends a result of Brandt [Discrete Applied Mathematics 79 (1997)], and a result of Bollob\'as and Thomason [Journal of Combinatorial Theory, Series B. 77 (1999)], and a result of Caccetta and Jia [Graphs Combin. 18 (2002)] and independently proving by Lin, Ning and Wu [Combin. Probab. Comput. 30 (2021)].
  Recently, Ren, Wang, Yang, and the second author [SIAM J. Discrete Math. 38 (2024)] show that for $3\leq r\leq 2k$ and $n\geq 318(r-2)^2k$, every $n$-vertex $C_{2k+1}$-free graph with $e(G) \geq \left\lfloor\frac{(n-r+1)^2}{4}\right\rfloor+\binom{r}{2}$ can be made bipartite by deleting at most $r-2$ vertices or deleting at most $\binom{\lfloor\frac{r}{2}\rfloor}{2}+\binom{\lceil\frac{r}{2}\rceil}{2}$ edges. As an application, we derive this result and provide a simple proof.</description>

      <title>Isolation number: Cartesian and lexicographic products and generalized Sierpi\'{n}ski graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The isolation number $\iota(G)$ of a graph $G$ is the minimum cardinality of a set $A\subset V(G)$ such that the subgraph induced by the vertices that are not in the union of the closed neighborhoods of vertices in $A$ has no edges. The invariant, known also under the name vertex-edge domination number of $G$, has attracted a lot of interest in recent years. In this paper, we study the behavior of the isolation number under several graph operations, namely the Cartesian and the lexicographic product and the fractalization leading to generalized Sierpi\'{n}ski graphs. We prove several upper and lower bounds on the isolation number of the Cartesian product of two graphs. We prove a lower bound for the isolation number of the prism $G\,\Box\, K_2$ over an arbitrary graph $G$, which in the case of bipartite graphs leads to the equality $\iota(G\,\Box\, K_2)=\gamma(G)$, where $\gamma(G)$ is the domination number of $G$. In particular, $\iota(Q_{n+1})=\gamma(Q_n)$ holds for all positive integers $n$, where $Q_n$ is the $n$-dimensional hypercube. For the lexicographic product $G\circ H$ we prove that its isolation number, under certain mild restrictions, equals the total domination number of the first factor $G$. We also prove sharp lower and upper bounds on the isolation numbers of the generalized Sierpi\'{n}ski graphs $S_G^t$, where $G$ is an arbitrary base graph. These bounds in the case of classical Sierpi\'{n}ski graphs, namely $S_{K_n}^t$, coincide and lead to the exact values $\iota(S_{K_n}^t)=(n-1)\cdot n^{t-2}$ for all dimensions $t\ge 2$.</description>

Abstract: Recently, Nadji and Ahmia~\cite{nadji2021} introduced the notion of $t$-Schur overpartitions and investigated their combinatorial and arithmetic properties. In this paper, we extend their work and establish several new congruence relations for $t$-Schur overpartitions.

      <title>Edge densities of drawings of graphs with one forbidden cell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A connected topological drawing of a graph divides the plane into a number of cells. The type of a cell $c$ is the cyclic sequence of crossings and vertices along the boundary walk of $c$. For example, all triangular cells with three incident crossings and no incident vertex share the same cell type. When a non-homotopic drawing of an $n$-vertex multigraph $G$ does not contain any such cells, Ackerman and Tardos [JCTA 2007] proved that $G$ has at most $8n-20$ edges, while Kaufmann, Klemz, Knorr, Reddy, Schr\"oder, and Ueckerdt [GD 2024] showed that this bound is tight. In this paper, we initiate the in-depth study of non-homotopic drawings that do not contain one fixed cell type $\mathfrak{c}$, and investigate the edge density of the corresponding multigraphs, i.e., the maximum possible number of edges. We consider non-homotopic as well as simple drawings, multigraphs as well as simple graphs, and every possible type of cell. For every combination of drawing style, graph type, and cell type, we give upper and lower bounds on the corresponding edge density. With the exception of the cell type with four incident crossings and no incident vertex, we show for every cell type $\mathfrak{c}$ that the edge density of $n$-vertex (multi)graphs with $\mathfrak{c}$-free drawings is either quadratic in $n$ or linear in $n$. In most cases, our bounds are tight up to an additive constant. Additionally, we improve the current lower bound on the edge density of simple graphs that admit a non-homotopic quasiplanar drawing from $7n-28$ to $7.5n-28$.</description>

      <title>Webification of symmetry classes of plane partitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Webs are graphical objects that give a tangible, combinatorial way to compute and classify tensor invariants. Recently, [Gaetz, Pechenik, Pfannerer, Striker, Swanson 2023+] found a rotation-invariant web basis for $\mathrm{SL}_4$, as well as its quantum deformation $U_q(\mathfrak{sl}_4)$, and a bijection between move equivalence classes of $U_q(\mathfrak{sl}_4)$-webs and fluctuating tableaux such that web rotation corresponds to tableau promotion. They also found a bijection between the set of plane partitions in an $a\times b\times c$ box and a benzene move equivalence class of $U_q(\mathfrak{sl}_4)$-webs by determining the corresponding oscillating tableau. In this paper, we similarly find the oscillating tableaux corresponding to plane partitions in certain symmetry classes. We furthermore show that there is a projection from $U_q(\mathfrak{sl}_4)$ invariants to $U_q(\mathfrak{sl}_r)$ for $r=2,3$ for webs arising from certain symmetry classes.</description>

      <title>Characterizing and Recognizing Twistedness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a simple drawing of a graph, any two edges intersect in at most one point (either a common endpoint or a proper crossing). A simple drawing is generalized twisted if it fulfills certain rather specific constraints on how the edges are drawn. An abstract rotation system of a graph assigns to each vertex a cyclic order of its incident edges. A realizable rotation system is one that admits a simple drawing such that at each vertex, the edges emanate in that cyclic order, and a generalized twisted rotation system can be realized as a generalized twisted drawing. Generalized twisted drawings have initially been introduced to obtain improved bounds on the size of plane substructures in any simple drawing of $K_n$. They have since gained independent interest due to their surprising properties. However, the definition of generalized twisted drawings is very geometric and drawing-specific.
  In this paper, we develop characterizations of generalized twisted drawings that enable a purely combinatorial view on these drawings and lead to efficient recognition algorithms. Concretely, we show that for any $n \geq 7$, an abstract rotation system of $K_n$ is generalized twisted if and only if all subrotation systems induced by five vertices are generalized twisted. This implies a drawing-independent and concise characterization of generalized twistedness. Besides, the result yields a simple $O(n^5)$-time algorithm to decide whether an abstract rotation system is generalized twisted and sheds new light on the structural features of simple drawings. We further develop a characterization via the rotations of a pair of vertices in a drawing, which we then use to derive an $O(n^2)$-time algorithm to decide whether a realizable rotation system is generalized twisted.</description>

      <title>Quality control in sublinear time: a case study via random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many algorithms are designed to work well on average over inputs. When running such an algorithm on an arbitrary input, we must ask: Can we trust the algorithm on this input? We identify a new class of algorithmic problems addressing this, which we call "Quality Control Problems." These problems are specified by a (positive, real-valued) "quality function" $\rho$ and a distribution $D$ such that, with high probability, a sample drawn from $D$ is "high quality," meaning its $\rho$-value is near $1$. The goal is to accept inputs $x \sim D$ and reject potentially adversarially generated inputs $x$ with $\rho(x)$ far from $1$. The objective of quality control is thus weaker than either component problem: testing for "$\rho(x) \approx 1$" or testing if $x \sim D$, and offers the possibility of more efficient algorithms.
  In this work, we consider the sublinear version of the quality control problem, where $D \in \Delta(\{0,1\}^N)$ and the goal is to solve the $(D ,\rho)$-quality problem with $o(N)$ queries and time. As a case study, we consider random graphs, i.e., $D = G_{n,p}$ (and $N = \binom{n}2$), and the $k$-clique count function $\rho_k := C_k(G)/\mathbb{E}_{G' \sim G_{n,p}}[C_k(G')]$, where $C_k(G)$ is the number of $k$-cliques in $G$. Testing if $G \sim G_{n,p}$ with one sample, let alone with sublinear query access to the sample, is of course impossible. Testing if $\rho_k(G)\approx 1$ requires $p^{-\Omega(k^2)}$ samples. In contrast, we show that the quality control problem for $G_{n,p}$ (with $n \geq p^{-ck}$ for some constant $c$) with respect to $\rho_k$ can be tested with $p^{-O(k)}$ queries and time, showing quality control is provably superpolynomially more efficient in this setting. More generally, for a motif $H$ of maximum degree $\Delta(H)$, the respective quality control problem can be solved with $p^{-O(\Delta(H))}$ queries and running time.</description>

      <title>The chromatic number of triangle-free hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.02839v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A triangle in a hypergraph $\mathcal{H}$ is a set of three distinct edges $e, f, g\in\mathcal{H}$ and three distinct vertices $u, v, w\in V(\mathcal{H})$ such that $\{u, v\}\subseteq e$, $\{v, w\}\subseteq f$, $\{w, u\}\subseteq g$ and $\{u, v, w\}\cap e\cap f\cap g=\emptyset$. Johansson proved in 1996 that $\chi(G)=\mathcal{O}(\Delta/\log\Delta)$ for any triangle-free graph $G$ with maximum degree $\Delta$. Cooper and Mubayi later generalized the Johansson's theorem to all rank $3$ hypergraphs. In this paper we provide a common generalization of both these results for all hypergraphs, showing that if $\mathcal{H}$ is a rank $k$, triangle-free hypergraph, then the list chromatic number \[ \chi_{\ell}(\mathcal{H})\leq \mathcal{O}\left(\max_{2\leq \ell \leq k} \left\{\left( \frac{\Delta_{\ell}}{\log \Delta_{\ell}} \right)^{\frac{1}{\ell-1}} \right\}\right), \] where $\Delta_{\ell}$ is the maximum $\ell$-degree of $\mathcal{H}$. The result is sharp apart from the constant. Moreover, our result implies, generalizes and improves several earlier results on the chromatic number and also independence number of hypergraphs, while its proof is based on a different approach than prior works in hypergraphs (and therefore provides alternative proofs to them). In particular, as an application, we establish a bound on chromatic number of sparse hypergraphs in which each vertex is contained in few triangles, and thus extend results of Alon, Krivelevich and Sudakov, and Cooper and Mubayi from hypergraphs of rank 2 and 3, respectively, to all hypergraphs.</description>

      <title>On the study of cellular automata on modulo-recurrent words</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.14216v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a class of cellular automata (CA) called stable cellular automata (SCA) that preserve stability by reflection, modulo-recurrent, and richness. After applying these automata to Sturmian words, we determine some of their combinatorial properties. Next, we calculate the classical and palindromic complexity functions of these words. Finally, we demonstrate that these words are $2$-balanced and establish their abelian complexity function.</description>

      <title>On the Classification of Planar-Rips complexes and their corresponding unit disk graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01082v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a metric space $(X,d)$, the Vietoris-Rips complex of $X$ at a scale of $r &gt;0$ is a simplicial complex whose simplices are all those finite subsets of $X$ with diameter less than $r$. In this paper, we classify, up to simplicial isomorphism, all $n$-dimensional pseudomanifolds and weak-pseudomanifolds that can be realized as a Vietoris-Rips complex of planar point sets. We further classify two-dimensional, pure, and closed planar-Rips complexes up to homotopy. Additionally, we explore the hereditary properties and introduce the notion of obstructions in planar-Rips complexes. We also consolidate our findings to describe a class of unit disk graphs, having all maximal cliques of same cardinality. Several structural and geometric properties of planar-Rips complexes have also been derived.</description>

      <title>Pretty good fractional revival on abelian Cayley graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20367v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be a graph with the adjacency matrix $A$. The transition matrix of $\Gamma$, denoted $H(t)$, is defined as $H(t) := \exp(-\textbf{i}tA)$, where $t$ is a real variable and $\textbf{i} := \sqrt{-1}$. The graph $\Gamma$ is said to exhibit pretty good fractional revival (PGFR in short) between the vertices $a$ and $b$ if there exists a sequence of real numbers $\{t_k\}$ such that $\lim_{k\to\infty} H(t_k){\textbf{e}_{a}} = \alpha{\textbf{e}_{a}} + \beta{\textbf{e}_{b}}$, where $\alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{C}$ with $\beta \neq 0$ and $|\alpha|^2 + |\beta|^2 = 1$. In this paper, we present a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of PGFR on abelian Cayley graphs. Using that necessary and sufficient condition, we obtain some infinite classes of circulant graphs exhibiting PGFR. We also obtain some classes of circulant graphs not exhibiting PGFR. Some of our results generalize the results of Chan et al. [Pretty good quantum fractional revival in paths and cycles. \textit {Algebr. Comb.} 4(6) (2021), 989-1004.] for cycles.</description>

      <title>Mixed Steiner Triples Systems with Shortest Length</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12954v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that a 3-GDD of type $1^n k^1 \ell^1$, where $n= k \cdot \ell$, with minimum distance 3 exists for every $k$ and $\ell$ such that $n = k \ell$, $k = 1$ or $3~(mod ~ 6)$, and $\ell = 1$ or $3~(mod ~ 6)$. These designs are of the shortest possible length (smallest number of elements) for given $k$ and $\ell$. Other constructions for such triple systems are also presented.</description>

      <title>Moduli spaces of Delzant polytopes and symplectic toric manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.02369v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces modern geometric combinatorial technology from the theory of triangulations in order to derive results in toric symplectic geometry. In the main part of the paper we prove a number of properties of the space $\mathcal{D}(n)$ of $n$-dimensional Delzant polytopes. Two highlights are the construction of examples showing that, in contrast with the classical work of Oda in dimension $2$, no classification of combinatorially minimal Delzant polytopes can be expected in dimension $3$ or higher, and a proof that the space of $n$-dimensional Delzant polytopes is path-connected. Our proof of the latter is based on the fact that every rational fan can be refined to a unimodular fan, which is a standard technique used for resolution of singularities of toric varieties. In the last part of the paper, using the Delzant correspondence, these results allow us to answer several open questions concerning the moduli space $\mathcal{M}(n)$ of symplectic toric manifolds of dimension $2n$, since this space is isometric to the space of Delzant polytopes. Our results imply that no classification of minimal models of symplectic toric manifolds is plausible in dimension $6$ or higher, which answers in the negative a long-standing folklore question originating in Oda's work (1978).</description>

      <title>A unified worst case for classical simplex and policy iteration pivot rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.14034v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a family of Markov decision processes for which the policy iteration algorithm needs an exponential number of improving switches with Dantzig's rule, with Bland's rule, and with the Largest Increase pivot rule. This immediately translates to a family of linear programs for which the simplex algorithm needs an exponential number of pivot steps with the same three pivot rules. Our results yield a unified construction that simultaneously reproduces well-known lower bounds for these classical pivot rules, and we are able to infer that any (deterministic or randomized) combination of them cannot avoid an exponential worst-case behavior. Regarding the policy iteration algorithm, pivot rules typically switch multiple edges simultaneously and our lower bound for Dantzig's rule and the Largest Increase rule, which perform only single switches, seem novel. Regarding the simplex algorithm, the individual lower bounds were previously obtained separately via deformed hypercube constructions. In contrast to previous bounds for the simplex algorithm via Markov decision processes, our rigorous analysis is reasonably concise.</description>

      <title>The $m$-th Element of a Sidon Set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01986v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that if $A=\{a_1,\dots ,a_{|A|}\}\subset \{1,2,\dots ,n\}$ is a Sidon set so that $|A|=n^{1/2}-L^\prime$, then $$a_m = m\cdot n^{1/2} + \mathcal O\left( n^{7/8}\right) + \mathcal O\left(L^{1/2}\cdot n^{3/4}\right)$$ where $L=\max\{0,L^\prime\}$. As an application of this, we give easy proofs of some previously derived results. We proceed on to proving that for a dense Sidon set $S$ and for any $\varepsilon &gt;0$, we have $$\sum_{a\in S} a = \frac 12 n^{3/2} + \mathcal O \left (n^{11/8} \right )$$ for all $n\le N$ but at most $\mathcal O_{\varepsilon} \left (N^{\frac 45 + \varepsilon} \right )$ exceptions.</description>

      <title>Tropical cluster varieties of type C</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02941v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explicitly describe the tropicalization of a cluster variety of finite type C, realizing it as the space of axially symmetric phylogenetic trees. We also find all occurring sign patterns of coordinates, for both the cluster variety and the cluster configuration space. We show that each of the corresponding signed tropicalizations is, combinatorially, dual to either a cyclohedron or an associahedron. As additional results, we construct Gr\"obner and tropical bases for the defining ideals of both varieties, and classify the arising toric degenerations.</description>

      <title>Optimum 1-Step Majority-Logic Decoding of Binary Reed-Muller Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08736v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The classical majority-logic decoder proposed by Reed for Reed-Muller codes RM(r, m) of order r and length 2^m, unfolds in r+1 sequential steps, decoding message symbols from highest to lowest degree. Several follow-up decoding algorithms reduced the number of steps, but for a limited set of parameters, or at the expense of reduced performance, or relying on the existence of some combinatorial structures. We show that any one-step majority-logic decoder-that is, a decoder performing all majority votes in one step simultaneously without sequential processing-can correct at most d_min/4 errors for all values of r and m, where d_min denotes the code's minimum distance. We then introduce a new hard-decision decoder that completes the decoding in a single step and attains this error-correction limit. It applies to all r and m, and can be viewed as a parallel realization of Reed's original algorithm, decoding all message symbols simultaneously. Remarkably, we also prove that the decoder is optimum in the erasure setting: it recovers the message from any erasure pattern of up to d_min-1 symbols-the theoretical limit. To our knowledge, this is the first 1-step decoder for RM codes that achieves both optimal erasure correction and the maximum one-step error correction capability.</description>
