      <title>Quadratic Quasi-Normal Modes of a Schwarzschild Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quadratic quasi-normal modes, generated at second order in black hole perturbation theory, are a promising target for testing gravity in the nonlinear regime with next-generation gravitational wave detectors. While their frequencies have long been known, their amplitudes remain poorly studied. We introduce regular variables and compute amplitudes for Schwarzschild black holes with the Leaver algorithm. We find a nonlinear ratio $\mathcal{R}\simeq0.154e^{-0.068i}$ for the most excited $\ell=4$ mode, matching results from Numerical Relativity. We also predict new low-frequency $\ell=2$ quadratic modes.</description>

      <title>Bouncing cosmologies in the presence of a Dirac-Born-Infeld field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a detailed dynamical system analysis for the behaviour of a Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) field in a spatially closed Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) cosmology. The DBI field is characterised by a potential and brane tension. We study power-law or exponential functions for the potential and tension. We find that in a spatially closed FLRW cosmology, a DBI field in the ultra-relativistic limit allows for a broader range of initial conditions resulting in a bouncing universe than in the non-relativistic limit. We further note that the range of initial conditions allowing for a bounce is larger if we consider power-law functions for the potential and tension, compared to the exponential case. Our dynamical analysis shows that a DBI field does not exhibit stable cyclical behaviour, including the case in which a negative cosmological constant is present.</description>

      <title>Solving the Einstein Equations Numerically</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are many complementary approaches to the construction of solutions to the field equations of general relativity. Among these, numerical approximation offers the only possibility to compute a variety of dynamical spacetimes, and so has come to play an important role for theory and experiment alike. Presently we give a brief introduction to this, the science of numerical relativity. We discuss the freedom in formulating general relativity as an initial (boundary) value problem. We touch on the fundamental concepts of well-posedness and gauge freedom and review the standard computational methods employed in the field. We discuss the physical interpretation of numerical spacetime data and end with an overview of a number of 3d codes that are either in use or under active development.</description>

      <title>A discontinuous Galerkin scheme for elliptic equations on extremely stretched grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods for solving elliptic equations are gaining popularity in the computational physics community for their high-order spectral convergence and their potential for parallelization on computing clusters. However, problems in numerical relativity with extremely stretched grids, such as initial data problems for binary black holes that impose boundary conditions at large distances from the black holes, have proven challenging for DG methods. To alleviate this problem we have developed a primal DG scheme that is generically applicable to a large class of elliptic equations, including problems on curved and extremely stretched grids. The DG scheme accommodates two widely used initial data formulations in numerical relativity, namely the puncture formulation and the extended conformal thin-sandwich (XCTS) formulation. We find that our DG scheme is able to stretch the grid by a factor of $\sim 10^9$ and hence allows to impose boundary conditions at large distances. The scheme converges exponentially with resolution both for the smooth XCTS problem and for the non-smooth puncture problem. With this method we are able to generate high-quality initial data for binary black hole problems using a parallelizable DG scheme. The code is publicly available in the open-source SpECTRE numerical relativity code.</description>

      <title>Improved frequency spectra of gravitational waves with memory in a binary-black-hole simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical relativists can now produce gravitational waveforms with memory effects routinely and accurately. The gravitational-wave memory effect contains very low-frequency components, including a persistent offset. The presence of these components violates basic assumptions about time-shift behavior underpinning standard data-analysis techniques in gravitational-wave astronomy. This poses a challenge to the analysis of waveform spectra: How to preserve the low-frequency characteristics when transforming a time-domain waveform to the frequency domain. To tackle this challenge, we revisit the preprocessing procedures applied to the waveforms that contain memory effects. We find inconsistency between the zero-frequency limit of displacement memory and the low- frequency spectrum of the same memory preprocessed using the common scheme in literature. To resolve the inconsistency, we propose a new robust preprocessing scheme that produces the spectra of memory waveforms more faithfully. Using this new scheme, we inspect several characteristics of the spectrum of a memory waveform. In particular, we find a discernible beating pattern formed by the dominant oscillatory mode and the displacement memory. This pattern is absent in the spectrum of a waveform without memory. The difference between the memory and no-memory waveforms is too small to be observed by current-generation detectors in a single binary-black-hole event. Detecting the memory in a single event is likely to occur in the era of next-generation detectors.</description>

      <title>Energy in critical collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the energy issue in critical collapse of a spherically symmetric scalar field. It is found that in critical collapse, the contribution from the material energy is greater than that from the gravitational energy. The quantity $m/r$ plays an important role in identifying the formation of apparent horizon in gravitational collapse, where $m$ is the Misner-Sharp mass and $r$ the areal radius. We observe that in critical collapse, the maximum value of $m/r$ fluctuates between $2/15$ and $4/15$. This denotes a large gap between critical collapse and black hole formation for which the criterion is $m/r=1/2$.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal Frequencies of Fields with Various Spin in the Quantum Oppenheimer-Snyder Model of Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recent development involves an intriguing model of a quantum-corrected black hole, established through the application of the quantum Oppenheimer-Snyder model within loop quantum cosmology [Lewandowski et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 130 (2023) 10, 101501]. Employing both time-domain integration and the WKB approach, we compute the quasinormal frequencies for scalar, electromagnetic, and neutrino perturbations in these quantum-corrected black holes. Our analysis reveals that while the real oscillation frequencies undergo only minor adjustments due to the quantum parameter, the damping rate experiences a significant decrease as a result of its influence. We also deduce the analytic formula for quasinormal frequencies in the eikonal limit and show that the correspondence between the null geodesics and eikoanl quasinormal modes holds in this case.</description>

      <title>Gravitating Scalarons with Inverted Higgs Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previously, a class of regular and asymptotically flat gravitating scalar solitons (scalarons) has been constructed in the Einstein--Klein--Gordon (EKG) theory by adopting a phantom field with Higgs-like potential where the kinetic term has the wrong sign and the scalaron possesses the negative Arnowitt--Deser--Misner (ADM) mass as a consequence. In this paper, we demonstrate that the use of the phantom field can be avoided by inverting the Higgs-like potential in the EKG system when the kinetic term has a proper sign, such that the corresponding gravitating scalaron can possess the positive ADM mass. We systematically study the basic properties of the gravitating scalaron, such as the ADM mass, the energy conditions, the geodesics of test particles, etc. Moreover, we find that it can be smoothly connected to the counterpart hairy black hole solutions from our recent work in the small horizon limit.</description>

      <title>Testing Strong Gravitational Lensing Effects of Supermassive Black Holes with String-Inspired Metric, EHT Constraints and Parameter Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine and compare the gravitational lensing, in the strong field limit, for the spherically symmetric string-inspired Euler-Heisenberg black holes, characterized by additional parameters $Q^2$ and $\alpha-\beta$, representing magnetic charge and coupling constant, respectively. Our analysis reveals a reduction in the photon sphere radius $x_{ps}$, critical impact parameter $u_{ps}$ and angular position $\theta_\infty$ with increasing magnitude of $Q^2$ and $\alpha-\beta$. Consequently, the value of these quantities is consistently lower than that of its GR equivalents. Further, the ratio $r_{mag}$ of the flux of the first image to all others decreases with $Q^2$ and $\alpha-\beta$. Unlike Schwarzschild black holes, string-inspired Euler-Heisenberg black holes have a smaller deflection angle $\alpha_D$, which decreases even more as $Q^2$ increases. Moreover, the time delay for Sgr A* and M87* can reach up to $~11.302$ and $~17085.1$ minutes, respectively, at $Q^2=0.1$ and $\alpha-\beta=-1$, deviating from Schwarzschild black holes by $~0.194$ and $~293.6$ minutes which are not very significant. For Sgr A* and M87*, we determine $\theta_\infty$ to range within $(23.81, 26.28)~\mu as$ and $(17.89, 19.78)~\mu as$ respectively, with angular separations $s$ ranging from $(3.33-5.67)~nas$ for Sgr A* and $(2.51-4.26)~nas$ for M87*. EHT bounds on the $\theta_{sh}$ of Sgr A* and M87* within the $1\sigma$ region, bound the parameters $Q^2$ and $\alpha-\beta$ as: for Sgr A* $0.29278 \le Q^2 \le 0.60778$ and for M87* $0 &lt; Q^2 \le 0.08473$, but in both the cases we found no bound on the parameter $\alpha-\beta$. We also estimate the parameters $\alpha-\beta$ and $Q^2$ associated with string-inspired Euler-Heisenberg black holes using the EHT observation results of Sgr A* and M87*.</description>

      <title>Sensing Gravity with Polarized Electromagnetic Radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polarization wiggling is a direct gravitational effect exerted by a gravitational field on any electromagnetic radiation traversing it. This effect is investigated in linear gravity for spacetimes with flat or conformally flat backgrounds. First, we show how the polarization wiggle rates can be computed in the conformal frame and transformed to the physical frame. Then it is shown that polarization wiggling is not sensitive to scalar perturbations to the metric, while vector and tensor perturbations do induce polarization wiggling. This poses two natural questions: Can polarized electromagnetic radiation be used to measure vectorial and tensorial components of gravitational fields directly? And if so, how? Next, polarization wiggling is studied for an arbitrary vector perturbation to the spacetime metric. In a stationary spacetime, the polarization wiggle rate is proportional to the difference in frame dragging rates between radiation emission and measurement events. We show how this can be used to measure the angular momentum of a gravitational source if the emitter orbits the gravitational source on a known orbit. Next, the effect of a gravitational tensor mode with arbitrary polarization is studied. Finally, the polarization wiggling effect induced by a gravitational tensor mode is analyzed. Two cases are demonstrated: A spacetime with a flat Minkowski background and an expanding cosmology with a conformally flat background. In both cases, the polarization wiggling frequency equals the frequency of the gravitational tensor mode, while the other state parameters are encoded in the polarization wiggling amplitude and phase of the polarized radiation. We show that measurements of polarization wiggling frequency, amplitude and phase of polarized radiation from different directions enables all state parameters of a gravitational tensor mode to be determined.</description>

      <title>Theory of interacting vector dark energy and fluid</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study interaction between dark energy and dark matter, where dark energy is described by a massive vector field, and dark matter is modelled as a fluid. We present new interaction term, which affects only perturbations and can give interesting phenomenology. Then we present a general Lagrangian for the interacting vector dark energy with dark matter. For the dark energy, we choose Proca theory with $G_{3}$ term to study its phenomenological consequence. For this model, we explore both background and perturbation dynamics. We also present the no-ghost condition for tensor modes and scalar modes. Subsequently, we also study the evolution of the overdensities of both baryon and cold dark matter in the high$-k$ limit. We show that the effective gravitational coupling is modified for cold dark matter and baryon. We also choose a simple concrete model and numerically show a suppression in the growth of cold dark matter overdensity.</description>

      <title>The Role of Topological Photon Spheres in Constraining the Parameters of Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the topological photon sphere from two distinct perspectives. In the first view, we examine the existence and characteristics of topological photon(anti-photon)spheres for black holes with different structures, such as Einstein-Young-Mills non-minimal, AdS black holes surrounded by Chaplygin-like dark fluid, and Bardeen-like black holes in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity. Furthermore, we delve into the deeper perspective of the necessity of photon spheres for super-compact gravitational structures such as black holes. By leveraging this necessity, we propose a classification of the parameter space of black hole models based on the existence and positioning of photon spheres. This approach enables the determination of parameter ranges that delineate whether a solution represents a black hole or a naked singularity. In essence, the paper illustrates the utility of the photon sphere as a notable test for establishing the permissible and non-permissible parameter ranges within specific theories of black hole solutions.</description>

      <title>Realistic models of general-relativistic differentially rotating stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: General-relativistic equilibria of differentially rotating stars are expected in a number of astrophysical scenarios, from core-collapse supernovae to the remnant of binary neutron-star mergers. The latter, in particular, have been the subject of extensive studies where they were modeled with a variety of laws of differential rotation with varying degree of realism. Starting from accurate and fully general-relativistic simulations of binary neutron-star mergers with various equations of state and mass ratios, we establish the time when the merger remnant has reached a quasi-stationary equilibrium and extract in this way realistic profiles of differential rotation. This allows us to explore how well traditional laws reproduce such differential-rotation properties and to derive new laws of differential rotation that better match the numerical data in the low-density Keplerian regions of the remnant. In this way, we have obtained a novel and somewhat surprising result: the dynamical stability line to quasi-radial oscillations computed from the turning-point criterion can have a slope that is not necessarily negative with respect to the central rest-mass density, as previously found with traditional differential-rotation laws. Indeed, for stellar models reproducing well the properties of the merger remnants, the slope is actually positive, thus reflecting remnants with angular momentum at large distances from the rotation axis, and hence with cores having higher central rest-mass densities and slower rotation rates.</description>

      <title>Semiclassical solution of black hole information paradox</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We resolve black hole information paradox within semiclassical gravity, in a manner that does not depend on details of unknown quantum gravity. Our crucial insight is that outgoing Hawking particles are physical only at distances much larger than the Schwarzschild radius, so they are created far from the horizon and entangled with degrees of freedom at smaller distances. The later degrees of freedom can be understood as quasi-classical coherent states, implying that Hawking radiation is accompanied by additional radiation similar to classical radiation by which the black hole loses hair during the classical gravitational collapse. The two kinds of radiation are entangled, which resolves black hole information paradox.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical electromagnetic radiation from moving point charges is foundational, but the thermal dynamics responsible for classical acceleration temperature are poorly understood. We investigate the thermal properties of classical electromagnetic radiation in the context of the correspondence between accelerated electrons and moving mirrors, focusing on three trajectories with asymptotically infinite (Davies-Fulling), asymptotically zero (Walker-Davies), and eternally uniform acceleration. The latter two are argued not to be thermal, while the former is found to emit thermal photons with a temperature that depends on the electron's speed. Thermal radiation from the mirror reveals a zero-jerk condition.</description>

      <title>Accounting for selection biases in population analyses: equivalence of the in-likelihood and post-processing approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper I show the equivalence, under appropriate assumptions, of two alternative methods to account for the presence of selection biases (also called selection effects) in population studies: one is to include the selection effects in the likelihood directly; the other follows the procedure of first inferring the observed distribution and then removing selection effects a posteriori. Moreover, I investigate a potential bias allegedly induced by the latter approach: I show that this procedure, if applied under the appropriate assumptions, does not produce the aforementioned bias.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Hole clusters, phenomenology &amp; implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present direct N-body simulations of black-hole-only clusters with up to $2 \cdot 10^4$ compact objects, zero natal spin and no primordial binaries as predicted by various primordial black hole (PBH) Dark Matter models. The clusters' evolution is computed using ${\tt NBODY6\!+\!+GPU}$, including the effects of the tidal field of the galaxy, the kicks of black hole mergers and orbit-averaged energy loss by gravitational radiation of binaries. We investigate clusters with four initial mass distributions, three of which attempt to model a generic PBH scenario using a lognormal mass distribution and a fourth one that can be directly linked to a monochromatic PBH scenario when accretion is considered. More specifically, we dive into the clusters' internal dynamics, describing their expansion and evaporation, along with the resultant binary black hole mergers. We also compare several simulations with and without black hole merger kicks and find modelling implications for the probability of hierarchical mergers.</description>

      <title>Probing orbits of stellar mass objects deep in galactic nuclei with quasi-periodic eruptions -- II: population analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) are intense repeating soft X-ray bursts with recurrence times about a few hours to a few weeks from galactic nuclei. Though the debates on the origin of QPEs have not completely settled down, more and more analyses favor the interpretation that QPEs are the result of collisions between a stellar mass object (a stellar mass black hole or a main sequence star) and an accretion disk around a supermassive black hole (SMBH) in galactic nuclei. If this interpretation is correct, QPEs will be invaluable in probing the orbits of stellar mass objects in the vicinity of SMBHs, and further inferring the formation of extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs), one of the major targets of spaceborne gravitational wave missions. In this work, we extended the EMRI orbital analysis in Paper I arXiv:2401.11190 to all the known QPE sources with more than $6$ flares observed. Among all the analyzed 5 QPE sources, two distinct EMRI populations are identified: 4 EMRIs are of low orbital eccentricity (consistent with 0) which should be born in the wet EMRI formation channel, and 1 mildly eccentric EMRI (with $e= 0.25^{+0.18}_{-0.20}$ at 2-$\sigma$ confidence level) is consistent with the predictions of both the dry loss-cone formation channel and the Hills mechanism.</description>

      <title>Holographic RG flows in a 3d gauged supergravity at finite temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider finite-temperature holographic RG flows in $D=3$ $\mathcal{N}=(2,0)$ gauged truncated supergravity coupled to a sigma model with a hyperbolic target space. In the context of the holographic duality, fixed points (CFTs) at finite temperature are described by AdS black holes. We come from the gravity EOM to a 3d autonomous dynamical system, which critical points can be related to fixed points of dual field theories. Near-horizon black hole solutions correspond to infinite points of this system. We use Poincar\'e transformations to project the system on $\mathbf{R}^3$ into the 3d unit cylinder such that the infinite points are mapped onto the boundary of the cylinder. We explore numerically the space of solutions. We show that the exact RG flow at zero temperature is the separatrix for asymptotically AdS black hole solutions if the potential has one extremum, while for the potential with three extrema the separatrices are RG flows between AdS fixed points. We find near-horizon analytical solutions for asymptotically AdS black holes using the dynamical equations. We also present a method for constructing full analytical solutions.</description>

      <title>Inflationary Gravitational Wave Spectral Shapes as test for Low-Scale Leptogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study thermal and non-thermal resonant leptogenesis in a general setting where a heavy scalar $\phi$ decays to right-handed neutrinos (RHNs) whose further out-of-equilibrium decay generates the required lepton asymmetry. Domination of the energy budget of the Universe by the $\phi$ or the RHNs alters the evolution history of the primordial gravitational waves (PGW), of inflationary origin, which re-enter the horizon after inflation, modifying the spectral shape. The decays of $\phi$ and RHNs release entropy into the early Universe while nearly degenerate RHNs facilitate low and intermediate scale leptogenesis. We show that depending on the coupling $y_R$ of $\phi$ to radiation species, RHNs can achieve thermal abundance before decaying, which gives rise to thermal leptogenesis. A characteristic damping of the GW spectrum resulting in two knee-like features or one knee-like feature would provide evidence for low-scale thermal and non-thermal leptogenesis respectively. We explore the parameter space for the lightest right-handed neutrino mass $M_1\in[10^2,10^{14}]$ GeV and washout parameter $K$ that depends on the light-heavy neutrino Yukawa couplings $\lambda$, in the weak ($K &lt; 1$) and strong ($K &gt; 1$) washout regimes. The resulting novel features compatible with observed baryon asymmetry are detectable by future experiments like LISA and ET. By estimating signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for upcoming GW experiments, we investigate the effect of the scalar mass $M_\phi$ and reheating temperature $T_\phi$, which depends on the $\phi-N$ Yukawa couplings $y_N$.</description>

      <title>A new diagnostic for the null test of dynamical dark energy in light of DESI 2024 and other BAO data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new diagnostic for the null test of dynamical dark energy. This diagnostic is useful, especially when we include anisotropic baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data in an analysis, to quantify the deviations from the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. This null test is independent of any late-time cosmological model or parametrization. With this, we study the evidence for dynamical dark energy in light of Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) 2024 data combined with cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations of the Planck 2018 mission and local $H_0$ measurements. We find low (around 0.6$\sigma$) to moderate (around 1$\sigma$) evidence for dynamical dark energy which is not that significant. Although we get individual deviations at around 2$\sigma$ at the effective redshift 0.51 of the DESI 2024 data, the average deviations combining all redshift points are almost independent of the inclusion or exclusion of the data at effective redshift 0.51 (the differences are only around 0.3$\sigma$). We get almost similar results for other non-DESI BAO data. The evidences are almost independent of the early-time physics and these evidences have very low dependence on $H_0$ values. The evidence of dynamical dark energy, obtained in this analysis, is not consistent with the DESI key paper results with the $w_0w_a$CDM model, but interestingly, these are almost consistent with the DESI's results with $z_pw_p$CDM model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present independent determinations of cosmological parameters and new constraints on $f(T)$ cosmologies, employing two new catalogs related to HII galaxy Hubble and CMB distance priors, along with the local standard measurements, SNIa, $H(z)$ measurements, growth rate data (RSD), and BAO baselines. We found that the marginalised best-fit C.L. $H_0$ and $\sigma_8$ parameters within these cosmologies can relax the current cosmological tensions using HIIG data. This produces a larger range of admissible values for the current Hubble constant, and when all baselines are considered, the uncertainty bands for $H_0$ and the matter density parameter reduce significantly.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2202.13790v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A transonic fluid flow generates an acoustic hole that is the hydrodynamic analogue of a gravitational black hole. Acoustic holes emit a detectable thermal radiation of phonons at a characteristic Hawking temperature. The crucial concept is that the spontaneous phonon emission at the horizon produces an irreversible heat increase at the expenses of the bulk fluid kinetic energy. We show that such process can be described in terms of \textit{effective} shear and bulk viscosities that are defined close to the horizon. We analyze this quantum friction process by resorting to a general kinetic theory approach as well as by the specific description of phonon emission as a tunneling process. The celebrated Kovtun, Son and Starinets (KSS) universal lower bound $\eta /s = 1 / 4 \pi $ of the shear viscosity coefficient to entropy density ratio, readily follows, and is extended to the longitudinal bulk viscosity at the horizon. We come to the same saturation of the KSS bound after considering the shear viscosity arising from a perturbation of the background metric at the acoustic horizon providing a -- in principle testable -- realization of the so called black hole \textit{membrane paradigm}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.12380v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We find a novel phenomenon in the solution to the Wheeler-DeWitt equation by solving numerically the equation assuming $O(4)$-symmetry and imposing the Hartle-Hawking wave function as a boundary condition. In the slow-roll limit, as expected, the numerical solution gives the most dominant steepest-descent that describes the probability distribution for the initial condition of a universe. The probability is consistent with the Euclidean computations, and the overall shape of the wave function is compatible with analytical approximations, although there exist novel differences in the detailed probability computation. Our approach gives an alternative point of view of the no-boundary wave function from the wave function point of view. Possible interpretations and conceptual issues of this wave function are discussed.</description>

Abstract: We study the dynamics of the critical collapse of a spherically symmetric scalar field. Approximate analytic expressions for the metric functions and matter field in the large-radius region are obtained.

      <title>Revisiting the cosmic string origin of GW190521</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.03860v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For the first time we analyse gravitational-wave strain data using waveforms constructed from strong gravity simulations of cosmic string loops collapsing to Schwarzschild black holes; a previously unconsidered source. Since the expected signal is dominated by a black-hole ringdown, it can mimic the observed gravitational waves from high-mass binary black hole mergers. To illustrate this, we consider GW190521, a short duration gravitational-wave event observed in the third LIGO--Virgo--KAGRA observing run. We show that describing this event as a collapsing cosmic string loop is favoured over previous cosmic string analyses by an approximate log Bayes factor of $22$. The binary black hole hypothesis is still preferred, mostly because the cosmic string remnant is non-spinning. It remains an open question whether a spinning remnant could form from loops with angular momentum, but if possible, it would likely bring into contention the binary black hole preference. Finally, we suggest that searches for ringdown-only waveforms would be a viable approach for identifying collapsing cosmic string events and estimating their event rate. This work opens up an important new direction for the cosmic-string and gravitational-wave communities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.10454v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examined the output of a quantum Michelson interferometer incorporating the combined effects of nonlinear optomechanical interaction and time-varying gravitational fields. Our findings indicate a deviation from the standard relationship between the phase shift of the interferometer's output and the amplitude of gravitational waves. This deviation, a slight offset in direct proportionality, is associated with the gravitational wave memory effect under the conventional settings of interferometer parameters. Furthermore, the results suggest that consecutive gravitational wave memory, or the stochastic gravitational wave memory background (SGWMB), contributes not only to the classical red noise spectrum but also to a quantum red noise spectrum through this new mechanism. This leads to a novel quantum noise limit for interferometers, which may be crucial for higher precision detection system. Our analysis potentially offers a more accurate description of quantum interferometers responding to gravitational waves and applies to other scenarios involving time-varying gravitational fields. It also provides insights and experimental approaches for exploring how to unify the quantum effects of macroscopic objects and gravitation.</description>

      <title>Simultaneously search for multi-target Galactic binary gravitational waves in reduced parameter space with LMPSO-CV</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09300v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an innovative approach to the concurrent exploration of gravitational waves originating from Galactic binaries through the development of a new Local Maxima Particle Swarm Optimization (LMPSO) algorithm. Our methodology employs strategic Create Voids (CV) to streamline parameter space, maximizing the identification of local maxima for the $\mathcal{F}$-statistic even in the overlapped signals case. Subsequently, a "find-real-$\mathcal{F}$-statistic-analysis", which implements the astrophysical models and properties of $\mathcal{F}$-statistic in parameter space, is conducted to reveal Galactic binary gravitational wave signals within the dataset. Our new approach eliminates inaccuracies associated with signal subtraction contamination, which is a challenge for traditional iterative-subtraction method when addressing low signal-to-noise ratio signals (e.g., SNR $&lt;$ 15). We also consider the effect of overlapping signals and degeneracy noise. To demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, we utilize the residuals from the LISA mock data challenge (LDC1-4), where 10982 injection sources with SNR $\ge$ 15 have been eliminated. For the remaining low SNR sources (SNR $&lt;$ 15), the LMPSO-CV method efficiently identifies 8995 signals with a 52.3\% detection rate or 3463 signals with a 73.1\% detection rate when the correlation coefficient threshold $R_t$ is set to 0.8.</description>

      <title>Probing the speed of scalar-induced gravitational waves with pulsar timing arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09818v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, several regional pulsar timing array collaborations, including CPTA, EPTA, PPTA, and NANOGrav, have individually reported compelling evidence for a stochastic signal at nanohertz frequencies. This signal originates potentially from scalar-induced gravitational waves associated with significant primordial curvature perturbations on small scales. In this letter, we employ data from the EPTA DR2, PPTA DR3, and NANOGrav 15-year data set, to explore the speed of scalar-induced gravitational waves using a comprehensive Bayesian analysis. Our results suggest that, to be consistent with pulsar timing array observations, the speed of scalar-induced gravitational waves should be $c_g \gtrsim 0.61$ at a $95\%$ credible interval for a lognormal power spectrum of curvature perturbations. Additionally, this constraint aligns with the prediction of general relativity that $c_g=1$ within a $90\%$ credible interval. Our findings underscore the capacity of pulsar timing arrays as a powerful tool for probing the speed of scalar-induced gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>Geodesic structure, shadow and optical appearance of black hole immersed in Chaplygin-like dark fluid</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.18066v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we focus on a black hole immersed in a cosmological Chaplygin-like dark fluid (CDF), characterized by the equation of state $p=-B/\rho$ and an additional parameter $q$ influencing the energy density of the fluid. We investigate the geodesic structure, shadow, and optical appearance of such a black hole. Through analysis on the effective potential and the epicyclic frequencies, it is found that the existence of innermost/outermost stable circular orbits for a timelike particle is governed by the CDF parameters. The behaviors of the orbital conserved quantities and Keplerian frequency are also examined. Due to the existence of pseudo-cosmological horizon, the determination of the shadow radius depends significantly on the position of the observer. By placing the static observer at an approximately flat position between the event and pseudo-cosmological horizons, we constrain the CDF parameters using EHT observations. We investigate the effect of CDF on the shadows and optical images of the black hole, surrounded by various profiles of accretions. For the thin disk accretion, the light trajectories are categorized into direct emission, lensing ring, and photon ring based on impact parameters. Due to the existence of outermost stable circular orbits, outer edges could exist in the direct and lensing ring images. The observed brightness is mainly due to direct emission, with a minor contribution from the lensing ring, while the contribution from the photon ring is negligible due to extreme demagnetization. In the case of spherical accretion, we consider both static and infalling accretion models. The images obtained under infalling accretion are slightly darker than those under static accretion, attributed to the Doppler effect. Throughout the study, we analyze the influence of the parameters $B$ and $q$ on the results.</description>

Abstract: At first glance, thermodynamic properties of gravity with asymptotically AdS conditions and those with box boundary conditions, where the spatial section of the boundary is a sphere of finite radius, appear similar. Both exhibit a similar phase structure and Hawking-Page phase transition. However, when we introduce a U(1) gauge field to the system, discrepancies in thermodynamic properties between the two cases has been reported in [7] (JHEP 11 (2016) 041). In this paper, by accepting the assumption that all Euclidean saddles contribute to the partition function, I found that these discrepancies are resolved due to the contribution from the "bag of gold (BG)," which is the class of Euclidean geometries whose area of bolt is bigger than that of the boundary. As a result, the Hawking-Page phase structure is restored, with the unexpected properties that the upper bound of thermodynamic entropy is always larger than the boundary area divided by 4G when the chemical potential is non-zero, and that such high entropy states are realized at sufficiently high temperature.</description>

      <title>Optimal shielding for Einstein gravity</title>

Abstract: To construct asymptotically-Euclidean Einstein's initial data sets, we introduce the localized seed-to-solution method, which projects from approximate to exact solutions of the Einstein constraints. The method enables us to glue together initial data sets in multiple asymptotically-conical regions, and in particular construct data sets that exhibit the gravity shielding phenomenon, specifically that are localized in a cone and exactly Euclidean outside of it. We achieve optimal shielding in the sense that the metric and extrinsic curvature { are controlled at a super-harmonic rate, regardless of how slowly they decay (even} beyond the standard ADM formalism), and the gluing domain can be a collection of arbitrarily narrow nested cones. We also uncover several notions of independent interest: silhouette functions, localized ADM modulator, and relative energy-momentum vector. An axisymmetric example is provided numerically.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of the 3-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01436v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, I studied the thermodynamical properties of the Einstein-Maxwell system with a box boundary in 4-dimensions [1](JHEP 04 (2024) 083). In this paper, I investigate those in 3-dimensions using the zero-loop saddle-point approximation and focusing only on a simple topology sector as usual. Similar to the 4-dimensional case, the system is thermodynamically well-behaved when $\Lambda&lt;0$ (due to the contribution of the "bag of gold" saddles). However, when $\Lambda=0$, a crucial difference to the 4-dimensional case appears, i.e. the 3-dimensional system turns out to be thermodynamically unstable, while the 4-dimensional one is thermodynamically stable. This may offer two options for how we think about the thermodynamics of 3-dimensional gravity with $\Lambda=0$. One is that the zero-loop approximation or restricting the simple topology sector is not sufficient for 3-dimensions with $\Lambda=0$. The other is that 3-dimensional gravity is really thermodynamically unstable when $\Lambda=0$.</description>

      <title>Energy flux and waveforms by coalescing spinless binary system in effective one-body theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09211v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a study on the energy radiation rate and waveforms of the gravitational wave generated by coalescing spinless binary systems up to the third post-Minkowskian approximation in the effective one-body theory. To derive an analytical expansion of the null tetrad components of the gravitational perturbed Weyl tensor $\varPsi_{4}$ in the effective spacetime, we utilize the method proposed by Sasaki $et$ $al.$ During this investigation, we discover more general integral formulas that provide a theoretical framework for computing the results in any order. Subsequently, we successfully compute the energy radiation rate and waveforms of the gravitational wave, which include the results of the Schwarzschild case and the correction terms resulting from the dimensionless parameters $a_{2}$ and $a_{3}$ in the effective metric.</description>

      <title>Neutrinos as possible probes for quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04076v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we aim to explore the interplay between neutrinos and quantum gravity, illustrating some proposals about the use of these particles as probes for the supposed quantized structure of spacetime. The residual signatures of a more fundamental theory of quantum gravity can manifest themselves modifying the free particle dispersion relations and the connected velocity. In neutrino sector these supposed effects can modify the time of flight for astrophysical particles with different energies and can affect the usual neutrino oscillation pattern introducing species depending perturbations. We will highlight how perturbations caused by non-standard interactions in the solar neutrino sector can mimic the presumed quantum gravity effects. In fact, the mathematical formulation of non-standard interactions is equivalent to that of CPT-odd perturbations. We will, therefore, emphasize the need to identify the nature of different contributions in order to disentangle them in the search for quantum gravity effects. As a final point we will discuss the possibility to detect in the neutrino sector decoherence effects caused by the quantum gravity supposed perturbations. By reviewing current experimental constraints and observations, we seek to shed light on the intricate relationship between neutrinos and quantum gravity, and discuss the challenges and future directions in this fascinating field of research.</description>

      <title>Standing wave in perturbed anti-de Sitter spacetimes with a naked singularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16254v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the framework of black hole perturbation theory, this work investigates the standing wave solutions in Reissner-Nordtsr\"om (RN) anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetimes with a naked singularity. These solutions can be viewed as a specific class of quasinormal modes exhibiting distinct characteristics. The imaginary parts of their frequencies are numerically vanishing, allowing them to persist over an extended period. Besides, these modes are predominantly stationary in terms of the evolution of spacetime waveforms. The numerical calculations are carried out employing the finite difference method, and the quasinormal frequencies extracted by the Prony method are shown to be consistent with those obtained using the matrix method. The obtained waveforms and quasinormal frequencies are shown to be drastically different from those of an extreme RN-AdS black hole. As the quasinormal modes are primarily dissipative, the non-dissipative standing waves are attributed to the nature that the singularity can neither be a sink nor a source of the gravitational system.</description>

      <title>Gravity Rainbow Effects on Higher Curvature Modification of $R^2$ inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04174v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study several extensions of the higher curvature modification of $R^{2}$ inflation in the context of gravity's rainbow. We modify the $(R+R^{2})$ model by adding an $f_{1}R^3$-term, an $f_{2}R^4$-term, and an $f_{3}R^{3/2}$-term to the original model. We calculate the inflationary observables and confront them using the latest observational bounds from Planck 2018 data. We assume the rainbow function of the form $\tilde{f}=1+\left(\frac{H}{M}\right)^{\lambda }$ with $\lambda$ being a rainbow parameter and $M$ a mass-dimensional parameter. We demonstrate that the power spectrum of curvature perturbation relies on the dimensionless coefficient $f_{i},\,i=1,2,3$, a rainbow parameter $\lambda$ and a ratio $H/M$. Likewise, the scalar spectral index $n_s$ is affected by both $f_{i}$ and the rainbow parameter. Moreover, the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ is solely determined by the rainbow parameter. Interestingly, by ensuring that $n_s$ aligns with the Planck collaboration's findings at the $1\sigma$ confidence level, the tensor-to-scalar ratio could reach up to $r\sim 0.01$, which is possibly measurable for detection in forthcoming Stage IV CMB ground experiments and is certainly feasible for future dedicated space missions.</description>

      <title>Predictions of a simple parametric model of hierarchical black hole mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.05766v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hierarchical mergers of black holes are proposed as a mechanism to explain the observations of binary black holes with component masses between $\sim 50M_{\odot}\hbox{--}130M_{\odot}$ by LIGO/Virgo, often referred to as "upper mass gap". We study the efficiency with which hierarchical mergers can produce higher and higher masses using a simple model of the forward evolution of binary black hole populations in gravitationally bound systems like stellar clusters. The model relies on pairing probability and initial mass functions for the black hole population, along with numerical relativity fitting formulas for the mass, spin, and kick speed of the merger remnant. We carry out an extensive comparison of the predictions of our model with clusterBHBdynamics (cBHBd) model, a fast method for the evolution of star clusters and black holes therein. For this comparison, we consider three different pairing functions of black holes and consider simulations from high- and low-metallicity cluster environments from cBHBd. We find good agreements between our model and the cBHBd results when the pairing probability of binaries depends on both total mass and mass ratio. We also assess the efficiency of hierarchical mergers as a function of merger generation and derive the mass distribution of black holes using our model. We find that the multi-modal features in the observed binary black hole mass spectrum---revealed by the non-parametric population models---can be interpreted by invoking the hierarchical merger scenario in dense, metal-rich, stellar environments. Further, the two subdominant peaks in the GWTC-3 component mass spectrum are consistent with second and third-generation mergers in metal-rich, dense environments. With more binary black hole detections, our model could be used to infer the black hole initial mass function and pairing probability exponent.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes with QCD Color Charge</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16877v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe a realistic mechanism whereby black holes with significant QCD color charge could have formed during the early universe. Primordial black holes (PBHs) could make up a significant fraction of the dark matter if they formed well before the QCD confinement transition. Such PBHs would form by absorbing unconfined quarks and gluons, and hence could acquire a net color charge. We estimate the number of PBHs per Hubble volume with near-extremal color charge for various scenarios, and discuss possible phenomenological implications.</description>

      <title>The merger rate of primordial black hole binaries as a probe of Hubble parameter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13728v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose that the merger rate of primordial black hole (PBH) binaries can be a probe of Hubble parameter by constraining PBH mass function in the redshifted mass distribution of PBH binaries. In next-generation gravitational wave (GW) detectors, the GWs from PBH binaries would be detected at high redshifts, which gives their redshifted mass and luminosity distances. From a number of detected events, the redshifted mass distribution of PBH binaries can be statistically obtained, and it depends on PBH mass function and redshift distribution of detected PBH binaries. The PBH mass function can be inversely solved by applying the gradient descent method in the relation between redshifted mass distribution and redshift distribution. However, the construction of redshift distribution requires an assumed Hubble parameter in a background cosmology to extract redshift from luminosity distances, which causes solved PBH mass function also depends on assumed Hubble parameter. To determine the Hubble parameter, the merger rate of PBH binaries constrains on this Hubble parameter-dependent PBH mass function by comparing calculated merger rate distribution with observed one, and the best-fit result produces an approximate mass distribution of the physical PBH mass function and pins down the Hubble parameter.</description>

      <title>One-loop partition functions in $T\overline{T}$-deformed AdS$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09879v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the geometry of $T\bar{T}$-deformed BTZ black hole and find it can be regarded as a quotient of hyperbolic space. We then consider the massive scalar field propagating in the $T\bar{T}$-deformed BTZ black hole background. The one-loop partition function of scalar field is calculated using the heat kernel method and the Wilson spool proposal. These two methods give consistent result which implies the Wilson spool proposal still holds under $T\bar{T}$ deformation. Moreover, we also calculate the one-loop partition function of graviton in $T\bar{T}$-deformed BTZ black hole. We find the deformed one-loop partition functions are modified in a simple way, which corresponds to a replacement of the modular parameter. The result precisely matches the large $c$ expansion of $T\bar{T}$-deformed CFT partition function. These results provide a further check about the correspondence between $T\bar{T}$-deformed CFT$_2$ and AdS$_3$ with mixed boundary condition.</description>
