      <title>Effective Microstructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$ duality, there are large families of smooth, horizonless microstate geometries that correspond to heavy pure states of the dual CFT. The metric and fluxes are complicated functions of up to five coordinates. There are also many duals of heavy pure states that cannot be described in supergravity, but only admit a worldsheet description. Extracting the physical properties of these solutions is technically challenging. In this paper, we show that there are much simpler effective descriptions of these solutions that capture many of their stringy and geometrical features, at the price of sacrificing supergravity smoothness. In particular, the effective description of some families of superstrata, and of certain worldsheet solutions, is given by easy-to-construct three-center solutions. For example, the effective description of a superstratum with a long AdS$_2$ throat is a scaling, three-center solution in which the momentum wave is collapsed to a singular source at one of the three centers. This also highlights how momentum migrates away from the supertube locus in the back-reacted geometry. Our results suggest that effective descriptions can be extended to more general microstates, and that many singular multi-center solutions can in fact correspond to effective descriptions of smooth horizonless microstructure.</description>

      <title>The On-shell Gravity Action and Linear Dilaton Holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computing the Euclidean spacetime action on-shell provides a useful way of both testing holographic proposals and determining the string theory sphere partition function. We consider families of three-dimensional linear dilaton spacetimes for which there are holographic proposals that share features of a $T\overline{T}$-deformed CFT. We extend the holographic renormalization program beyond AdS to this class of geometries by identifying the boundary terms needed for a well-defined variational principle and a finite on-shell action. We show that the spacetime energy or mass determined from the on-shell action matches the $T\overline{T}$-deformed two-dimensional CFT energy. This provides more evidence for the role of the $T\overline{T}$ deformation in this holographic correspondence.</description>

      <title>Generalized Neumann boundary condition for the scalar field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the Klein-Gordon field theory in $(D+1)$ dimensions in the presence of a $(D-1)$-dimensional hyperplanar $\delta$-like potential that couples quadratically to the field derivatives. This model effectively generalizes the Neumann boundary condition for the scalar field on the plane, as it reduces to this condition in an appropriate limit of the coupling parameter. Specifically, we calculate the modifications to the Feynman propagator induced by the planar potential and analyze the interaction energy between a stationary point-like source and the potential, obtaining a general and exact expression. We demonstrate that, under certain conditions relating the field mass and the coupling constant to the external potential, the vacuum state becomes unstable, giving rise to a pair-creation phenomenon that resembles the Schwinger effect in quantum electrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Extra-natural production of superheavy Kaluza-Klein particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gauge fields in extra compact dimensions can drive inflation in the four-dimensional (4D) non-compact spacetime, a scenario known as extra-natural inflation. A time-dependent gauge field configuration generates the electric field along the compact dimension, enabling the production of Kaluza-Klein (KK) particles charged under the field via the Schwinger effect. We construct the extra-natural inflation model within a five-dimensional (5D) quantum electrodynamics (QED) framework coupled to gravity including matter fields that generate the inflationary one-loop effective potential. In general, multiple charged fields can exist, and we show that KK particle production occurs under these conditions. Since KK momentum is conserved, the produced KK particles may become superheavy dark matter or dominate the universe, depending on the model parameters. Furthermore, we show that even when the gauge field acts not as the inflaton but as a spectator field, its post-inflationary oscillations, initiated when the Hubble friction becomes negligible, can also generate superheavy KK modes. This suggests that KK particle production is a generic outcome when gauge potentials along compact dimensions are light.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.11293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamics of gravity interaction with matter at one-loop level of effective quantum field theory naturally sets the cut-off scale $\Lambda_E$ in a sub-Planckian region through incorporating the gauge coupling constant $\alpha(\Lambda_E)$ and the reduced Planckian mass $\tilde m_\text{pl}$ into relation $ \Lambda_E\sim \tilde m_\text{pl}\,\alpha(\Lambda_E)/(4\pi)$ numerically yielding $\Lambda_E\sim 10^{16}$ GeV. Such two scales are empirically inherent for an inflationary cosmology.</description>

      <title>$T\bar{T}$ braneworld holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a constructive gravitational dual of two-dimensional $T\bar{T}$-deformed conformal field theories (CFTs) grounded in their two-dimensional gravity description. This framework can be viewed as a Randall-Sundrum-type braneworld, where two-dimensional gravity localized on the $AdS_3$ boundary is dynamical. Assuming the AdS/CFT correspondence, the holographic dictionary provides a straightforward translation between the $T\bar{T}$-deformed CFT and its gravitational dual. In particular, this $T\bar{T}$ braneworld holography remains valid in the presence of matter. To clarify how our framework relates to -- and differs from -- the cutoff AdS proposal, we examine, in the absence of matter, the effect of dynamical boundary gravity on the bulk geometry. In general, semiclassical integration of the boundary two-dimensional gravity -- weighted by the massive gravity action -- leads to a deformation of the two-dimensional metric on constant-radial surfaces. However, we find that the surface commonly interpreted as the cutoff emerges dynamically as a characteristic bulk surface on which the deformation is neutralized. This perspective opens the door to possible extensions of our framework to incorporate matter effects on the bulk surface in future work.</description>

      <title>Differential Contracting Homotopy in the Linearized 3d Higher-Spin Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the recently developed differential homotopy approach is applied to the problem of disentangling dynamical and topological fields of the $3d$ higher-spin gauge theory at the linear level. This formalism allows us to reproduce all known disentangling solutions in a unified form, including both the solutions obtained previously within the shifted homotopy approach in \cite{Korybut:2022kdx} and that derived by hand in \cite{Vasiliev:1992ix}, as well as other solutions including those associated with the cohomology of the background covariant derivative $D_0$. Also, within the differential homotopy framework an alternative way of derivation of disentangled equations through a non-conventional solution for the field $S_1$ is suggested. The obtained results are important for further analysis of nonlinear corrections to HS equations in $AdS_3$.</description>

      <title>Explicit construction of the energy-momentum tensor in the large N limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct the energy-momentum tensor of the O(N) linear sigma model explicitly in the large N limit. Our guiding principles behind the construction are twofold: first the energy-momentum tensor must satisfy the Ward identity for translation and rotation invariance, and second the energy-momentum tensor must have proper cutoff dependence as a composite operator. We verify that the energy-momentum tensor thus constructed satisfies the expected trace formula, and that the trace vanishes at the critical point.</description>

      <title>Kinematic flow from the flow of cuts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The wavefunction coefficients of conformally coupled scalars in power-law FRW cosmologies satisfy differential equations governed by a set of simple combinatorial rules known as the kinematic flow. In this paper we derive the kinematic flow, expressed using a set of differential forms referred to as the cut basis, from a geometric perspective, relying solely on the cosmological hyperplane arrangement and without invoking bulk physics. Each element of the cut basis corresponds to the positive geometry associated to an independent cut of the physical FRW-form and can be labeled by decorating (minors of) the truncated Feynman graph with an acyclic orientation. We provide a straightforward prescription to associate a logarithmic differential form to each element of the cut basis by considering its corresponding decorated graph. Moreover, we show that the residues of the physical FRW-form are canonical forms of certain graphical zonotopes labeled by the same set of decorated graphs. These zonotopes control the cut combinatorics -- flow of cuts -- of the physical FRW-form and the cut basis (by construction). Using the theory of relative twisted cohomology and intersection theory, we derive a closed form formula for the differential equations of the cut basis. We also introduce combinatorial rules that compute the kinematic differential of any basis element without explicit calculation. The combinatorics of our differential equations is a natural consequence of the flow of cuts and is equivalent (up to rescaling) to the kinematic flow for the recently studied time integral basis. In particular, our differential equations decouple into exponentially many sectors, one for each way of cutting a subset of edges of the graph.</description>

      <title>Anomaly cancellation for a $U(1)$ factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use methods of arithmetic geometry to solve the abelian local anomaly cancellation conditions for a four-dimensional gauge theory whose Lie algebra has a single $\mathfrak{u}_1$ summand, assuming that a solution exists. The resulting polynomial equations in the integer $\mathfrak{u}_1$ charges define a projective cubic hypersurface over the field of rational numbers. Generically, such a hypersurface is (by a theorem of Koll\'{a}r) a unirational variety, making it possible to find a finitely-many-to-one parametrization of all solutions (of which there are necessarily infinitely many). (Otherwise, such a hypersurface is either reducible or is a cone over an elliptic curve and all solutions can again be found in practice.) As an example, for the Standard Model Lie algebra with its three generations of quarks and leptons (or even with just a single generation and two $\mathfrak{su}_3 \oplus \mathfrak{su}_2$-singlet right-handed neutrinos), it follows that there are infinitely many anomaly-free possibilities for the $\mathfrak{u}_1$ hypercharges.</description>

      <title>Holography at Finite N: Breakdown of Bulk Reconstruction for Subregions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within AdS/CFT, focusing on the AdS-Rindler wedge, we show that when $N$ is large but finite, correlation functions of reconstructed bulk operators grow exponentially with bulk momentum, overwhelming the usual $1/N$ suppression. The growth starts when the smeared operator's ultraviolet scale goes beyond a critical value $\Lambda_{crit} = \frac{2}{\pi}\ln N$, which is far below the Planck scale. Above this logarithmic threshold, the large $N$ expansion ceases to be reliable, and the would-be bulk operators cannot be consistently defined as observables in the full quantum gravity theory. Since the AdS-Rindler wedge describes the near-horizon region of black holes, this result implies a sharp $\ln N$ cutoff for reconstructing bulk operators across horizons. This has a direct impact on whether and how information from the black hole interior is encoded-a central question in the black hole information paradox.</description>

      <title>The fundamental physical importance of generic off-diagonal solutions and Grigori Perelman entropy in the Einstein gravity theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The gravitational field equations in general relativity (GR) consist of a sophisticated system of nonlinear partial differential equations. Solving such equations in some generic off-diagonal forms is usually a hard analytic or numeric task. Physically important solutions in GR were constructed using a diagonal ansatz for metrics with a maximum of 4 independent coefficients. The Einstein equations can be solved in exact or parametric forms determined by some integration constants for corresponding assumptions on spherical or cylindrical spacetime symmetries. The anholonomic frame and connection deformation method allows us to construct generic off-diagonal solutions described by 6 independent coefficients of metrics depending, in general, on all spacetime coordinates. New types of exact and parametric solutions are determined by generating and integration functions and (effective) generating sources. They may describe vacuum gravitational and matter fields solitonic hierarchies; locally anisotropic polarizations of physical constants for black holes, wormholes, black toruses, or cosmological solutions; various types of off-diagonal deformations of horizons, etc. The additional degrees of freedom (related to off-diagonal coefficients) can be used to describe dark energy and dark matter configurations and elaborate locally anisotropic cosmological scenarios. In general, the generic off-diagonal solutions do not involve certain hypersurface or holographic configurations and can't be described in the framework of the Bekenstein-Hawking thermodynamic paradigm. We argue that generalizing the concept of G. Perelman's entropy for relativistic Ricci flows allows us to define and compute geometric thermodynamic variables for all possible classes of solutions in GR.</description>

      <title>Probing phase transitions and microscopic interactions in quasi-topological black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine the thermodynamic geometry of four-dimensional quasi-topological black holes by computing the Ruppeiner scalar curvature R which serves as an empirical tool to describe the nature of interactions among black hole microstructures. In four dimensions, we write novel black hole solutions within the framework of generalized quasi-topological gravity, extended through a fundamental p-form field. Temperature, entropy, and thermodynamic volume are explicitly expressed using the extended first law. The nature of the interactions between the microstructure is then revealed by computing R, where positive curvature indicates repulsion dominant interactions and negative curvature indicates the dominance of attraction. Our approach uses divergences and sign changing nature of R to identify critical points and phase transitions. Further, our analysis reveals a notably streamlined thermodynamic behavior, a single zero-crossing of curvature R, marking a second-order phase transition and offering direct insight into the underlying microstructure interactions.</description>

      <title>Unification of Gravity and Standard Model: Weyl-Dirac-Born-Infeld action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a unified (quantum) description by the gauge principle of gravity and Standard Model (SM), that extends the Dirac-Born-Infeld action to the SM and Weyl geometry in $d$ dimensions, hereafter called Weyl-Dirac-Born-Infeld action (WDBI). This action is a general gauge theory of SM and Weyl group (of dilatations and Poincar\'e symmetry), in the Weyl gauge covariant (metric) formulation of Weyl geometry. The theory is SM and Weyl gauge invariant in arbitrary $d$ dimensions, hence there is no Weyl anomaly. The action has the unique elegant feature, not present in other gauge theories or even in string theory, that it is mathematically well-defined in $d$ dimensions, with no need to introduce a UV regulator (scale or field). The WDBI action actually {\it predicts} that gravity, through (Weyl covariant) space-time curvature, acts as UV regulator of both SM and gravity in $d=4$. A series expansion of the WDBI action (in dimensionless couplings) recovers in the leading order the Weyl gauge invariant action of SM and Weyl (gauge theory of) quadratic gravity. The SM and Einstein-Hilbert gravity are recovered in the Stueckelberg broken phase of Weyl gauge symmetry, which also restores Riemannian geometry below Planck scale. Sub-leading orders are suppressed by powers of (dimensionless) gravitational coupling ($\xi$) of Weyl quadratic gravity.</description>

Abstract: We prove a general version of the crystalline equivalence principle which gives an equivalence of categories between a category of TQFTs defined on a generic space with $G$-symmetry, and a category of TQFTs with internal symmetry. We give a definition and classification of anomalies associated to TQFTs in the presence of spatial symmetry, which we then generalize to a definition of an anomaly for a categorical symmetry.</description>

      <title>Observable Optimization for Precision Theory: Machine Learning Energy Correlators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The practice of collider physics typically involves the marginalization of multi-dimensional collider data to uni-dimensional observables relevant for some physics task. In any cases, such as classification or anomaly detection, the observable can be arbitrarily complicated, such as the output of a neural network. However, for precision measurements, the observable must correspond to something computable systematically beyond the level of current simulation tools. In this work, we demonstrate that precision-theory-compatible observable space exploration can be systematized by using neural simulation-based inference techniques from machine learning. We illustrate this approach by exploring the space of marginalizations of the energy 3-point correlator to optimize sensitivity to the the top quark mass. We first learn the energy-weighted probability density from simulation, then search in the space of marginalizations for an optimal triangle shape. Although simulations and machine learning are used in the process of observable optimization, the output is an observable definition which can be then computed to high precision and compared directly to data without any memory of the computations which produced it. We find that the optimal marginalization is isosceles triangles on the sphere with a side ratio approximately $1:1:\sqrt{2}$ (i.e. right triangles) within the set of marginalizations we consider.</description>

      <title>Spontaneously Broken Non-Invertible Symmetries in Transverse-Field Ising Qudit Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: \usepackage{iopams} Recent developments have revealed that symmetries need not form a group, but instead can be non-invertible. Here we use analytical arguments and numerical evidence to illuminate how spontaneous symmetry breaking of a non-invertible symmetry is similar yet distinct from ordinary, invertible, symmetry breaking. We consider one-dimensional chains of group-valued qudits, whose local Hilbert space is spanned by elements of a finite group $G$ (reducing to ordinary qubits when $G=\mathbb{Z}_2$). We construct Ising-type transverse-field Hamiltonians with Rep($G$) symmetry whose generators multiply according to the tensor product of irreducible representations (irreps) of the group $G$. For non-Abelian $G$, the symmetry is non-invertible. In the symmetry broken phase there is one ground state per irrep on a closed chain. The symmetry breaking can be detected by local order parameters but, unlike the invertible case, different ground states have distinct entanglement patterns. We show that for each irrep of dimension greater than one the corresponding ground state exhibits string order, entanglement spectrum degeneracies, and has gapless edge modes on an open chain -- features usually associated with symmetry-protected topological order. Consequently, domain wall excitations behave as one-dimensional non-Abelian anyons with non-trivial internal Hilbert spaces and fusion rules. Our work identifies properties of non-invertible symmetry breaking that existing quantum hardware can probe.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Corrected Thermodynamics and Plasma Lensing in Non-Minimally Coupled Symmetric Teleparallel Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamic and optical signatures of electrically charged black holes (BHs) in symmetric teleparallel gravity (STPG) with non-minimal electromagnetic coupling, incorporating quantum corrections and plasma dispersion effects. The BH solution, characterized by a coupling parameter $k$, generalizes the Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m spacetime through power-law modifications to electromagnetic terms in the metric function. We implement exponential corrections to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of the form $S = S_0 + e^{-S_0}$ and derive quantum-corrected expressions for fundamental thermodynamic quantities including internal energy, Helmholtz and Gibbs free energies, pressure, enthalpy, and heat capacity. Our analysis reveals rich phase transition structures with second-order transitions occurring at critical horizon radii for specific coupling values, demonstrating enhanced thermodynamic instability under strong non-minimal coupling effects. The quantum-corrected Joule-Thomson expansion analysis identifies distinct cooling and heating regimes separated by inversion points that shift systematically with the coupling parameter $k$. We analyze the efficiency of heat engines operating in Carnot cycles, finding that electromagnetic charge enhances thermodynamic performance with efficiency values approaching 99\% for optimal configurations in this geometry. Using the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, we derive analytical expressions for gravitational deflection angles in both vacuum and plasma environments, revealing how non-minimal coupling and plasma dispersion create frequency-dependent lensing signatures that differ substantially from general relativity predictions.</description>

      <title>Nambu-Goldstone boson phenomenology in Domain-Wall Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the Domain-Wall Standard Model (DWSM), a five-dimensional framework in which all Standard Model (SM) particles are localized on a domain wall embedded in a non-compact extra spatial dimension. A distinctive feature of this setup is the emergence of a Nambu-Goldstone (NG) boson, arising from the spontaneous breaking of translational invariance in the extra dimension due to the localization of SM chiral fermions. This NG boson couples via Yukawa interactions to SM fermions and their Kaluza-Klein (KK) excitations. We study the phenomenology of this NG boson and derive constraints from astrophysical processes (supernova cooling), Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN), and collider searches for KK-mode fermions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The strongest limits arise from LHC data: we reinterpret existing mass bounds on squarks and sleptons in simplified supersymmetric models (assuming a massless lightest neutralino), as well as limits on exotic hadrons containing long-lived squarks or long-lived charged sleptons in the regime of extremely small Yukawa couplings. From this analysis, we obtain a conservative lower bound of 1 TeV on the masses of KK-mode quarks and charged leptons. Finally, we discuss the prospects for producing KK-mode fermions at future high-energy lepton colliders and outline strategies to distinguish their signatures from those of sfermions.</description>

      <title>ACT inflation and its influence on reheating era in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the observational viability of non-minimally coupled scalar-Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (GB) gravity, during inflation and post-inflationary reheating dynamics, from the perspective of the latest ACT-DR6 combined with the Planck 2018 and BAO data. It turns out that the ACT result considerably affects the inflationary e-fold number compared to the case where only Planck 2018 data is taken into account. The viable parameter spaces corresponding to the inflationary ACT-DR6+Planck18+BAO substantially influence the reheating phenomenology via the reheating equation of state ($w_\mathrm{eff}$) and the reheating temperature. In particular, the ACT-DR6+Planck18+BAO data seems to disfavor $w_\mathrm{eff} &lt; 1/3$ during the reheating stage, which is unlike to that of only Planck 2018 case. These reveal how the ACT-DR6 data hits the early universe phenomenology from inflation to reheating in the context of higher curvature like scalar-Einstein-GB theory of gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.11512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a string theoretic approach to surface counting in local Calabi--Yau fourfolds via supersymmetric localization in topologically twisted four-dimensional gauge theories. This approach is based on a spectral correspondence between PT1-stable pairs on local fourfolds and twisted quasimaps with fixed two-dimensional domain associated to the ADHM quiver, or, equivalently, ADHM sheaves. For local toric fourfolds, we derive a conjectural residue formula for the K-theoretic quasimap partition via Coulomb branch localization. As a result, in this case, we obtain a conjectural prescription fixing all usual sign ambiguities in the equivariant computation of such invariants. We present some explicit computations for local P2, extending the results available in the literature, and describe the formalism in general. This is the first instance of Coulomb branch localization for a quasimap theory in the context of four-dimensional gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Finite-Width Neural Tangent Kernels from Feynman Diagrams</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.11522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural tangent kernels (NTKs) are a powerful tool for analyzing deep, non-linear neural networks. In the infinite-width limit, NTKs can easily be computed for most common architectures, yielding full analytic control over the training dynamics. However, at infinite width, important properties of training such as NTK evolution or feature learning are absent. Nevertheless, finite width effects can be included by computing corrections to the Gaussian statistics at infinite width. We introduce Feynman diagrams for computing finite-width corrections to NTK statistics. These dramatically simplify the necessary algebraic manipulations and enable the computation of layer-wise recursive relations for arbitrary statistics involving preactivations, NTKs and certain higher-derivative tensors (dNTK and ddNTK) required to predict the training dynamics at leading order. We demonstrate the feasibility of our framework by extending stability results for deep networks from preactivations to NTKs and proving the absence of finite-width corrections for scale-invariant nonlinearities such as ReLU on the diagonal of the Gram matrix of the NTK. We validate our results with numerical experiments.</description>

Abstract: Massless vector and scalar Green's functions are obtained in closed form for a plane gravitational wave spacetime using three independent methods: direct solution of the Green-function equation and construction via the DeWitt and Hadamard recursive schemes. The results coincide exactly with the DeWitt--Schwinger expansion, indicating no massless particles production in this background. Contrasting interpretations, based on Bogolyubov coefficient calculations predicting massless particle creation, are also addressed.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a large class of conformally-covariant differential operators and a crossing equation that they obey. Together, these tools dramatically simplify calculations involving operators with spin in conformal field theories. As an application, we derive a formula for a general conformal block (with arbitrary internal and external representations) in terms of derivatives of blocks for external scalars. In particular, our formula gives new expressions for "seed conformal blocks" in 3d and 4d CFTs. We also find simple derivations of identities between external-scalar blocks with different dimensions and internal spins. We comment on additional applications, including derivation of recursion relations for general conformal blocks, reducing inversion formulae for spinning operators to inversion formulae for scalars, and deriving identities between general 6j symbols (Racah-Wigner coefficients/"crossing kernels") of the conformal group.</description>

Abstract: We propose a systematic approximation scheme to calculate general $n$-point $HSSA$ of open bosonic string theory. This stringy scaling loop expansion contains finite number of vacuum diagram terms at each loop order of scattering energy due to a vacuum diagram contraint and a topological graph constraint. In addition, we calculate coefficient and give the vacuum diagram representation and its Feynman rules for each term in the expansion of the $HSSA$. As an application to extending our previous calculation of $n$-point leading order stringy scaling behavior of $HSSA$, we explicitly calculate some examples of $4$-point next to leading order stringy scaling violation terms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11034v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define and solve the $\text{U(1)}$ Chern-Simons-Maxwell theory on spacetime lattice, with an emphasis on the chirality of the theory. Realizing Chern-Simons theory on lattice has been a problem of interest for decades, and over the years it has gradually become clear that there are two key points: 1) Some non-topological term, such as a Maxwell term, is necessary -- this is true even in the continuum, but more manifestly on the lattice; 2) the $\text{U(1)}$ gauge field should be implemented in the Villainized form to retain its topological properties. Putting the two ideas together seriously, we show all interesting properties of a chiral Chern-Simons theory are reproduced in an explicitly regularized manner on the lattice. These include the bosonic and fermionic level quantization, the bulk and chiral edge spectrum, the Wilson loop flux attachment (with point-split framing or geometric framing depending on the Maxwell coupling), the Wilson loop spin, the ground state degeneracy, and, most non-trivially, the chiral gravitational anomaly.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06382v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conformal Gravity (CG) is a Weyl--invariant metric theory whose action is free from divergences for generic asymptotically anti-de Sitter spaces. For Neumann boundary conditions, it reduces to renormalized Einstein--AdS gravity at tree level. By evaluating CG's action on a replica orbifold, one obtains a codimension-2 local conformal invariant functional, $L_\Sigma$, which reduces to the renormalized area, the reduced Hawking mass and the Willmore Energy, for a surface $\Sigma$. Although there is evidence supporting the idea that this functional should be finite, a detailed analysis of its asymptotic behavior near the conformal boundary is still lacking. In this work, the finiteness of the conformal surface functional $L_\Sigma$ is shown for any boundary--anchored surface embedded in an arbitrary ambient spacetime which is a solution to CG. This conclusion is drawn regardless the fact the surface is minimal or not. This result implies that Conformal Renormalization method not only applies to the bulk action, but also codimension--2 functionals.</description>

Abstract: We study the hydrodynamic response of the AdS electron star in the vector sector, and compute the correlation functions and the transverse conductivity of the dual field theory. The system exhibits hydrodynamic behavior at low temperatures and near the critical temperature where the electron star undergoes the phase transition to the RN black hole. However, at intermediate temperatures the hydrodynamics does not exist. Remarkably, the system has an instability, i.e. a pole on the positive imaginary frequency axis at finite temperature. This instability is found both from analytical arguments and from numerics. Its physical meaning is so far unclear but it might mean that the ideal fluid limit for the star is a false vacuum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20180v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computing the vacuum expectation of fermion number operator on a soliton background is often challenging. A recent proposal in arXiv:2305.13606 simplifies this task by considering the soliton in a bounded region and relating the $\eta$ invariant, and thus the fermion number, to a specific heat kernel coefficient and to contributions from the edge states. We test this method in a system of charged fermions living on an Abrikosov-Nielsen-Olesen (ANO) vortex background. We show that the resulting $\eta$ invariant does not depend on boundary conditions (within a certain class), thereby supporting the validity of the method. Our analysis reveals a nontrivial feature for the fermionic spectrum in the vortex-induced Higgs phase. As a by-product, we also find that for a vortex living on a disk, the edge states carry fractional charge.</description>

      <title>Non-Local Conserved Currents and Continuous Non-Invertible Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22976v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We embark on a systematic study of continuous non-invertible symmetries, focusing on 1+1d CFTs. We describe a generalized version of Noether's theorem, where continuous non-invertible symmetries are associated to $\textit{non-local}$ conserved currents: point-like operators attached to extended topological defects. The generalized Noether's theorem unifies several constructions of continuous non-invertible symmetries in the literature, and allows us to exhibit many more examples in diverse theories of interest. We first review known examples which are non-intrinsic (i.e., invertible up to gauging), and then describe $\textit{new}$ examples in Wess-Zumino-Witten models and products of minimal models. For some of these new examples, we show that these continuous non-invertible symmetries are intrinsic if we demand that a certain global symmetry is preserved. The continuous non-invertible symmetries in products of minimal models also allow us to construct new examples of defect conformal manifolds in a single copy of a minimal model. Finally, we comment on continuous non-invertible symmetries in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>$c_\text{eff}$ from Surgery and Modularity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10087v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: $\widehat{Z}$ invariants, rigorously defined for negative definite plumbed 3-manifolds, are expected--on physical grounds--to exist for every closed, oriented 3-manifold. Several prescriptions have been proposed to extend their definition to generic plumbings by reversing the orientation of a negative definite plumbing, thus turning it into a positive definite one. Two existing proposals are relevant for this paper: (i) the regularized $+1/r$-surgery conjecture combined with the false-mock modular conjecture, and (ii) a construction based on resurgence and a false theta function duality. In this note, we compare these proposals on the class of Brieskorn homology spheres $\Sigma\left(s,t,rst\pm1\right)$ and find that they are incompatible in general. Our diagnostic is the effective central charge, $c_{\text{eff}}$, which governs the asymptotic growth of coefficients of $\widehat{Z}$. First, we prove that the upper bound on $c_{\text{eff}}$ from prescription (i) is governed by the Ramanujan theta function, which regularizes the surgery formula. Second, we develop numerical and modular tools that deliver the lower bounds as well as exact values via mixed mock-modular analysis. Complementing this, we also study $c_{\text{eff}}$ for negative definite plumbed 3-manifolds which allow for a better comparison of pairs of 3-manifolds related by orientation reversal. As a result, we find that for some Brieskorn spheres the surgery and false-mock prescriptions violate the expected relation between $c_{\text{eff}}$, Chern-Simons invariants and non-abelian flat connections. These findings underscore $\widehat{Z}$ as a sensitive probe of the "positive side" of $\widehat{Z}$-theory.</description>

Abstract: We provide conditions under which a Riemann surface $X$ is the asymptotic boundary of a convex co-compact hyperbolic manifold, homeomorphic to a handlebody, of negative renormalized volume. We prove that this is the case when there are on $X$ enough closed curves of short enough hyperbolic length.</description>

      <title>Improved entanglement entropy estimates from filtered bitstring probabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07092v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the bitstring probabilities of ground states of bipartitioned ladders of Rydberg atoms, we calculate the mutual information, which is a lower bound on the corresponding bipartite von Neumann quantum entanglement entropy $S^{vN}_A$. We show that in many cases these lower bounds can be improved by removing the bitstrings with a probability lower than some value $p_{min}$ and renormalizing the remaining probabilities (filtering). We propose a heuristic based on the change of the conditional entropy under filtering that very effectively improves the estimate of $S^{vN}_A$. We consider various sizes, lattice spacings and bipartitions. Our numerical investigation suggest that the filtered mutual information obtained with samples having just a few thousand bitstrings can provide reasonably close estimates of $S^{vN}_A$. We briefly discuss practical implementations with QuEra's Aquila device.</description>

      <title>On the origin of mixed inhomogeneous phase in vortical gluon plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15085v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, lattice simulations of SU(3) Yang-Mills theory revealed that rotating hot gluon matter in thermal equilibrium possesses a novel inhomogeneous phase consisting of the deconfinement phase located in the center region, which is spatially separated from the confinement phase in the periphery. This inhomogeneous two-phase structure is also expected to be produced by vorticity in quark-gluon plasma formed in non-central relativistic heavy-ion collisions. We show that its vortical properties are determined by two types of couplings of the angular velocity to the gluon fields: a linear coupling to the mechanical angular momentum of gluons and a quadratic ``magnetovortical'' coupling to a chromomagnetic component. We demonstrate numerically that the distinctive inhomogeneous structure of the vortical (quark-)gluon plasma is determined by the latter, while the former plays only a subleading role. We argue that the anisotropy of the gluonic action in the curved co-rotating background can quantitatively explain the remarkable property that the spatial structure of this inhomogeneous phase disobeys the picture based on a straightforward implementation of the Tolman-Ehrenfest law. We also support our findings with Monte Carlo simulations of Yang-Mills plasma at the real-valued angular frequency, which take into account only the magnetic part of the action.</description>

      <title>Schwinger pair production in spacetime fields: Moir\'e patterns, Aharonov-Bohm phases and Sturm-Liouville eigenvalues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19709v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use a worldline-instanton formalism to study the momentum spectrum of Schwinger pair production in spacetime fields with multiple stationary points. We show that the interference structure changes fundamentally when going from purely time-dependent to space-time-dependent fields. For example, it was known that two time-dependent pulses give interference if they are anti-parallel, i.e. $E_z(t)-E_z(t-\Delta t)$, but here we show that two spacetime pulses will typically give interference if they instead are parallel, i.e. $E_z(t,z)+E_z(t-\Delta t,z-\Delta z)$. We take into account the fact that the momenta of the electron, $p_z$, and of the positron, $p'_z$, are independent for $E_z(t,z)$ (it would be $p_z+p'_z=0$ for $E(t)$), and find a type of fields which give moir\'e patterns in the $p_z-p'_z$ plane. Depending on the separation of two pulses, we also find an Aharonov-Bohm phase. We also study complex momentum saddle points in order to obtain the integrated probability from the spectrum. Finally, we calculate an asymptotic expansion for the eigenvalues of the Sturm-Liouville equation that corresponds to the saddle-point approximation of the worldline path integral, use that expansion to compute the product of eigenvalues, and compare with the result obtained with the Gelfand-Yaglom method.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear trident using WKB and worldline instantons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19758v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider nonlinear trident, $e^{\scriptscriptstyle -}\to e^{\scriptscriptstyle -} e^{\scriptscriptstyle -} e^{\scriptscriptstyle +}$, in various electric background fields. This process has so far been studied for plane-wave backgrounds, using Volkov solutions. Here we first use WKB for trident in time-dependent electric fields, and then for fields which vary slowly in space. Then we show how to use worldline instantons for more general fields which depend on both time and space. For time-dependent fields the WKB approach is at least as simple to use as the worldline approach, but already the relatively modest step of including a slow spatial dependence makes the worldline approach much more efficient.</description>

      <title>Hairless Black Hole by Superradiance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18003v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the interplaying effects of black hole scalarization and superradiance in the context of the Einstein-Maxwell-scalar model, with the scalar field possessing electric charge. Restricted to spherical symmetry, our linear analysis about a Reissner-Nordstr\"om background confirms the persistence of tachyonic scalar modes upon inclusion of electric charge. However, fully nonlinear numerical simulations reveal that the system no longer evolves into a scalarized, hairy black hole state. Instead, we find that the superradiance phenomenon (specifically the electromagnetic version of the effect) causes the scalar condensate to become fully depleted through accretion into the black hole and radiation to spatial infinity. The combination of the two effects, which we refer to as "tachyonic superradiance", may thus be seen as a particularly efficient mechanism for the extraction of energy from a black hole, exploiting both the tachyonic growth and superradiant emission. We accurately compute the amounts of energy transfer in different channels by deriving formulae for the energy fluxes of matter fields in the presence of a dynamical horizon, which are amenable for evaluation in numerical relativity calculations.</description>

      <title>Bogomol'nyi Equations and Coexistence of Vortices and Antivortices in Generalized Abelian Higgs Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02162v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive the Bogomol'nyi equations in generalized Abelian Higgs theories which allow the coexistence of vortices and antivortices over a compact Riemann surface or the full plane. In the compact surface situation, we obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a unique solution describing a system of coexisting vortices and antivortices. In the full-plane situation, we prove the existence of a unique solution representing an arbitrary distribution of vortices and antivortices and obtain sharp asymptotic behavior of the solution near infinity. These solutions carry quantized magnetic fluxes and energies explicitly expressed in terms of the numbers of vortices and antivortices topologically characterized by the first Chern and Thom classes.</description>

      <title>Quantum multicriticality and emergent symmetry in Dirac systems with two order parameters at three-loop order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22723v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional materials with interacting Dirac excitations can host quantum multicritical behavior near the phase boundaries of the semimetallic and two-ordered phases. We study such behavior in Gross--Neveu--Yukawa field theories where $N_f$ flavors of Dirac fermions are coupled to two order-parameter fields with $SO(N_A)$ and $SO(N_B)$ symmetry, respectively. To that end, we employ the perturbative renormalization group up to three-loop order in $4-\epsilon$ spacetime dimensions. We distinguish two key scenarios: (i) The two orders are compatible as characterized by anticommuting mass terms, and (ii) the orders are incompatible. For the first case, we explore the stability of a quantum multicritical point with emergent $SO(N_A\!+\!N_B)$ symmetry. We find that the stability is controlled by increasing the number of Dirac fermion flavors. Moreover, we extract the series expansion of the leading critical exponents for the chiral $SO(4)$ and $SO(5)$ models up to third order in $\epsilon$. Notably, we find a tendency towards rapidly growing expansion coefficients at higher orders, rendering an extrapolation to $\epsilon=1$ difficult. For the second scenario, we study a model with $SO(4) \simeq SO(3) \times SO(3)$ symmetry, which was recently suggested to describe criticality of antiferromagnetism and superconductivity in Dirac systems. However, it was also argued that a physically admissible renormalization-group fixed point only exists for $N_f$ above a critical number $N_{c}^&gt;$. We determine the corresponding series expansion at three-loop order as $N_{c}^&gt;\approx 16.83-7.14\epsilon-7.12\epsilon^2$. This suggests that the physical choice of $N_f=2$ may be a borderline case, where true criticality and pseudocriticality, as induced by fixed-point annihilation, are extremely challenging to distinguish.</description>
