      <title>On P=NP Either False or Independent of ZFC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our main result, Theorem 3.3, uses Friedman's Jump Free Theorem, Theorem 2.7, which he has shown to be independent of ZFC, the usual axioms of set theory. We conjecture that Theorem 3.3, a straight forward translation of the statement of Theorem 2.7 into sets and functions, is also independent of ZFC as is its immediate Corollary 3.4. It is easy to show that a proof that P=NP will also prove Corollary 3.4. If Corollary 3.4 is in fact independent of ZFC then a ZFC proof of P=NP is impossible, perhaps because it is false.</description>

      <title>Primitive Recursive Dependent Type Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that restricting the elimination principle of the natural numbers type in Martin-L\"of Type Theory (MLTT) to a universe of types not containing $\Pi$-types ensures that all definable functions are primitive recursive. This extends the concept of primitive recursiveness to general types. We discuss extensions to univalent type theories and other notions of computability. We are inspired by earlier work by Martin Hofmann, work on Joyal's arithmetic universes, and Hugo Herbelin and Ludovic Patey's sketched Calculus of Primitive Recursive Constructions.
  We define a theory Tpr that is a subtheory of MLTT with two universes, such that all inductive types are finitary and the lowest universe is restricted to not contain $\Pi$-types. We prove soundness such that all functions $\mathbb{N}\to\mathbb{N}$ are primitive recursive. The proof requires that Tpr satisfies canonicity, which we easily prove using synthetic Tait computability.</description>

      <title>Modelling Multiplicative Linear Logic via Deep Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiplicative linear logic is a very well studied formal system, and most such studies are concerned with the one-sided sequent calculus. In this paper we look in detail at existing translations between a deep inference system and the standard sequent calculus one, provide a simplified translation, and provide a formal proof that a standard approach to modelling is indeed invariant to all these translations. En route we establish a necessary condition for provable sequents related to the number of pars and tensors in a formula that seems to be missing from the literature.</description>

      <title>The Countable Reals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a topos in which the Dedekind reals are countable.
  To accomplish this, we first define a new kind of toposes that we call parameterized realizability toposes. They are built from partial combinatory algebras whose application operation depends on a parameter, and in which realizers operate uniformly with respect to a given parameter set. Our topos is the parameterized realizability topos whose realizers are oracle-computable partial maps, with oracles serving as parameters and ranging over the representations of a non-diagonalizable sequence, discovered by Joseph Miller. It is a sequence of reals in $[0,1]$ that is non-diagonalizable in the sense that any real in $[0,1]$ that is oracle-computable, uniformly in oracles representing the sequence, must already appear in the sequence. The Dedekind reals are countable in the topos because the non-diagonalizable sequence appears in it as an epimorphism.
  The topos is intuitionistic, as it invalidates both the law of excluded middle and the axiom of countable choice. The Cauchy reals are uncountable. The Hilbert cube is countable, from which Brouwer's fixed-point theorem follows as an easy corollary of Lawvere's fixed-point theorem. From the 1-dimensional Brouwer's fixed-point theorem we obtain the intermediate value theorem and the lesser limited principle of omniscience. The Kreisel-Lacombe-Shoenfield-Tseitin theorem stating that all real-valued maps are continuous is valid, because the usual proof is uniform with respect to oracles. Lastly, the closed interval $[0,1]$, being countable, can trivially be covered by a sequence of open intervals whose lengths add up to any prescribed $0 &lt; \epsilon &lt; 1$, and such a cover has no finite subcover. However, we show that any sequence of open intervals with rational endpoints covering $[0,1]$ must has a finite subcover.</description>

      <title>GFLean: An Autoformalisation Framework for Lean via GF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an autoformalisation framework for the Lean theorem prover, called GFLean. GFLean uses a high-level grammar writing tool called Grammatical Framework (GF) for parsing and linearisation. GFLean is implemented in Haskell. We explain the functionalities of GFLean, its inner working and discuss its limitations. We also discuss how we can use neural network based translation programs and rule based translation programs together complimenting each other to build robust autoformalisation frameworks.</description>

      <title>Growth of regular partitions 1: Improved bounds for small slicewise VC-dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is Part 1 in a series of papers about sizes of regular partitions of $3$-uniform hypergraphs. Previous work of the author and Wolf, and independently Chernikov and Towsner, showed that $3$-uniform hypergraphs of small slicewise VC-dimension admit homogeneous partitions. The results of Chernikov and Towsner did not produce explicit bounds, while the work of the author and Wolf relied on a strong version of hypergraph regularity, and consequently produced a Wowzer type bound on the size of the partition. This paper gives a new proof of this result, yielding $\e$-homogeneous partitions of size at most $2^{2^{\epsilon^{-K}}}$, where $K$ is a constant depending on the slicewise VC-dimension. This result is a crucial ingredient in Part 2 of the series, which investigates the growth of weak regular partitions in hereditary properties of $3$-uniform hypergraphs.</description>

      <title>Growth of regular partitions 2: Weak regularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is Part 2 in a series of papers about the growth of regular partitions in hereditary properties $3$-uniform hypergraphs. The focus of this paper is the notion of weak hypergraph regularity, first developed by Chung, Chung-Graham, and Haviland-Thomason. Given a hereditary property of $3$-uniform hypergraphs $\mathcal{H}$, we define a function $M_{\mathcal{H}}:(0,1)\rightarrow \mathbb{N}$ by letting $M_{\mathcal{H}}(\epsilon)$ be the smallest integer $M$ such that all sufficiently large elements of $\mathcal{H}$ admit weak regular partitions of size at most $M$. We show the asymptotic growth rate of such a function falls into one of four categories: constant, polynomial, between single and double exponentials, or tower. These results are a crucial component in Part 3 of the series, which considers vertex partitions associated to a stronger notion of hypergraph regularity.</description>

      <title>Projectivity meets Uniform Post-Interpolant: Classical and Intuitionistic Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19525v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the interplay between projectivity (in the sense that was introduced by S.~Ghilardi) and uniform post-interpolant for the classical and intuitionistic propositional logic. More precisely, we explore whether a projective substitution of a formula is equivalent to its uniform post-interpolant, assuming the substitution leaves the variables of the interpolant unchanged. We show that in classical logic, this holds for all formulas. Although such a nice property is missing in intuitionistic logic, we provide Kripke semantical characterisation for propositions with this property.
  As a main application of this, we show that the unification type of some extensions of intuitionistic logic are finitary. In the end, we study admissibility for intuitionistic logic, relative to some sets of formulae.
  The first author of this paper recently considered a particular case of this relativised admissibility and found it useful in characterising the provability logic of Heyting Arithmetic.</description>

      <title>Coalgebraic Modal Logic for Dynamic Systems with Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06177v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we define a class of polynomial functors suited for constructing coalgebras representing processes in which uncertainty plays an important role. In these polynomial functors we include upper and lower probability measures, finitely additive probability measures, plausibilty measures (and their duals, belief functions), and possibility measures. We give axioms and inference rules for the associated system of coalgebraic modal logic, and construct the canonical coalgebras to prove a completeness result.</description>

      <title>Free Doubly-Infinitary Distributive Categories are Cartesian Closed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10447v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We delve into the concept of categories with products that distribute over coproducts, which we call doubly-infinitary distributive categories. We show various instances of doubly-infinitary distributive categories aiming for a comparative analysis with established notions such as extensivity, infinitary distributiveness, and cartesian closedness. Our exploration reveals that this condition represents a substantial extension beyond the classical understanding of infinitary distributive categories. Our main theorem establishes that free doubly-infinitary distributive categories are cartesian closed. We end the paper with remarks on non-canonical isomorphisms, open questions, and future work.</description>
