      <title>Sensitivity Analysis of the Laser Power Control System to Measurement Noise in SLS 3D Printers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uniform temperature distribution in Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) is essential for producing durable 3D prints. Achieving uniformity requires a laser power control system that minimises deviation of the printing temperatures from the target temperature. Because the estimate of the actual process temperature is an input to the laser power control, uncertainty in the estimate of the actual temperature can lead to fluctuations in laser power that affect the thermal performance of the SLS. This article investigates the sensitivity of a laser power control system to temperature measurement uncertainty. This article evaluates the effectiveness of two methods for quantifying the effect of input uncertainty on a SLS laser power control system: a recent innovation in uncertainty-tracked architecture and traditional Monte Carlo simulation. We show that recent advances in computer architecture for arithmatic on probability distributions make it possible for the first time, to perform control system uncertainty analysis with latencies under 30 ms, while achieving the same level of uncertainty analysis as Monte Carlo methods with latencies that are two orders of magnitude slower.</description>

      <title>Network Risk Estimation: A Risk Estimation Paradigm for Cyber Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cyber networks are fundamental to many organization's infrastructure, and the size of cyber networks is increasing rapidly. Risk measurement of the entities/endpoints that make up the network via available knowledge about possible threats has been the primary tool in cyber network security. However, the dynamic behavior of the entities and the sparsity of risk-measurable points are limiting factors for risk measurement strategies, which results in poor network visibility considering the volatility of cyber networks. This work proposes a new probabilistic risk estimation approach to network security, NRE, which operates on top of existing risk measurements. The proposed method NRE extracts relationships among system components from the network connection data, models risk propagation based on the learned relationships and refines the estimates whenever risk measurements are provided. In this work, (i) the risk estimation scheme is proposed, (ii) an application of quantitative risk estimates is devised, (iii) descriptiveness of the risk estimates are compared to a pure risk measurement alternative and (iv) low computational complexity of the proposed method is illustrated capable of real-time deployment. The proposed method, NRE, is ultimately a quantitative data-driven risk assessment tool that can be used to add security aspects to existing network functions, such as routing, and it provides a robust description of the network state in the presence of threats, capable of running in real-time.</description>

      <title>A General Bayesian Framework for Informative Input Design in System Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We tackle the problem of informative input design for system identification, where we select inputs, observe the corresponding outputs from the true system, and optimize the parameters of our model to best fit the data. We propose a methodology that is compatible with any system and parametric family of models. Our approach only requires input-output data from the system and first-order information from the model with respect to the parameters. Our algorithm consists of two modules. First, we formulate the problem of system identification from a Bayesian perspective and propose an approximate iterative method to optimize the model's parameters. Based on this Bayesian formulation, we are able to define a Gaussian-based uncertainty measure for the model parameters, which we can then minimize with respect to the next selected input. Our method outperforms model-free baselines with various linear and nonlinear dynamics.</description>

      <title>Finite Sample Analysis of Subspace Identification Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As one of the mainstream approaches in system identification, subspace identification methods (SIMs) are known for their simple parameterization for MIMO systems and robust numerical properties. However, a comprehensive statistical analysis of SIMs remains an open problem. Amid renewed focus on identifying state-space models in the non-asymptotic regime, this work presents a finite sample analysis for a large class of open-loop SIMs. It establishes high-probability upper bounds for system matrices obtained via SIMs, and reveals that convergence rates for estimating Markov parameters and system matrices are $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{N})$ up to logarithmic terms, in line with classical asymptotic results. Following the key steps of SIMs, we arrive at the above results by a three-step procedure. In Step 1, we begin with a parsimonious SIM (PARSIM) that uses least-squares regression to estimate multiple high-order ARX models in parallel. Leveraging a recent analysis of an individual ARX model, we obtain a union error bound for a bank of ARX models. Step 2 involves model reduction via weighted singular value decomposition (SVD), where we consider different data-dependent weighting matrices and use robustness results for SVD to obtain error bounds on extended controllability and observability matrices, respectively. The final Step 3 focuses on deriving error bounds for system matrices, where two different realization algorithms, the MOESP type and the Larimore type, are considered. Although our study initially focuses on PARSIM, the methodologies apply broadly across many variants of SIMs.</description>

      <title>On Non-intrusive Data-driven Implementations of IRKA and Balanced Truncation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces quadrature-based approaches that enable offline sampling of the transfer function and its derivative from available frequency response or impulse response data. Unlike quadrature-based data-driven balanced truncation, the proposed methods do not require samples of the transfer function's derivative or the impulse response's derivative. Additionally, a non-intrusive approach to track the error in IRKA as it refines the interpolation data is presented. Furthermore, a non-intrusive data-driven implementation of balanced truncation, equivalent to ADI-based low-rank balanced truncation, is proposed. This approach is not quadrature-based and only requires samples of the transfer function at the mirror images of the ADI shifts to construct the reduced-order model. The quality of the low-rank approximation of the Gramians in this method can also be monitored in a non-intrusive manner. Both the non-intrusive implementations of IRKA and balanced truncation are also extended to discrete-time systems in this paper. For discrete-time IRKA, the impulse response-based implementation uses a truncated summation approach, as the time-domain formulation of discrete-time IRKA involves summations rather than integrals. The paper includes two illustrative examples: one for the non-intrusive data-driven implementations of IRKA and balanced truncation for continuous-time systems, and another for discrete-time systems.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring with Features Extracted by Independent Component Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a novel neural network architecture is proposed to address the challenges in energy disaggregation algorithms. These challenges include the limited availability of data and the complexity of disaggregating a large number of appliances operating simultaneously. The proposed model utilizes independent component analysis as the backbone of the neural network and is evaluated using the F1-score for varying numbers of appliances working concurrently. Our results demonstrate that the model is less prone to overfitting, exhibits low complexity, and effectively decomposes signals with many individual components. Furthermore, we show that the proposed model outperforms existing algorithms when applied to real-world data.</description>

      <title>Toward Explainable NILM: Real-Time Event-Based NILM Framework for High-Frequency Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) is an advanced, and cost-effective technique for monitoring appliance-level energy consumption. However, its adaptability is hindered by the lack of transparency and explainability. To address this challenge, this paper presents an explainable, real-time, event-based NILM framework specifically designed for high-frequency datasets. The proposed framework ensures transparency at every stage by integrating a z-score-based event detector, appliance signature estimation, Fourier-based feature extraction, an XG-Boost classifier, and post hoc SHAP analysis. The SHAP analysis further quantifies the contribution of individual features, such as cosine of specific harmonic phases, to appliance classification. The framework is trained and evaluated on the PLAID dataset, and achieved a classification accuracy of 90% while maintaining low computational requirements and a latency of less than one second.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Effect of Long-Term Memory Model Parameters in Pole-Zero Identification for Stability Analysis of Power Amplifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the nature of potential instabilities is indispensable for the stabilization of power amplifiers. Pole-zero identification is one of the techniques that can be used to determine the stability of a design in large-signal operation. In this work, the possible presence of poles at the fundamental frequency linked to the long-term memory parameters of the transistor's model (self-heating and traps) is presented and discussed. The paper shows how their effect on the identified frequency responses around the fundamental frequency may compromise the stability analysis results and the assessment of stability margins. The low observability of the poles at the fundamental frequency highlights the importance of an accurate identification of real poles in low-frequency bands. A specific algorithm for the automatic frequency domain identification of non-resonant frequency responses and a procedure for detecting and reducing overfitting of real poles is proposed in this article. The benefits of the proposed methodology to correctly detect and analyze real poles at low frequencies is demonstrated through Monte-Carlo sensitivity analyses of two different amplifier designs.</description>

      <title>Data-Efficient Extremum-Seeking Control Using Kernel-Based Function Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing extremum-seeking control (ESC) approaches typically rely on applying repeated perturbations to input parameters and performing measurements of the corresponding performance output. Performing these measurements can be costly in practical applications, e.g., due to the use of resources, making it desirable to reduce the number of performed measurements. Moreover, the required separation between the different timescales in the ESC loop typically results in slow convergence. With these challenges in mind, this work presents an approach aimed at both increasing the convergence rate and reducing the number of measurements that need to be performed. In the proposed approach, input-output data obtained during operation is used to construct online an approximation of the system's underlying cost function. By using this approximation to perform parameter updates when a decrease in the cost can be guaranteed, instead of performing additional measurements to perform this update, more efficient use is made of the collected data. As a result, reductions in both the required number of measurements and update steps are indeed obtained. In addition, a stability analysis of the novel ESC approach is provided. The benefits of the synergy between kernel-based function approximation and standard ESC is demonstrated in simulation on a multi-input dynamical system.</description>

      <title>In-Circuit Characterization of Low-Frequency Stability Margins in Power Amplifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-frequency resonances with low stability margins affect video bandwidth characteristics of power amplifiers. In this work, a non-connectorized measurement technique is presented to obtain the low-frequency critical poles at internal nodes of a hybrid amplifier. The experimental setup uses a high impedance probe connected to a vector network analyzer (VNA) to obtain a fully calibrated closed-loop frequency response that is identified to get the poles of the device at low frequency. Compared to previous connectorized solutions, the approach avoids the ad-hoc insertion of extra RF connectors to access the low-frequency dynamics of the amplifier. In addition, it simplifies the characterization at multiple internal nodes, which is worthwhile for an efficient detection and fixing of critical low frequency dynamics in multistage power amplifiers. The technique is first applied to dc steady state regimes and compared to the connectorized approach on a single stage amplifier. Next, it is applied to a three-stage amplifier to show its potential to detect the origin of the undesired dynamics and the most effective way to increase stability margin. Finally, the technique has been extended to the large-signal case to increase its usefulness for the design and diagnosis of high power amplifiers.</description>

      <title>Optimal control over Markovian wireless communication channels under generalized packet dropout compensation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Control loops closed over wireless links greatly benefit from accurate estimates of the communication channel condition. To this end, the finite-state Markov channel model allows for reliable channel state estimation. This paper develops a Markov jump linear system representation for wireless networked control with persistent channel state observation, stochastic message losses, and generalized packet dropout compensation. With this model, we solve the finite- and infinite-horizon linear quadratic regulation problems and introduce an easy-to-test stability condition for any given infinite-horizon control law. We also thoroughly analyze the impact of a scalar general dropout compensation factor on the stability and closed-loop performance of a rotary inverted pendulum controlled remotely through a wireless link. Finally, we validate the results numerically via extensive Monte Carlo simulations, showing the benefits of the proposed control strategy.</description>

      <title>Foundation Models for CPS-IoT: Opportunities and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Methods from machine learning (ML) have transformed the implementation of Perception-Cognition-Communication-Action loops in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) and the Internet of Things (IoT), replacing mechanistic and basic statistical models with those derived from data. However, the first generation of ML approaches, which depend on supervised learning with annotated data to create task-specific models, faces significant limitations in scaling to the diverse sensor modalities, deployment configurations, application tasks, and operating dynamics characterizing real-world CPS-IoT systems. The success of task-agnostic foundation models (FMs), including multimodal large language models (LLMs), in addressing similar challenges across natural language, computer vision, and human speech has generated considerable enthusiasm for and exploration of FMs and LLMs as flexible building blocks in CPS-IoT analytics pipelines, promising to reduce the need for costly task-specific engineering.
  Nonetheless, a significant gap persists between the current capabilities of FMs and LLMs in the CPS-IoT domain and the requirements they must meet to be viable for CPS-IoT applications. In this paper, we analyze and characterize this gap through a thorough examination of the state of the art and our research, which extends beyond it in various dimensions. Based on the results of our analysis and research, we identify essential desiderata that CPS-IoT domain-specific FMs and LLMs must satisfy to bridge this gap. We also propose actions by CPS-IoT researchers to collaborate in developing key community resources necessary for establishing FMs and LLMs as foundational tools for the next generation of CPS-IoT systems.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Position Estimation in Tactile Internet-Enabled Remote Robotic Surgery Using MOESP-Based Kalman Filter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately estimating the position of a patient's side robotic arm in real time during remote surgery is a significant challenge, especially within Tactile Internet (TI) environments. This paper presents a new and efficient method for position estimation using a Kalman Filter (KF) combined with the Multivariable Output-Error State Space (MOESP) method for system identification. Unlike traditional approaches that require prior knowledge of the system's dynamics, this study uses the JIGSAW dataset, a comprehensive collection of robotic surgical data, along with input from the Master Tool Manipulator (MTM) to derive the state-space model directly. The MOESP method allows accurate modeling of the Patient Side Manipulator (PSM) dynamics without prior system models, improving the KF's performance under simulated network conditions, including delays, jitter, and packet loss. These conditions mimic real-world challenges in Tactile Internet applications. The findings demonstrate the KF's improved resilience and accuracy in state estimation, achieving over 95 percent accuracy despite network-induced uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric Sparse Online Learning of the Koopman Operator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Koopman operator provides a powerful framework for representing the dynamics of general nonlinear dynamical systems. Data-driven techniques to learn the Koopman operator typically assume that the chosen function space is closed under system dynamics. In this paper, we study the Koopman operator via its action on the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), and explore the mis-specified scenario where the dynamics may escape the chosen function space. We relate the Koopman operator to the conditional mean embeddings (CME) operator and then present an operator stochastic approximation algorithm to learn the Koopman operator iteratively with control over the complexity of the representation. We provide both asymptotic and finite-time last-iterate guarantees of the online sparse learning algorithm with trajectory-based sampling with an analysis that is substantially more involved than that for finite-dimensional stochastic approximation. Numerical examples confirm the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Safe Gradient Flow for Bilevel Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bilevel optimization is a key framework in hierarchical decision-making, where one problem is embedded within the constraints of another. In this work, we propose a control-theoretic approach to solving bilevel optimization problems. Our method consists of two components: a gradient flow mechanism to minimize the upper-level objective and a safety filter to enforce the constraints imposed by the lower-level problem. Together, these components form a safe gradient flow that solves the bilevel problem in a single loop. To improve scalability with respect to the lower-level problem's dimensions, we introduce a relaxed formulation and design a compact variant of the safe gradient flow. This variant minimizes the upper-level objective while ensuring the lower-level solution remains within a user-defined distance. Using Lyapunov analysis, we establish convergence guarantees for the dynamics, proving that they converge to a neighborhood of the optimal solution. Numerical experiments further validate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches. Our contributions provide both theoretical insights and practical tools for efficiently solving bilevel optimization problems.</description>

      <title>Fine-Tuned Language Models as Space Systems Controllers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), or foundation models (FMs), are pretrained transformers that coherently complete sentences auto-regressively. In this paper, we show that LLMs can control simplified space systems after some additional training, called fine-tuning. We look at relatively small language models, ranging between 7 and 13 billion parameters. We focus on four problems: a three-dimensional spring toy problem, low-thrust orbit transfer, low-thrust cislunar control, and powered descent guidance. The fine-tuned LLMs are capable of controlling systems by generating sufficiently accurate outputs that are multi-dimensional vectors with up to 10 significant digits. We show that for several problems the amount of data required to perform fine-tuning is smaller than what is generally required of traditional deep neural networks (DNNs), and that fine-tuned LLMs are good at generalizing outside of the training dataset. Further, the same LLM can be fine-tuned with data from different problems, with only minor performance degradation with respect to LLMs trained for a single application. This work is intended as a first step towards the development of a general space systems controller.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Model Predictive Control and Reinforcement Learning Based Control for Legged Robot Locomotion in MuJoCo Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Model Predictive Control (MPC) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) are two prominent strategies for controlling legged robots, each with unique strengths. RL learns control policies through system interaction, adapting to various scenarios, whereas MPC relies on a predefined mathematical model to solve optimization problems in real-time. Despite their widespread use, there is a lack of direct comparative analysis under standardized conditions. This work addresses this gap by benchmarking MPC and RL controllers on a Unitree Go1 quadruped robot within the MuJoCo simulation environment, focusing on a standardized task-straight walking at a constant velocity. Performance is evaluated based on disturbance rejection, energy efficiency, and terrain adaptability. The results show that RL excels in handling disturbances and maintaining energy efficiency but struggles with generalization to new terrains due to its dependence on learned policies tailored to specific environments. In contrast, MPC shows enhanced recovery capabilities from larger perturbations by leveraging its optimization-based approach, allowing for a balanced distribution of control efforts across the robot's joints. The results provide a clear understanding of the advantages and limitations of both RL and MPC, offering insights into selecting an appropriate control strategy for legged robotic applications.</description>

      <title>SHIELD: Secure Host-Independent Extensible Logging for SATA/Network Storage Towards Ransomware Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As malware such as ransomware becomes sophisticated, the ability to find and neutralize it requires more robust and tamper-resistant solutions. Current methods rely on data from compromised hosts, lack hardware isolation, and cannot detect emerging threats. To address these limitations, we introduce SHIELD - a detection architecture leveraging FPGA-based open-source SATA and Network Block Device (NBD) technology to provide off-host, tamper-proof measurements for continuous observation of disk activity for software executing on a target device. SHIELD provides three distinct contributions: It (1) develops a framework to obtain and analyze multi-level hardware metrics at NBD, FPGA, and SATA storage levels, and shows their ability to differentiate between harmless and malicious software; (2) Broadens the functionality of an open-source FPGA-driven SATA Host Bus Adapter (HBA) to offer complete data storage capabilities through NBD without relying on the host system; (3) Provides a foundation for using the methodology and metrics in automated machine learning-assisted detection and ASIC integration for advanced mitigation capabilities in data storage devices. SHIELD analyzes 10 benign programs and 10 modern ransomware families to illustrate its capacity for real-time monitoring and use in distinguishing between ransomware and benign software. Experimental evidence shows SHIELD's robust host-independent and hardware-assisted metrics are a basis for detection, allowing to observe program execution and detect malicious activities at the storage level.</description>

      <title>Quantum advantage in decentralized control of POMDPs: A control-theoretic view of the Mermin-Peres square</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider a decentralized partially-observed Markov decision problem (POMDP) with multiple cooperative agents aiming to maximize a long-term-average reward criterion. We observe that the availability, at a fixed rate, of entangled states of a product quantum system between the agents, where each agent has access to one of the component systems, can result in strictly improved performance even compared to the scenario where common randomness is provided to the agents, i.e. there is a quantum advantage in decentralized control. This observation comes from a simple reinterpretation of the conclusions of the well-known Mermin-Peres square, which underpins the Mermin-Peres game. While quantum advantage has been demonstrated earlier in one-shot team problems of this kind, it is notable that there are examples where there is a quantum advantage for the one-shot criterion but it disappears in the dynamical scenario. The presence of a quantum advantage in dynamical scenarios is thus seen to be a novel finding relative to the current state of knowledge about the achievable performance in decentralized control problems.

      <title>Late Breaking Results: Energy-Efficient Printed Machine Learning Classifiers with Sequential SVMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Printed Electronics (PE) provide a mechanically flexible and cost-effective solution for machine learning (ML) circuits, compared to silicon-based technologies. However, due to large feature sizes, printed classifiers are limited by high power, area, and energy overheads, which restricts the realization of battery-powered systems. In this work, we design sequential printed bespoke Support Vector Machine (SVM) circuits that adhere to the power constraints of existing printed batteries while minimizing energy consumption, thereby boosting battery life. Our results show 6.5x energy savings while maintaining higher accuracy compared to the state of the art.</description>

      <title>Optimization and Learning in Open Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern artificial intelligence relies on networks of agents that collect data, process information, and exchange it with neighbors to collaboratively solve optimization and learning problems. This article introduces a novel distributed algorithm to address a broad class of these problems in "open networks", where the number of participating agents may vary due to several factors, such as autonomous decisions, heterogeneous resource availability, or DoS attacks. Extending the current literature, the convergence analysis of the proposed algorithm is based on the newly developed "Theory of Open Operators", which characterizes an operator as open when the set of components to be updated changes over time, yielding to time-varying operators acting on sequences of points of different dimensions and compositions. The mathematical tools and convergence results developed here provide a general framework for evaluating distributed algorithms in open networks, allowing to characterize their performance in terms of the punctual distance from the optimal solution, in contrast with regret-based metrics that assess cumulative performance over a finite-time horizon. As illustrative examples, the proposed algorithm is used to solve dynamic consensus or tracking problems on different metrics of interest, such as average, median, and min/max value, as well as classification problems with logistic loss functions.</description>

      <title>Detecting Critical Resonances in Microwave Amplifiers through Noise Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The presence of critical resonances in microwave power amplifiers has a negative impact on its behavior and performance. These critical resonances are usually predicted from pole-zero stability simulations. In this paper, a different and less demanding approach for the circuit designer is proposed. It is based on performing noise simulations of the amplifier and observing the rise in the noise spectrum that happens when the system has low damping poles. Critical resonance detection is simplified since no additional probes have to be inserted in the circuit and no post-processing for pole-zero analysis is required. The technique is applied to two amplifier prototypes fabricated in microstrip hybrid technology and the results are compared with the conventional pole-zero approach.</description>

      <title>Collision Avoidance and Geofencing for Fixed-wing Aircraft with Control Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02508v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Safety-critical failures often have fatal consequences in aerospace control. Control systems on aircraft, therefore, must ensure the strict satisfaction of safety constraints, preferably with formal guarantees of safe behavior. This paper establishes the safety-critical control of fixed-wing aircraft in collision avoidance and geofencing tasks. A control framework is developed wherein a run-time assurance (RTA) system modulates the nominal flight controller of the aircraft whenever necessary to prevent it from colliding with other aircraft or crossing a boundary (geofence) in space. The RTA is formulated as a safety filter using control barrier functions (CBFs) with formal guarantees of safe behavior. CBFs are constructed and compared for a nonlinear kinematic fixed-wing aircraft model. The proposed CBF-based controllers showcase the capability of safely executing simultaneous collision avoidance and geofencing, as demonstrated by simulations on the kinematic model and a high-fidelity dynamical model.</description>

      <title>Minimum Time Consensus of Multi-agent System under Fuel Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19927v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work addresses the problem of finding a consensus point in the state space ($\mathbb{R}^2$) for a multi-agent system that is comprised of $N$ identical double integrator agents. It is assumed that each agent operates under constrained control input (i.e., $|u_i(t)| \leq 1$ $\forall i = 1, \hdots N$). Further, a fixed fuel budget is also assumed i.e., the total amount of cumulative input that can be expended is limited by $\int_0^{t_f}|u(t)|dt \le \beta$. First, the attainable set $\mathcal{A}(t,x_0,\beta)$ at time $t$, which is the set of all states that an agent can attain starting from initial conditions $x_0$ under the fuel budget constraints at time $t$ is computed for every agent. This attainable set is a convex set for all $t\ge0$. Then the minimum time to consensus is the minimum time $\bar{t}$ at which attainable sets of all agents intersect, and the consensus point is the point of intersection. A closed-form expression for the minimum time consensus point is provided for the case of three agents. Then, using Helly's theorem, the intersection will be non-empty at a time when all the $N \choose 3$ triplets of agents have non-empty intersection. The computation of minimum time consensus for all $N \choose 3$ triplets is performed independently and can be distributed among all the $N$ agents. Finally, the overall minimum time to consensus is given by the triplet that has the highest minimum time to consensus. Further, the intersection of all the attainable sets of this triplet gives the minimum time consensus point for all $N$ agents.</description>

      <title>Y-Configuration Active Bridge (YAB) Converter: A DAB-Type Single-Stage Isolated Three-Phase AC-DC Converter with Simple Sinusoidal Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21440v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper reviews commonly used three-phase isolated AC-DC converters and introduces a novel Y-configuration Active Bridge (YAB) converter for single-stage isolated AC-DC power conversion. The proposed YAB addresses the limitations of multi-stage designs by eliminating bulky electrolytic capacitor banks and input boost inductors, thereby enabling a simplified start-up process without the risk of inrush current. It retains the advantages of single-stage AC-DC Dual Active Bridge (AC-DC DAB) converters while significantly reducing control complexity. Across its entire operating range, the YAB achieves low total harmonic distortion, maintains relatively low current stress, and exhibits excellent soft-switching performance. The operating principle of the proposed converter is detailed, and an equivalent circuit model is presented. System performance is evaluated using a numerical Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) model. To validate the performance of the proposed converter, a three-phase 6 kW, 480 V YAB prototype is designed and tested in the laboratory. Experimental results demonstrate a maximum efficiency of 97.1\%.</description>
