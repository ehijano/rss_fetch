      <title>Equilibrium control theory for Kihlstrom-Mirman preferences in continuous time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In intertemporal settings, the multiattribute utility theory of Kihlstrom and Mirman suggests the application of a concave transform of the lifetime utility index. This construction, while allowing time and risk attitudes to be separated, leads to dynamically inconsistent preferences. We address this issue in a game-theoretic sense by formalizing an equilibrium control theory for continuous-time Markov processes. In these terms, we describe the equilibrium strategy and value function as the solution of an extended Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman system of partial differential equations. We verify that (the solution of) this system is a sufficient condition for an equilibrium and examine some of its novel features. A consumption-investment problem for an agent with CRRA-CES utility showcases our approach.</description>

      <title>The Negative Drift of a Limit Order Fill</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Market making refers to a form of trading in financial markets characterized by passive orders which add liquidity to limit order books. Market makers are important for the proper functioning of financial markets worldwide. Given the importance, financial mathematics has endeavored to derive optimal strategies for placing limit orders in this context. This paper identifies a key discrepancy between popular model assumptions and the realities of real markets, specifically regarding the dynamics around limit order fills. Traditionally, market making models rely on an assumption of low-cost random fills, when in reality we observe a high-cost non-random fill behavior. Namely, limit order fills are caused by and coincide with adverse price movements, which create a drag on the market maker's profit and loss. We refer to this phenomenon as "the negative drift" associated with limit order fills. We describe a discrete market model and prove theoretically that the negative drift exists. We also provide a detailed empirical simulation using one of the most traded financial instruments in the world, the 10 Year US Treasury Bond futures, which also confirms its existence. To our knowledge, this is the first paper to describe and prove this phenomenon in such detail.</description>

      <title>Joint calibration to SPX and VIX options with signature-based models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.13235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.13235v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a stochastic volatility model where the dynamics of the volatility are described by a linear function of the (time extended) signature of a primary process which is supposed to be a polynomial diffusion. We obtain closed form expressions for the VIX squared, exploiting the fact that the truncated signature of a polynomial diffusion is again a polynomial diffusion. Adding to such a primary process the Brownian motion driving the stock price, allows then to express both the log-price and the VIX squared as linear functions of the signature of the corresponding augmented process. This feature can then be efficiently used for pricing and calibration purposes. Indeed, as the signature samples can be easily precomputed, the calibration task can be split into an offline sampling and a standard optimization. We also propose a Fourier pricing approach for both VIX and SPX options exploiting that the signature of the augmented primary process is an infinite dimensional affine process. For both the SPX and VIX options we obtain highly accurate calibration results, showing that this model class allows to solve the joint calibration problem without adding jumps or rough volatility.</description>

      <title>Pathwise uniqueness for singular stochastic Volterra equations with H\"older coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.08029v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pathwise uniqueness is established for a class of one-dimensional stochastic Volterra equations driven by Brownian motion with singular kernels and H\"older continuous diffusion coefficients. Consequently, the existence of unique strong solutions is obtained for this class of stochastic Volterra equations.</description>

      <title>Optimal market-neutral currency trading on the cryptocurrency platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15461v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This research proposes a novel arbitrage approach with respect to multivariate pair trading called Optimal Trading Technique (OTT). We introduce the method to selectively form a "bucket" of fiat currencies anchored to cryptocurrency for simultaneously monitoring and exploiting trading opportunities. To handle the quantitative conflicts that arise when receiving multiple trading signals, a bi-objective convex optimization process is designed to cater to the investor's preference between profitability and risk tolerance. This process includes tunable parameters such as volatility punishment, action thresholds. During our experiments in the cryptocurrency market from 2020 to 2022 when the market was experiencing a vigorous bull-run immediately followed by a bear-run, the OTT realized an annualized profit of 15.49%. We further carried out the experiments in bull, bear, and full-cycle market conditions separately, and found that OTT is capable of achieving stable profit under various market conditions. Apart from the profitability side of the OTT, the arbitrage operation provides a new perspective of trading, which requires no external shorting and never hold intermediate cryptocurrency during the arbitrage period.</description>
