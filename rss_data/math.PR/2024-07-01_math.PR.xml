      <title>Markov-bridge representation of ergodic large-deviation principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit classic ergodic large-deviation principles: for the occupation measure (Donsker-Varadhan), and for the empirical flux. We show that these problems can be embedded into a more general, discrete-time framework. A conditioning and mixing argument then yields alternative expressions for these well-known rate functionals, formulated in terms of Markov bridges.</description>

      <title>On the Precision of the Spectral Profile Bound for the Mixing Time of Continuous State Markov Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the sharpness of the spectral profile bound presented by Goel et al. and Chen et al. on the $L^{2}$ mixing time of Markov chains on continuous state spaces. We show that the bound provided by Chen et al. is sharp up to a factor of $\log\log$ of the initial density. This result extends the findings of Kozma, which showed the analogous result for the original spectral profile bound of Goel et al. for Markov chains on finite state spaces. Kozma shows that the spectral profile bound is sharp up to a multiplicative factor of $\log(\log(\pi_{min}))$, where $\pi_{\min}$ is the smallest value of the probability mass function of the stationary distribution. We discuss the application of our primary finding to the comparison of Markov chains. Our main result can be used as a comparison bound, indicating that it is possible to compare chains even when only non-spectral bounds exist for a known chain.</description>

      <title>From clonal interference to Poissonian interacting trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a population whose size $N$ is fixed over the generations, and in which random beneficial mutations arrive at a rate of order $1/\log N$ per generation. In this so-called Gerrish-Lenski regime, typically a finite number of contending mutations is present together with one resident type. These mutations compete for fixation, a phenomenon addressed as clonal interference. We study a system of Poissonian interacting trajectories (PIT) which arise as a large population scaling limit of the logarithmic sizes of the contending clonal subpopulations. We prove that this system exhibits an a.s.\ positive asymptotic rate of fitness increase (speed of adaptation), which turns out to be finite if and only if fitness increments have a finite expectation. We relate this speed to heuristic predictions from the literature. Furthermore, we derive a functional central limit theorem for the fitness of the resident population in the PIT. A main result of this work is that the Poissonian interacting trajectories arise as a large-population limit of a continuous time Moran model with strong selection.</description>

      <title>Two results from Mandelbaum's paper: "The dynamic complementarity problem"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A draft of a paper by Mandelbaum, "The dynamic complementarity problem", was circulated in 1987, but has never been published. We give an exposition of two important results from that paper which are not readily accessible in the literature.
  The first is an example of a Skorokhod problem in two dimensions in the quadrant for which there is not uniqueness. The second is a proof of uniqueness for the Skorokhod problem in two dimensions in the quadrant in a critical case.</description>

      <title>Sampling from the Continuous Random Energy Model in Total Variation Distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The continuous random energy model (CREM) is a toy model of spin glasses on $\{0,1\}^N$ that, in the limit, exhibits an infinitely hierarchical correlation structure. We give two polynomial-time algorithms to approximately sample from the Gibbs distribution of the CREM in the high-temperature regime, based on a Markov chain and a sequential sampler. The running time depends algebraically on the desired TV distance and failure probability and exponentially in $(1/g')^{O(1)}$, where $g'$ is the gap to a certain inverse temperature threshold; this contrasts with previous results which only attain $o(N)$ accuracy in KL divergence. If the covariance function $A$ of the CREM is concave, the algorithms work up to the critical threshold $\beta_c$, which is the static phase transition point; moreover, for certain $A$, the algorithms work up to the known algorithmic threshold $\beta_G$ proposed in Addario-Berry and Maillard (2020) for non-trivial sampling guarantees. Our result depends on quantitative bounds for the fluctuation of the partition function and a new contiguity result of the ``tilted" CREM obtained from sampling, which is of independent interest. We also show that the spectral gap is exponentially small with high probability, suggesting that the algebraic dependence is unavoidable with a Markov chain approach.</description>

      <title>Geometrical quantity on random checkerboards on the regular torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the study of the observability of the wave equation (here on $(0,T)\times \mathbb{T}^d$, where $\mathbb{T}^d$ is the d-dimensional torus), a condition naturally emerges as a sufficient observability condition. This condition, which writes $\ell^T\left(\omega\right) &gt; 0$, signifies that the smallest time spent by a geodesic in the subset $\omega\subset \mathbb{T}^d$ during time $T$ is non-zero. In other words, the subset $\omega$ detects any geodesic propagating on the d-dimensional torus during time $T$. Here, the subset $\omega$ is randomly defined by drawing a grid of $n^d$, $n\in\mathbb{N}$, small cubes of equal size and by adding them to $\omega$ with probability $\varepsilon &gt; 0$. In this article, we establish a probabilistic property of the functional $\ell^T$: the random law $\ell^T\left(\omega_\varepsilon^n\right)$ converges in probability to $\varepsilon$ as $n \to + \infty$.Considering random subsets $\omega_\varepsilon^n$ allows us to construct subsets $\omega$ such that $\ell^T\left(\omega\right) = |\omega|$.</description>

      <title>Poisson-Laguerre tessellations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce a family of Poisson-Laguerre tessellations in $\mathbb{R}^d$ generated by a Poisson point process in $\mathbb{R}^d\times \mathbb{R}$, whose intensity measure has a density of the form $(v,h)\mapsto f(h){\rm d} h {\rm d} v$, where $v\in\mathbb{R}^d$ and $h\in\mathbb{R}$, with respect to the Lebesgue measure. We study its sectional properties and show that the $\ell$-dimensional section of a Poisson-Laguerre tessellation corresponding to $f$ is an $\ell$-dimensional Poisson-Laguerre tessellation corresponding to $f_{\ell}$, which is up to a constant a fractional integral of $f$ of order $(d-\ell)/2$. Further we derive an explicit representation for the distribution of the volume weighted typical cell of the dual Poisson-Laguerre tessellation in terms of fractional integrals and derivatives of $f$.</description>

      <title>On favourite sites of a random walk in moderately sparse random environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the favourite sites of a random walk evolving in a sparse random environment on the set of integers. The walker moves symmetrically apart from some randomly chosen sites where we impose random drift. We prove annealed limit theorems for the time the walk spends in its favourite sites in two cases. The first one, in which it is the distribution of the drift that determines the limiting behaviour of the walk, is a generalization of known results for a random walk in i.i.d. random environment. In the second case a new behaviour appears, caused by the sparsity of the environment.</description>

      <title>Quantitative relative entropy estimates for interacting particle systems with common noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive quantitative estimates proving the conditional propagation of chaos for large stochastic systems of interacting particles subject to both idiosyncratic and common noise. We obtain explicit bounds on the relative entropy between the conditional Liouville equation and the stochastic Fokker--Planck equation with an interaction kernel \(k\in L^2(\R^d) \cap L^\infty(\R^d)\), extending far beyond the Lipschitz case. Our method relies on reducing the problem to the idiosyncratic setting, which allows us to utilize the exponential law of large numbers by Jabin and Wang~\cite{JabinWang2018} in a pathwise manner.</description>

      <title>Large deviations of the giant component in scale-free inhomogeneous random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study large deviations of the size of the largest connected component in a general class of inhomogeneous random graphs with iid weights, parametrized so that the degree distribution is regularly varying. We derive a large-deviation principle with logarithmic speed: the rare event that the largest component contains linearly more vertices than expected is caused by the presence of constantly many vertices with linear degree. Conditionally on this rare event, we prove distributional limits of the weight distribution and component-size distribution.</description>

      <title>Bernstein duality revisited: frequency-dependent selection, coordinated mutation and opposing environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Population models usually come in pairs; one process describes forward evolution (e.g. type composition) and the other describes backward evolution (e.g. lines of descent). These processes are often linked by a formal relationship known as duality. Ideally, one of the two processes is easier to analyze, and the duality relation is so simple that properties of the more involved process can be inferred from the simpler one. This is the case when the forward process admits a moment dual. Unfortunately, moment duality seems to be the exception rather than the rule. Various approaches have been used to analyze models in the absence of a moment dual, one of them is based on Bernstein duality and another one on Siegmund duality. As a rule of thumb, the first approach seems to work well whenever the ancestral processes are positive recurrent; the second one, in contrast, works well in situations where the ancestral structures can grow to infinity (in size). The second approach was recently used to provide a full characterization of the long-term behavior of a broad class of $\Lambda$-Wright--Fisher processes subject to frequency-dependent selection and opposing environments. In this paper, we use the first approach to complete the picture, i.e. we describe the long-term behavior of a different class of $\Lambda$-Wright--Fisher processes, which covers many of the cases that were not covered by the aforementioned result (the two classes intersect, but none is a proper subset of the other one). Moreover, we extend the notion of Bernstein duality to cases with (single and coordinated) mutations {and environmental selection}, and we use it to show ergodic properties of the process.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of locally stable Gibbs point processes via spatial birth-death dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that for every locally stable and tempered pair potential $\phi$ with bounded range, there exists a unique infinite-volume Gibbs point process on $\mathbb{R}^d$ for every activity $\lambda &lt; (e^{L} \hat{C}_{\phi})^{-1}$, where $L$ is the local stability constant and $\hat{C}_{\phi}:= \mathrm{sup}_{x \in \mathbb{R}^{d}} \int_{\mathbb{R}^{d}} 1 - e^{-|\phi(x, y)|} dy$ is the (weak) temperedness constant. Our result extends the uniqueness regime that is given by the classical Ruelle--Penrose bound by a factor of at least $e$, where the improvements becomes larger as the negative parts of the potential become more prominent (i.e., for attractive interactions at low temperature). Our technique is based on the approach of Dyer et al. (Rand. Struct. &amp; Alg. '04): we show that for any bounded region and any boundary condition, we can construct a Markov process (in our case spatial birth-death dynamics) that converges rapidly to the finite-volume Gibbs point process while effects of the boundary condition propagate sufficiently slowly. As a result, we obtain a spatial mixing property that implies uniqueness of the infinite-volume Gibbs measure.</description>

      <title>Targeting influence in a harmonic opinion model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Influence propagation in social networks is a central problem in modern social network analysis, with important societal applications in politics and advertising. A large body of work has focused on cascading models, viral marketing, and finite-horizon diffusion. There is, however, a need for more developed, mathematically principled \emph{adversarial models}, in which multiple, opposed actors strategically select nodes whose influence will maximally sway the crowd to their point of view.
  In the present work, we develop and analyze such a model based on harmonic functions and linear diffusion. We prove that our general problem is NP-hard and that the objective function is monotone and submodular; consequently, we can greedily approximate the solution within a constant factor. Introducing and analyzing a convex relaxation, we show that the problem can be approximately solved using smooth optimization methods. We illustrate the effectiveness of our approach on a variety of example networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce some new notions of aging based on geometric, harmonic means of failure rate and aging intensity function. We define a generalized version of aging functions called specific interval-average geometric hazard rate, specific interval-average harmonic hazard rate. We focus on some characterization results and their inter-relationships among the resulting non-parametric classes of distributions. Monotonic nature of so defined aging classes are exhibited by some well known probability distributions. Probabilistic orders based on these functions are taken up for further study. The work is illustrated through case studies and a simulated data having applications in reliability/survival analysis.</description>

Abstract: We establish the existence and uniqueness of the maximal pathwise solution for an abstract nonlinear stochastic evolutional equation, which takes the two and three dimensional stochastic Navier-Stokes equations as a typical model, forced by a multiplicative white noise, and show that the pathwise solution exists globally in time in a positive probability when the initial data is sufficiently small. Moreover, a global pathwise solution is obtained for the stochastic Navier-Stokes equations defined on torus when the data is properly regular and small.</description>

      <title>Posterior Sampling with Denoising Oracles via Tilted Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Score-based diffusion models have significantly advanced high-dimensional data generation across various domains, by learning a denoising oracle (or score) from datasets. From a Bayesian perspective, they offer a realistic modeling of data priors and facilitate solving inverse problems through posterior sampling. Although many heuristic methods have been developed recently for this purpose, they lack the quantitative guarantees needed in many scientific applications.
  In this work, we introduce the \textit{tilted transport} technique, which leverages the quadratic structure of the log-likelihood in linear inverse problems in combination with the prior denoising oracle to transform the original posterior sampling problem into a new `boosted' posterior that is provably easier to sample from. We quantify the conditions under which this boosted posterior is strongly log-concave, highlighting the dependencies on the condition number of the measurement matrix and the signal-to-noise ratio. The resulting posterior sampling scheme is shown to reach the computational threshold predicted for sampling Ising models [Kunisky'23] with a direct analysis, and is further validated on high-dimensional Gaussian mixture models and scalar field $\varphi^4$ models.</description>

Abstract: We consider the momentum formulation of the two-dimensional surface quasi-geostrophic equations forced by random noise, of both additive and linear multiplicative types. For any prescribed deterministic function under some conditions, we construct solutions to each system whose energy is the fixed function. Consequently, we prove non-uniqueness of almost sure Markov selections of suitable class of weak solutions associated to the momentum surface quasi-geostrophic equations in both cases of noise.</description>

      <title>Distribution of Primitve Lattice Points in Large Dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the asymptotic behavior of the distribution of primitive lattice points in a symmetric Borel set $S_d\subset\mathbb R^d$ as $d$ goes to infinity, under certain volume conditions on $S_d$. Our main technique involves exploring higher moment formulas for the primitive Siegel transform. We first demonstrate that if the volume of $S_d$ remains fixed for all $d\in \mathbb N$, then the distribution of the half the number of primitive lattice points in $S_d$ converges, in distribution, to the Poisson distribution of mean $\frac 1 2$. Furthermore, if the volume of $S_d$ goes to infinity subexponentially as $d$ approaches infinity, the normalized distribution of the half the number of primitive lattice points in $S_d$ converges, in distribution, to the Normal distribution $\mathcal N(0,1)$. We also extend these results to the setting of stochastic processes. This work is motivated by the contributions of Rogers (1955), S$\ddot{\text{o}}$dergren (2011) and Str$\ddot{\text{o}}$mbergsson and S$\ddot{\text{o}}$dergren (2019).</description>

      <title>Knockout tournaments admitting all candidates as winners</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A set of $2^n$ candidates is presented to a commission. At every round, each member of the commission votes by pairwise comparison, and one-half of the candidates is deleted from the tournament, the remaining candidates proceeding to the next round until the $n$-th round (the final one) in which a winner is declared. The candidates are arranged on a blackboard in a given order, with the relative order among the candidates maintained at all rounds. In the case of $2^n$ candidates, with $n \geq 3$, we identify a voting profile for which any candidate could win just by choosing a proper initial order of the candidates. A study on the size of the commission is carried out in order to obtain the desired result of any candidate being a possible winner. We construct such a commission with $4n -3$ voters for $2^n$ candidates. Moreover, in the setting of a random number of voters, we obtain the same results, with high probability, when the expected number of voters is large.</description>

      <title>Tournament score sequences, Erd\H{o}s-Ginzburg-Ziv numbers, and the L\'evy-Khintchine method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a short proof of a recent result of Claesson, Dukes, Frankl\'in and Stef\'ansson, that connects tournament score sequences and the Erd\H{o}s-Ginzburg-Ziv numbers from additive number theory. We show that this connection is, in fact, an instance of the L\'evy-Khintchine formula from probability theory, and highlight how such formulas can be useful in enumerative combinatorics. Our proof combines renewal theory with the representation of score sequences as lattice paths, due to Erd\H{o}s and Moser in the 1960s. These probabilistic and geometric points of view lead to a simpler proof. A key idea in the original proof and ours is to consider cyclic shifts of score sequences. We observe, however, that this idea is already present in Kleitman's remarks added to one of Moser's final articles in 1968, and in subsequent works by Kleitman. In the same article, Moser conjectured that there are asymptotically $C4^n/n^{5/2}$ many score sequences of length $n$. Combining the arguments in the current work with those in a recent work by the third author, we demonstrate the utility of the L\'evy-Khintchine method, by giving a short proof of Moser's conjecture.</description>

      <title>Sharp relations between volume growth, isoperimetry and escape probability in vertex-transitive graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.01467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2001.01467v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove sharp bounds on the probability that the simple random walk on a vertex-transitive graph escapes the ball of radius $r$ before returning to its starting point. In particular, this shows that if the ball of radius $r$ has size slightly greater than quadratic in $r$ then this probability is bounded from below. On the other hand, we show that if the ball of radius $r$ has volume slightly less than cubic in $r$ then this probability decays logarithmically for all larger balls. These results represent a finitary refinement of Varopoulos's theorem that a random walk on a vertex-transitive graph is recurrent if and only if the graph has at most quadratic volume growth. They also imply the existence of a gap at $0$ for escape probabilities: there exists a universal constant $c&gt;0$ such that the random walk on an arbitrary vertex-transitive graph is either recurrent or has a probability of at least $c$ of escaping to infinity. We also prove versions of these results for finite graphs, in particular confirming and strengthening a conjecture of Benjamini and Kozma from 2002. Amongst other things, we also generalise our results to give a sharp finitary version of the characterisation of $p$-parabolic vertex-transitive graphs, prove a number of sharp isoperimetric inequalities for vertex-transitive graphs, and prove a locality result for the escape probability of the random walk on a vertex-transitive graph that can be seen as an analogue of Schramm's locality conjecture for the critical percolation probability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2108.09008v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study an exit contract design problem, where one provides a universal exit contract to multiple heterogeneous agents, with which each agent chooses an optimal (exit) stopping time. The problem consists in optimizing the universal exit contract w.r.t. some criterion depending on the contract as well as the agents' exit times. Under a technical monotonicity condition, and by using Bank-El Karoui's representation of stochastic processes, we are able to transform the initial contract optimization problem into an optimal control problem. The latter is also equivalent to an optimal multiple stopping problem and the existence of the optimal contract is proved. We next show that the problem in the continuous-time setting can be approximated by a sequence of discrete-time ones, which would induce a natural numerical approximation method. We finally discuss the optimaization problem over the class of all Markovian and/or continuous exit contracts.</description>

      <title>Quasi-stationary distributions in reducible state spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2201.10151v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study quasi-stationary distributions and quasi-limiting behavior of Markov chains in general reducible state spaces with absorption. We propose a set of assumptions dealing with particular situations where the state space can be decomposed into three subsets between which communication is only possible in a single direction. These assumptions allow us to characterize the exponential order of magnitude and the exact polynomial correction, called polynomial convergence parameter, for the leading order term of the semigroup for large time. They also provide explicit convergence speeds to this leading order term. We apply these results to general Markov chains with finitely or denumerably many communication classes using a specific induction over the communication classes of the chain. We are able to explicitely characterize the polynomial convergence parameter, to determine the complete set of quasistationary distributions and to provide explicit estimates for the speed of convergence to quasi-limiting distributions in the case of finitely many communication classes. We conclude with an application of these results to the case of denumerable state spaces, where we are able to prove that, in general, there is existence of a quasi-stationary distribution without assuming irreducibility before absorption. This actually holds true assuming only aperiodicity, the existence of a Lyapunov function and the existence of a point in the state space from which the return time is finite with positive probability.</description>

      <title>Continuous-time weakly self-avoiding walk on $\mathbb{Z}$ has strictly monotone escape speed</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.15580v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Weakly self-avoiding walk (WSAW) is a model of simple random walk paths that penalizes self-intersections. On $\mathbb{Z}$, Greven and den Hollander proved in 1993 that the discrete-time weakly self-avoiding walk has an asymptotically deterministic escape speed, and they conjectured that this speed should be strictly increasing in the repelling strength parameter. We study a continuous-time version of the model, give a different existence proof for the speed, and prove the speed to be strictly increasing. The proof uses a transfer matrix method implemented via a supersymmetric version of the BFS--Dynkin isomorphism theorem, spectral theory, Tauberian theory, and stochastic dominance.</description>

Abstract: This work is concerned with fractional Gaussian fields, i.e. Gaussian fields whose covariance operator is given by the inverse fractional Laplacian $(-\Delta)^{-s}$ (where, in particular, we include the case $s &gt;1$). We define a lattice discretization of these fields and show that their scaling limits -- with respect to the optimal Besov space topology (up to an endpoint case) -- are the original continuous fields. As a byproduct, in dimension $d&lt;2s$, we prove the convergence in distribution of the maximum of the fields. A key tool in the proof is a sharp error estimate for the natural finite difference scheme for $(-\Delta)^s$ under minimal regularity assumptions, which is also of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Full $\Gamma$-expansion of reversible Markov chains level two large deviations rate functionals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.00671v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\Xi_n \subset \mathbb R^d$, $n\ge 1$, be a sequence of finite sets and consider a $\Xi_n$-valued, irreducible, reversible, continuous-time Markov chain $(X^{(n)}_t:t\ge 0)$. Denote by $\mathscr P(\mathbb R^d) $ the set of probability measures on $\mathbb R^d$ and by $I_n\colon \mathscr P(\mathbb R^d) \to [0,+\infty)$ the level two large deviations rate functional for $X^{(n)}_t$ as $t\to\infty$. We present a general method, based on tools used to prove the metastable behaviour of Markov chains, to derive a full expansion of $I_n$ expressing it as $I_n = I^{(0)} \,+\, \sum_{1\le p\le q} (1/\theta^{(p)}_n)\, I^{(p)}$, where $I^{(p)}\colon \mathscr P(\mathbb R^d) \to [0,+\infty]$ represent rate functionals independent of $n$ and $\theta^{(p)}_n$ sequences such that $\theta^{(1)}_n \to\infty$, $\theta^{(p)}_n / \theta^{(p+1)}_n \to 0$ for $1\le p&lt; q$. The speed $\theta^{(p)}_n$ corresponds to the time-scale at which the Markov chains $X^{(n)}_t$ exhibits a metastable behavior, and the $I^{(p-1)}$ zero-level sets to the metastable states. To illustrate the theory we apply the method to random walks in potential fields.</description>

      <title>Mean field limits of interacting particle systems with positive stable jumps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.12275v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This note is a companion article to the recent paper L\"ocherbach, Loukianova, Marini (2024). We consider mean field systems of interacting particles. Each particle jumps with a jump rate depending on its position. When jumping, a macroscopic quantity is added to its own position. Moreover, simultaneously, all other particles of the system receive a small random kick which is distributed according to a positive $\alpha-$stable law and scaled in $N^{-1/\alpha},$ where $0 &lt; \alpha &lt; 1.$ In between successive jumps of the system, the particles follow a deterministic flow with drift depending on their position and on the empirical measure of the total system. In a more general framework where jumps and state space do not need to be positive, we have shown in L\"ocherbach, Loukianova, Marini (2024) that the mean field limit of this system is a McKean-Vlasov type process which is solution of a non-linear SDE, driven by an $ \alpha-$stable process. Moreover we have obtained in L\"ocherbach, Loukianova, Marini (2024) an upper bound for the strong rate of convergence with respect to some specific distance disregarding big jumps of the limit stable process. In the present note we consider the specific situation where all jumps are positive and particles take values in $[ 0, + \infty [ . $ We show that in this case it is possible to improve upon the error bounds obtained in L\"ocherbach, Loukianova, Marini (2024) by using an adhoc distance obtained after applying a concave space transform to the trajectories. The distance we propose here takes into account the big jumps of the limit $ \alpha-$stable subordinator.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.03139v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The motivation for this paper is the analysis of the fixed-density Ising lattice gas in the presence of a gravitational field. This is a seen as a particular instance of an Ising model with a slowly varying magnetic field in the fixed magnetization ensemble. We first characterize the typical magnetization profiles in the regime in which the contribution of the magnetic field competes with the bulk energy term. We then discuss in more detail the particular case of a gravitational field and the arising interfacial phenomena. In particular, we identify the macroscopic profile and propose several conjectures concerning the interface appearing in the phase coexistence regime. The latter are supported by explicit computations in an effective model. Finally, we state some conjectures concerning equilibrium crystal shapes in the presence of a gravitational field, when the latter contributes to the energy only to surface order.</description>

      <title>On the limit theory of mean field optimal stopping with non-Markov dynamics and common noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00407v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper focuses on a mean-field optimal stopping problem with non-Markov dynamics and common noise, inspired by Talbi, Touzi, and Zhang \cite{TalbiTouziZhang1,TalbiTouziZhang3}. The goal is to establish the limit theory and demonstrate the equivalence of the value functions between weak and strong formulations. The difference between the strong and weak formulations lies in the source of randomness determining the stopping time on a canonical space. In the strong formulation, the randomness of the stopping time originates from Brownian motions. In contrast, this may not necessarily be the case in the weak formulation. Additionally, a $(H)$-Hypothesis-type condition is introduced to guarantee the equivalence of the value functions. The limit theory encompasses the convergence of the value functions and solutions of the large population optimal stopping problem towards those of the mean-field limit, and it shows that every solution of the mean field optimal stopping problem can be approximated by solutions of the large population optimal stopping problem.</description>

Abstract: A homogenization problem of infinite dimensional diffusion processes indexed by ${\mathbf Z}^d$ having periodic drift coefficients is considered. By an application of the uniform ergodic theorem for infinite dimensional diffusion processes based on logarithmic Sobolev inequalities, an homogenization property of the processes starting from an almost every arbitrary point in the state space with respect to an invariant measure is proved. This result is also interpreted as solution to a homogenization problem of infinite dimensional diffusions with random coefficients, which is essentially analogous to the known ones in finite dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.14176v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the averaging process on the discrete $d$-dimensional torus. On this graph, the process is known to converge to equilibrium on diffusive timescales, not exhibiting cutoff. In this work, we refine this picture in two ways. Firstly, we prove a concentration phenomenon of the averaging process around its mean, occurring on a shorter timescale than the one of its relaxation to equilibrium. Secondly, we establish sharp gradient estimates, which capture its fast local smoothness property. This is the first setting in which these two features of the averaging process -- concentration and local smoothness -- can be quantified. These features carry useful information on a number of large scale properties of the averaging process. As an illustration of this fact, we determine the limit profile of its distance to equilibrium and derive a quantitative hydrodynamic limit for it. Finally, we discuss their implications on cutoff for the binomial splitting process, the particle analogue of the averaging process.</description>

Abstract: Consider a supercritical branching random walk in a time-inhomogeneous random environment. We impose a selection (called barrier) on survival in the following way. The position of the barrier may depend on the generation and the environment. %to indexed by time $n,$ i.e.,$\{\L_n\}$with a random absorption barrier In each generation, only the individuals born below the barrier can survive and reproduce. When the barrier causes the extinction of the system, we give the extinction rate in the sense of $L^p~(p\geq 1)$. Moreover, we show the $L^p$ convergence of the small deviation probability for a random walk with random environment in time.</description>

Abstract: We consider the convergence of kinetic Langevin dynamics to its ergodic invariant measure, which is Gibbs distribution. Instead of the standard setup where the friction coefficient is a constant scalar, we investigate position-dependent friction coefficient and the possible accelerated convergence it enables. We show that by choosing this coefficient matrix to be $2\sqrt{\text{Hess}V}$, convergence is accelerated in the sense that no constant scalar friction coefficient can lead to faster convergence for a large subset of (nonlinear) strongly-convex potential $V$'s. The speed of convergence is quantified in terms of chi-square divergence from the target distribution, and proved using a Lyapunov approach, based on viewing sampling as optimization in the infinite dimensional space of probability distributions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13183v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well-known that a Lorenz curve derived from the distribution function of a random variable can be viewed itself as a probability distribution function of a new random variable [3]. We prove the surprising result that a sequence of consecutive iterations of this map leads to a non-corner case convergence independent of the starting random variable. In the primal case, the limiting distribution has a power law, with coefficient equal to the golden section. In the reflected case, the limiting distribution is classical Pareto, with a conjugate coefficient. Possible directions for applications are discussed.</description>

      <title>On some features of Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization with random coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17059v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO or UBQP) is concerned with
  maximizing/minimizing the quadratic form
  $H(J, \eta) = W \sum_{i,j} J_{i,j} \eta_{i} \eta_{j}$ with $J$ a matrix of coefficients,
  $\eta \in \{0, 1\}^N$ and $W$ a normalizing constant.
  In the statistical mechanics literature, QUBO is a lattice gas counterpart to the (generalized) Sherrington--Kirkpatrick spin glass model.
  Finding the optima of $H$ is an NP-hard problem.
  Several problems in combinatorial optimization and data analysis can be mapped to QUBO in a straightforward manner.
  In the combinatorial optimization literature, random instances of QUBO are often used to test the effectiveness of heuristic algorithms.
  Here we consider QUBO with random independent coefficients and show that if
  the $J_{i,j}$'s have zero mean and finite variance then, after proper normalization,
  the minimum and
  maximum \emph{per particle} of $H$ do not depend on the details of the distribution
  of the couplings and are concentrated around their expected values.
  Further, with the help of numerical simulations, we study the
  minimum and maximum of the objective function and provide some insight
  into the structure of the minimizer and the maximizer of $H$.
  We argue that also this structure is rather robust.
  Our findings hold also in the diluted case where each of the $J_{i,j}$'s is allowed
  to be zero with probability going to $1$ as $N \to \infty$ in a suitable way.</description>

      <title>Perfect Matchings and Essential Spanning Forests in Hyperbolic Double Circle Packings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08615v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate perfect matchings and essential spanning forests in planar hyperbolic graphs via circle packings.
  We prove the existence of nonconstant harmonic Dirichlet functions that vanish in a closed set of the boundary, generalizing a result in \cite{bsinv}. We then prove the existence of extremal infinite volume measures for uniform spanning forests with partially wired boundary conditions and partially free boundary conditions, generalizing a result in \cite{BLPS01}.
  Using the double circle packing for a pair of dual graphs, we relate the inverse of the weighted adjacency matrix to the difference of Green's functions plus an explicit harmonic Dirichlet function. This gives explicit formulas for the probabilities of any cylindrical events.
  We prove that the infinite-volume Gibbs measure obtained from approximations by finite domains with exactly two convex white corners converging to two distinct points along the boundary is extremal, yet not invariant with respect to a finite-orbit subgroup of the automorphism group. We then show that under this measure, a.s.~there are no infinite contours in the symmetric difference of two i.i.d.~random perfect matchings.
  As an application, we prove that the variance of the height difference of two i.i.d.~uniformly weighted perfect matchings under the boundary condition above on a transitive nonamenable planar graph is always finite; in contrast to the 2D uniformly weighted dimer model on a transitive amenable planar graph as proved in \cite{RK01,KOS06}, where the variance of height difference grows in the order of $\log n$, with $n$ being the graph distance to the boundary. This also implies that a.s.~each point is surrounded by finitely many cycles in the symmetric difference of two i.i.d.~perfect matchings, again in contrast to the 2D Euclidean case.</description>

      <title>An Optimal Selection Problem Associated with the Poisson Process</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15616v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cowan and Zabczyk (1978) introduced a continuous-time generalisation of the best-choice (secretary) problem, where offers arrive at epochs of a homogeneous Poisson process. We expand their work to encompass the last-success problem under the Karamata-Stirling success profile. In this setting, the $k$th trial is a success with probability $p_k=\theta/(\theta+k-1)$, where $\theta &gt; 0$. In the best-choice setting ($\theta=1$), the myopic strategy is optimal, and the proof hinges on verifying the monotonicity of certain critical roots. We extend this crucial result to the last-success case by exploiting a connection to the sign of the derivative in the first parameter of a quotient of Kummer's hypergeometric functions. Finally, we derive bounds and asymptotics of the critical roots, strengthening and improving the findings of Ciesielski and Zabczyk (1979).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2105.05627v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a generalization of the strong subadditivity of the von Neumann entropy for bosonic quantum Gaussian systems. Such generalization determines the minimum values of linear combinations of the entropies of subsystems associated to arbitrary linear functions of the quadratures, and holds for arbitrary quantum states including the scenario where the entropies are conditioned on a memory quantum system. We apply our result to prove new entropic uncertainty relations with quantum memory, a generalization of the quantum Entropy Power Inequality, and the linear time scaling of the entanglement entropy produced by quadratic Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>The coalescent in finite populations with arbitrary, fixed structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.02880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.02880v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The coalescent is a stochastic process representing ancestral lineages in a population undergoing neutral genetic drift. Originally defined for a well-mixed population, the coalescent has been adapted in various ways to accommodate spatial, age, and class structure, along with other features of real-world populations. To further extend the range of population structures to which coalescent theory applies, we formulate a coalescent process for a broad class of neutral drift models with arbitrary -- but fixed -- spatial, age, sex, and class structure, haploid or diploid genetics, and any fixed mating pattern. Here, the coalescent is represented as a random sequence of mappings $\mathcal{C} = \left(C_t\right)_{t=0}^\infty$ from a finite set $G$ to itself. The set $G$ represents the ``sites'' (in individuals, in particular locations and/or classes) at which these alleles can live. The state of the coalescent, $C_t:G \to G$, maps each site $g \in G$ to the site containing $g$'s ancestor, $t$ time-steps into the past. Using this representation, we define and analyze coalescence time, coalescence branch length, mutations prior to coalescence, and stationary probabilities of identity-by-descent and identity-by-state. For low mutation, we provide a recipe for computing identity-by-descent and identity-by-state probabilities via the coalescent. Applying our results to a diploid population with arbitrary sex ratio $r$, we find that measures of genetic dissimilarity, among any set of sites, are scaled by $4r(1-r)$ relative to the even sex ratio case.</description>

      <title>Langevin dynamics based algorithm e-TH$\varepsilon$O POULA for stochastic optimization problems with discontinuous stochastic gradient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.13193v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new Langevin dynamics based algorithm, called e-TH$\varepsilon$O POULA, to solve optimization problems with discontinuous stochastic gradients which naturally appear in real-world applications such as quantile estimation, vector quantization, CVaR minimization, and regularized optimization problems involving ReLU neural networks. We demonstrate both theoretically and numerically the applicability of the e-TH$\varepsilon$O POULA algorithm. More precisely, under the conditions that the stochastic gradient is locally Lipschitz in average and satisfies a certain convexity at infinity condition, we establish non-asymptotic error bounds for e-TH$\varepsilon$O POULA in Wasserstein distances and provide a non-asymptotic estimate for the expected excess risk, which can be controlled to be arbitrarily small. Three key applications in finance and insurance are provided, namely, multi-period portfolio optimization, transfer learning in multi-period portfolio optimization, and insurance claim prediction, which involve neural networks with (Leaky)-ReLU activation functions. Numerical experiments conducted using real-world datasets illustrate the superior empirical performance of e-TH$\varepsilon$O POULA compared to SGLD, TUSLA, ADAM, and AMSGrad in terms of model accuracy.</description>

      <title>A Multilevel Stochastic Approximation Algorithm for Value-at-Risk and Expected Shortfall Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.01207v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a multilevel stochastic approximation (MLSA) scheme for the computation of the value-at-risk (VaR) and expected shortfall (ES) of a financial loss, which can only be computed via simulations conditional on the realization of future risk factors. Thus, the problem of estimating its VaR and ES is nested in nature and can be viewed as an instance of stochastic approximation problems with biased innovations. In this framework, for a prescribed accuracy $\varepsilon$, the optimal complexity of a nested stochastic approximation algorithm is shown to be of order $\varepsilon^{-3}$. To estimate the VaR, our MLSA algorithm attains an optimal complexity of order $\varepsilon^{-2-\delta}$, where $\delta&lt;1$ is some parameter depending on the integrability degree of the loss, while to estimate the ES, it achieves an optimal complexity of order $\varepsilon^{-2}\left|\ln{\varepsilon}\right|^2$. Numerical studies of the joint evolution of the error rate and the execution time demonstrate how our MLSA algorithm regains a significant amount of the performance lost due to the nested nature of the problem.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Optimal Control Matching</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02027v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stochastic optimal control, which has the goal of driving the behavior of noisy systems, is broadly applicable in science, engineering and artificial intelligence. Our work introduces Stochastic Optimal Control Matching (SOCM), a novel Iterative Diffusion Optimization (IDO) technique for stochastic optimal control that stems from the same philosophy as the conditional score matching loss for diffusion models. That is, the control is learned via a least squares problem by trying to fit a matching vector field. The training loss, which is closely connected to the cross-entropy loss, is optimized with respect to both the control function and a family of reparameterization matrices which appear in the matching vector field. The optimization with respect to the reparameterization matrices aims at minimizing the variance of the matching vector field. Experimentally, our algorithm achieves lower error than all the existing IDO techniques for stochastic optimal control for three out of four control problems, in some cases by an order of magnitude. The key idea underlying SOCM is the path-wise reparameterization trick, a novel technique that may be of independent interest. Code at https://github.com/facebookresearch/SOC-matching</description>

      <title>Extended Flow Matching: a Method of Conditional Generation with Generalized Continuity Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18839v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The task of conditional generation is one of the most important applications of generative models, and numerous methods have been developed to date based on the celebrated flow-based models. However, many flow-based models in use today are not built to allow one to introduce an explicit inductive bias to how the conditional distribution to be generated changes with respect to conditions. This can result in unexpected behavior in the task of style transfer, for example. In this research, we introduce extended flow matching (EFM), a direct extension of flow matching that learns a ``matrix field'' corresponding to the continuous map from the space of conditions to the space of distributions. We show that we can introduce inductive bias to the conditional generation through the matrix field and demonstrate this fact with MMOT-EFM, a version of EFM that aims to minimize the Dirichlet energy or the sensitivity of the distribution with respect to conditions. We will present our theory along with experimental results that support the competitiveness of EFM in conditional generation.</description>

      <title>Markov generators as non-hermitian supersymmetric quantum Hamiltonians: spectral properties via bi-orthogonal basis and Singular Value Decompositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16605v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Continuity equations associated to continuous-time Markov processes can be considered as Euclidean Schr\"odinger equations, where the non-hermitian quantum Hamiltonian $\bold{H}={\bold{div}}{\bold J}$ is naturally factorized into the product of the divergence operator ${\bold {div}}$ and the current operator ${\bold J}$. For non-equilibrium Markov jump processes in a space of $N$ configurations with $M$ links and $C=M-(N-1)\geq 1$ independent cycles, this factorization of the $N \times N$ Hamiltonian ${\bold H}={\bold I}^{\dagger}{\bold J}$ involves the incidence matrix ${\bold I}$ and the current matrix ${\bold J}$ of size $M \times N$, so that the supersymmetric partner ${\hat{\bold H}}= {\bold J}{\bold I}^{\dagger}$ governing the dynamics of the currents living on the $M$ links is of size $M \times M$. To better understand the relations between the spectral decompositions of these two Hamiltonians $\bold{H}={\bold I}^{\dagger}{\bold J}$ and ${\hat {\bold H}} ={\bold J}{\bold I}^{\dagger}$ with respect to their bi-orthogonal basis of right and left eigenvectors that characterize the relaxation dynamics towards the steady state and the steady currents, it is useful to analyze the properties of the Singular Value Decompositions of the two rectangular matrices ${\bold I}$ and ${\bold J} $ of size $M \times N$ and the interpretations in terms of discrete Helmholtz decompositions. This general framework concerning Markov jump processes can be adapted to non-equilibrium diffusion processes governed by Fokker-Planck equations in dimension $d$, where the number $N$ of configurations, the number $M$ of links and the number $C=M-(N-1)$ of independent cycles become infinite, while the two matrices ${\bold I}$ and ${\bold J}$ become first-order differential operators acting on scalar functions to produce vector fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08384v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we revisit the notion of grouped dispersal that have been introduced by Soubeyrand and co-authors \cite{soubeyrand2011patchy} to model the simultaneous (and hence dependent) dispersal  of several propagules from a single source  in a homogeneous  environment. We built a time continuous  measure valued process that takes into account the main feature of a grouped dispersal and derive its infinitesimal generator. To cope with the mutligeneration aspect associated to the demography we introduce  two types of propagules in the description of  the population which is one of  the main innovations here.  We also provide a rigorous description of the process and its generator. We derive  as well, some large population asymptotics of the process unveilling the  degenerate ultra parabolic system of PDE satisfied by the density of population. Finally, we also show that such a PDE system has a non-trivial solution which is unique in a certain functional space.</description>
