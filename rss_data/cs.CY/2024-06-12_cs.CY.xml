      <title>The Legal Duty to Search for Less Discriminatory Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Work in computer science has established that, contrary to conventional wisdom, for a given prediction problem there are almost always multiple possible models with equivalent performance--a phenomenon often termed model multiplicity. Critically, different models of equivalent performance can produce different predictions for the same individual, and, in aggregate, exhibit different levels of impacts across demographic groups. Thus, when an algorithmic system displays a disparate impact, model multiplicity suggests that developers could discover an alternative model that performs equally well, but has less discriminatory impact. Indeed, the promise of model multiplicity is that an equally accurate, but less discriminatory algorithm (LDA) almost always exists. But without dedicated exploration, it is unlikely developers will discover potential LDAs. Model multiplicity and the availability of LDAs have significant ramifications for the legal response to discriminatory algorithms, in particular for disparate impact doctrine, which has long taken into account the availability of alternatives with less disparate effect when assessing liability. A close reading of legal authorities over the decades reveals that the law has on numerous occasions recognized that the existence of a less discriminatory alternative is sometimes relevant to a defendant's burden of justification at the second step of disparate impact analysis. Indeed, under disparate impact doctrine, it makes little sense to say that a given algorithmic system used by an employer, creditor, or housing provider is "necessary" if an equally accurate model that exhibits less disparate effect is available and possible to discover with reasonable effort. As a result, we argue that the law should place a duty of a reasonable search for LDAs on entities that develop and deploy predictive models in covered civil rights domains.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The traditional five-day workweek faces mounting challenges, prompting exploration of alternative models like the four-day workweek. This research explores the transformative potential of scalability principles derived from cloud computing and IT in redefining workforce management for a four-day workweek. The study employs a Multivocal Literacy Research methodology, combining grey literature and systematic review approaches. Through a comprehensive review of related work, the challenges, and benefits of transitioning to a four-day workweek are explored. Pilot programs, clear communication, and agility are identified as critical success factors. The synthesis of scalability principles in workforce management serves as a powerful framework for a smooth transition towards a four-day workweek. By prioritizing adaptability, dynamic resource allocation, and data-driven insights, organizations can unlock the full potential of a compressed work schedule. This research contributes valuable insights for organizations seeking to thrive in the evolving landscape of modern work structures and prioritizing employee well-being.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Social Networks and the Future of Free Speech Online</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decentralized social networks like Mastodon and BlueSky are trending topics that have drawn much attention and discussion in recent years. By devolving powers from the central node to the end users, decentralized social networks aim to cure existing pathologies on the centralized platforms and have been viewed by many as the future of the Internet. This article critically and systematically assesses the decentralization project's prospect for communications online. It uses normative theories of free speech to examine whether and how the decentralization design could facilitate users' freedom of expression online. The analysis shows that both promises and pitfalls exist, highlighting the importance of value-based design in this area. Two most salient issues for the design of the decentralized networks are: how to balance the decentralization ideal with constant needs of centralization on the network, and how to empower users to make them truly capable of exercising their control. The article then uses some design examples, such as the shared blocklist and the opt-in search function, to illustrate the value considerations underlying the design choices. Some tentative proposals for law and policy interventions are offered to better facilitate the design of the new network. Rather than providing clear answers, the article seeks to map the value implications of the design choices, highlight the stakes, and point directions for future research.</description>

      <title>Position Paper: Technical Research and Talent is Needed for Effective AI Governance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In light of recent advancements in AI capabilities and the increasingly widespread integration of AI systems into society, governments worldwide are actively seeking to mitigate the potential harms and risks associated with these technologies through regulation and other governance tools. However, there exist significant gaps between governance aspirations and the current state of the technical tooling necessary for their realisation. In this position paper, we survey policy documents published by public-sector institutions in the EU, US, and China to highlight specific areas of disconnect between the technical requirements necessary for enacting proposed policy actions, and the current technical state of the art. Our analysis motivates a call for tighter integration of the AI/ML research community within AI governance in order to i) catalyse technical research aimed at bridging the gap between current and supposed technical underpinnings of regulatory action, as well as ii) increase the level of technical expertise within governing institutions so as to inform and guide effective governance of AI.</description>

Abstract: Digital Twins have evolved as a concept describing digital representations of physical assets. They can be used to facilitate simulations, monitoring, or optimization of product lifecycles. Considering the concept of a Circular Economy, which entails several lifecycles of, e.g., vehicles, their components, and materials, it is important to investigate how the respective Digital Twins are managed over the lifecycle of their physical assets. This publication presents and compares three approaches for managing Digital Twins in industrial use cases. The analysis considers aspects such as updates, data ownership, and data sovereignty. The results based on the research project Catena-X</description>

      <title>The end of multiple choice tests: using AI to enhance assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective teaching relies on knowing what students know-or think they know. Revealing student thinking is challenging. Often used because of their ease of grading, even the best multiple choice (MC) tests, those using research based distractors (wrong answers) are intrinsically limited in the insights they provide due to two factors. When distractors do not reflect student beliefs they can be ignored, increasing the likelihood that the correct answer will be chosen by chance. Moreover, making the correct choice does not guarantee that the student understands why it is correct. To address these limitations, we recommend asking students to explain why they chose their answer, and why "wrong" choices are wrong. Using a discipline-trained artificial intelligence-based bot it is possible to analyze their explanations, identifying the concepts and scientific principles that maybe missing or misapplied. The bot also makes suggestions for how instructors can use these data to better guide student thinking. In a small "proof of concept" study, we tested this approach using questions from the Biology Concepts Instrument (BCI). The result was rapid, informative, and provided actionable feedback on student thinking. It appears that the use of AI addresses the weaknesses of conventional MC test. It seems likely that incorporating AI-analyzed formative assessments will lead to improved overall learning outcomes.</description>

      <title>Anna Karenina Strikes Again: Pre-Trained LLM Embeddings May Favor High-Performing Learners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unsupervised clustering of student responses to open-ended questions into behavioral and cognitive profiles using pre-trained LLM embeddings is an emerging technique, but little is known about how well this captures pedagogically meaningful information. We investigate this in the context of student responses to open-ended questions in biology, which were previously analyzed and clustered by experts into theory-driven Knowledge Profiles (KPs). Comparing these KPs to ones discovered by purely data-driven clustering techniques, we report poor discoverability of most KPs, except for the ones including the correct answers. We trace this "discoverability bias" to the representations of KPs in the pre-trained LLM embeddings space.</description>

      <title>PANDORA: Deep graph learning based COVID-19 infection risk level forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: COVID-19 as a global pandemic causes a massive disruption to social stability that threatens human life and the economy. Policymakers and all elements of society must deliver measurable actions based on the pandemic's severity to minimize the detrimental impact of COVID-19. A proper forecasting system is arguably important to provide an early signal of the risk of COVID-19 infection so that the authorities are ready to protect the people from the worst. However, making a good forecasting model for infection risks in different cities or regions is not an easy task, because it has a lot of influential factors that are difficult to be identified manually. To address the current limitations, we propose a deep graph learning model, called PANDORA, to predict the infection risks of COVID-19, by considering all essential factors and integrating them into a geographical network. The framework uses geographical position relations and transportation frequency as higher-order structural properties formulated by higher-order network structures (i.e., network motifs). Moreover, four significant node attributes (i.e., multiple features of a particular area, including climate, medical condition, economy, and human mobility) are also considered. We propose three different aggregators to better aggregate node attributes and structural features, namely, Hadamard, Summation, and Connection. Experimental results over real data show that PANDORA outperforms the baseline method with higher accuracy and faster convergence speed, no matter which aggregator is chosen. We believe that PANDORA using deep graph learning provides a promising approach to get superior performance in infection risk level forecasting and help humans battle the COVID-19 crisis.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Determinants of Pedestrian Crash Severity Using an AutoML Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates pedestrian crash severity through Automated Machine Learning (AutoML), offering a streamlined and accessible method for analyzing critical factors. Utilizing a detailed dataset from Utah spanning 2010-2021, the research employs AutoML to assess the effects of various explanatory variables on crash outcomes. The study incorporates SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to interpret the contributions of individual features in the predictive model, enhancing the understanding of influential factors such as lighting conditions, road type, and weather on pedestrian crash severity. Emphasizing the efficiency and democratization of data-driven methodologies, the paper discusses the benefits of using AutoML in traffic safety analysis. This integration of AutoML with SHAP analysis not only bolsters predictive accuracy but also improves interpretability, offering critical insights into effective pedestrian safety measures. The findings highlight the potential of this approach in advancing the analysis of pedestrian crash severity.</description>

      <title>Network-Based Transfer Learning Helps Improve Short-Term Crime Prediction Accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning architectures enhanced with human mobility data have been shown to improve the accuracy of short-term crime prediction models trained with historical crime data. However, human mobility data may be scarce in some regions, negatively impacting the correct training of these models. To address this issue, we propose a novel transfer learning framework for short-term crime prediction models, whereby weights from the deep learning crime prediction models trained in source regions with plenty of mobility data are transferred to target regions to fine-tune their local crime prediction models and improve crime prediction accuracy. Our results show that the proposed transfer learning framework improves the F1 scores for target cities with mobility data scarcity, especially when the number of months of available mobility data is small. We also show that the F1 score improvements are pervasive across different types of crimes and diverse cities in the US.</description>

      <title>Controlling Counterfactual Harm in Decision Support Systems Based on Prediction Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decision support systems based on prediction sets help humans solve multiclass classification tasks by narrowing down the set of potential label values to a subset of them, namely a prediction set, and asking them to always predict label values from the prediction sets. While this type of systems have been proven to be effective at improving the average accuracy of the predictions made by humans, by restricting human agency, they may cause harm$\unicode{x2014}$a human who has succeeded at predicting the ground-truth label of an instance on their own may have failed had they used these systems. In this paper, our goal is to control how frequently a decision support system based on prediction sets may cause harm, by design. To this end, we start by characterizing the above notion of harm using the theoretical framework of structural causal models. Then, we show that, under a natural, albeit unverifiable, monotonicity assumption, we can estimate how frequently a system may cause harm using only predictions made by humans on their own. Further, we also show that, under a weaker monotonicity assumption, which can be verified experimentally, we can bound how frequently a system may cause harm again using only predictions made by humans on their own. Building upon these assumptions, we introduce a computational framework to design decision support systems based on prediction sets that are guaranteed to cause harm less frequently than a user-specified value using conformal risk control. We validate our framework using real human predictions from two different human subject studies and show that, in decision support systems based on prediction sets, there is a trade-off between accuracy and counterfactual harm.</description>

      <title>Long-Term Fairness Inquiries and Pursuits in Machine Learning: A Survey of Notions, Methods, and Challenges</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The widespread integration of Machine Learning systems in daily life, particularly in high-stakes domains, has raised concerns about the fairness implications. While prior works have investigated static fairness measures, recent studies reveal that automated decision-making has long-term implications and that off-the-shelf fairness approaches may not serve the purpose of achieving long-term fairness. Additionally, the existence of feedback loops and the interaction between models and the environment introduces additional complexities that may deviate from the initial fairness goals. In this survey, we review existing literature on long-term fairness from different perspectives and present a taxonomy for long-term fairness studies. We highlight key challenges and consider future research directions, analyzing both current issues and potential further explorations.</description>

      <title>Turning the Tide on Dark Pools? Towards Multi-Stakeholder Vulnerability Notifications in the Ad-Tech Supply Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Online advertising relies on a complex and opaque supply chain that involves multiple stakeholders, including advertisers, publishers, and ad-networks, each with distinct and sometimes conflicting incentives. Recent research has demonstrated the existence of ad-tech supply chain vulnerabilities such as dark pooling, where low-quality publishers bundle their ad inventory with higher-quality ones to mislead advertisers. We investigate the effectiveness of vulnerability notification campaigns aimed at mitigating dark pooling. Prior research on vulnerability notifications has primarily focused on single-stakeholder scenarios, and it is unclear whether vulnerability notifications can be effective in the multi-stakeholder ad-tech supply chain. We implement an automated vulnerability notification pipeline to systematically evaluate the responsiveness of various stakeholders, including publishers, ad-networks, and advertisers to vulnerability notifications by academics and activists. Our nine-month long multi-stakeholder notification study shows that notifications are an effective method for reducing dark pooling vulnerabilities in the online advertising ecosystem, especially when targeted towards ad-networks. Further, the sender reputation does not impact responses to notifications from activists and academics in a statistically different way. In addition to being the first notification study targeting the online advertising ecosystem, we are also the first to study multi-stakeholder context in vulnerability notifications.</description>

      <title>Delving into ChatGPT usage in academic writing through excess vocabulary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent large language models (LLMs) can generate and revise text with human-level performance, and have been widely commercialized in systems like ChatGPT. These models come with clear limitations: they can produce inaccurate information, reinforce existing biases, and be easily misused. Yet, many scientists have been using them to assist their scholarly writing. How wide-spread is LLM usage in the academic literature currently? To answer this question, we use an unbiased, large-scale approach, free from any assumptions on academic LLM usage. We study vocabulary changes in 14 million PubMed abstracts from 2010-2024, and show how the appearance of LLMs led to an abrupt increase in the frequency of certain style words. Our analysis based on excess words usage suggests that at least 10% of 2024 abstracts were processed with LLMs. This lower bound differed across disciplines, countries, and journals, and was as high as 30% for some PubMed sub-corpora. We show that the appearance of LLM-based writing assistants has had an unprecedented impact in the scientific literature, surpassing the effect of major world events such as the Covid pandemic.</description>

Abstract: This study employs cutting-edge wearable monitoring technology to conduct high-precision, high-temporal-resolution cognitive load assessment on EEG data from the FP1 channel and heart rate variability (HRV) data of secondary vocational students(SVS). By jointly analyzing these two critical physiological indicators, the research delves into their application value in assessing cognitive load among SVS students and their utility across various tasks. The study designed two experiments to validate the efficacy of the proposed approach: Initially, a random forest classification model, developed using the N-BACK task, enabled the precise decoding of physiological signal characteristics in SVS students under different levels of cognitive load, achieving a classification accuracy of 97%. Subsequently, this classification model was applied in a cross-task experiment involving the National Computer Rank Examination, demonstrating the method's significant applicability and cross-task transferability in diverse learning contexts. Conducted with high portability, this research holds substantial theoretical and practical significance for optimizing teaching resource allocation in secondary vocational education, as well as for cognitive load assessment methods and monitoring. Currently, the research findings are undergoing trial implementation in the school.</description>

      <title>Toxic Memes: A Survey of Computational Perspectives on the Detection and Explanation of Meme Toxicities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Internet memes, channels for humor, social commentary, and cultural expression, are increasingly used to spread toxic messages. Studies on the computational analyses of toxic memes have significantly grown over the past five years, and the only three surveys on computational toxic meme analysis cover only work published until 2022, leading to inconsistent terminology and unexplored trends. Our work fills this gap by surveying content-based computational perspectives on toxic memes, and reviewing key developments until early 2024. Employing the PRISMA methodology, we systematically extend the previously considered papers, achieving a threefold result. First, we survey 119 new papers, analyzing 158 computational works focused on content-based toxic meme analysis. We identify over 30 datasets used in toxic meme analysis and examine their labeling systems. Second, after observing the existence of unclear definitions of meme toxicity in computational works, we introduce a new taxonomy for categorizing meme toxicity types. We also note an expansion in computational tasks beyond the simple binary classification of memes as toxic or non-toxic, indicating a shift towards achieving a nuanced comprehension of toxicity. Third, we identify three content-based dimensions of meme toxicity under automatic study: target, intent, and conveyance tactics. We develop a framework illustrating the relationships between these dimensions and meme toxicities. The survey analyzes key challenges and recent trends, such as enhanced cross-modal reasoning, integrating expert and cultural knowledge, the demand for automatic toxicity explanations, and handling meme toxicity in low-resource languages. Also, it notes the rising use of Large Language Models (LLMs) and generative AI for detecting and generating toxic memes. Finally, it proposes pathways for advancing toxic meme detection and interpretation.</description>

      <title>AI Sandbagging: Language Models can Strategically Underperform on Evaluations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07358v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Trustworthy capability evaluations are crucial for ensuring the safety of AI systems, and are becoming a key component of AI regulation. However, the developers of an AI system, or the AI system itself, may have incentives for evaluations to understate the AI's actual capability. These conflicting interests lead to the problem of sandbagging $\unicode{x2013}$ which we define as "strategic underperformance on an evaluation". In this paper we assess sandbagging capabilities in contemporary language models (LMs). We prompt frontier LMs, like GPT-4 and Claude 3 Opus, to selectively underperform on dangerous capability evaluations, while maintaining performance on general (harmless) capability evaluations. Moreover, we find that models can be fine-tuned, on a synthetic dataset, to hide specific capabilities unless given a password. This behaviour generalizes to high-quality, held-out benchmarks such as WMDP. In addition, we show that both frontier and smaller models can be prompted, or password-locked, to target specific scores on a capability evaluation. Even more, we found that a capable password-locked model (Llama 3 70b) is reasonably able to emulate a less capable model (Llama 2 7b). Overall, our results suggest that capability evaluations are vulnerable to sandbagging. This vulnerability decreases the trustworthiness of evaluations, and thereby undermines important safety decisions regarding the development and deployment of advanced AI systems.</description>

      <title>Comparing Deep Learning Models for Rice Mapping in Bhutan Using High Resolution Satellite Imagery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Bhutanese government is increasing its utilization of technological approaches such as including Remote Sensing-based knowledge in their decision-making process. This study focuses on crop type and crop extent in Paro, one of the top rice-yielding districts in Bhutan, and employs publicly available NICFI high-resolution satellite imagery from Planet. Two Deep Learning (DL) approaches, point-based (DNN) and patch-based (U-Net), models were used in conjunction with cloud-computing platforms. Three different models per DL approaches (DNN and U-Net) were trained: 1) RGBN channels from Planet; 2) RGBN and elevation data (RGBNE); 3) RGBN and Sentinel-1 (S1) data (RGBNS), and RGBN with E and S1 data (RGBNES). From this comprehensive analysis, the U-Net displayed higher performance metrics across both model training and model validation efforts. Among the U-Net model sets, the RGBN, RGBNE, RGBNS, and RGBNES models had an F1-score of 0.8546, 0.8563, 0.8467, and 0.8500 respectively. An independent model evaluation was performed and found a high level of performance variation across all the metrics. For this independent model evaluation, the U-Net RGBN, RGBNE, RGBNES, and RGBN models displayed the F1-scores of 0.5935, 0.6154, 0.5882, and 0.6582, suggesting U-Net RGBNES as the best model. The study shows that the DL approaches can predict rice. Also, DL methods can be used with the survey-based approaches currently utilized by the Bhutan Department of Agriculture. Further, this study demonstrated the usage of regional land cover products such as SERVIR's RLCMS as a weak label approach to capture different strata addressing the class imbalance problem and improving the sampling design for DL application. Finally, through preliminary model testing and comparisons outlined it was shown that using additional features such as NDVI, EVI, and NDWI did not drastically improve model performance.</description>

Abstract: The perception that the convergence of biological engineering and artificial intelligence (AI) could enable increased biorisk has recently drawn attention to the governance of biotechnology and artificial intelligence. The 2023 Executive Order, Executive Order on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence, requires an assessment of how artificial intelligence can increase biorisk. Within this perspective, quantitative and qualitative frameworks for evaluating biorisk are presented. Both frameworks are exercised using notional scenarios and their benefits and limitations are then discussed. Finally, the perspective concludes by noting that assessment and evaluation methodologies must keep pace with advances of AI in the life sciences.</description>

      <title>Investigation of the effectiveness of applying ChatGPT in Dialogic Teaching Using Electroencephalography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16687v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology, especially the emergence of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, has presented significant prospects for application in the field of education. LLMs possess the capability to interpret knowledge, answer questions, and consider context, thus providing support for dialogic teaching to students. Therefore, an examination of the capacity of LLMs to effectively fulfill instructional roles, thereby facilitating student learning akin to human educators within dialogic teaching scenarios, is an exceptionally valuable research topic. This research recruited 34 undergraduate students as participants, who were randomly divided into two groups. The experimental group engaged in dialogic teaching using ChatGPT, while the control group interacted with human teachers. Both groups learned the histogram equalization unit in the information-related course "Digital Image Processing". The research findings show comparable scores between the two groups on the retention test. However, students who engaged in dialogue with ChatGPT exhibited lower performance on the transfer test. Electroencephalography data revealed that students who interacted with ChatGPT exhibited higher levels of cognitive activity, suggesting that ChatGPT could help students establish a knowledge foundation and stimulate cognitive activity. However, its strengths on promoting students. knowledge application and creativity were insignificant. Based upon the research findings, it is evident that ChatGPT cannot fully excel in fulfilling teaching tasks in the dialogue teaching in information related courses. Combining ChatGPT with traditional human teachers might be a more ideal approach. The synergistic use of both can provide students with more comprehensive learning support, thus contributing to enhancing the quality of teaching.</description>

      <title>Towards Algorithmic Fairness by means of Instance-level Data Re-weighting based on Shapley Values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.01928v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Algorithmic fairness is of utmost societal importance, yet state-of-the-art large-scale machine learning models require training with massive datasets that are frequently biased. In this context, pre-processing methods that focus on modeling and correcting bias in the data emerge as valuable approaches. In this paper, we propose FairShap, a novel instance-level data re-weighting method for fair algorithmic decision-making through data valuation by means of Shapley Values. FairShap is model-agnostic and easily interpretable. It measures the contribution of each training data point to a predefined fairness metric. We empirically validate FairShap on several state-of-the-art datasets of different nature, with a variety of training scenarios and machine learning models and show how it yields fairer models with similar levels of accuracy than the baselines. We illustrate FairShap's interpretability by means of histograms and latent space visualizations. Moreover, we perform a utility-fairness study and analyze FairShap's computational cost depending on the size of the dataset and the number of features. We believe that FairShap represents a novel contribution in interpretable and model-agnostic approaches to algorithmic fairness that yields competitive accuracy even when only biased training datasets are available.</description>

      <title>FFB: A Fair Fairness Benchmark for In-Processing Group Fairness Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.09468v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the Fair Fairness Benchmark (\textsf{FFB}), a benchmarking framework for in-processing group fairness methods. Ensuring fairness in machine learning is important for ethical compliance. However, there exist challenges in comparing and developing fairness methods due to inconsistencies in experimental settings, lack of accessible algorithmic implementations, and limited extensibility of current fairness packages and tools. To address these issues, we introduce an open-source standardized benchmark for evaluating in-processing group fairness methods and provide a comprehensive analysis of state-of-the-art methods to ensure different notions of group fairness. This work offers the following key contributions: the provision of flexible, extensible, minimalistic, and research-oriented open-source code; the establishment of unified fairness method benchmarking pipelines; and extensive benchmarking, which yields key insights from $\mathbf{45,079}$ experiments, $\mathbf{14,428}$ GPU hours. We believe that our work will significantly facilitate the growth and development of the fairness research community.</description>

Abstract: Educational Data Mining (EDM) has emerged as a vital field of research, which harnesses the power of computational techniques to analyze educational data. With the increasing complexity and diversity of educational data, Deep Learning techniques have shown significant advantages in addressing the challenges associated with analyzing and modeling this data. This survey aims to systematically review the state-of-the-art in EDM with Deep Learning. We begin by providing a brief introduction to EDM and Deep Learning, highlighting their relevance in the context of modern education. Next, we present a detailed review of Deep Learning techniques applied in four typical educational scenarios, including knowledge tracing, student behavior detection, performance prediction, and personalized recommendation. Furthermore, a comprehensive overview of public datasets and processing tools for EDM is provided. We then analyze the practical challenges in EDM and propose targeted solutions. Finally, we point out emerging trends and future directions in this research area.</description>

      <title>Post-hoc Orthogonalization for Mitigation of Protected Feature Bias in CXR Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01349v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Purpose: To analyze and remove protected feature effects in chest radiograph embeddings of deep learning models. Methods: An orthogonalization is utilized to remove the influence of protected features (e.g., age, sex, race) in CXR embeddings, ensuring feature-independent results. To validate the efficacy of the approach, we retrospectively study the MIMIC and CheXpert datasets using three pre-trained models, namely a supervised contrastive, a self-supervised contrastive, and a baseline classifier model. Our statistical analysis involves comparing the original versus the orthogonalized embeddings by estimating protected feature influences and evaluating the ability to predict race, age, or sex using the two types of embeddings. Results: Our experiments reveal a significant influence of protected features on predictions of pathologies. Applying orthogonalization removes these feature effects. Apart from removing any influence on pathology classification, while maintaining competitive predictive performance, orthogonalized embeddings further make it infeasible to directly predict protected attributes and mitigate subgroup disparities. Conclusion: The presented work demonstrates the successful application and evaluation of the orthogonalization technique in the domain of chest X-ray image classification.</description>

      <title>Do Llamas Work in English? On the Latent Language of Multilingual Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10588v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We ask whether multilingual language models trained on unbalanced, English-dominated corpora use English as an internal pivot language -- a question of key importance for understanding how language models function and the origins of linguistic bias. Focusing on the Llama-2 family of transformer models, our study uses carefully constructed non-English prompts with a unique correct single-token continuation. From layer to layer, transformers gradually map an input embedding of the final prompt token to an output embedding from which next-token probabilities are computed. Tracking intermediate embeddings through their high-dimensional space reveals three distinct phases, whereby intermediate embeddings (1) start far away from output token embeddings; (2) already allow for decoding a semantically correct next token in the middle layers, but give higher probability to its version in English than in the input language; (3) finally move into an input-language-specific region of the embedding space. We cast these results into a conceptual model where the three phases operate in "input space", "concept space", and "output space", respectively. Crucially, our evidence suggests that the abstract "concept space" lies closer to English than to other languages, which may have important consequences regarding the biases held by multilingual language models.</description>

      <title>From Complexity to Clarity: How AI Enhances Perceptions of Scientists and the Public's Understanding of Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00706v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper evaluated the effectiveness of using generative AI to simplify science communication and enhance the public's understanding of science. By comparing lay summaries of journal articles from PNAS, yoked to those generated by AI, this work first assessed linguistic simplicity across such summaries and public perceptions. Study 1a analyzed simplicity features of PNAS abstracts (scientific summaries) and significance statements (lay summaries), observing that lay summaries were indeed linguistically simpler, but effect size differences were small. Study 1b used a large language model, GPT-4, to create significance statements based on paper abstracts and this more than doubled the average effect size without fine-tuning. Study 2 experimentally demonstrated that simply-written GPT summaries facilitated more favorable perceptions of scientists (they were perceived as more credible and trustworthy, but less intelligent) than more complexly-written human PNAS summaries. Crucially, Study 3 experimentally demonstrated that participants comprehended scientific writing better after reading simple GPT summaries compared to complex PNAS summaries. In their own words, participants also summarized scientific papers in a more detailed and concrete manner after reading GPT summaries compared to PNAS summaries of the same article. AI has the potential to engage scientific communities and the public via a simple language heuristic, advocating for its integration into scientific dissemination for a more informed society.</description>

      <title>Unraveling overoptimism and publication bias in ML-driven science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14422v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) is increasingly used across many disciplines with impressive reported results across many domain areas. However, recent studies suggest that the published performance of ML models are often overoptimistic. Validity concerns are underscored by findings of an inverse relationship between sample size and reported accuracy in published ML models, contrasting with the theory of learning curves where accuracy should improve or remain stable with increasing sample size. This paper investigates factors contributing to overoptimistic accuracy reports in ML-driven science, focusing on data leakage and publication bias. We introduce a novel stochastic model for observed accuracy, integrating parametric learning curves and the aforementioned biases. We then construct an estimator that corrects for these biases in observed data. Theoretical and empirical results show that our framework can estimate the underlying learning curve, providing realistic performance assessments from published results. Applying the model to meta-analyses in ML-driven science, including neuroimaging-based and speech-based classifications of neurological conditions, we find prevalent overoptimism and estimate the inherent limits of ML-based prediction in each domain.</description>

      <title>#EpiTwitter: Public Health Messaging During the COVID-19 Pandemic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01866v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Effective communication during health crises is critical, with social media serving as a key platform for public health experts (PHEs) to engage with the public. However, it also amplifies pseudo-experts promoting contrarian views. Despite its importance, the role of emotional and moral language in PHEs' communication during COVID-19 remains under explored. This study examines how PHEs and pseudo-experts communicated on Twitter during the pandemic, focusing on emotional and moral language and their engagement with political elites. Analyzing tweets from 489 PHEs and 356 pseudo-experts from January 2020 to January 2021, alongside public responses, we identified key priorities and differences in messaging strategy. PHEs prioritize masking, healthcare, education, and vaccines, using positive emotional language like optimism. In contrast, pseudo-experts discuss therapeutics and lockdowns more frequently, employing negative emotions like pessimism and disgust. Negative emotional and moral language tends to drive engagement, but positive language from PHEs fosters positivity in public responses. PHEs exhibit liberal partisanship, expressing more positivity towards liberals and negativity towards conservative elites, while pseudo-experts show conservative partisanship. These findings shed light on the polarization of COVID-19 discourse and underscore the importance of strategic use of emotional and moral language by experts to mitigate polarization and enhance public trust.</description>

      <title>Deception Analysis with Artificial Intelligence: An Interdisciplinary Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05724v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Humans and machines interact more frequently than ever and our societies are becoming increasingly hybrid. A consequence of this hybridisation is the degradation of societal trust due to the prevalence of AI-enabled deception. Yet, despite our understanding of the role of trust in AI in the recent years, we still do not have a computational theory to be able to fully understand and explain the role deception plays in this context. This is a problem because while our ability to explain deception in hybrid societies is delayed, the design of AI agents may keep advancing towards fully autonomous deceptive machines, which would pose new challenges to dealing with deception. In this paper we build a timely and meaningful interdisciplinary perspective on deceptive AI and reinforce a 20 year old socio-cognitive perspective on trust and deception, by proposing the development of DAMAS -- a holistic Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) framework for the socio-cognitive modelling and analysis of deception. In a nutshell this paper covers the topic of modelling and explaining deception using AI approaches from the perspectives of Computer Science, Philosophy, Psychology, Ethics, and Intelligence Analysis.</description>
