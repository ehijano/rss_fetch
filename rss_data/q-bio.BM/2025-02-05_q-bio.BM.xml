      <title>Accurate Pocket Identification for Binding-Site-Agnostic Docking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate identification of druggable pockets is essential for structure-based drug design. However, most pocket-identification algorithms prioritize their geometric properties over downstream docking performance. To address this limitation, we developed RAPID-Net, a pocket-finding algorithm for seamless integration with docking workflows. When guiding AutoDock Vina, RAPID-Net outperforms DiffBindFR on the PoseBusters benchmark and enables blind docking on large proteins that AlphaFold 3 cannot process as a whole. Furthermore, RAPID-Net surpasses PUResNet and Kalasanty in docking accuracy and pocket-ligand intersection rates across diverse datasets, including PoseBusters, Astex Diverse Set, BU48, and Coach420. When accuracy is evaluated as ``at least one correct pose in the ensemble'', RAPID-Net outperforms AlphaFold 3 on the PoseBusters benchmark, suggesting that our approach can be further improved with a suitable pose reweighting tool offering a cost-effective and competitive alternative to AlphaFold 3 for docking. Finally, using several therapeutically relevant examples, we demonstrate the ability of RAPID-Net to identify remote functional sites, highlighting its potential to facilitate the development of innovative therapeutics.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Sparse Bayesian Multitask Model with Scalable Inference for Microbiome Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a hierarchical Bayesian multitask learning model that is applicable to the general multi-task binary classification learning problem where the model assumes a shared sparsity structure across different tasks. We derive a computationally efficient inference algorithm based on variational inference to approximate the posterior distribution. We demonstrate the potential of the new approach on various synthetic datasets and for predicting human health status based on microbiome profile. Our analysis incorporates data pooled from multiple microbiome studies, along with a comprehensive comparison with other benchmark methods. Results in synthetic datasets show that the proposed approach has superior support recovery property when the underlying regression coefficients share a common sparsity structure across different tasks. Our experiments on microbiome classification demonstrate the utility of the method in extracting informative taxa while providing well-calibrated predictions with uncertainty quantification and achieving competitive performance in terms of prediction metrics. Notably, despite the heterogeneity of the pooled datasets (e.g., different experimental objectives, laboratory setups, sequencing equipment, patient demographics), our method delivers robust results.</description>
