      <title>In-Network Collective Operations: Game Changer or Challenge for AI Workloads?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper summarizes the opportunities of in-network collective operations (INC) for accelerated collective operations in AI workloads. We provide sufficient detail to make this important field accessible to non-experts in AI or networking, fostering a connection between these communities. Consider two types of INC: Edge-INC, where the system is implemented at the node level, and Core-INC, where the system is embedded within network switches. We outline the potential performance benefits as well as six key obstacles in the context of both Edge-INC and Core-INC that may hinder their adoption. Finally, we present a set of predictions for the future development and application of INC.</description>

      <title>Non-Asymptotic Performance Analysis of DOA Estimation Based on Real-Valued Root-MUSIC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01999v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a systematic theoretical performance analysis of the Real-Valued root-MUSIC (RV-root-MUSIC) algorithm under non-asymptotic conditions. A well-known limitation of RV-root-MUSIC is the estimation ambiguity caused by mirror roots, which are typically suppressed using conventional beamforming (CBF). By leveraging the equivalent subspace constructed through the conjugate extension method and exploiting the equivalence of perturbations for true and mirror roots, this work provides a comprehensive study of three key aspects: noise subspace perturbation, true-root perturbation, and mirror-root perturbation. A statistical model is established, and generalized perturbation expressions are derived. Monte Carlo simulations confirm the correctness and effectiveness of the theoretical results. The analysis provides a rigorous foundation for parameter optimization in Direction-of-Arrival (DOA) estimation, with applications in radar, wireless communications, and intelligent sensing.</description>

      <title>Rule-Based Graph Programs Matching the Time Complexity of Imperative Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09144v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report on recent advances in rule-based graph programming, which allow us to match the time complexity of some fundamental imperative graph algorithms. In general, achieving the time complexity of graph algorithms implemented in conventional languages using a rule-based graph-transformation language is challenging due to the cost of graph matching. Previous work demonstrated that with rooted rules, certain algorithms can be implemented in the graph programming language GP 2 such that their runtime matches the time complexity of imperative implementations. However, this required input graphs to have a bounded node degree and (for some algorithms) to be connected. In this paper, we overcome these limitations by enhancing the graph data structure generated by the GP 2 compiler and exploiting the new structure in programs. We present three case studies: the first program checks whether input graphs are connected, the second program checks whether input graphs are acyclic, and the third program solves the single-source shortest-paths problem for graphs with integer edge-weights. The first two programs run in linear time on (possibly disconnected) input graphs with arbitrary node degrees. The third program runs in time $O(nm)$ on arbitrary input graphs, matching the time complexity of imperative implementations of the Bellman-Ford algorithm. For each program, we formally prove its correctness and time complexity, and provide runtime experiments on various graph classes.</description>

      <title>Agentic Plan Caching: Test-Time Memory for Fast and Cost-Efficient LLM Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14852v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: LLM-based agent applications have shown increasingly remarkable capabilities in complex workflows but incur substantial costs and latency due to extensive planning and reasoning requirements. Existing LLM caching techniques (like context caching and semantic caching), primarily designed for serving chatbots, are insufficient for agent applications where outputs depend on external data and environmental contexts. We propose Agentic Plan Caching (APC), a novel test-time memory that extracts, stores, adapts, and reuses structured plan templates from planning stages of agent applications across semantically similar tasks to reduce the cost and latency of serving. Unlike traditional semantic caching, our system extracts plan templates from completed agent executions at test-time, employs keyword extraction to match new requests against cached plans, and utilizes lightweight models to adapt these templates to task-specific plans with contexts. Evaluation across multiple real-world agent applications shows that our system can reduce costs by 50.31% and latency by 27.28% on average while maintaining performance, offering a more efficient solution for serving LLM-based agents that complements existing LLM serving infrastructures.</description>
