      <title>Relativistic Magnetohydrodynamic Simulations of Giant Magnetar Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gradual crustal deformation can generate strongly twisted magnetic fields around magnetars, potentially triggering giant flares with total energies exceeding $10^{44}\,\mathrm{erg}$. In this Letter, we present the first relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulation of a surface shear-driven magnetar eruption, capturing reconnection-driven plasma heating, the ejection of relativistically hot plasma, and the formation of a hot fireball confined within the inner magnetosphere. We find that magnetic reconnection in the equatorial current sheet launches a hot trailing outflow capable of powering the initial spike observed in giant flares, while simultaneously leaving behind a thermally stratified fireball with sufficient thermal energy to produce the pulsating, decaying tail. Together, these features provide a self-consistent physical framework for understanding the observed energetics of magnetar giant flares. The eruption also expels a magnetically dominated giant plasmoid carrying up to $\sim 9\%$ of the magnetosphere's total magnetic energy. Furthermore, our simulation demonstrates how the plasmoid drives the formation of a blast wave -- an important ingredient in models linking magnetar eruptions to fast radio bursts.</description>

      <title>Addressing the Impact of Solar Modulation Systematic Uncertainties on Cosmic-Ray Propagation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a comprehensive analysis of cosmic-ray propagation using the time-dependent AMS-02 flux measurements covering a full solar cycle, with particular emphasis on the role of solar modulation. We fit two representative Galactic propagation scenarios, convection- and re-acceleration-dominated models, in combination with three solar modulation prescriptions: the standard force-field approximation, an extended force-field model with a rigidity break, and the heliospheric propagation code $\texttt{HelMod}$. The inclusion of time-resolved antiproton data provides a unique probe of charge-sign-dependent modulation effects and low-energy systematics. We find that the force-field approximation can describe positively charged nuclei reasonably well outside the solar maximum in convection-dominated models, but fails during periods of high solar activity and for antiprotons at all times. In re-acceleration scenarios, strong degeneracies between solar modulation and low-energy propagation lead to unphysical results when simple modulation models are employed. Across all models, we identify systematic uncertainties of order 10-15% in the reconstructed local interstellar spectra and propagation parameters, driven by limitations in current solar modulation modelling. Compared to the percent level error of current measurements, these uncertainties significantly limit the precision of cosmic-ray studies. Future time-dependent measurements spanning a full 22-year solar cycle will be crucial to reduce these uncertainties.</description>

      <title>TROYE: Modeling Dynamic Phase Transitions in Gravitational Waves from Neutron Star-Black Hole Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Equation of State (EoS) of dense nuclear matter remains one of the most compelling open questions in high-energy astrophysics. While static EoS models are increasingly well-constrained by observations of binary neutron star (BNS) inspirals, the possibility of a dynamic phase transition occurring during the coalescence has been thus far deferred from standard gravitational-wave (GW) analyses. In this work, we investigate the detectability of such a phase transition, manifesting as a macroscopic shift in the tidal deformability parameter $\Lambda$, using GWs from Neutron Star-Black Hole (NSBH) coalescences. We argue that NSBH systems serve as a cleaner laboratory for this phenomenology than BNS systems due to the absence of the $\tilde{\Lambda}(\Lambda_1,\Lambda_2)$ degeneracy, allowing for the isolation of single-body tidal evolution. We introduce a phenomenological waveform model, TROYE (Transitional Representation Of varYing Equation-of-state), which stitches together two waveform approximants in the time domain to simulate a smooth but rapid transition between two equations of state during the late inspiral. We perform a comprehensive Bayesian injection and recovery campaign on 100 simulated events using the bilby inference library. Our results demonstrate that a phase transition corresponding to a tidal shift of $|\Delta\Lambda| \gtrsim 400$ is detectable with Advanced LIGO design sensitivity, yielding decisive statistical evidence ($\ln B &gt; 5$). We further identify a "V-shape" asymmetry in detectability, where "softening" transitions (decreasing $\Lambda$) are systematically easier to detect than "stiffening" ones due to the specific phase evolution of the tidal sector. Finally, we present "stress tests" showing that the transition remains recoverable even when marginalized over uncertainties in the stitching time and binary mass ratio.</description>

      <title>Updated Air-Shower $X_{\rm max}$ Moment Parametrizations for UHECR Composition with Latest Hadronic Interaction Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mass composition of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) is commonly inferred from the first two moments of the depth of shower maximum, $X_{\rm max}$, measured by fluorescence and hybrid detectors. Such analyses require fast and accurate mappings between the moments of $X_{\rm max}$ and those of the logarithmic mass, $\ln A$, based on realistic air-shower simulations. In this work we provide updated parametrizations of the $X_{\rm max}$ moments and distributions for air showers initiated by nuclei from proton to iron, simulated with CONEX for three state-of-the-art hadronic interaction models: Epos LHC-R, Sibyll 2.3e, and QGSJet-III-01. We parametrize the mean depth $\langle X_{\rm max}\rangle$ and the variance $\sigma^2(X_{\rm max})$ as functions of energy and mass. For the variance we compare a second-order polynomial model with an exponential model. In addition, we model the full $X_{\rm max}$ distributions with a three-parameter generalized Gumbel function. The Gumbel parameters are fitted using an unbinned likelihood and are validated by comparing the implied mean and variance with the raw CONEX samples and with the moment parametrizations. Across the full energy range considered, residuals between the parametrizations (or the Gumbel representation) and the simulations are at the level of a few g cm$^{-2}$ for the mean and a few (g cm$^{-2}$)$^2$ for the variance, making these parametrizations suitable for precision UHECR composition studies and forward-folding analyses of $X_{\rm max}$ distributions.</description>

      <title>A geometric physics-informed machine learning inference for the neutron star maximum mass and the inverse problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The existence of a distinct mass boundary between the heaviest neutron stars and the lightest black holes remains in question. It is an artefact of our ignorance of the properties of matter at supra-nuclear densities, which exist in the cores of neutron stars. The study addresses these problems with a physics-informed machine learning approach, guided by astrophysical observations. The Transformer model is trained on an agnostically generated ensemble of equations of state. Two geometric parameters are defined on the mass-radius sequence of a neutron star--the front bending and the back bending. The transformer provides a two-step solution: first, the model predicts the maximum mass and radius using the bending parameters. Second, it predicts the square of the sound speed profile, completing the inverse mapping. The prediction is that massive neutron stars form when the sound speed peaks at low density, leading to strong back-bending and an early phase transition to quark matter. Massive stars favour a stiff equation of state at low density, and the density of matter at the star's core is sufficiently small. The maximum mass for a neutron star predicted by the astrophysical constrained transformer model is $2.477$ solar masses, and a minimum radius of about $11.498$ km for a neutron star of $1.4$ solar masses.</description>

      <title>Numerical simulations of cold clumps in the hot accretion flows around black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous numerical simulations have shown that cold clumps can form within hot accretion flows, offering insights into the detailed processes of the state transition in black hole X-ray binaries. However, the evolution of the cold clumps has not been investigated in detail yet. In this paper, we conduct hydrodynamic simulations to investigate the evolution of the cold clumps. In addition to previous result that when the accretion rate is high enough the cold clumps emerge within the hot accretion flow, we found that instead of directly moving toward to the black hole, the clumps moves outward when they initially form. The reason should be the combination of viscous torque and the condensation of hot gas from larger radii, which lead to the slightly super-Keplerian angular momentum of the clumps. After reaching the equilibrium position, the clumps begin to fragment at the inner edge with each fragment moving inward sequentially. Generally, the azimuthal movement of the clumps are quasi-Keplerian, being closer to the outer detached Keplerian cold disk rather than the surrounding sub-Keplerian hot accretion flow, which agrees well with the semi-analytical results for weak coupling case in Wang et al. (2012).</description>

      <title>Chandra Proper Motions and Milliarcsecond Astrometry of Nineteen Pulsars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present X-ray proper motion (PM) measurements of 19 pulsars using new and archival data from the Chandra X-ray Observatory, including pulsar wind trails and X-ray filaments. Precise X-ray PMs are often limited by uncertainties in aligning observations to a common reference frame. Our analysis uses unresolved X-ray flux from stars in the Gaia catalog in addition to X-ray bright point sources for alignment, improving uncertainties. We obtain absolute positions referenced to Gaia with typical astrometric precision $\sim$10 mas and PM statistical uncertainties down to 1.3 mas yr$^{-1}$, the most precise X-ray PM achieved to date. With our improved frame alignment, PM accuracies are now limited by the pulsar flux in most cases. These results reveal a new X-ray filament and illuminate the wind nebula structures and origins of several of these pulsars.</description>

      <title>Teen TITANS simulations -- I. Inefficient intermediate-mass black hole seeding via stellar collisions in young massive clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Young massive clusters (YMCs) provide favorable environments for frequent stellar collisions, potentially leading to the formation of very massive stars (VMSs) and seeds of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs). We investigate the role of repeated stellar collisions in YMCs using TITANS, a new suite of 18 direct $N$-body simulations. Our models span cluster masses $10^5 - 10^6\,\rm M_\odot$, half-mass densities $\rho_{\rm h}=100 - 10^5\,\rm M_\odot\,pc^{-3}$, and include high primordial binary fractions, consistent with observations of massive stars in young clusters. Overall, our simulations assume cluster properties that are typical of YMCs in the low-redshift Universe. We find that repeated stellar collisions are efficient only in the densest clusters with short relaxation times and are absent in systems with $\rho_{\rm h}&lt;500\,\rm M_\odot\,pc^{-3}$ and $t_{\rm rh}&gt;1.3\,\rm Gyr$. Rapid mass segregation allows massive stars to sink to the cluster center, merge, and undergo subsequent collisions, even in clusters with long core-collapse times. However, collision chains are typically triggered by primordial binary mergers and usually involve only two collisions. In our simulations, only three VMSs form through repeated collisions and reach $m_*&gt;330\,\rm M_\odot$, while most VMSs have $m_*&lt;300\,\rm M_\odot$ and form through primordial binary mergers. None constitute viable IMBH seeds, as their helium cores fall in the (pulsational) pair-instability regime. We form five IMBHs from stellar collisions involving stars at different evolutionary stages, while the dominant channel is the merger of stellar-mass black holes, producing twelve IMBHs. For properties typical of local YMCs, stellar collision chains are therefore inefficient in producing IMBHs more massive than $140\,\rm M_\odot$, as most collisionally formed VMSs attain masses that fall in the pair-instability regime.</description>

      <title>GR-Athena++: Binary Neutron Star Merger Simulations with Neutrino Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present general-relativistic radiation magnetohydrodynamics simulations of binary neutron star mergers performed with GR-Athena++. Neutrino transport is treated using a moment-based, energy-integrated scheme (M1), augmented by neutrino number density evolution (N0). Our implementation is validated through an extensive suite of standard tests and demonstrated to perform robustly under adaptive mesh refinement. As a first application, we simulate the gravitational collapse of a uniformly rotating, magnetized neutron star, demonstrating stable radiation evolution through apparent-horizon formation using a novel excision technique based on the tapering of state vector evolution inside the horizon. To further test robustness in highly dynamic environments, we apply our code to two demanding binary neutron star merger scenarios. We investigate a long-lived remnant with the DD2 equation of state, evolved with full general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics and M1 neutrino transport. Following this, a gravitational collapse scenario with the SFHo equation of state is explored. We showcase long-term stable evolution on neutrino cooling time-scales, demonstrating robust handling of excision and stable evolution of the post-collapse accretion phase in three-dimensional mergers with magnetic fields and neutrino radiation.</description>

      <title>Constraining the $\Lambda\Lambda$ interaction with terrestrial and astronomical data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Terrestrial double-$\Lambda$ hypernuclear data and astronomical observations of neutron stars provide complementary constraints on the $\Lambda\Lambda$ interaction. In this work, we investigate the $\Lambda\Lambda$ interaction within a Skyrme energy density functional framework based on the KIDS (Korea-IBS-Daegu-SKKU) models. We employ a Skyrme-type $\Lambda\Lambda$ interaction that includes the standard $s$- and $p$-wave terms, as well as a density-dependent term that effectively represents an $N\Lambda\Lambda$ three-body force. The $s$-wave terms are constrained using data on double-$\Lambda$ hypernuclei supplemented by pseudodata obtained from core + $2\Lambda$ three-body model calculations including heavier hypernuclei. We show that the data on heavier systems are essential to simultaneously constrain the two $s$-wave parameters. We further explore the impact of the $p$-wave and $N\Lambda\Lambda$ components on the neutron-star properties and find that appropriate repulsive contributions of these terms yield consistency with current neutron-star mass-radius observations. These results indicate that the present framework provides phenomenologically acceptable equations of state for dense $(N,\Lambda)$ matter over a wide range of densities and highlight the importance of future experimental data on heavier double-$\Lambda$ hypernuclei.</description>

      <title>Detection prospects of solar $g$-modes with LISA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.18385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The possibility of detecting solar oscillation modes using space-based gravitational-wave detectors has been investigated in the context of gravitational-wave interferometry, with Polnarev \cite{Polnarev:2009xf} demonstrating that low-frequency solar modes could, in principle, produce detectable signals in a LISA-type interferometer. Motivated by this work, I revisit the problem using current solar models, updated detector sensitivities, and improved theoretical and observational constraints on mode amplitudes. In this study, I compute the gravitational response of solar oscillation modes using standard solar models generated with \texttt{MESA}, and mode eigenfrequencies and eigenfunctions calculated with \texttt{GYRE}. I focus primarily on solar $g$ modes, evaluating their responses for degree $l=2$ and azimuthal orders $m=0$ and $m=2$. The analysis incorporates both the earlier proposed and the current updated LISA sensitivity curves, and I perform a comparative assessment with the TianQin mission in the relevant low-frequency band. To assess the robustness of the predicted signals, I estimate the gravitational responses using two different standard solar models based on the GS98 and AGSS09 abundance compilations. I find that the resulting signal responses are nearly identical for the two models, indicating that uncertainties in solar metallicity have a negligible impact on the detectability of solar $g$ modes by space-based interferometers.</description>

      <title>A solution to the tension of burning on neutron stars and nuclear physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11966v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When neutron stars accrete matter from a companion star, this matter forms a disc around them and eventually falls on their surface. Here, the fuel can ignite into bright flashes called Type I bursts. Theoretical calculations based on state-of-the-art nuclear reactions are able to explain many features of the bursts. However, models predict that the bursts should cease at high accretion rates, whereas in many sources they disappear at much lower rates. Moreover, their recurrence times also show strong discrepancies with predictions. Although various solutions have been proposed, none can account for all the observational constraints. Here we describe a new model that explains all the contradictory behaviours within a single picture. We are able to reconstruct the conditions on the star surface that determine the burst properties by comparing data to new simulations. We find strong evidence that the physical mechanism driving the burst behaviour is the structure of the accretion disc in the regions closest to the star. This connection reconciles the puzzling burst phenomenology with nuclear physics and also opens a new window on the study of accretion processes around compact objects.</description>

      <title>$r$-process Heating Feedback on Disk Outflows from Neutron Star Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15288v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neutron star mergers produce $r$-process elements, with yields that are sensitive to the kinematic and thermodynamic properties of the ejecta. These ejecta properties are potentially affected by dynamically-important feedback from $r$-process heating, which is usually not coupled to the hydrodynamics in post-merger simulations modeling the ejecta launching and expansion. The multi-messenger detection of GW170817 showed the importance of producing reliable ejecta predictions, to maximize the diagnostic potential of future events. In this paper, we develop a prescription for including $r$-process heating as a source term in the hydrodynamic equations. This prescription depends on local fluid properties and on the $Y_{e}$ history as recorded by dedicated tracer particles, which exchange information with the grid using the Cloud-in-Cell method. The method is implemented in long-term viscous hydrodynamic simulations of accretion disk outflows to investigate its feedback on ejecta properties. We find that $r$-process heating can increase the unbound disk ejecta mass by $\sim 10\%$ relative to a baseline case that only considers alpha particle recombination. Nuclear heating also enhances the radial velocity of the ejecta with $Y_e &lt; 0.25$ by up to a factor of two, while concurrently suppressing marginally-bound convective ejecta.</description>

      <title>Ultra-high energy event KM3-230213A as a cosmogenic neutrino in light of minimal UHECR flux models</title>

Abstract: Recently, the KM3NeT experiment reported the detection of a neutrino with exceptionally high energy E = 220 PeV, whose origin remains unclear. The corresponding value of the neutrino flux is in tension with the results of other high-energy neutrino experiments. In this study, we discuss the possibility that this neutrino is cosmogenic, i. e., produced by ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECR) during their propagation through the intergalactic medium. We adopt the UHECR flux models derived by the Telescope Array experiment, which features a predominantly light mass composition. We show that the predictions of the cosmogenic neutrino flux in these models are consistent with the measurements of the KM3NeT-only and with that of the "global neutrino observatory" at approximately 2${\sigma}$ level. Notably, this result is achieved in a minimal version of the UHECR flux models, that assume one source population with a standard cosmological evolution. We also estimate the corresponding cosmogenic gamma-ray flux and show that it is consistent with Fermi-LAT IGRB measurements and UHE gamma-ray limits; the improvement of the latter can probe these predictions in future.</description>

      <title>Stochastic analysis of ultra-high energy cosmic ray interactions</title>

Abstract: Photonuclear interactions between ultra-high-energy cosmic ray (UHECR) nuclei and surrounding photon fields are key to understanding the connection between the compositions observed at Earth and those emitted from the sources. These interactions can completely disintegrate a nucleus of iron over trajectory lengths of a few and up to hundreds of megaparsecs, depending on the energy of the UHECR. The stochastic nature of these interactions means that it is not possible to describe them deterministically for a single cosmic ray, and an exact formulation of the probability distributions is not yet available. Current approaches describe these interactions using either Monte Carlo simulations or solving ordinary differential equations that neglect stochasticity. Because of the limitations of these approaches, only partial capture of the process is achieved. This paper presents an analytic probabilistic description of UHECR interactions and the resulting nuclear cascades, establishing their connection to Markov jump processes. The fundamental properties of these cascades are presented, as is the computation of the usual quantities of interest, such as the horizon, spectrum, and composition. The benefits of this description are outlined using astrophysical examples related to extragalactic propagation and UHECR sources.</description>

      <title>Ultra-long Gamma-ray Bursts from Micro-Tidal Disruption Events: The Case of GRB 250702B</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22779v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultra-long gamma-ray bursts (ULGRBs), a rare class of high-energy transients with durations $&gt;10^3$s, remain poorly understood. GRB 250702B is notable for its multi-hour prompt emission, an X-ray pre-peak emission starting $\sim$1 day earlier, off-nuclear host position, and hard, rapidly variable gamma-rays. This combination is difficult to explain with standard ULGRB progenitors such as blue-supergiant collapsars, magnetar engines, or white-dwarf tidal disruptions by intermediate-mass black holes. We interpret the event as a micro-tidal disruption event ($\mu$TDE), where a stellar-mass black hole or neutron star partially or fully disrupts a main-sequence star. Three $\mu$TDE pathways can reproduce the observed pre-peak emission to main flare delay: (i) a dynamical (partial/repeating) disruption, in which a grazing passage yields a faint precursor and the core returns after $\sim$day for a deeper encounter; (ii) a natal-kick disruption, where the delay reflects the ballistic motion of a newborn compact object relative to its companion, leading to full disruption; and (iii) a hybrid natal-kick + partial case, in which the kick seeds the close encounter but the first passage is only partial, with the core returning on the day-scale period. Cross-section scalings imply comparable rates for partial and full outcomes in both dynamical and natal-kick scenarios. The highly variable, hard $\gamma$-ray emission supports association with a stellar-mass compact object. Fallback and viscous accretion naturally explain the ultra-long duration, energetics, and ks-scale X-ray variability. We outline observational discriminants between the three channels and argue that $\mu$TDEs offer a compelling framework for ULGRBs such as GRB 250702B.</description>

      <title>Multigroup Radiation Diffusion on a Moving Mesh: Implementation in RICH and Application to Tidal Disruption Events</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.05120v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Radiation-hydrodynamics (RHD) determines the bulk evolution and observable emission in a wide variety of high-energy astrophysical phenomena. Due to their complexity, RHD problems must usually be studied through numerical simulation. We have extended the publicly available RICH code, which previously solved the equations of RHD in the limit of grey flux-limited diffusion (FLD), to operate with a multigroup FLD solver. RICH is a semi-Lagrangian code that solves the equations of RHD on an unstructured moving mesh, and is the first multigroup RHD moving mesh code, making it uniquely applicable to problems with extreme dynamic range and dynamically important radiation forces. We validate our multigroup module against multiple analytic benchmarks, including a novel test of the RHD Doppler term. The computational efficiency of the code is aided by a novel scheme to accelerate convergence in optically thick cells by limiting the absorption coefficients. Finally, we apply multigroup \textsc{rich} in a pilot three dimensional study of a stellar tidal disruption event (TDE), using a $10^4 M_\odot$ intermediate-mass black hole. Our simulations self-consistently produce a bright early-time X-ray flash prior to peak optical/UV light, in qualitative agreement with post-processing of (grey) RICH simulations of supermassive black hole TDEs, as well as X-ray observations of the TDE AT 2022dsb.</description>

      <title>Supermassive black holes swallow stellar objects at high rates: from Little Red Dots to Black Hole Stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.15929v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Supermassive black hole growth plausibly occurs via runaway astrophysical black hole mergers in nuclear star clusters that form intermediate mass black hole seeds at high redshifts. Such a model of Little Red Dots yields an order-of-magnitude higher rate of tidal disruption events than that of black hole captures. Our prediction, normalised to our proposed resolution of SMBH seeding, yields detectable TDE rates at high redshift. The resulting dense gas cocoons generate the nuclei of LRDs, each incorporating a central massive black-hole-star, with comparable masses in gas, stars, and massive black hole within a scale of around a parsec as inferred from the various spectral signatures.</description>

      <title>Gravitational-wave signatures of nonviolent nonlocality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13714v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Measurement of gravitational waves can provide precision tests of the nature of black holes and compact objects. In this work, we test Giddings' nonviolent nonlocality proposal, which posits that quantum information is transferred via a nonlocal interaction that generates metric perturbations around black holes. In contrast to firewalls, these quantum fluctuations would be spread out over a larger distance range -- up to a Schwarzschild radius away. In this letter, we model the modification to the gravitational waveform from nonviolent nonlocality. We modify the nonspinning EOBNRv2 effective one body waveform to include metric perturbations that are due to a random Gaussian process. We find that the waveform exhibits random deviations which are particularly important in the late inspiral-plunge phase. We find an optimal dephasing parameter for detecting this effect with a principal component analysis. This is particularly intriguing because it predicts random phase deviations across different gravitational wave events, providing theoretical support for hierarchical tests of general relativity. We estimate the constraint on the perturbations in nonviolent nonlocality with events for the LIGO-Virgo network and for a third-generation network.</description>

      <title>The dramatic transition of the extreme Red Supergiant WOH G64 to a Yellow Hypergiant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19329v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Red Supergiants (RSGs) are cool, evolved massive stars in their final evolutionary stage before exploding as a supernova. However, the evolution and fate of the most luminous RSGs remain uncertain. Observational evidence for luminous warm, post-RSG objects and the apparent lack of luminous RSGs as supernova progenitors suggest a blueward evolution. Since the 1980s, WOH G64 has been considered the most extreme RSG in the Large Magellanic Cloud, given its large obscuration, outstanding size, luminosity, and mass-loss rate. Here we report a sudden, yet smooth change in its apparent nature. Time-series photometry and subsequent spectroscopy revealed the most extreme transition ever seen in the optical spectral features of a RSG. We discovered that WOH G64 is a rare, massive symbiotic binary system where the RSG transitioned to a Yellow Hypergiant. The dramatic transition can be explained either by the partial ejection of the pseudo-atmosphere during a common-envelope phase, or the return to a quiescent state after an outstanding eruption exceeding 30 years. WOH G64 offers a unique opportunity to witness stellar evolution in real-time and assess the role of binarity on the final phases of massive stars and their resulting supernovae.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Ionization by Schwarzschild Primordial Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05935v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) are theorized to form from the collapse of overdensities in the very early Universe. PBHs in the asteroid-mass range $10^{17} \, {\rm g}\lesssim M \lesssim 10^{23} \, {\rm g}$ could serve as all or most of the dark matter today, but are particularly difficult to detect due to their modest rates of Hawking emission and sub-micron Schwarzschild radii. We consider whether the steep gradients of a PBH's gravitational field could generate tidal forces strong enough to disrupt atoms and nuclei. Such phenomena may yield new observables that could uniquely distinguish a PBH from a macroscopic object of the same mass. We first consider the gravitational ionization of ambient neutral hydrogen and evaluate prospects for detecting photon radiation from the recombination of ionized atoms. During the present epoch, this effect would be swamped by Hawking radiation -- which would itself be difficult to detect for PBHs at the upper end of the asteroid-mass window. We then consider the gravitational ionization and heating of neutral hydrogen immediately following recombination at $z\simeq1090$, and identify a broad class of PBH distributions with typical mass $5\times10^{21}\,{\rm g}\lesssim M \lesssim 10^{23}\, {\rm g}$ within which gravitational interactions would have been the dominant form of energy deposition to the medium. We also identify conditions under which tidal forces from a transiting PBH could overcome the strong nuclear force, either by dissociating deuterons, which would be relevant during big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN), or by inducing fission of heavy nuclei. We find that gravitational dissociation of deuterons dominates photodissociation rates due to Hawking radiation for PBHs with masses $10^{14}\,{\rm g}\lesssim M \lesssim 10^{16}\,{\rm g}$. We additionally identify the phenomenon of gravitationally induced fission of heavy nuclei via tidal deformation.</description>
