      <title>Data-driven discovery of thermal illusions through latent-space geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Illusion effects-where one object appears as another-arise from the non-uniqueness of physical systems, in which different material configurations yield identical external responses. Conventional approaches, such as coordinate transformation, map equivalent configurations but provide only specific solutions, while analytical or numerical optimization methods extend these designs by minimizing scattering yet remain constrained by model assumptions and computational cost. Here, we exploit this non-uniqueness through a data-driven framework that uses a variational autoencoder to compress high-dimensional thermal-field data into a compact latent space capturing geometrical relations between configurations and observations. In this latent space, thermal illusion corresponds to finding configurations that minimize geometric distance to a target configuration, with thermal cloaking as a special case where the target is free space. Specifically, we demonstrate the concept in a cylindrical shell with anisotropic thermal conductivities enclosing a core of arbitrary conductivity, achieving robust thermal illusion and cloaking using only positive conductivities. Such a latent-space distance approach provides a refreshed perspective for achieving illusion and can be applied to inverse-design problems in other classical wave systems.</description>

      <title>Wrinkle-Induced Hexagonal Boron Nitride Nanochannels for Biomolecule Localization and Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluorescence-based single-molecule localization, transport, and sensing require spatial confinement to extend the molecule's residence time during imaging, sufficient temporal resolution to capture fast dynamics, and efficient fluorescence background suppression. Two-dimensional (2D) materials offer large-area, atomically flat surfaces suitable for massively parallel in-plane biomolecule imaging, yet achieving guided motion in one-dimensional confinements using top-down nanofabrication remains challenging. Here, we demonstrate that thermally induced wrinkles in exfoliated hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) act as self-assembled nanochannels that enable biomolecule confinement and imaging under wide-field fluorescence microscopy. By controlling annealing parameters and substrate properties, we obtain scalable and reproducible wrinkle networks whose densities and morphologies can be tuned. Structural characterization using atomic force and scanning electron microscopy is complemented by fluorescence imaging and Kelvin probe force microscopy, confirming that aqueous solutions fill and remain stably retained within the nanochannels for periods exceeding 10 hours. We further achieve selective ATTO647N-DNA localization and imaging in the one-dimensional channels through the formation of a graphene/hBN vertical heterostructure. The graphene overlayer serves as a quenching mask that suppresses background fluorescence both from high-strain hBN regions and from DNA adsorbed on top of the 2D layer. Overall, these results provide a scalable, lithography-free route for creating planar nanofluidic confinements fully compatible with single-molecule imaging. This platform enables fundamental nanobiology studies as well as on-chip biomolecule transport and sensing applications.</description>

      <title>Microwave Cytometry with Machine Learning for Shape-Resolved Microplastic Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microplastics are increasingly recognized as a global environmental health threat, yet their detection and characterization remain constrained by the cost, form factor, and throughput of existing analytical tools. Portable micro/nanotechnology-based sensors are emerging to address this need, but most rely on the assumption of spherical particle geometry in their operating principle, limiting their relevance for environmental analysis. Here, we overcome this limitation by advancing microwave cytometry with machine learning-enabled shape recognition. Microwave cytometry is a flow-through electronic platform that integrates microwave resonator responses with low-frequency impedance signals to capture the dielectric signatures of individual particles. Using microscopy-derived shape measurements as ground truth, we trained a random forest model to decode these information-rich waveforms. Once trained, the system operates without optical input, enabling electronic-only determination of particle geometry. We demonstrate extraction of the major and minor axes of ellipsoidal microparticles with &lt;8% relative error on average and use these predictions to derive the dielectric permittivity of ellipsoid particles. This approach removes long-standing shape assumptions in microplastic sensing and establishes a pathway toward portable, high-throughput, morphology-aware detection technologies.</description>

      <title>Large-scale programmable phononic integrated circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electronic and photonic chips revolutionized information technology through massive integration of functional elements, yet phonons as fundamental information carriers in solids remain underestimated. Here, we demonstrate large-scale programmable phononic integrated circuits (PnICs) for complex signal processing. We developed a comprehensive library of gigahertz-frequency phononic building blocks that control acoustic wave propagation, polarization, and dispersion. Combining these elements, we demonstrate an ultra-compact 1$\times$128 on-chip acoustic power splitter with unprecedented integration density of 3,000/cm$^2$, a 21-port acoustic frequency demultiplexer with 3.8~MHz resolution, and a four-channel reconfigurable frequency synthesizer. This work establishes scalable phononic integration as the third pillar of information processing alongside electronics and photonics, enabling hybrid chips that combine all three domains for advanced signal processing and quantum information applications.</description>

      <title>Tailored heat treatments to characterise the fracture resistance of critical weld regions in hydrogen transmission pipelines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new protocol is presented to directly characterise the toughness of microstructural regions present within the weld heat-affected zone (HAZ), the most vulnerable location governing the structural integrity of hydrogen transport pipelines. Heat treatments are tailored to obtain bulk specimens that replicate predominantly ferritic-bainitic, bainitic, and martensitic microstructures present in the HAZ. These are applied to a range of pipeline steels to investigate the role of manufacturing era (vintage versus modern), chemical composition, and grade. The heat treatments successfully reproduce the hardness levels and microstructures observed in the HAZ of existing natural gas pipelines. Subsequently, fracture experiments are conducted in air and pure H2 at 100 bar, revealing a reduced fracture resistance and higher hydrogen embrittlement susceptibility of the HAZ microstructures, with initiation toughness values as low as 32 MPa$\sqrt{\text{m}}$. The findings emphasise the need to adequately consider the influence of microstructure and hard, brittle zones within the HAZ.</description>

      <title>Selective Parametric Amplification of Degenerate Modes in Electrostatically Transduced Coupled Beam Resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parametric excitation in coupled mechanical systems has enabled advances in sensing, computation, and phonon control. The function of distinct phase modes using parametric driving remains insufficiently explored. Here, we investigate the nonlinear and parametric response of degenerate phase modes in a Double Ended Tuning Fork (DETF) resonator. Our measurements reveal pronounced nonlinearity and parametric amplification in the out-phase mode, attributed to the dominant contribution of the coupling beam, while the in-phase mode remains predominantly linear. Uniquely, we demonstrate parametric excitation through the coupling spring, enabling selective amplification and de-amplification controlled via the relative phase between harmonic and parametric drives. A parametric gain of $\sim$13 dB is achieved in the out-phase mode, with phase-dependent modulation of amplification, indicating its suitability for signal processing, logic operations, and memory elements based on degenerate modes. These results establish a new approach to exploiting mode-specific nonlinear dynamics in coupled resonators for emerging applications in sensing and phononic control.</description>

      <title>Ensuring Outcome-Based Curriculum Coherence through Systematic CLO-PLO Alignment and Feedback Loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study proposes a quantitative framework to enhance curriculum coherence through the systematic alignment of Course Learning Outcomes (CLOs) and Program Learning Outcomes (PLOs), contributing to continuous improvement in outcome-based education. Grounded in accreditation standards such as ABET and NCAAA, the model introduces mathematical tools that map exercises, assessment questions, teaching units (TUs), and student assessment components (SACs) to CLOs and PLOs. This dual-layer approach-combining micro-level analysis of assessment elements with macro-level curriculum evaluation-enables detailed tracking of learning outcomes and helps identify misalignments between instructional delivery, assessment strategies, and program objectives. The framework incorporates alignment matrices, weighted relationships, and practical indicators to quantify coherence and evaluate course or program performance. Application of this model reveals gaps in outcome coverage and underscores the importance of realignment, especially when specific PLOs are underrepresented or CLOs are not adequately supported by assessments. The proposed model is practical, adaptable, and scalable, making it suitable for academic programs. Its systematic structure supports institutions in implementing evidence-based curriculum improvements and provides a reliable mechanism for aligning teaching practices with desired learning outcomes. Ultimately, this framework offers a valuable tool for closing the feedback loop between instructional design, assessment execution, and learning outcomes, thus promoting greater transparency, accountability, and educational effectiveness. Institutions that adopt this model can expect to strengthen their quality assurance processes and help ensure that students graduate with the competencies required by academic standards and professional expectations.</description>

      <title>Diamond quantum sensing at record high pressure up to 240 GPa</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum sensing utilizing nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond has emerged as a transformative technology for probing magnetic phase transition1-4, evidencing Meissner effect of superconductors1,5-9, and visualizing stress distribution3,9 under extreme conditions. Recent development in NV configurations and hydrostatic environments have raised the operational pressures of NV centers to 140 GPa2,6,10,11, but substantial challenges remain in extending sensing capabilities into multi-megabar range, critical for research in hydrogen-rich superconductors like La-Sc-H ($T_{\text{c}}$ of 271-298 K at 195-266 GPa)12 and evolution of minerals near Earth's core13. Here we report the fabrication of shallow NV centers through ion implantation followed by high-pressure and high-temperature (HPHT) annealing, leading to increased density, improved coherence, and mitigated internal stresses, a pre-requisite for reducing their degradation under compression. This NV magnetometry enable breakthrough of pressure capabilities exceeding 240 GPa, constrained by structural integrity of the 50 um diamond anvils, suggesting that the untapped pressure limit may enable further advancements with smaller cutlets or more robust diamonds. We present compelling evidence of the Meissner effect and trapped flux at record-high pressure of 180 GPa for superconducting transition in elemental titanium (Ti) as benchmark, establishing a solid foundation for high-pressure magnetometry in exploring complex quantum phenomena at previously unreachable pressures.</description>

      <title>A Simple Method for More Precise Pulse-Height Fitting in Sparsely Sampled Data Using Pulse-Shape-Archetype Information, Especially Suited to Ultra-Short-Laser Pulsetrains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08101v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel pulse-reconstruction method well suited to sparsely sampled repetitive data, such as commonly arise from trains of ultrashort laser-pulses. Typically waveforms in such traces are fully instrument-limited by the detecting systems, for instance, the combination of detector and oscilloscope, and only the energy of each waveform is sought. The method applies whenever shape of the waveform is the same for every pulse and can be well-characterized, with only amplitude and relative peak-timing changing. Under such conditions this information, known in advance, can be used as a basis - an archetype - for very accurate pulse fitting. Our characterizations show that the method very accurately extracts pulse heights and relative pulse timing, even when sampling routinely misses the pulse peak, and entirely misses the rising or falling edge. We show this method to be adaptable in different detection systems, showing significant improvement in accuracy of measurement, in this class of problem.</description>

      <title>Magnetic levitation by rotation described by a new type of Levitron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23268v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, a novel magnetic levitation phenomenon involving two magnetically equivalent neodymium permanent magnets has been reported. In this work, we propose that this system functions as a scaled-up analog of the Levitron. The key distinction is that the ratio $m_/\mu_f$ becomes a function of the lateral displacement $\delta_R$, and magnetic trapping no longer depends on the rotational speed of the levitating body as in a conventional Levitron. Furthermore, we demonstrate that stable trapping occurs when a specific constraint on the $\delta_R$ parameter is satisfied, ensuring that the potential energy reaches a minimum at the equilibrium point.</description>

      <title>Brightify: A tool for calculating directionally-resolved brightness in neutron sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22431v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Brightness is a critical metric for optimizing the design of neutron sources and beamlines, yet there is no direct way to calculate brightness within most Monte Carlo packages used for neutron source simulation. In this paper, we present Brightify, an open-source Python-based tool designed to calculate brightness from Monte Carlo Particle List (MCPL) files, which can be extracted from several Monte Carlo simulation packages. Brightify provides an efficient computational approach to calculate brightness for any particle type and energy spectrum recorded in the MCPL file. It enables localized, directionally-resolved brightness evaluations by scanning across both spatial and angular domains, facilitating the identification of positions and directions corresponding to maximum brightness. This functionality is particularly valuable for identifying brightness hotspots and helping fine-tune the design of neutron sources for optimal performance. We validate Brightify against standard methods, such as surface current tally and point estimator tally, and demonstrate its accuracy and adaptability, particularly in high-resolution analyses. By overcoming the limitations of traditional methods, Brightify streamlines neutron source re-optimization, reduces computational burden, and accelerates source development workflows. The full code is available on the Brightify GitHub repository.</description>
