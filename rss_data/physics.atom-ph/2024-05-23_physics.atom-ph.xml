      <title>High-precision, reference-free measurements of 2p $\rightarrow$ 1s transitions in boron-like sulfur and argon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have measured several 2p $\rightarrow$ 1s transition energies in core-excited boron-like ions of sulfur and argon. The measurements are reference-free, with an accuracy of a few parts per million. The x-rays were produced by the plasma of a an electron-cyclotron resonance ion source and were measured by a double-crystal x-ray spectrometer. The precision obtained for the measured 1s2s22p2 J -- 1s2 2s2 2p J ' lines is $\approx$4 ppm for sulfur and $\approx$2 ppm for argon. The line energies are compared to relativistic atomic structure calculations performed with the mdfgme multi-configuration Dirac-Fock code. This comparison is used for line identification and test the theoretical methods, which reach an agreement with experimental data up to 15 meV. The theoretical calculations have been extended to C+, Si9+, Cr19+ and Fe21+, which were the only B-like ions where such transitions were measured up to now.</description>

      <title>Tracking Chirality in Photoelectron Circular Dichroism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photoelectron circular dichroism (PECD) originates from the interplay between a molecule's chiral nuclear scaffold and a circularly polarized ionizing laser field. It is one of the most sensitive characterization techniques for the chirality of molecules in the gas phase. However, due to the complexity of the observable, it is generally difficult to predict and track how and when the chirality of the molecule is imprinted onto the photoelectron. Here, we present simulations of PECD for single-photon ionization in a hydrogenic single-electron model with an artificial chiral potential. This framework allows us to systematically tune the system's chirality and characterize the emergence of PECD. To this end, we propose chirality measures for potentials and wave functions to establish a quantitative connection with the resulting anisotropy in the photelectron distribution. We show that these chirality measures are suitable indicators for chirality in our model, paving the way for tracking the evolution of chirality from the nuclear scaffold to the final observable.</description>

      <title>Fano line shape metamorphosis in resonant two-photon ionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-photon atomic ionization driven by time-locked XUV and IR pulses allows to study dynamics of Fano resonances in time and energy domains. Different time evolution of the two interfering pathways leading to a Fano resonance can be exploited to turn the Fano profile of the two-photon XUV/IR ionization into a symmetric Gaussian once the directly ejected photoelectron leaves the parent ion and cannot any longer absorb an IR photon. This line shape transformation allows for the direct determination of the resonant lifetime from the spectroscopic measurements without need for an extremely fine energy resolution. Ubiquitous nature of Fano resonances makes this determination a universal tool in diverse quantum systems ranging from nuclei to nano-fabricated solids.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Four-Wave Mixing in Rydberg Atoms for Microwave-Optical Conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a numerical and analytical investigation of microwave-to-optical conversion based on four-wave mixing in Rydberg atoms. Our work demonstrates that both all-resonant and off-resonant frequency-mixing configurations achieve near-unit photon conversion efficiencies. We review the conditions that can lead to the presence of two possible dark states. We find that for both configurations, one of the dark states can be detrimental at high microwave powers, and show that an additional limitation to all-resonant frequency mixing is microwave-induced fluorescence. Finally, we confirm that the off-resonant configuration is more appropriate as it allows for efficient photon conversion on a wider range of input microwave intensities with reduced total power of the auxiliary fields.</description>

      <title>A frequency shift compensation method for light shift and vapor-cell temperature shift in atomic clocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light shift and vapor-cell temperature shift are the two most significant factors dominating the long-term instability of compact atomic clocks. Due to the different physical mechanisms, there is not yet a solution that can effectively suppress the frequency shifts induced by these two effects. Here, we propose a 'resonance-offset' locking approach that compensates for the two physical frequency shifts. In this approach, the additional offset locking shift can effectively counteract the atomic resonance shifts arising from changes in vapor-cell temperature and light power, reducing the net impact on the clock's frequency to nearly zero. We have demonstrated this strategy on the 778 nm Rubidium two-photon optical frequency standard, successfully compensating for light shift and cell-temperature shift, respectively. This general method is particularly appealing for compact vapor-cell microwave and optical atomic clocks designed for the excellent stability rather than accuracy.</description>

      <title>Ultra-cold atoms quantum tunneling through single and double optical barriers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We realize textbook experiments on Bose-Einstein condensate tunnelling through thin repulsive potential barriers. In particular, we demonstrate atom tunnelling though a single optical barrier in the quantum scattering regime where the De Broglie wavelength of the atoms is larger than the barrier width. Such a beam splitter can be used for atom interferometry and we study the case of two barriers creating an atomic Fabry-P{\'e}rot cavity. Technically, the velocity of the atoms is reduced thanks to the use of a 39K Bose-Einstein condensate with no interactions. The potential barriers are created optically and their width is tunable thanks to the use of a digital micro-mirror device. In addition, our scattering experiments enable in-situ characterization of the optical aberrations of the barrier optical system.</description>

      <title>Stabilizing classical accelerometers and gyroscopes with a quantum inertial sensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate measurement of inertial quantities is essential in geophysics, geodesy, fundamental physics and navigation. For instance, inertial navigation systems require stable inertial sensors to compute the position and attitude of the carrier. Here, we present the first hybridized cold-atom inertial sensor based on matter wave interferometry where the atomic measurements are used to correct the drift and bias of both an accelerometer and a gyroscope at the same time. We achieve respective bias stabilities of $7 \times 10^{-7}$ m/s$^2$ and $4 \times 10^{-7}$ rad/s after two days of integration, corresponding to a 100-fold and 3-fold increase on the stability of the hybridized sensor compared to the force-balanced accelerometer and Coriolis vibrating gyroscope operated alone. The instrument has been operated under up to 100-times the Earth rotation rate. Compared to state-of-the-art atomic gyroscope, the simplicity and scalability of our architecture make it easily extendable to a compact full six-axis inertial measurement unit, providing a pathway towards autonomous positioning and orientation using cold-atom sensors.</description>

      <title>Generalized Einstein Relations between Absorption and Emission Spectra at Thermodynamic Equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Einstein coefficient spectra and a detailed-balance derivation of generalized Einstein relations between them that is based on the connection between spontaneous and stimulated emission. If two broadened levels or bands overlap in energy, transitions between them need not be purely absorptive or emissive. Consequently, spontaneous emission can occur in both transition directions, and four Einstein coefficient spectra replace the three Einstein coefficients for a line. At equilibrium, the four different spectra obey five pairwise relationships and one lineshape generates all four. These relationships are independent of molecular quantum statistics and predict the Stokes' shift between forward and reverse transitions required by equilibrium with blackbody radiation. For Boltzmann statistics, the relative strengths of forward and reverse transitions depend on the formal chemical potential difference between the initial and final bands, which becomes the standard chemical potential difference for ideal solutes. The formal chemical potential of a band replaces both the energy and degeneracy of a quantum level. Like the energies of quantum levels, the formal chemical potentials of bands obey the Rydberg-Ritz combination principle. Each stimulated Einstein coefficient spectrum gives a frequency-dependent transition cross section. Transition cross sections obey causality and a detailed-balance condition with spontaneous emission, but do not directly obey generalized Einstein relations. Even with an energetic width much less than the photon energy, an absorptive forward transition with an energetic width much greater than the thermal energy can have such an extreme Stokes' shift that its reverse transition cross section becomes predominantly absorptive rather than emissive.</description>

      <title>Extension of the SpK Atomic Physics Code to Generate Global Equation of State Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Global microphysics models are required for the modelling of high-energy-density physics (HEDP) experiments, the improvement of which are critical to the path to inertial fusion energy. This work presents further developments to the atomic and microphysics code, SpK, part of the numerical modelling suite of Imperial College London and First Light Fusion. We extend the capabilities of SpK to allow the calculation of the equation of state (EoS). The detailed configuration accounting calculations are interpolated into finite-temperature Thomas-Fermi calculations at high coupling to form the electronic component of the model. The Cowan model provides the ionic contribution, modified to approximate the physics of diatomic molecular dissociation. By utilising bonding corrections and performing a Maxwell construction, SpK captures the EoS from states ranging from the zero-pressure solid, through the liquid-vapour coexistence region and into plasma states. This global approach offers the benefit of capturing electronic shell structure over large regions of parameter space, building highly-resolved tables in minutes on a simple desktop. We present shock Hugoniot and off-Hugoniot calculations for a number of materials, comparing SpK to other models and experimental data. We also apply EoS and opacity data generated by SpK in integrated simulations of indirectly-driven capsule implosions, highlighting physical sensitivities to the choice of EoS models.</description>

      <title>Full spectroscopic model and trihybrid experimental-perturbative-variational line list for NH</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Imidogen (NH) is a reactive molecule whose presence in astrochemical environments is of interest due to its role in the formation of nitrogen-containing molecules and as a potential probe of nitrogen abundance. Spectroscopic NH monitoring is useful for Earth-based combustion and photolysis processes of ammonia and other nitrogen-containing species. NH is also relevant to ultracold molecular physics and plasma studies. To enable these diverse applications, high-quality molecular spectroscopic data is required. Here, a new line list with significant advantages over existing data is presented. Most notably, this line list models isotopologue spectroscopy and forbidden transitions (important for NH visible absorption), alongside some overall improvements to accuracy and completeness. This approach takes advantage of existing experimental data (from a previous MARVEL compilation) and perturbative line lists together with new MRCI ab initio electronic data. These are used to produce a novel variational spectroscopic model and trihybrid line list for the main 14N1H isotopologue, as well as isotopologue-extrapolated hybrid line lists for the 14N2H, 15N1H and 15N2H isotopologues. The new 14N1H ExoMol-style trihybrid line list, kNigHt, comprises 4,076 energy levels (1,078 experimental) and 327,014 transitions up to 47,500 cm-1 (211 nm) between five low-lying electronic states (X 3{\Sigma}-, a 1{\Delta}, b 1{\Sigma}+, A 3{\Pi} and c 1{\Pi}). For most anticipated applications aside from far-IR studies, this line list will be of sufficient quality; any improvements should focus on the b 1{\Sigma}+ energies, and the a 1{\Delta} - A 3{\Pi} and b 1{\Sigma}+ - A 3{\Pi} spin-orbit couplings.</description>

Abstract: The hydrogen atom perturbed by a constant 1-dimensional weak quadratic potential $\lambda z^2$ is solved at first-order perturbation theory using the eigenstates of the total angular momentum operator - the coupled basis. Physical applications of this result could be found, for example, in the study of a quadratic Zeeman effect weaker than fine-structure effects, or in a perturbation caused by instantaneous generalised van der Waals interactions.</description>

      <title>Quantum Simulation of Spin-Boson Models with Structured Bath</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spin-boson model, involving a spin interacting with a bath of quantum harmonic oscillators, is a widely used representation of open quantum systems. Trapped ions present a natural platform for the quantum simulation of such models; however, previous experiments have been limited to simulating a scenario where a spin is coherently coupled to bosonic modes, which neglects capturing the dissipation of the bath. In our work, we perform quantum simulations of spin-boson models with structured baths using the motional states of trapped ions. We demonstrate the capability for adjusting the bath's temperature and continuous spectral density by adding randomness to the control parameters. Subsequently, we simulate the dynamics of various spin-boson models with spectral densities composed of up to three Lorentzian peaks. The experimental outcomes closely align with theoretical predictions, suggesting the advantage of adding the trapped-ion system's experimental noise for simulating open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum thermodynamic derivation of the energy resolution limit in magnetometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It was recently demonstrated that a large number of magnetic sensing technologies satisfy the energy resolution limit, which connects a quantity composed by the variance of the magnetic field estimate, the sensor volume and the measurement time, and having units of action, with $\hbar$. A first-principles derivation of the energy resolution limit is still elusive. We here present such a derivation based on quantum thermodynamic arguments. We show that the energy resolution limit is a result of quantum thermodynamic work associated with quantum measurement and Landauer erasure, the work being exchanged with the magnetic field. We apply these considerations to atomic magnetometers and SQUIDS. Regarding the former, we unravel a new spin correlation effect relevant to the magnetic noise produced by atomic vapors.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate an approach for producing a high flux beam of $^7$Li$^4$He dimers by performing post-nozzle seeding of a lithium beam into a supersonic helium expansion. The molecular beam has a longitudinal temperature of 13(6) mK and a continuous flux on the order of $10^{11}$ dimers/s. Monte Carlo simulations of molecular formation based on ab-initio quantum scattering calculations are carried out and compared to the experimentally observed molecular flux. Extensions of this work could lead towards a more quantitative understanding of few-body collision processes of alkali and helium atoms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01056v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a systematic analysis of single-channel quantum interference in laser-induced nonsequential double ionization with few-cycle pulses, using the strong-field approximation. We focus on a below-threshold intensity for which the recollision-excitation with subsequent ionization (RESI) mechanism is prevalent. We derive and classify several analytic interference conditions for single-channel RESI in arbitrary driving fields, and address specific issues for few-cycle pulses. Since the cycles in a short pulse are no longer equivalent, there are several events whose dominance varies. We quantify this dominance for single excitation channels by proposing a dominance parameter. Moreover, there will be many more types of superimposed interference fringes that must be taken into consideration. We find an intricate tapestry of patterns arising from phase differences related to symmetrization, temporal shifts and a combination of exchange and event interference.</description>

      <title>Complex-valued 3D atomic spectroscopy with Gaussian-assisted inline holography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09117v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When a laser-cooled atomic sample is optically excited, the envelope of coherent forward scattering can often be decomposed into a few complex Gaussian profiles. The convenience of Gaussian propagation helps addressing key challenges in digital holography. In this work, we theoretically develop and experimentally demonstrate a Gaussian-decomposition-assisted approach to inline holography, for single-shot, simultaneous measurements of absorption and phase shift of small atomic samples sparsely distributed in 3D. Experimentally, we image a sparse lattice of $^{87}$Rb samples on the D2 line, to resolve their axial positions with micrometer precision, and to retrieve their complex-valued spectroscopic images. With the phase-angle readouts that are highly insensitive to atom-number and interaction-strength uncertainties, we achieve hundred-kHz-level single-shot-resolution to the transition frequency with merely hundreds of atoms. We further demonstrate 3D sensing of local light shift with micrometer spatial resolution.</description>

Abstract: An increasingly large variety of molecular species are being cooled down to low energies in recent years, and innovative ideas and powerful techniques continue to emerge to gain ever more precise control of molecular motion. In this brief review we focus our discussions on two widely employed cooling techniques that have brought molecular gases into the quantum regime: association of ultracold atomic gases into quantum gases of molecules and direct laser cooling of molecules. These advances have brought into reality our capability to prepare and manipulate both internal and external states of molecules quantum mechanically, opening the field of cold molecules to a wide range of scientific explorations.</description>

      <title>Quantum coherent feedback control of an N-level atom with multiple excitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.07787v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to study the dynamics of a quantum coherent feedback network, where an $N$-level atom is coupled with a cavity and the cavity is also coupled with single or multiple parallel waveguides. When the atom is initialized at the highest energy level, it can emit multiple photons into the cavity, and the photons can be further transmitted to the waveguides and re-interact with the cavity quantum electrodynamics (cavity-QED) system. The transmission of photons in the waveguide can construct a feedback channel with a delay determined by the length of the waveguide. We model the dynamics of the atomic and photonic states of the cavity-QED system as a linear control system with delay. By tuning the control parameters such as the coupling strengths among the atom, cavity and waveguide, the eigenstates of the quantum system can be exponentially stable or unstable, and the exponential stability of the linear quantum control system with delay is related with the generation of single- and multi-photon states. Besides, when the cavity-QED system is coupled with multiple parallel waveguides, the emitted photons oscillate among different waveguides and the stability of quantum states is influenced by the feedback loop length and coupling strengths among waveguides.</description>

      <title>Programmable XY-type couplings through parallel spin-dependent forces on the same trapped ion motional modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.04922v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose and experimentally demonstrate an analog scheme for generating XY-type ($J_{ij}^x \sigma_x^i \sigma_x^j \;$ + $J_{ij}^y \sigma_y^i \sigma_y^j \;$) Hamiltonians on trapped ion spins with independent control over the $J_{ij}^x$ and $J_{ij}^y$ terms. The Ising-type interactions $\sigma_x^i \sigma_x^j \;$ and $\sigma_y^i \sigma_y^j \;$ are simultaneously generated by employing two spin-dependent forces operating in parallel on the same set of normal modes. We analytically calculate the region of validity of this scheme, and provide numerical and experimental validation with $^{171}\rm{Yb}^+\;$ ions. This scheme inherits the programmability and scalability of the Ising-type interactions with trapped ions that have been explored in numerous quantum simulation experiments. Our approach extends the capabilities of existing trapped ion quantum simulators to access a large class of spin Hamiltonians relevant for exploring exotic quantum phases such as superfluidity and spin liquids.</description>

      <title>Quantum field theory for multipolar composite bosons with mass defect and relativistic corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.06110v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Atomic high-precision measurements have become a competitive and essential technique for tests of fundamental physics, the Standard Model, and our theory of gravity. It is therefore self-evident that such measurements call for a consistent relativistic description of atoms that eventually originates from quantum field theories like quantum electrodynamics. Most quantum-metrological approaches even postulate effective field-theoretical treatments to describe a precision enhancement through techniques like squeezing. However, a consistent derivation of interacting atomic quantum gases from an elementary quantum field theory that includes both the internal structure as well as the center of mass of atoms, has not yet been addressed. We present such a subspace effective field theory for interacting, spin carrying, and possibly charged ensembles of atoms composed of nucleus and electron that form composite bosons called cobosons, where the interaction with light is included in a multipolar description. Relativistic corrections to the energy of a single coboson, light-matter interaction, and the scattering potential between cobosons arise in a consistent and natural manner. In particular, we obtain a relativistic coupling between the coboson's center-of-mass motion and internal structure encoded by the mass defect. We use these results to derive modified bound-state energies, including the motion of ions, modified scattering potentials, a relativistic extension of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation, and the mass defect applicable to atomic clocks or quantum clock interferometry.</description>

      <title>Quantum coherent and measurement feedback control based on atoms coupled with a semi-infinite waveguide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.16876v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that quantum feedback control may be applied to generate desired states for atomic and photonic systems based on a semi-infinite waveguide coupled with multiple two-level atoms. In this set-up, an initially excited atom can emit one photon into the waveguide, which can be reflected by the terminal mirror or other atoms to establish different feedback loops via the coherent interactions between the atom and photon. When there are at most two excitations in the waveguide quantum electrodynamics (waveguide QED) system, the evolution of quantum states can be interpreted using random graph theory. While this process is influenced by the environment, and we clarify that the environment-induced dynamics can be eliminated by measurement-based feedback control or coherent drives. Thus, in the open system atom-waveguide interactions, measurement-based feedback can modulate the final steady quantum state, while simultaneously, the homodyne detection noise in the measurement process can induce oscillations, which is treated by the coherent feedback designs.</description>

      <title>Bound impurities in a one-dimensional Bose lattice gas: low-energy properties and quench-induced dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03070v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study two mobile bosonic impurities immersed in a one-dimensional optical lattice and interacting with a bosonic bath. We employ the exact diagonalization method for small periodic lattices to study stationary properties and dynamics. We consider the branch of repulsive interactions that induce the formation of bound impurities, akin to the bipolaron problem. A comprehensive study of ground-state and low-energy properties is presented, including an examination of the interaction strengths which induce the formation of a bound dimer of impurities. We also study the dynamics induced after an interaction quench to examine the stability of the bound dimers. We reveal that after large interaction quenches from strong to weak interactions the system can show large oscillations over time with revivals of the dimer states. We find that the oscillations are driven by selected eigenstates with phase-separated configurations.</description>
