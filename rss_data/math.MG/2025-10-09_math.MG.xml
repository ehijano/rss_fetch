      <title>Cutting along a symmetric quadrilateral to construct an embedded flexible dodecahedron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Until recently, the simplest known flexible polyhedron was Steffen's polyhedron on nine vertices. However, in 2024, an embedded flexible polyhedron on eight vertices was announced. It attains the known lower bound for the number of vertices, showing that the simplest embedded flexible polyhedron has eight vertices. We introduce a method for making new flexible polyhedral surfaces from old ones. This general method applies to the above minimal example, giving another proof of its flexibility. We also construct a different flexible dodecahedron on eight vertices. This improves both the range of motion and the simplicity of the exposition.</description>

      <title>Quasisymmetric mappings on two variants of fractal percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study quasisymmetric maps on two variants of the classical fractal percolation model: the fat and dense fractal percolations. We show that, almost surely conditioned on non-extinction, the Hausdorff dimension of the fat fractal percolation cannot be lowered with a quasisymmetry and the Hausdorff dimension of the dense fractal percolation cannot be lowered with a power quasisymmetry.</description>

      <title>On Convex Functions of Gaussian Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a convexity properties for normalized log moment generating function continuing a recent investigation of Chen of convex images of Gaussians. We show that any variable satisfying a ``Ehrhard-like'' property for its distribution function has a strictly convex normalized log moment generating function, unless the variable is Gaussian, in which case affine-ness is achieved. Moreover we characterize variables that satisfy the Ehrhard-like property as the convex images of Gaussians. As applications, we derive sharp comparisons between R\'enyi divergences for a Gaussian and a strongly log-concave variable, and characterize the equality case. We also demonstrate essentially optimal concentration bounds for the sequence of conic intrinsic volumes associated to convex cone and we obtain a reversal of McMullen's inequality between the sum of the (Euclidean) intrinsic volumes associated to a convex body and the body's mean width that generalizes and sharpens a result of Alonso-Hernandez-Yepes.</description>

      <title>On the best constant in the finitary Vitali covering lemma for high dimensional cubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma_d$ be the largest constant such that every finite collection of cubes in $\mathbb{R}^d$ whose sides are parallel to the coordinate axes admits a disjoint sub-collection occupying a fraction $\Gamma_d$ of its volume. Vitali's greedy algorithm shows that $\Gamma_d\geq 3^{-d}$, and cutting a cube into its $2^d$ dyadic sub-cubes gives $\Gamma_d\leq 2^{-d}$. The question of determining the value of $\Gamma_d$ was first raised by T.~Rad\'o in a 1927 letter to Sierpinski.
  In this paper we investigate the asymptotic behavior of $\Gamma_d$ in the high-dimensional limit. We prove that there exists an absolute constant $c&gt;0$ such that \[
  \Gamma_d\geq c\frac{2^{-d}}{d\log d}
  \] in all dimensions $d$, a significant asymptotic improvement of earlier results by R.~Rado (1949) and Bereg--Dumitrescu--Jiang (2010). This gives an answer to problem D6 in Croft--Falconer--Guy's book "Unsolved problems in geometry".</description>

      <title>Conic optimization for extremal geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to highlight recent progress in using conic optimization methods to study geometric packing problems. We will look at four geometric packing problems of different kinds: two on the unit sphere -- the kissing number problem and measurable $\pi/2$-avoiding sets -- and two in Euclidean space -- the sphere packing problem and measurable one-avoiding sets.</description>

      <title>Two-scale branching functions and inhomogeneous attractors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of a two-scale branching function associated with an arbitrary metric space, which encodes the lower and upper box dimensions as well as the Assouad spectrum. If the metric space is quasi-doubling, this function is approximately Lipschitz. We fully classify the attainable Lipschitz two-scale branching functions, which gives a new proof of the classification of Assouad spectra due to the second author.
  We then study inhomogeneous self-conformal sets satisfying standard separation conditions. We show that the two-scale branching function of the attractor is given explicitly in terms of the two-scale branching function of the condensation set and the Hausdorff dimension of the homogeneous attractor. In particular, this gives formulas for the lower box dimension and the Assouad spectrum of the attractor.</description>

      <title>Characterization of the sphere by means of congruent support cones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20615v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a convex body and let $K$ be a closed convex surface $K$ both contained in the Euclidean space $\mathbb{E}^3$. What can we say about $M$ if $K$ encloses $M$ and if from all the points in $K$ the body $M$ looks the same? In this work we are going to present a result which claims that if for every two support cones $C_x$, $C_y$ of $M$, with apexes $x,y \in K$, respectively, there exists $\Phi$ in the semi direct product of the orthogonal group $O(3)$ and $\mathbb{E}^3$ such that $$C_y=\Phi(C_x),$$ and this can be done in a continuous way, then $M$ is a sphere.</description>

      <title>Projection theorems with countably many exceptions and applications to the exact overlaps conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21923v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish several optimal estimates for exceptional parameters in the projection of fractal measures: (1) For a parametric family of self-similar measures satisfying a transversality condition, the set of parameters leading to a dimension drop is at most countable. (2) For any ergodic CP-distribution $Q$ on $\mathbb{R}^2$, the Hausdorff dimension of its orthogonal projection is $\min\{1, \dim Q\}$ in all but at most countably many directions. Applications of our projection results include: (i) For any planar Borel probability measure with uniform entropy dimension $\alpha$, the packing dimension of its orthogonal projection is at least $\min\{1, \alpha\}$ in all but at most countably many directions. (ii) For any planar set $F$, the Assouad dimension of its orthogonal projection is at least $ \min\{1, \dim_{\rm A} F\} $ in all but at most countably many directions.</description>
