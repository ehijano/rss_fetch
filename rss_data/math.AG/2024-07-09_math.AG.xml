      <title>Chip-firing on the Platonic solids: a primer for studying graph gonality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides a friendly introduction to chip-firing games and graph gonality. We use graphs coming from the five Platonic solids to illustrate different tools and techniques for studying these games, including independent sets, treewidth, scramble number, and Dhar's burning algorithm. In addition to showcasing some previously known results, we present the first proofs that the dodecahedron graph has gonality $6$, and that the icosahedron graph has gonality~$9$.</description>

      <title>Algebraic cycles and Hitchin systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to study motivic aspects of the Hitchin system for $\mathrm{GL}_n$. Our results include the following. (a) We prove the motivic decomposition conjecture of Corti-Hanamura for the Hitchin system; in particular, the decomposition theorem associated with the Hitchin system is induced by algebraic cycles. This yields an unconditional construction of the motivic perverse filtration for the Hitchin system, which lifts the cohomological/sheaf-theoretic perverse filtration. (b) We prove that the inverse of the relative Hard Lefschetz symmetry is induced by a relative algebraic correspondence, confirming the relative Lefschetz standard conjecture for the Hitchin system. (c) We show a strong perversity bound for the normalized Chern classes of a universal bundle with respect to the motivic perverse filtration; this specializes to the sheaf-theoretic result obtained earlier by Maulik-Shen. (d) We prove a $\chi$-independence result for the relative Chow motives associated with Hitchin systems.
  Our methods combine Fourier transforms for compactified Jacobian fibrations associated with integral locally planar curves, nearby and vanishing cycle techniques, and a Springer-theoretic interpretation of parabolic Hitchin moduli spaces.</description>

      <title>Moduli of elliptic surfaces of Kodaira dimension one fibered over rational curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we construct an infinite sequence of irreducible components of Koll\'{a}r--Shepherd-Barron (KSB-) moduli spaces of surfaces of arbitrarily large volumes, and describe the boundary of each component completely. Moreover, we describe the stable reduction steps in finding the KSB-limits in an explicit combinatorial way. Our main approach is to study the moduli spaces of elliptic surfaces with Kodaira dimension one, fibered over rational curves, using the techniques of wall-crossing for KSBA moduli and twisted stable maps.</description>

      <title>A characterization of quasi-homogeneous singularities of free and nearly free plane curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to establish a new and efficient characterization of quasi-homogeneous isolated singularities of free curves and nearly free curves $C$ in $\mathbb{P}^2$. The criterion will be in terms of the first syzygy matrix associated with the Jacobian ideal of $f$ where $f=0$ is the equation of the plane curve $C$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the results proven by Deninger and Murre directly imply that the Chern classes of the de Rham bundle of an abelian scheme are torsion elements in the Chow ring, a result that was later proven by van der Geer. We also discuss several results about the orders of these classes.</description>

      <title>Linear Complementary dual codes and Linear Complementary pairs of AG codes in function fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, linear complementary pairs (LCP) of codes and linear complementary dual (LCD) codes have gained significant attention due to their applications in coding theory and cryptography. In this work, we construct explicit LCPs of codes and LCD codes from function fields of genus $g \geq 1$. To accomplish this, we present pairs of suitable divisors giving rise to non-special divisors of degree $g-1$ in the function field. The results are applied in constructing LCPs of algebraic geometry codes and LCD algebraic geometry (AG) codes in Kummer extensions, hyperelliptic function fields, and elliptic curves.</description>

      <title>Weakly approximable triangulated categories and enhancements: a survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper surveys some recent results, concerning the intrinsicness of natural subcategories of weakly approximable triangulated subcategories. We also review the results about uniqueness of enhancements of triangulated categories, with the aim of showing the fruitful interplay. In particular, we show how this leads to a vast generalization of a result by Rickard about derived invariance for schemes and rings.</description>

      <title>Algebraically trivial automorphisms of irreducible holomorphic symplectic manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the lattice-theoretic approach of Brandhorst--Cattaneo to classify algebraically trivial actions on the known IHS manifolds, up to deformation and birational conjugacy. In particular, we classify even order algebraically trivial non symplectic automorphisms, with or without trivial discriminant action. In the case of nontrivial discriminant actions, we show that such automorphisms exist only for finitely many known deformation types and orders.</description>

      <title>Nonnegative Polynomials and Moment Problems on Algebraic Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cone of nonnegative polynomials is of fundamental importance in real algebraic geometry, but its facial structure is understood in very few cases. We initiate a systematic study of the facial structure of the cone of nonnegative polynomials $\pos$ on a smooth real projective curve $X$. We show that there is a duality between its faces and totally real effective divisors on $X$. This allows us to fully describe the face lattice in case $X$ has genus $1$. The dual cone $\pos^\vee$ is known as the moment cone, and it plays an important role in real analysis. We compute the Carath\'{e}odory number of $\pos^\vee$ for an elliptic normal curve $X$, which measures the complexity of quadrature rules of measures supported on $X$. This number can also be interpreted as a maximal typical Waring rank with nonnegative coefficients. Interestingly, the topology of the real locus of $X$ influences the Carath\'{e}odory number of $\pos^\vee$. We apply our results to truncated moment problems on affine cubic curves, where we deduce sharp bounds on the flat extension degree.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this short note, we will explain that the good moduli space morphisms behave as if they are proper when we consider sheaf operations, though they are not separated. For example, the decomposition theorem and the base change theorem hold for these morphisms, which have applications to the cohomological study of moduli spaces.</description>

      <title>Integral aspects of Fourier duality for abelian varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove several results about integral versions of Fourier duality for abelian schemes, making use of Pappas's work on integral Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch. If $S$ is smooth quasi-projective of dimension $d$ over a field and $\pi \colon X\to S$ is a $g$-dimensional abelian scheme, we prove, under very mild assumptions on $X/S$, that all classical results about Fourier duality, including the existence of a Beauville decomposition, are valid for the Chow ring $\mathrm{CH}(X;\Lambda)$ with coefficients in the ring $\Lambda = \mathbb{Z}[1/(2g+d+1)!]$. If $X$ admits a polarization $\theta$ of degree $\nu(\theta)^2$ we further construct an $\mathfrak{sl}_2$-action on $\mathrm{CH}(X;\Lambda_\theta)$ with $\Lambda_\theta = \Lambda[1/\nu(\theta)]$, and we show that $\mathrm{CH}(X;\Lambda_\theta)$ is a sum of copies of the symmetric powers $\mathrm{Sym}^n(\mathrm{St})$ of the $2$-dimensional standard representation, for $n=0,\ldots,g$. For an abelian variety over an algebraically closed field, we use our results to produce torsion classes in $\mathrm{CH}^i(X;\Lambda_\theta)$ for every $i\in \{1,\ldots,g\}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article deals with computing the cohomology of Schur functors applied to tautological bundles on super Grassmannians. We show that in a range of cases, the cohomology is a free module over the cohomology of the structure sheaf and that the space of generators is an irreducible representation of the general linear supergroup that can be constructed via explicit multilinear operations. Our techniques come from commutative algebra: we relate this cohomology calculation to Tor groups of certain algebraic varieties.</description>

      <title>Comparison of the Hitchin metric and the semi-flat metric in the rank two case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $(E,\theta)$ be a Higgs bundle of rank $2$ and degree $0$ on a compact Riemann surface $X$ whose spectral curve is smooth. The tangent space of the moduli space of Higgs bundles at $(E,\theta)$ is equipped with two natural metrics called the Hitchin metric and the semi-flat metric. It is known that the difference between two metrics along the curve $(E,t\theta)$ $(t\geq 1)$ decays in an exponential way. In this paper, we shall study how the exponential rate is improved.</description>

      <title>Enumerating places of $\mathbf P^1$ up to automorphisms of $\mathbf P^1$ in quasilinear time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an algorithm that, for every fixed degree $n\ge 3$, will enumerate all degree-$n$ places of the projective line over a finite field $k$ up to the natural action of $\operatorname{PGL}_2(k)$ using $O(\log q)$ space and $\widetilde{O}(q^{n-3})$ time, where $q=\#k$. Since there are $\Theta(q^{n-3})$orbits of $\operatorname{PGL}_2(k)$ acting on the set of degree-$n$ places, the algorithm is quasilinear in the size of its output. The algorithm is probabilistic unless we assume the extended Riemann hypothesis, because its complexity depends on that of polynomial factorization: for odd $n$, it involves factoring $\Theta(q^{n-3})$ polynomials over $k$ of degree up to ${1 + ((n-1)/2)^n}$.
  For composite degrees $n$, earlier work of the author gives an algorithm for enumerating $\operatorname{PGL}_2(k)$ orbit representatives for degree-$n$ places of $\mathbf{P}^1$ over $k$ that runs in time $\widetilde{O}(q^{n-3})$ independent of the extended Riemann hypothesis, but that uses $O(q^{n-3})$ space.
  We also present an algorithm for enumerating orbit representatives for the action of $\operatorname{PGL}_2(k)$ on the degree-$n$ effective divisors of $\mathbf{P}^1$ over finite fields $k$. The two algorithms depend on one another; our method of enumerating orbits of places of odd degree $n$ depends on enumerating orbits of effective divisors of degree $(n+1)/2$.</description>

      <title>Computation of $\wp$-functions on plane algebraic curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerical tools for computation of $\wp$-functions, also known as Kleinian or multiply periodic, are proposed. In this connection, computation of periods of the both first and second kind is reconsidered. An analytical approach to constructing the Reimann surface of a plane algebraic curves of low gonalities is used. The approach is based on explicit radical solutions to quadratic, cubic, and quartic equations, which serve for hyperelliptic, trigonal, and tetragonal curves, respectively. The proposed analytical construction of the Riemann surface gives a full control over computation of the Abel image of any point on a curve. Therefore, computation of $\wp$-functions on given divisors can be done directly. An alternative computation with the help of the Jacobi inversion problem is used for verification. Hyperelliptic and trigonal curves are considered in detail, and illustrated by examples.</description>

      <title>Log-concavity for independent sets of valuated matroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, several proofs of the Mason--Welsh conjecture for matroids have been found, which asserts the log-concavity of the sequence that counts independent sets of a given size. In this article we use the theory of Lorentzian polynomials, developed by Br\"and\'en and Huh, to prove a generalization of the Mason-Welsh conjecture to the context of valuated matroids. In fact, we provide a log-concavity result in the more general setting of valuated discrete polymatroids, or equivalently, M-convex functions. Our approach is via the construction of a generic extension of a valuated matroid or M-convex function, so that the bases of the extension are related to the independent sets of the original matroid. We also provide a similar log-concavity result for valuated bimatroids, which, we believe, might be of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a polarized family of complex projective manifolds, we study the Hermitian Yang-Mills functionals on the sequence of vector bundles over the base of the family associated with direct image sheaves of the tensor powers of the polarization. We make a connection between the asymptotic minimization of these functionals, for big tensor powers of the polarization, and the minimization of the so-called Wess-Zumino-Witten functional defined on the space of all relatively K\"ahler $(1, 1)$-forms on the fibration. We establish the sharp lower bounds on the latter functional in terms of the limiting Harder-Narasimhan measure, which is a certain algebraic invariant of the family. As an application, in a fibered setting, we prove an asymptotic converse to the Andreotti-Grauert theorem conjectured by Demailly.</description>

      <title>Motivic mirror symmetry and $\chi$-independence for Higgs bundles in arbitrary characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.15393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.15393v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the (twisted orbifold) motives of the moduli spaces of $\mathrm{SL}_n$ and $\mathrm{PGL}_n$-Higgs bundles of coprime rank and degree on a smooth projective curve over an algebraically closed field in which the rank is invertible are isomorphic in Voevodsky's triangulated category of motives. The equality of twisted orbifold Hodge numbers of these moduli spaces was conjectured by Hausel and Thaddeus and recently proven by Groechenig, Ziegler and Wyss via $p$-adic integration and then by Maulik and Shen using the decomposition theorem, an analysis of the supports of $D$-twisted Hitchin fibrations and vanishing cycles. Our proof in characteristic zero combines the geometric ideas of Maulik and Shen with the conservativity of the Betti realisation on abelian motives; to apply the latter, we prove that the relevant motives are abelian. In particular, we prove that the motive of the $\mathrm{SL}_n$-Higgs moduli space is abelian, building on our previous work in the $\mathrm{GL}_n$-case. We then use motivic nearby cycles to deduce the result in positive characteristic from that in characteristic zero. Using the same ideas, we prove motivic $\chi$-independence for $\mathrm{GL}_n$-Higgs bundles.</description>

Abstract: Bernstein-Schwarzman conjectured that the quotient of a complex affine space by an irreducible complex crystallographic group generated by reflections is a weighted projective space. The conjecture was proved by Schwarzman and Tokunaga-Yoshida in dimension 2 for almost all such groups, and for all crystallographic reflection groups of Coxeter type by Looijenga, Bernstein-Schwarzman and Kac-Peterson in any dimension. We prove that the conjecture is true for the crystallographic reflection group in dimension 3 for which the associated collineation group is Klein's simple group of order 168. In this case the quotient is the 3-dimensional weighted projective space with weights 1, 2, 4, 7. The main ingredient in the proof is the computation of the algebra of invariant theta functions. Unlike the Coxeter case, the invariant algebra is not free polynomial, and this was the major stumbling block.</description>

      <title>Extensions of curves with high degree with respect to the genus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.01851v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We classify linearly normal surfaces $S \subset \mathbf{P}^{r+1}$ of degree $d$ such that $4g-4 \leq d \leq 4g+4$, where $g&gt;1$ is the sectional genus (it is a classical result that for larger $d$ there are only cones). We apply this to the study of the extension theory of pluricanonical curves and genus $3$ curves, whenever they verify Property $N_2$, using and slightly expanding the theory of integration of ribbons of the authors and E.~Sernesi. We compute the corank of the relevant Gaussian maps, and we show that all ribbons over such curves are integrable, and thus there exists a universal extension.
  We carry out a similar program for linearly normal hyperelliptic curves of degree $d\geq 2g+3$. We classify surfaces having such a curve $C$ as a hyperplane section, compute the corank of the relevant Gaussian maps, and prove that all ribbons over $C$ are integrable if and only if $d=2g+3$. In the latter case we obtain the existence of a universal extension.</description>

      <title>Recovering the relative poset structure of a covering of schemes using glued topoi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.03879v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a normal connected Noetherian scheme. In this paper we give an algorithm to reconstruct the relative poset structure of finite dominant separable morphism $X'\to X$ in terms of topos-theoretic enhancements of the underlying poset of $X$. The different relative poset structures are classified by an object in a $2$-limit of topoi over a graph, which we call the universal poset covering. We interpret the data in the universal covering in terms of glued power series, and we show how to calculate these using iterated symbolic multivariate Newton-Puiseux algorithms. This in particular gives a full local monogenic algorithm to calculate dual intersection graphs of semistable models of curves defined over a discretely valued field. We give a detailed study of this algorithm, with various examples to illustrate the non-trivial gluing phenomena. We also interpret these techniques in terms of analytic spaces, with an eye towards future applications in $p$-adic integration theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.06792v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A reflection mapping is a singular holomorphic mapping obtained by restricting the quotient mapping of a complex reflection group. We study the analytic structure of double point spaces of reflection mappings. In the case where the image is a hypersurface, we obtain explicit equations for the double point space and for the image as well. In the case of surfaces in $\C^3$, this gives a very efficient method to compute the Milnor number and delta invariant of the double point curve.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01559v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For lc algebraically integrable foliations on klt varieties, we prove the base-point-freeness theorem, the contraction theorem, and the existence of flips. The first result resolves a conjecture of Cascini and Spicer, while the latter two results strengthen a result of Cascini and Spicer by removing their assumption on the termination of flips.
  Moreover, we prove the existence of the minimal model program for lc algebraically integrable foliations on klt varieties and the existence of good minimal models or Mori fiber spaces for lc algebraically integrable foliations polarized with ample divisors on klt varieties. As a consequence, we show that $\mathbb{Q}$-factorial klt varieties with lc algebraically integrable Fano foliation structures are Mori dream spaces. We also show the existence of a Shokurov-type polytope for lc algebraically integrable foliations.</description>

We show that while not all the usual definitions of vector bundle agree over semirings, all the usual definitions of line bundle do agree.

      <description>arXiv:2004.08437v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the symmetry of point vortices with one dominant vortex and four vortices with infinitesimal circulations in the (1+4)-vortex problem, a subcase of the five-vortex problem. The four infinitesimal vortices inscribe quadrilaterals in the unit circle with the dominant vortex at the origin. We consider symmetric configurations which have one degree of spacial freedom, namely the (1+N)-gon, kites, rectangles, and trapezoids with three equal sides. We show there is only one possible rectangular configuration (up to rotation and ordering of the vortices) and one possible trapezoid with three equal sides (up to rotation and ordering), while there are parametrically defined families of kites. Additionally we consider the (1+4)-gon and show that the infinitesimal vortices must have equal circulations on opposite corners of the square. The proofs are heavily dependent on techniques from algebraic geometry and require the use of a computer to calculate Grobner bases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.08622v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formulate an equivariant conservation of number, which proves that a generalized Euler number of a complex equivariant vector bundle can be computed as a sum of local indices of an arbitrary section. This involves an expansion of the Pontryagin--Thom transfer in the equivariant setting. We leverage this result to commence a study of enumerative geometry in the presence of a group action. As an illustration of the power of this machinery, we prove that any smooth complex cubic surface defined by a symmetric polynomial has 27 lines whose orbit types under the $S_4$-action on $\mathbb{C}P^3$ are given by $[S_4/C_2]+[S_4/C_2'] + [S_4/D_8]$, where $C_2$ and $C_2'$ denote two non-conjugate cyclic subgroups of order two. As a consequence we demonstrate that a real symmetric cubic surface can only contain 3 or 27 real lines.</description>

Abstract: A conjecture, recently stated by Flach and Morin, relates the action of the monodromy on the Galois invariant part of the p-adic Beilinson-Hyodo-Kato cohomology of the generic fiber of a scheme defined over a DVR of mixed characteristic to (the cohomology of) its special fiber. We prove the conjecture in the case the special fiber, of the given arithmetic scheme, is also a fiber of a geometric family over a curve in positive characteristic.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.01998v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explicitly identify the algebra generated by symplectic Fourier-Deligne transforms (i.e. convolution with Kazhdan-Laumon sheaves) acting on the Grothendieck group of perverse sheaves on the basic affine space $G/U$, answering a question originally raised by A. Polishchuk. We show it is isomorphic to a distinguished subalgebra, studied by I. Marin, of the generalized algebra of braids and ties (defined in Type $A$ by F. Aicardi and J. Juyumaya and generalized to all types by Marin), providing a connection between geometric representation theory and an algebra defined in the context of knot theory. Our geometric interpretation of this algebra entails some algebraic consequences: we obtain a short and type-independent geometric proof of the braid relations for Juyumaya's generators of the Yokonuma-Hecke algebra (previously proved case-by-case in types $A, D, E$ by Juyumaya and separately for types $B, C, F_4, G_2$ by Juyumaya and S. S. Kannan), a natural candidate for an analogue of a Kazhdan-Lusztig basis, and finally an explicit formula for the dimension of Marin's algebra in Type $A_n$ (previously only known for $n \leq 4$).</description>

      <title>Etale descent obstruction and anabelian geometry of curves over finite fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.04844v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $C$ and $D$ be smooth, proper and geometrically integral curves over a finite field $F$. Any morphism from $D$ to $C$ induces a morphism of their \'etale fundamental groups. The anabelian philosophy proposed by Grothendieck suggests that, when $C$ has genus at least $2$, all open homomorphisms between the \'etale fundamental groups should arise in this way from a nonconstant morphism of curves. We relate this expectation to the arithmetic of the curve $C_K$ over the global function field $K = F(D)$. Specifically, we show that there is a bijection between the set of conjugacy classes of well-behaved morphism of fundamental groups and locally constant adelic points of $C_K$ that survive \'etale descent. We use this to provide further evidence for the anabelian conjecture by relating it to another recent conjecture by Sutherland and the second author.</description>

      <title>A double copy from twisted (co)homology at genus one</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02148v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the twisted (co)homology of a family of genus-one integrals -- the so called Riemann-Wirtinger integrals. These integrals are closely related to one-loop string amplitudes in chiral splitting where one leaves the loop-momentum, modulus and all but one puncture un-integrated. While not actual one-loop string integrals, they share many properties and are simple enough that the associated twisted (co)homologies have been completely characterized [Goto2022,arXiv:2206.03177]. Using intersection numbers -- an inner product on the vector space of allowed differential forms -- we derive the Gauss-Manin connection for two bases of the twisted cohomology providing an independent check of [Mano&amp;Watanabe2012]. We also use the intersection index -- an inner product on the vector space of allowed contours -- to derive a double-copy formula for the closed-string analogues of Riemann-Wirtinger integrals (one-dimensional integrals over the torus). Similar to the celebrated KLT formula between open- and closed-string tree-level amplitudes, these intersection indices form a genus-one KLT-like kernel defining bilinears in meromorphic Riemann-Wirtinger integrals that are equal to their complex counterparts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06572v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The notion of formal Siegel modular forms for an arithmetic subgroup $\Gamma$ of the symplectic group of genus $n$ is a generalization of symmetric formal Fourier-Jacobi series. Assuming an upper bound on the affine covering number of the Siegel modular variety associated with $\Gamma$, we prove that all formal Siegel modular forms are given by Fourier-Jacobi expansions of classical holomorphic Siegel modular forms. We also show that the required upper bound is always met if $2\leq n \leq 4$. As an application we consider the case of the paramodular group of squarefree level and genus $2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09995v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $p\neq{2,3}$ be a prime number and let $\Gamma \subset \mathrm{SL}_{2}(\mathbb{Z})$ be a congruence subgroup with modular curve $X_{\Gamma}/K$ and Jacobian $J(X_{\Gamma})$. In this paper we give an explicit group-theoretic description of the semistable toric rank and component group of $J(X_{\Gamma})$ at the finite places of $K$ lying over $p$. We first produce a suitable deformation retract of the minimal Berkovich skeleton of $X_{\Gamma}$ in terms of Hecke-Iwahori double coset spaces. We call this deformation retract the pruned skeleton of the curve. Our description of this skeleton includes a group-theoretic formula for the edge lengths, allowing us to give the component group of the modular curve as the quotient of a lattice using the monodromy pairing. For $X_{0}(N)$, $X_{1}(N)$, $X_{sp}(N)$ and $X_{sp}^{+}(N)$, we explicitly determine the pruned skeleta using a set of coset schemes over $\mathbb{Z}$. This in particular recovers results by Deligne-Rapoport, Edixhoven, Coleman-McMurdy and Tsushima on the semistable reduction type of $X_{0}(p^{n})$ for $n\leq{4}$. Finally, we determine the geometric Tamagawa number and the prime-to-$2$ structure of the component group of $X_{0}(N)$ over the extension given by Krir's theorem.</description>

      <title>The defect of weak approximation for a reductive group over a global field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08017v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using ideas of Sansuc and results of Colliot-Th\'el\`ene and of Tate, we compute the defect of weak approximation for a reductive group G over a global field K in terms of the algebraic fundamental group of G.</description>

      <title>Flatmates and the bounded cohomology of algebraic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01709v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For all algebraic groups over non-Archimedean local fields, the bounded cohomology vanishes. This follows from the corresponding statement for automorphism groups of Bruhat--Tits buildings, which hinges on the solution to the flatmate conjecture raised in earlier work with Bucher. Vanishing and invariance theorems for arithmetic groups are derived.</description>
