      <title>Subrack Lattices of Conjugation Racks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A rack is a set with a binary operation such that left multiplications are automorphisms of the set and a quandle is a rack satisfying a certain condition. Let $S$ be a subset of a finite group $G$ which is closed under the conjugation operation $a\triangleright b := aba^{-1}$. The set $S$ with the conjugation operation $\triangleright$ is a quandle. We call those objects \emph{conjugation racks}. The prime examples are
  \begin{itemize}
  \item the group rack $(G,\triangleright)$,
  \item the conjugacy class rack $(C,\triangleright)$, where $C$ is a conjugacy class in $G$, and
  \item the $p$-power rack $(G_p,\triangleright)$, where $p$ is a prime and $G_p$ is the set of all elements in $G$ whose order is a power of $p$.
  \end{itemize}
  The set of all subracks of a finite rack form a lattice under inclusion. In this paper we study the subrack lattices of the conjugation racks. In particular, we show that the subrack lattice can be associated with a subposet of a partition lattice as well as with a subposet of an integer partition lattice in a canonical way if the rack is connected. And, if the rack is not connected, the study of the homotopy properties of the subrack lattice can be reduced into the study of the homotopy properties of the subposet of parabolic subracks. We also prove that for a certain class of $p$-power racks the order of a Sylow $p$-subgroup divides the reduced Euler characteristic of the subrack lattice of the $p$-power rack. This statement can be considered as the rack analogue of a result by Brown in the field of subgroup complexes regarding the Euler characteristic of the poset of nontrivial $p$-subgroups of a group.</description>

      <title>A construction of uncountably many finitely generated simple groups of homeomorphisms of the circle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The notion of chain groups of homeomorphisms of the interval was introduced by Kim, Koberda and Lodha as a generalization of Thompson's group $F$. In this paper, we study an $S^1$-version of chain groups: ring groups. We study the simplicity of the commutator subgroups of ring groups. We show that a ring group with a prechain subgroup acting minimally on its support has a simple commutator subgroup. We also study isometric actions of ring groups on R-trees. We give a construction of ring groups such that for every fixed point-free isometric action on an R-tree, there exists an invariant line upon which the group acts by translations. We also confirm that there are uncountably many finitely generated simple groups in the group of orientation preserving homeomorphisms of $S^1$, which are commutator groups of ring groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We survey solvability of equations in wreath products of groups, and prove that the quadratic diophantine problem is solvable in wreath products of Abelian groups. We consider the related question of determining commutator width, and prove that the quadratic diophantine problem is also solvable in Baumslag's finitely presented metabelian group. This text is a short version of an extensive article by the first-named authors.</description>

      <title>Sublinear Bilipschitz Equivalence and the Quasiisometric Classification of Solvable Lie Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a product theorem for sublinear bilipschitz equivalences which generalizes the classical work of Kapovich, Kleiner and Leeb on quasiisometries between product spaces. Independently we develop a new tool, based on a theorem of Cornulier on sublinear bilipschitz equivalences between solvable Lie groups, to evaluate the distortion of certain subgroups in central extensions. This is useful to provide lower bounds on Dehn functions. Building on work of Cornulier and Tessera, we compute the Dehn functions of all simply connected solvable Lie groups of exponential growth up to dimension $5$. We employ our product theorem to distinguish up to quasiisometry certain families among these groups which share the same dimension, cone-dimension and Dehn function. Finally, using a theorem of Peng together with our computations of cone-dimensions and Dehn functions, we establish the quasiisometric rigidity of the rank-two, five-dimensional solvable Lie group acting simply transitively by isometries on the horosphere in general position inside the product of three real hyperbolic planes.</description>

      <title>On trace set of hyperbolic surfaces and a conjecture of Sarnak and Schmutz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the trace set of a Fuchsian lattice. There are two results of this paper: the first is that for a non-uniform lattice, we prove Scmutz's conjecture: the trace set of a Fuchsian lattice exhibits linear growth if and only if the lattice is arithmetic. Additionally, we show that for a fixed surface group of genus bigger than 2 and any positive number $\epsilon$, te set of cocompact lattice embedding such that their growth rate of trace set exceeds $n^{2-\epsilon}$ has positive Weil-Petersson volume. We also provide an asymptotic analysis of the volume of this set.</description>

      <title>The period and index of a Galois cohomology class of a reductive group over a local or global field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $K$ be a local or global field. For a connected reductive group $G$ over $K$, in another preprint [5] we defined a power operation $$(\xi,n)\mapsto \xi^{\Diamond n}\,\colon\, H^1(K,G)\times {\mathbb Z}\to H^1(K,G)$$ of raising to power $n$ in the Galois cohomology pointed set $H^1(K,G)$.
  In this paper, for a cohomology class $\xi$ in $H^1(K,G)$, we compare the period ${\rm per}(\xi)$ defined to be the least integer $n\ge 1$ such that $\xi^{\Diamond n}=1$, and the index ${\rm ind}(\xi)$ defined to be the greatest common divisor of the degrees $[L:K]$ of finite separable extensions $L/K$ splitting $\xi$. These period and index generalize the period and index a central simple algebra over $K$. For an arbitrary reductive $K$-group $G$, we proved in [5] that ${\rm per}(\xi)$ divides ${\rm ind}(\xi)$. In this paper we show that the index may be strictly greater than the period.
  In [5] we proved that for any $K$, $G$, and $\xi\in H^1(K,G)$ as above, the index ${\rm ind}(\xi)$ divides ${\rm per}(\xi)^d$ for some positive integer $d$, and we gave upper bounds for $d$ in the local case and in the case of a number field. Here we give a characteristic-free proof of the fact that ${\rm ind}(\xi)$ divides ${\rm per}(\xi)^d$ for some positive integer $d$ in the global field case, and our proof gives an upper bound for $d$ that is valid also in the case of a function field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by colouring minimal Cayley graphs, in 1978, Babai conjectured that no-lonely-colour graphs have bounded chromatic number. We disprove this in a strong sense by constructing graphs of arbitrarily large girth and chromatic number that have a proper edge-colouring in which each cycle contains no colour exactly once.</description>

      <title>Torsion homology growth and cheap rebuilding of inner-amenable groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.07916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.07916v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that virtually torsion-free, residually finite groups that are inner-amenable and non-amenable have the cheap 1-rebuilding property, a notion recently introduced by Ab\'ert, Bergeron, Fr\k{a}czyk and Gaboriau. As a consequence, the first $\ell^2$-Betti number with arbitrary field coefficients and log-torsion in degree 1 vanish for these groups. This extends results previously known for amenable groups to inner-amenable groups. We use a structure theorem of Tucker-Drob for inner-amenable groups showing the existence of a chain of q-normal subgroups.</description>

      <title>Post Clifford semigroups, the Yang-Baxter equation, relative Rota--Baxter Clifford semigroups and dual weak left braces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19722v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As generalizations of Rota--Baxter groups, Rota--Baxter Clifford semigroups have been introduced by Catino, Mazzotta and Stefanelli in 2023. Based on their pioneering results, in this paper we first continue to study Rota--Baxter Clifford semigroups. Inspired by the corresponding results in Rota--Baxter groups, we firstly obtain some properties and construction methods for Rota--Baxter Clifford semigroups, and then study the substructures and quotient structures of these semigroups. On the other hand, as generalizations of post-groups, Rota--Baxter Clifford semigroups and braided groups, in this paper we introduce and investigate post Clifford semigroups, relative Rota--Baxter Clifford semigroups and braided Clifford semigroups, respectively. We prove that the categories of strong post Clifford semigroups, dual weak left braces, bijective strong relative Rota-Baxter Clifford semigroups and braided Clifford semigroups are mutually pairwise equivalent, and the category of post Clifford semigroups is equivalent to the category of bijective relative Rota--Baxter Clifford semigroups, respectively. As a consequence, we prove that both post Clifford semigroups, relative Rota--Baxter Clifford semigroups and braided Clifford semigroups can provide set-theoretical solutions for the Yang--Baxter equation. The substructures and quotient structures of relative Rota--Baxter Clifford semigroups are also considered.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13070v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define a new class of groups arising from context-free inverse graphs. We provide closure properties, prove that their co-word problems are context-free, study the torsion elements, and realize them as subgroups of the asynchronous rational group. Furthermore, we use a generalized version of the free product of graphs and prove that such a product is context-free inverse closed. We also exhibit an example of a group in our class that is not residually finite and one that is not poly-context-free. These properties make them interesting candidates to disprove both the Lehnert conjecture (which characterizes co-context-free groups as all subgroups of Thompson's group V) and the Brough conjecture (which characterizes finitely generated poly-context-free groups as virtual finitely generated subgroups of direct products of free groups).</description>

      <title>Symmetric Cayley graphs on non-abelian simple groups of valency 7</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19225v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be a connected $7$-valent symmetric Cayley graph on a finite non-abelian simple group $G$. If $\Gamma$ is not normal, Li {\em et al.} [On 7-valent symmetric Cayley graphs of finite simple groups, J. Algebraic Combin. 56 (2022) 1097-1118] characterised the group pairs $(\mathrm{soc}(\mathrm{Aut}(\Gamma)/K),GK/K)$, where $K$ is a maximal intransitive normal subgroup of $\mathrm{Aut}(\Gamma)$. In this paper, we improve this result by proving that if $\Gamma$ is not normal, then $\mathrm{Aut}(\Gamma)$ contains an arc-transitive non-abelian simple normal subgroup $T$ such that $G&lt;T$ and $(T,G)=(\mathrm{A}_{n},\mathrm{A}_{n-1})$ with $n=7$, $3\cdot 7$, $3^2\cdot 7$, $2^2\cdot 3\cdot 7$, $2^3\cdot3\cdot7$, $2^3\cdot3^2\cdot5\cdot7$, $2^4\cdot3^2\cdot5\cdot7$, $2^6\cdot3\cdot7$, $2^7\cdot3\cdot7$, $2^6\cdot3^2\cdot7$, $2^6\cdot3^4\cdot5^2\cdot7$, $2^8\cdot3^4\cdot5^2\cdot7$, $2^7\cdot3^4\cdot5^2\cdot7$, $2^{10}\cdot3^2\cdot7$, $2^{24}\cdot3^2\cdot7$. Furthermore, $\mathrm{soc}(\mathrm{Aut}(\Gamma)/R)=(T\times R)/R$, where $R$ is the largest solvable normal subgroup of $\mathrm{Aut}(\Gamma)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1112.1999v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the late 19th century, Klein inaugurated a program for describing the finite subgroups of $PGL_2(k)$ by treating the case in which the field $k$ is the complex numbers. Gierster and Moore extended Klein's arguments to deal with finite fields. In the past century, additional contributions to this problem were made by Serre, Suzuki, and Beauville, among others. We complete this program by giving a classification of the finite subgroups of $PGL_2(k)$ with order divisible by $p$, up to conjugation, for an arbitrary field $k$ of positive characteristic $p$.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the constant-depth circuit complexity of the Isomorphism Problem, Minimum Generating Set Problem (MGS), and Sub(quasi)group Membership Problem (Membership) for groups and quasigroups (=Latin squares), given as input in terms of their multiplication (Cayley) tables. Despite decades of research on these problems, lower bounds for these problems even against depth-$2$ AC circuits remain unknown.

Theory, 2013) showed that Quasigroup Isomorphism could be solved by AC circuits of depth $O(\log \log n)$ using $O(\log^2 n)$ nondeterministic bits, a class we denote $\exists^{\log^2(n)}FOLL$. We narrow this gap by improving the upper bound for many of these problems to $quasiAC^0$, thus decreasing the depth to constant.
  In particular, we show:
  - MGS for quasigroups is in $\exists^{\log^2(n)}\forall^{\log n}NTIME(\mathrm{polylog}(n))\subseteq quasiAC^0$. Papadimitriou and Yannakakis (J. Comput. Syst. Sci., 1996) conjectured that this problem was $\exists^{\log^2(n)}P$-complete; our results refute a version of that conjecture for completeness under $quasiAC^0$ reductions unconditionally, and under polylog-space reductions assuming EXP $\neq$ PSPACE.
  - MGS for groups is in $AC^{1}(L)$, improving on the previous upper bound of $P$ (Lucchini &amp; Thakkar, J. Algebra, 2024).
  - Quasigroup Isomorphism belongs to $\exists^{\log^2(n)}AC^0(DTISP(\mathrm{polylog},\log)\subseteq quasiAC^0$, improving on the previous bound of $\exists^{\log^2(n)}L\cap\exists^{\log^2(n)}FOLL\subseteq quasiFOLL$ (Chattopadhyay, Tor\'an, &amp; Wagner, ibid.; Levet, Australas. J. Combin., 2023).
  Our results suggest that understanding the constant-depth circuit complexity may be key to resolving the complexity of problems concerning (quasi)groups in the multiplication table model.</description>

      <title>A classification of $C_{p^n}$-Tambara fields</title>

Abstract: Tambara functors arise in equivariant homotopy theory as the structure adherent to the homotopy groups of a coherently commutative equivariant ring spectrum. We show that if $k$ is a field-like $C_{p^n}$-Tambara functor, then $k$ is the coinduction of a field-like $C_{p^s}$-Tambara functor $\ell$ such that $\ell(C_{p^s}/e)$ is a field. If this field has characteristic other than $p$, we observe that $\ell$ must be a fixed-point Tambara functor, and if the characteristic is $p$, we determine all possible forms of $\ell$ through an analysis of the behavior of the Frobenius endomorphism and an application of Artin-Schreier theory.</description>
