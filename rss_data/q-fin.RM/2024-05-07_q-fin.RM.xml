      <title>The Democratization of Wealth Management: Hedged Mutual Fund Blockchain Protocol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop several innovations designed to bring the best practices of traditional investment funds to the blockchain landscape. Our innovations combine the superior mechanisms of mutual funds and hedge funds. Specifically, we illustrate how fund prices can be updated regularly like mutual funds and performance fees can be charged like hedge funds. We show how mutually hedged blockchain investment funds can operate with investor protection schemes - high water marks - and measures to offset trading slippage when redemptions happen. We provide detailed steps - including mathematical formulations and instructive pointers - to implement these ideas as blockchain smart contracts. We discuss how our designs overcome several blockchain bottlenecks and how we can make smart contracts smarter. We provide numerical illustrations of several scenarios related to the mechanisms we have tailored for blockchain implementation.
  The concepts we have developed for blockchain implementation can also be useful in traditional financial funds to calculate performance fees in a simplified manner. We highlight two main issues with the operation of mutual funds and hedge funds and show how blockchain technology can alleviate those concerns. The ideas developed here illustrate on one hand, how blockchain can solve many issues faced by the traditional world and on the other hand, how many innovations from traditional finance can benefit decentralized finance and speed its adoption. This becomes an example of symbiosis between decentralized and traditional finance - bringing these two realms closer and breaking down barriers between such artificial distinctions - wherein the future will be about providing better risk adjusted wealth appreciation opportunities to end customers through secure, reliable, accessible and transparent services - without getting too caught up about how such services are being rendered.</description>

      <title>Hedge Error Analysis In Black Scholes Option Pricing Model: An Asymptotic Approach Towards Finite Difference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Black-Scholes option pricing model remains a cornerstone in financial mathematics, yet its application is often challenged by the need for accurate hedging strategies, especially in dynamic market environments. This paper presents a rigorous analysis of hedge errors within the Black-Scholes framework, focusing on the efficacy of finite difference techniques in calculating option sensitivities. Employing an asymptotic approach, we investigate the behavior of hedge errors under various market conditions, emphasizing the implications for risk management and portfolio optimization. Through theoretical analysis and numerical simulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method in reducing hedge errors and enhancing the robustness of option pricing models. Our findings provide valuable insights into improving the accuracy of hedging strategies and advancing the understanding of option pricing in financial markets.</description>

      <title>Explainable Risk Classification in Financial Reports</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01881v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Every publicly traded company in the US is required to file an annual 10-K financial report, which contains a wealth of information about the company. In this paper, we propose an explainable deep-learning model, called FinBERT-XRC, that takes a 10-K report as input, and automatically assesses the post-event return volatility risk of its associated company. In contrast to previous systems, our proposed model simultaneously offers explanations of its classification decision at three different levels: the word, sentence, and corpus levels. By doing so, our model provides a comprehensive interpretation of its prediction to end users. This is particularly important in financial domains, where the transparency and accountability of algorithmic predictions play a vital role in their application to decision-making processes. Aside from its novel interpretability, our model surpasses the state of the art in predictive accuracy in experiments on a large real-world dataset of 10-K reports spanning six years.</description>
