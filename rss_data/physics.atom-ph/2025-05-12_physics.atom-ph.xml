      <title>Enhancing optical lattice clock coherence times with erasure conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pursuit of ever-longer optical coherence is central to advancing the precision of optical clocks. Synchronous differential clock comparisons have now demonstrated atomic coherence times on optical transitions that far exceed the coherence time of the clock laser. In optical lattice and tweezer clocks the atom coherence times are then primarily limited by errors induced by Raman scattering from the trapping light, as well as radiative decay due to the finite lifetime of the excited clock state, broadening and loss from two-body collisions, and loss due to heating. Importantly, many of these errors take the atoms out of the clock transition subspace, and can therefore be converted into "erasure" errors if the appropriate readout scheme is employed. Here we experimentally demonstrate a hyperfine-resolved readout technique for 87Sr optical lattice clocks that mitigates decoherence from Raman scattering induced by the lattice trapping light as well as radiative decay. By employing hyperfine-resolved readout in synchronous differential comparisons between 87Sr ensembles with both Ramsey and spin echo spectroscopy sequences, we achieve enhanced atomic coherence times exceeding 100 s and 150 s, respectively, and demonstrate that the differential instability becomes less sensitive to the interrogation time, enabling longer coherent measurements without a reduction in performance. We anticipate that this hyperfine-resolved readout technique will benefit applications of state-of-the-art optical lattice clock comparisons in which the coherence times or stabilities are constrained by Raman scattering or radiative decay.</description>

      <title>Direct measurement of the 3P0 clock state natural lifetime in 87Sr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical lattice clocks based on the narrow transition between 5s2-1S0 and 5s5p-3P0 levels in neutral strontium (Sr) are among the most precise and accurate measurement devices in existence. Although this transition is completely forbidden by selection rules, state mixing from the hyperfine interaction in 87Sr provides a weakly allowed transition that can be coherently driven with practical clock laser intensities. While the coherent interrogation times of optical clocks are typically set by the linewidth of the probe laser, this limitation can be overcome in synchronous differential comparisons between ensembles. In such measurements the natural lifetime of the 1S0 to 3P0 clock transition becomes the fundamental limiting factor to the duration of a single run of the experiment. However, a direct measurement of the decay rate of the clock excited state is quite challenging due to the competing effects of other loss channels such as Raman scattering, inelastic collisions and atom-loss due to background gas. In this work, we monitor the decay of Sr atoms trapped in an optical lattice and initialized in the 3P0 state. By making measurements of high and low density ensembles of both 87Sr and 88Sr across varying lattice trap depths, we isolate radiative decay, which accounts for a significant fraction of the observed decays at low depths. We obtain a natural radiative decay lifetime of 167+79-40s for the 3P0 clock state in 87Sr, a value that is consistent with previously reported direct and indirect measurements, along with theoretical predictions. We also introduce an additional measurement scheme that involves repeated measurements of the ground state population within a single experimental sequence, further confirming our model and the consistency of the measured rates.</description>

      <title>Atomic Coherence of 2 minutes and Instability of 1.5E-18 at 1 s in a Wannier-Stark Lattice Clock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the limits of atomic coherence and measurement precision in a 87Sr optical lattice clock. We perform a detailed characterization of key effects, including lattice Raman scattering and atomic collisions in a shallow lattice configuration, determining a 174(28) s 3P0 clock state lifetime. Investigation of atomic coherence across a range of lattice depths and atomic densities reveals decoherence mechanisms related to photon scattering and atomic interaction. At a reduced density, we observe a coherence time of 118(9) s, approaching the fundamental limit set by spontaneous emission. Guided by this coherence understanding, we demonstrate a clock instability of 1.5E-18 at 1 s in fractional frequency units. Our results are important for further advancing the state-of-the-art of an optical lattice clock for fundamental physics applications.</description>

      <title>Coordinated international comparisons between optical clocks connected via fiber and satellite links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical clocks provide ultra-precise frequency references that are vital for international metrology as well as for tests of fundamental physics. To investigate the level of agreement between different clocks, we simultaneously measured the frequency ratios between ten optical clocks in six different countries, using fiber and satellite links. This is the largest coordinated comparison to date, from which we present a subset of 38 optical frequency ratios and an evaluation of the correlations between them. Four ratios were measured directly for the first time, while others had significantly lower uncertainties than previously achieved, supporting the advance towards a redefinition of the second and the use of optical standards for international time scales.</description>

      <title>Single-atom imaging of ${}^{173}$Yb in optical tweezers loaded by a five-beam magneto-optical trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the trapping and imaging of individual ytterbium atoms in arrays of optical tweezers, loaded from a magneto-optical trap (MOT) formed by only five beams in an orthogonal configuration. In our five-beam MOT, operating on the narrow ${}^1$S${}_0 \rightarrow {}^3$P${}_1$ intercombination transition, gravity balances the radiation pressure of a single upward-directed beam. This approach enables efficient trapping and cooling of the most common ytterbium isotopes (${}^{171}$Yb, ${}^{173}$Yb and ${}^{174}$Yb) to $\lesssim 20\,\mu$K at densities $\sim 10^{11}$ atoms/cm$^3$ within less than one second. This configuration allows for significantly reducing the complexity of the optical setup, potentially benefiting any ytterbium-atom based quantum science platform leveraging single-atom microscopy, from quantum processors to novel optical clocks. We then demonstrate the first single-atom-resolved imaging of the fermionic, large-spin isotope ${}^{173}$Yb ($I=5/2$), employing a two-color imaging scheme that does not rely on magic-wavelength trapping. We achieve a high single-atom imaging fidelity of $99.96(1)\%$ and a large survival probability of $98.5(2)\%$, despite large differential light shifts affecting all nuclear spin sublevels of the excited ${}^3$P${}_1$ state involved in the cooling transition. The demonstrated capabilities will play a key role in future quantum simulations and computing applications with ${}^{173}$Yb arrays.</description>

      <title>Single-photon ionization of H$_2^+$ in near-circular laser fields with lower photon energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study single-photon ionization of aligned H$_2^+$ in low-intensity near-circular laser fields with lower photon energy numerically and analytically. The photoelectron momentum distribution (PMD) within the laser polarization plane, obtained by numerical simulations, shows a remarkable offset angle, which changes with changing the internuclear distance and the laser frequency. This phenomenon is different from that observed in recent experiments [Science 370, 339 (2020)] which is related to the PMD along the propagation direction of the laser. This phenomenon holds even for H$_2^+$ with short-range Coulomb potentials but disappears for atoms, different from that observed in attoclock experiments. We show that the molecular Coulomb potential near the two atomic centers plays an important role here and theory models associated with more accurate continuum wave function of the molecule are needed for reproducing this phenomenon. This phenomenon can be useful for ultrafast probing of molecules with high resolution of several attoseconds or even zeptoseconds.</description>

      <title>Observation of modulation-induced Feshbach resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we observe a novel resonant mechanism, namely the modulation-induced Feshbach resonance. By applying a far-detuned laser to the cesium D2 transition with intensity modulation, we periodically shake the energy levels of atomic collisional states. This periodic shaking connects the free-scattering states to shallow molecular states. At specific frequencies, we observe significant atom loss, which corresponds to the resonant coupling between these two types of states. This precisely corresponds to a form of Feshbach resonance, yet in the frequency domain rather than the magnetic-field domain. Using this method, we can directly scan the energy spectrum of molecular bound states without synthesizing any molecules. In addition to these bound states, we can also probe the molecular states embedded in the continuum, which are typically very difficult to detect by the conventional methods based on molecular synthesis. Moreover, by using a far-detuned laser instead of a magnetic field coil, it enables spatially dependent control over atomic interactions, coupling multiple levels simultaneously, and inducing new Feshbach resonances for those atoms that do not have conventional magnetic resonances. Therefore, we believe that this new resonant mechanism offers new opportunities for controlling atomic and molecular interactions in quantum simulations.</description>

      <title>Gamma-ray and high-energy X-ray detection with large area scintillating crystals: a hands-on review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detection of photons with scintillating inorganic crystals in the high-energy range (&gt; 0.1 MeV) will be discussed, making a comparison with other available methods. Energy resolutions up to 2 % at 662 keV and fast decay time of the order of 20 ns are within reach, with the introduction of Ce-doped crystals instead of alkali halide ones. Development is underway for the production of non-hygroscopic scintillating crystals, such as PrLuAg and CE:GAAG. At the end of this review, examples of experimental devices based on scintillating inorganic crystals will be discussed. Practical hands-on experience is emphasized at the expense of a more comprehensive description of all available and possible options. Detectors' construction details and the consequences of the different choices will be discussed. Emphasis will be put on the LaBr3:Ce-based detectors that are the present ''golden standard'' in gamma ray spectroscopy. This review will focus on photon detection in the high-energy region: mainly 0.1-2 MeV, including both gamma rays and high-energy X-rays, even if many considerations may be applied to the detection of low-energy X-rays.</description>

      <title>Prospects for the determination of fundamental constants with beyond-state-of-the-art uncertainty using molecular hydrogen ion spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14021v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The proton, deuteron and triton masses can be determined relative to the electron mass via rovibrational spectroscopy of molecular hydrogen ions. This has to occur via comparison of the experimentally measured transition frequencies and the ab initio calculated frequencies, whose dependence on the mass ratios can be calculated precisely. In precision experiments to date (on HD$^+$ and H$_2^+$), the transitions have involved the ground vibrational level $v=0$ and excited vibrational levels with quantum numbers up to $v'=9$. For these transitions, the sensitivity of the ab initio frequency on the high-order-QED contributions is correlated with that on the mass ratios. This prevents an efficient simultaneous determination of these quantities from experimental data, so that the accuracy of the mass ratios is essentially limited by the theoretical uncertainty. Here we analyze how the accuracy of mass ratios may be improved by providing experimental transition frequencies between levels with larger quantum numbers, whose sensitivity on the mass ratio is positive rather than negative, or close to zero. This allows the unknown QED contributions and involved fundamental constants to be much more efficiently determined from a joint analysis of several measurements. We also consider scenarios where transitions of D$_2^+$ are included. We find these to be powerful approaches, allowing in principle to reach uncertainties for the mass ratios approximately three orders smaller than CODATA 2018. Improvements by a factor of 3.5 for the Rydberg constant, and 11 (14) for the proton (deuteron) charge radius, are also projected.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20376v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the quantum evolution of one-dimensional Bose gases immediately after several variants of high-energy quenches, both theoretically and experimentally. Using the advantages conveyed by the relative simplicity of these nearly integrable many-body systems, we are able to differentiate the behaviors of two distinct but often temporally overlapping processes, hydrodynamization and local prethermalization. We show that the hydrodynamization epoch is itself characterized by two independent timescales, an oscillation period and an observable-dependent damping time. We also show how the existence of a hydrodynamization epoch depends on the exact nature of the high-energy quench. There is a universal character to our findings, which can be applied to the short-time behavior of any interacting many-body quantum system after a sudden high-energy quench. We specifically discuss its potential relevance to heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Investigations of electron removal processes in slow He$^{2+}$ and He$^{+}$-Ne$_2$ collisions indicate high Interatomic Coulombic Decay yield</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20411v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We implement an independent-atom and independent-electron model to investigate the collision systems of He$^{2+}$ and He$^{+}$ ion projectiles impinging on a neon dimer target. The dimer is set to be stationary at its equilibrium bond length with the projectile traveling parallel to the dimer axis at a speed corresponding to the collision energy of 10 keV/amu. Two approaches called multinomial and determinantal are used as an analysis of these collisions. Each of the analyses is broken down into two types of models that do not and do include a change in the projectile charge state due to electron capture from the dimer. All calculations are performed using both a frozen atomic target and a dynamic response model using the coupled-channel two-center basis generator method for orbital propagation. All one- and two- electron removal processes are calculated, though particular attention is paid to those that result in the Ne$^{+}$-Ne$^{+}$ fragmentation channel due to its association with interatomic Coulombic decay (ICD). We confirm in all analyses and models that Ne(2$s$) electron removal is strong so that ICD will contribute to dimer fragmentation as has been previously demonstrated. The model that takes into account the change in projectile charge state indicates that there is a pure ICD yield when utilizing a He$^{+}$ projectile.</description>

Abstract: We study the occurrence of Rydberg atom-ion molecules (RAIMs) in a hybrid atom-ion system with an ion crystal trapped in a Paul trap coupled to Rydberg atoms on its either ends. To assess the feasibility of such a system, we perform a detailed Floquet analysis of the effect of the Paul trap's rf potential on the RAIMs and provide a qualitative analysis of the survival probability based on scaling laws. We conclude that the RAIM survives for sufficiently weak and low frequency traps. We then use this hybrid system and propose a scheme to utilise the common motional modes of the ion crystal to suppress (blockade) or enhance (anti-blockade) the probability of forming two RAIMs at the ends of the chain, replacing the typical blockade radius by the length of the ion crystal.</description>

Abstract: Cherenkov radiation of charged particles moving with superluminal velocities in transparent media is a well-studied phenomenon with a plethora of applications. Its microscopic origins can be traced to the polarization of atomic shells, characterized by time scales in the subfemtosecond range - dynamics that eludes conventional macroscopic treatment. Here we present a theoretical framework for probing the intrinsic dynamics of Cherenkov radiation, unveiling quantum features absent in classical realm and even in a fully quantum theory in momentum space. These features include a finite formation length and spreading time of the photon, the latter becoming negative nearby the Cherenkov angle, a finite flash duration tied to the size of the electron packet, along with a shift in the photon arrival time that can be either positive or negative and necessitates going beyond the far-field approximation. The calculated time scales lie in the attosecond range for the relevant parameters, thus linking this macroscopic phenomenon back to its atomic origins. Finally, we propose that by measuring the duration of the Cherenkov flash one can in principle retrieve the length of the emitting packet, deepening our understanding of quantum coherence effects in photon emission.</description>
