      <title>A Vector Representation for Phylogenetic Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Good representations for phylogenetic trees and networks are important for optimizing storage efficiency and implementation of scalable methods for the inference and analysis of evolutionary trees for genes, genomes and species. We introduce a new representation for rooted phylogenetic trees that encodes a binary tree on n taxa as a vector of length 2n in which each taxon appears exactly twice. Using this new tree representation, we introduce a novel tree rearrangement operator, called a HOP, that results in a tree space of diameter n and a quadratic neighbourhood size. We also introduce a novel metric, the HOP distance, which is the minimum number of HOPs to transform a tree into another tree. The HOP distance can be computed in near-linear time, a rare instance of a tree rearrangement distance that is tractable. Our experiments show that the HOP distance is better correlated to the Subtree-Prune-and-Regraft distance than the widely used Robinson-Foulds distance. We also describe how the novel tree representation we introduce can be further generalized to tree-child networks.</description>

      <title>Ecology, Spatial Structure, and Selection Pressure Induce Strong Signatures in Phylogenetic Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evolutionary dynamics are shaped by a variety of fundamental, generic drivers, including spatial structure, ecology, and selection pressure. These drivers impact the trajectory of evolution, and have been hypothesized to influence phylogenetic structure. Here, we set out to assess (1) if spatial structure, ecology, and selection pressure leave detectable signatures in phylogenetic structure, (2) the extent, in particular, to which ecology can be detected and discerned in the presence of spatial structure, and (3) the extent to which these phylogenetic signatures generalize across evolutionary systems. To this end, we analyze phylogenies generated by manipulating spatial structure, ecology, and selection pressure within three computational models of varied scope and sophistication. We find that selection pressure, spatial structure, and ecology have characteristic effects on phylogenetic metrics, although these effects are complex and not always intuitive. Signatures have some consistency across systems when using equivalent taxonomic unit definitions (e.g., individual, genotype, species). Further, we find that sufficiently strong ecology can be detected in the presence of spatial structure. We also find that, while low-resolution phylogenetic reconstructions can bias some phylogenetic metrics, high-resolution reconstructions recapitulate them faithfully. Although our results suggest potential for evolutionary inference of spatial structure, ecology, and selection pressure through phylogenetic analysis, further methods development is needed to distinguish these drivers' phylometric signatures from each other and to appropriately normalize phylogenetic metrics. With such work, phylogenetic analysis could provide a versatile toolkit to study large-scale evolving populations.</description>

      <title>Exact Expressions for the Log-likelihood's Hessian in Multivariate Continuous-Time Continuous-Trait Gaussian Evolution along a Phylogeny</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We presents the closed form formulae for the likelihood Hessian matrix of a family of multivariate continuous-trait Gaussian Markov trait evolution model along a given phylogeny, in which the trait vector's mean is an affine function of that of its ancestor and the variance is not dependent of the trait. Accompanied with this work is an R package called 'glinvci', publicly available on The Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN), that can compute Hessian-based approximate confidence regions for these models while at the same time allowing users to have missing data, lost traits, and multiple evolutionary regimes.</description>

      <title>Feedback-delay dependence of the stability of cluster periodic orbits in populations of degrade-and-fire oscillators with common activator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Feedback delay has been identified as a key ingredient in the quorum sensing synchronization of synthetic gene oscillators. While this influence has been evidenced at the theoretical level in a simplified system of degrade-and-fire oscillators coupled via a common activator protein, full mathematical certifications remained to be provided. Here, we prove from a rigorous mathematical viewpoint that, for the very same model, the synchronized degrade-and-fire oscillations are 1/ unstable with respect to out-of-sync perturbations in absence of delay, and 2/ are otherwise asymptotically stable in presence of delay, no matter how small is its amplitude. To that goal, we proceed to an extensive study of the population dynamics in this system, which in particular identifies the mechanisms of, and related criteria for, the delay-dependent stability of periodic orbits with respect to out-of-sync perturbations. As an additional outcome, the analysis also reveals that, depending on the parameters, multiple stable partially synchronized periodic orbits can coexist with the fully synchronized one.</description>

      <title>Mechanically-driven growth and competition in a Voronoi model of tissues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mechanisms leading cells to acquire a fitness advantage and establish themselves in a population are paramount to understanding the development and growth of cancer. Although there are many works that study separately either the evolutionary dynamics or the mechanics of cancer, little has been done to couple evolutionary dynamics to mechanics. To address this question, we study a confluent model of tissue using a Self-Propelled Voronoi (SPV) model with stochastic growth rates that depend on the mechanical variables of the system. The SPV model is an out-of-equilibrium model of tissue derived from an energy functional that has a jamming/unjamming transition between solid-like and liquid-like states. By considering several scenarios of mutants invading a resident population in both phases, we determine the range of parameters that confer a fitness advantage and show that the preferred area and perimeter are the most relevant ones. We find that the liquid-like state is more resistant to invasion and show that the outcome of the competition can be determined from the simulation of a non-growing mixture. Moreover, a mean-field approximation can accurately predict the fate of a mutation affecting mechanical properties of a cell. Our results can be used to infer evolutionary dynamics from tissue images, understand cancer-suppressing effects of tissue mechanics, and even search for mechanics-based therapies.</description>

      <title>Seed Selection in the Heterogeneous Moran Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15986v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Moran process is a classic stochastic process that models the rise and takeover of novel traits in network-structured populations. In biological terms, a set of mutants, each with fitness $m\in(0,\infty)$ invade a population of residents with fitness $1$. Each agent reproduces at a rate proportional to its fitness and each offspring replaces a random network neighbor. The process ends when the mutants either fixate (take over the whole population) or go extinct. The fixation probability measures the success of the invasion. To account for environmental heterogeneity, we study a generalization of the Standard process, called the Heterogeneous Moran process. Here, the fitness of each agent is determined both by its type (resident/mutant) and the node it occupies. We study the natural optimization problem of seed selection: given a budget $k$, which $k$ agents should initiate the mutant invasion to maximize the fixation probability? We show that the problem is strongly inapproximable: it is $\mathbf{NP}$-hard to distinguish between maximum fixation probability 0 and 1. We then focus on mutant-biased networks, where each node exhibits at least as large mutant fitness as resident fitness. We show that the problem remains $\mathbf{NP}$-hard, but the fixation probability becomes submodular, and thus the optimization problem admits a greedy $(1-1/e)$-approximation. An experimental evaluation of the greedy algorithm along with various heuristics on real-world data sets corroborates our results.</description>
