      <title>Comparison of Australasian tektites with Australasian microtektites and BeLaU spherules recovered from the ocean</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Australasian strewn field covers more than 15% of Earth's surface, consisting of tektites and microtektites. Australasian tektites from Southeast Asia and Australia, as well as microtektites recovered from deep sea sediments and Antarctica, are established to be derived from upper continental crust sediments. An expedition to retrieve remnants of bolide CNEOS 2014 January 8 (IM1), held in the Pacific Ocean, was in proximity to the known extent of the Australasian strewn field, and yielded "BeLaU"-spherules, whose compositions did not match most well-studied solar system material. We therefore report precise and comprehensive elemental data for Australasian tektites to compare their elemental abundances to those of microtektites from deep sea sediments, and BeLaU. Our findings corroborate previous studies that Australasian tektites and microtektites closely resemble the elemental abundance patterns of the upper continental crust. Meanwhile, the elemental patterns of the BeLaU-spherules are distinct from the Australasian tektite/microtektite compositions.</description>

      <title>Discovery of Late Triassic volcanic ash layers in the deep-water zone of the Nanpanjiang Basin (South China) and the possibility of Carnian Pluvial Episode correlation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents new geochronological constraints for the Niluo Member within the slope-basin facies of the Late Triassic Nanpanjiang Basin, eastern Tethys. The basin underwent a significant marine-to-continental transition during this period. Previous biostratigraphic studies on platform facies were hindered by inconclusive conodont zonation, leaving the chronology of slope-basin deposits poorly resolved. To address this, we identified volcanic ash layers within the Niluo Member in the Wangmo area. Zircon U-Pb dating of these ashes yielded weighted mean ages of 229.9 Ma and 229.0 Ma, establishing a Carnian depositional age. This result is significantly younger than previous estimates and coincides with the CPE. The Niluo Member is interpreted as a period of slow, oxygen-deficient sedimentation, contrasting with the rapid turbidite deposition of the enclosing formations. This depositional hiatus likely facilitated the preservation of the datable ash layers. The Carnian age and unique lithology suggest the Niluo Member may record the CPE in the slope environment, potentially linked to increased terrigenous input that suppressed carbonate production. Concurrent conodont sampling was unsuccessful, validating the documented difficulties in applying biostratigraphy in these deep-water settings. These new radiometric ages provide a crucial anchor point for Late Triassic stratigraphy in South China, demonstrate the potential for preserving CPE records in slope facies, and offer a new basis for regional and global correlation.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Exploration of Tropical Cyclone's Controllability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although the chaotic nature of the atmosphere may enable efficient control of tropical cyclones (TCs) via small-scale perturbations, few studies have proposed data-driven optimization methods to identify such perturbations. Here, we apply the recently proposed Ensemble Kalman Control (EnKC) to a TC simulation. We show that EnKC finds small-scale perturbations that mitigate TC. An EnKC-estimated reduction in surface water vapor, located approximately 250km from the TC center, suppresses convective activity and latent heat release in the eye wall, leading to a reduction of TC intensity. To advance the discovery of feasible TC mitigation strategies, we discuss the potential of this data-driven method for leveraging chaos, as well as its remaining challenges.</description>

      <title>Learning Soil Physics from Partial Knowledge and Data: Partitioning Capillary and Adsorbed Soil Water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Soil physics models have long relied on simplifying assumptions to represent complex processes, yet such assumptions can strongly bias model predictions. Here, we propose a paradigm-shifting differentiable hybrid modeling (DHM) framework that instead of simplifying the unknown, learns it from data. As a proof of concept, we apply the hybrid approach to the challenge of partitioning the soil water retention curve (SWRC) into capillary and adsorbed water components, a problem where traditional assumptions have led to divergent results. The hybrid framework derives this partitioning directly from data while remaining guided by a few parsimonious and universally accepted physical constraints. Using basic soil physical properties as inputs, the hybrid model couples an analytical formula for the dry end of the SWRC with data-driven physics-informed neural networks that learn the wet end, the transition between the two ends, and key soil-specific parameters. The model was trained on a SWRC dataset from 482 undisturbed soil samples from Central Europe, spanning a broad range of soil texture classes and organic carbon contents. The hybrid model successfully learned both the overall shape and the capillary and adsorbed components of the SWRC. Notably, the model revealed physically meaningful pore-scale features without relying on explicit geometrical assumptions about soil pore shape or its distribution. Moreover, the model revealed a distinctly nonlinear transition between capillary and adsorbed domains, challenging the linear assumptions invoked in previous studies. The methodology introduced here provides a blueprint for learning other soil processes where high-quality datasets are available but mechanistic understanding is incomplete.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Videos of the 2020 Beirut explosion offer a rare opportunity to see a shock wave. We summarize the non-linear theory of a weak shock, derive the Landau-Whitham formula for the thickness of the overpressure layer and, using frame-by-frame video analysis, we demonstrate a semi-quantitative agreement of data and theory.</description>

      <title>Solute dispersion boosts the phoretic removal of colloids from dead-end pores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting and controlling the transport of colloids in porous media is essential for a broad range of applications, from drug delivery to contaminant remediation. Chemical gradients are ubiquitous in these environments, arising from reactions, precipitation/dissolution, or salinity contrasts, and can drive particle motion via diffusiophoresis. Yet our current understanding mostly comes from idealized settings with sharply imposed solute gradients, whereas in porous media, flow disorder enhances solute dispersion, and leads to diffuse solute fronts. This raises a central question: does front dispersion suppress diffusiophoretic migration of colloids in dead-end pores, rendering the effect negligible at larger scales? We address this question using an idealized one-dimensional dead-end geometry. We derive an analytical model for the spatiotemporal evolution of colloids subjected to slowly varying solute fronts and validate it with numerical simulations and microfluidic experiments. Counterintuitively, we find that diffuseness of solute front enhances removal from dead-end pores: although smoothing reduces instantaneous gradient magnitude, it extends the temporal extent of phoretic forcing, yielding a larger cumulative drift and higher clearance efficiency than sharp fronts. Our results highlight that solute dispersion does not weaken the phoretic migration of colloids from dead-end pores, pointing to the potential relevance of diffusiophoresis at larger scales, with implications for filtration, remediation, and targeted delivery in porous media.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous Wettability Alters Methane Migration and Leakage in Shallow Aquifers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Capillary heterogeneity is increasingly recognized as a first-order control on gas plume migration and trapping in aquifers and storage formations. We show that spatial variability in the water-methane contact angle, determined by mineralogy and salinity, alters capillary entry pressures and migration pathways. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we estimate contact angles on quartz and kaolinite under fresh and saline conditions and incorporate these results into continuum-scale multiphase flow simulations via a contact-angle-informed Leverett J function, mapping wettability directly onto continuum-scale flow properties. Accounting for contact angle heterogeneity affects methane behavior: mobile and residually trapped methane in aquifers decrease by up to 10 percent, while leakage to the atmosphere increases by as much as 20 percent. The magnitude of this effect depends on permeability contrast, leakage rate, salinity, and facies proportions. By coupling molecular-scale wettability to continuum-scale flow and transport, this cross-scale framework provides a physically grounded basis for groundwater protection and risk assessment and yields more reliable emissions estimates. The approach can be generalized to other subsurface gas transport problems, including hydrogen and carbon dioxide storage, as well as natural releases such as methane from permafrost thaw.</description>

      <title>Amides from the carbonaceous asteroid (162173) Ryugu: nanoscale spectral and isotopic characterizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11471v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: C-type asteroids, such as asteroid (162173) Ryugu, may have played a key role in delivering light elements to early Earth. Nitrogen (N)-bearing molecules have been chemically identified in some Ryugu grains, and based on the faint 3.06 um absorption band observed by the hyperspectral microscope MicrOmega, NH-bearing compounds appear to be globally distributed. However, the chemical forms of these NH-bearing compounds - whether organic molecules, ammonium (NH4+) salts, NH4+- or NH-organic-bearing phyllosilicates, or other forms - remain to be clarified. We report the characterization of two Ryugu particles (C0050 and C0052) using infrared spectroscopy at millimeter, micrometer, and nanometer scales, combined with NanoSIMS to constrain the nature and origin of NH-bearing components. Ryugu's C0052 particle contains rare (~1 vol.%) micrometer-sized NH-rich organic compounds with peaks at 1660 cm-1 (C=O stretching, amide I) and 1550 cm-1 (N-H bending, amide II), indicative of amides, absent in C0050. N isotopic analysis shows these amides are depleted in 15N (d15N ~ -200 permil), confirming their indigenous origin. The amides may have formed by hydrothermal alteration of carboxylic acids and amines on Ryugu's parent body or by irradiation of 15N-depleted N-bearing ice in the outer Solar System or interstellar medium. Such amides delivered by primitive small bodies may have contributed to prebiotic chemistry on early Earth.</description>
