      <title>The Bright Side of Timed Opacity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12240v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 2009, Franck Cassez showed that the timed opacity problem, where an attacker can observe some actions with their timestamps and attempts to deduce information, is undecidable for timed automata (TAs). Moreover, he showed that the undecidability holds even for subclasses such as event-recording automata. In this article, we consider the same definition of opacity for several other subclasses of TAs: with restrictions on the number of clocks, of actions, on the nature of time, or on a new subclass called observable event-recording automata. We show that opacity can mostly be retrieved, except for one-action TAs and for one-clock TAs with $\epsilon$-transitions, for which undecidability remains. We then exhibit a new decidable subclass in which the number of observations made by the attacker is limited.</description>

      <title>Deciding the synthesis problem for hybrid games through bisimulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05498v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hybrid games are games played on a finite graph endowed with real variables which may model behaviors of discrete controllers of continuous systems. The synthesis problem for hybrid games is decidable for classical objectives (like LTL formulas) when the games are initialized singular, meaning that the slopes of the continuous variables are piecewise constant and variables are reset whenever their slope changes. The known proof adapts the region construction from timed games. In this paper we show that initialized singular games can be reduced, via a sequence of alternating bisimulations, to timed games, generalizing the known reductions by bisimulation from initialized singular automata to timed automata. Alternating bisimulation is the generalization of bisimulation to games, accomodating a strategy translation lemma by which, when two games are bisimilar and carry the same observations, each strategy in one of the games can be translated to a strategy in the second game such that all the outcomes of the second strategy satisfies the same property that are satisfied by the first strategy. The advantage of the proposed approach is that one may then use realizability tools for timed games to synthesize a winning strategy for a given objective, and then use the strategy translation lemma to obtain a winning strategy in the hybrid game for the same objective.</description>

      <title>Submonoid Membership in n-dimensional lamplighter groups and S-unit equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07077v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that Submonoid Membership is decidable in n-dimensional lamplighter groups $(\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}) \wr \mathbb{Z}^n$ for any prime $p$ and integer $n$. More generally, we show decidability of Submonoid Membership in semidirect products of the form $\mathcal{Y} \rtimes \mathbb{Z}^n$, where $\mathcal{Y}$ is any finitely presented module over the Laurent polynomial ring $\mathbb{F}_p[X_1^{\pm}, \ldots, X_n^{\pm}]$. Combined with a result of Shafrir (2024), this gives the first example of a group $G$ and a finite index subgroup $\widetilde{G} \leq G$, such that Submonoid Membership is decidable in $\widetilde{G}$ but undecidable in $G$.
  To obtain our decidability result, we reduce Submonoid Membership in $\mathcal{Y} \rtimes \mathbb{Z}^n$ to solving S-unit equations over $\mathbb{F}_p[X_1^{\pm}, \ldots, X_n^{\pm}]$-modules. We show that the solution set of such equations is effectively $p$-automatic, extending a result of Adamczewski and Bell (2012). As an intermediate result, we also obtain that the solution set of the Knapsack Problem in $\mathcal{Y} \rtimes \mathbb{Z}^n$ is effectively $p$-automatic.</description>
