      <title>Spherical Balls Settling Through a Quiescent Cement Paste Measured by X-ray Tomography: Influence of the Paste Thixotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The settling of spherical balls in quiescent cement pastes of increasing age is studied. Metallic spheres with radii of 2, 2.5 and 3mm are dropped into the paste and allowed to settle, while their position is tracked using X-ray tomography. The instantaneous velocity of the spheres, calculated from their movement, is observed to be quasi-constant during their fall, and an average is estimated. The results show that the average velocity of the balls decreases logarithmically with paste age until ball stoppage, for all three ball sizes. In parallel, the rheological properties of the cement paste are measured using a rheometer with a vane geometry. The evolution of the paste static yield stress over time is evaluated, and proves to be a reliable predictor for ball stoppage. Finally, thixotropic models of increasing complexity are evaluated. These models consider four forms of structural growth and breakdown parameters, and their ability to capture the ball settling velocity as a function of paste age is compared. This emphasizes the importance of considering paste breakdown in relation to shearing of the paste when the ball passes through it.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Multi-Agent AI for High-Throughput Polymer Informatics: From Property Prediction to Generative Design Across Synthetic and Bio-Polymers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an integrated multiagent AI ecosystem for polymer discovery that unifies high-throughput materials workflows, artificial intelligence, and computational modeling within a single Polymer Research Lifecycle (PRL) pipeline. The system orchestrates specialized agents powered by state-of-the-art large language models (DeepSeek-V2 and DeepSeek-Coder) to retrieve and reason over scientific resources, invoke external tools, execute domain-specific code, and perform metacognitive self-assessment for robust end-to-end task execution. We demonstrate three practical capabilities: a high-fidelity polymer property prediction and generative design pipeline, a fully automated multimodal workflow for biopolymer structure characterization, and a metacognitive agent framework that can monitor performance and improve execution strategies over time. On a held-out test set of 1,251 polymers, our PolyGNN agent achieves strong predictive accuracy, reaching R2 = 0.89 for glass-transition temperature (Tg ), R2 = 0.82 for tensile strength, R2 = 0.75 for elongation, and R2 = 0.91 for density. The framework also provides uncertainty estimates via multiagent consensus and scales with linear complexity to at least 10,000 polymers, enabling high-throughput screening at low computational cost. For a representative workload, the system completes inference in 16.3 s using about 2 GB of memory and 0.1 GPU hours, at an estimated cost of about $0.08. On a dedicated Tg benchmark, our approach attains R2 = 0.78, outperforming strong baselines including single-LLM prediction (R2 = 0.67), group-contribution methods (R2 = 0.71), and ChemCrow (R2 = 0.66). We further demonstrate metacognitive control in a polystyrene case study, where the system not only produces domain-level scientific outputs but continually monitors and optimizes its own behavior through tactical, strategic, and meta-strategic self-assessment.</description>

      <title>Microfluidic Fabrication and Analysis of Biocompatible, Monodisperse DNA-Hydrogels with Tunable Swelling and Dissolution Kinetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stimulus-responsive DNA-hydrogels with swelling capabilities are a promising class of materials for biomedical applications such as drug delivery and biosensing. Designing these systems remains challenging because fabrication methods must be simultaneously biocompatible and conserve scarce DNA materials, even at the microscale. Moreover, stimulus-induced swelling must be precisely controlled and shown to drive measurable changes in molecular properties. We present a biocompatible fabrication and characterization method for micron-scale DNA-hydrogels with tunable isotropic swelling and dissolving properties. We first developed a fabrication method demonstrating that both the hydrogel composition and the fabrication process itself are biocompatible, while also minimizing the consumption of valuable DNA reagents. We then demonstrated modular control over isotropic swelling in micron-scale DNA microgels, achieving up to a two-fold size increase with tunable swelling through defined design parameters. We further established a quantitative workflow to measure structural changes of spherical, swollen and unswelled microgels leveraging the diffusive properties of a DNA-binding dye. Finally, we demonstrate tunable dissolving of microgels and quantitatively reveal various experimental factors that influence dissolution rates beyond what is traditionally considered in microgel experiments. Together, these advances establish a biocompatible platform for the fabrication and analysis of stimulus-responsive DNA micro-hydrogels, providing a foundation for their future use in drug delivery, biosensing, and related biomedical technologies.</description>

      <title>Plasticity, hysteresis, and recovery mechanisms in spider silk fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spider silk is a remarkable biomaterial with exceptional stiffness, strength, and toughness stemming from a unique microstructure. While recent studies show that silk fibers exhibit plasticity, hysteresis, and recovery under cyclic loading, the underlying microstructural mechanisms are not yet fully understood. In this work, we propose a mechanism explaining the loading-unloading-relaxation response through microstructural evolution: initial loading distorts intermolecular bonds, resulting in a linear elastic regime. Upon reaching the yield stress, these bonds dissociate and the external load is transferred to the polypeptide chains, which deform entropically to allow large deformations. Unloading is driven by entropic shortening until a traction free state with residual stretch is achieved. Subsequently, the fiber recovers as chains reorganize and bonds reform, locking the microstructure into a new stable equilibrium that increases stiffness in subsequent cycles. Following these mechanisms, we develop a microscopically motivated, energy-based model that captures the macroscopic response of silk fibers under cyclic loading. The response is decoupled into two parallel networks: (1) an elasto-plastic network of inter- and intramolecular bonds governing the initial stiffness and yield stress, and (2) an elastic network of entropic chains that enable large deformations. The model is validated against experimental data from Argiope bruennichi dragline silk. The findings from this work are three-fold: (1) explaining the mechanisms that govern hysteresis and recovery and linking them to microstructural evolution; (2) quantifying the recovery process of the fiber, which restores and enhances mechanical properties; and (3) establishing a predictive foundation for engineering synthetic fibers with customized properties.</description>

      <title>Many-body contributions to polymorphism and polyhexaticity in a water monolayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanoconfined water plays a crucial role in nanofluidics, biology, and cutting-edge technologies. The process of melting water monolayers and quasi-two-dimensional confined water involves, as an intermediate stage, the hexatic phase--a state that lies between solid and liquid and is characterized by quasi-long-range orientational order and short-range translational order. However, the influence of hydrogen bond (HB) cooperativity in this process has not been thoroughly investigated. This gap hampers our understanding of the phase behavior of confined water and limits the accuracy of our models. To address this, we extend the water model developed by Franzese and Stanley, which explicitly includes many-body interactions (MBIs) of HBs. We distinguish the contributions of three-body and five-body HB-MBIs. Our Monte Carlo calculations in the isobaric-isothermal ensemble produces a detailed pressure-temperature phase diagram, revealing polymorphism and polyhexaticity: low-density square ice and high-density triangular ice are separated from the liquid phase by distinct hexatic phases. Three-body interactions notably promote crystallization and can destabilize the low-density hexatic phase, while cooperative five-body interactions help restore it, thus modifying the thermodynamic landscape. These findings demonstrate that HB-MBIs are key in determining the phase behavior of confined water, influencing phenomena such as the non-monotonic specific heat, maximum density lines, and the accessibility of the liquid-liquid critical point. Beyond advancing theoretical understanding, these results have wide-ranging implications for nanofluidics, interfacial science, and applications in biology, food technology, and pharmaceutics, where controlling water under confinement is essential.</description>

      <title>Unified origin of negative energetic elasticity in a lattice polymer chain: soft self-repulsion and bending stiffness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a single lattice polymer chain under a fixed end-to-end distance, incorporating both Domb--Joyce (DJ) soft-core self-repulsion between polymer segments and a local bending-energy cost. By decomposing the stiffness into energetic and entropic contributions, we survey the parameter space defined by the self-repulsion strength and bending-energy cost. We find that the energetic contribution to stiffness is negative across the entire explored range, whereas the entropic contribution remains positive. These results unify two previously independent mechanisms of negative energetic elasticity -- solvent-induced self-repulsion and bending stiffness -- and demonstrate that either mechanism alone, as well as their combination, produces the same sign. Beyond this sign-level unification, we analyze the internal-energy scaling and show that, in the absence of the bending-energy term, the DJ (self-repulsion) limit exhibits a robust $(n-r)^{7/4}/n$ scaling collapse. In contrast, the introduction of finite bending stiffness progressively disrupts this scaling, providing an internal-energy-based diagnostic to distinguish between contributions from self-repulsion and bending stiffness.</description>

      <title>Plateau moduli of Kremer-Grest models for commodity polymer melts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We estimate the plateau moduli of highly entangled end-pinned bead-spring polymer melts with Z = 100 and Z = 200 from the time-dependent elastic response to a step strain, which we first extrapolate to infinite time and then interpolate to zero strain. We present data for systems deformed in the melt state as well as for systems deformed at the primitive path level following the recent iPPA protocol. We observe excellent agreement between the plateau moduli obtained via the two deformation protocols and good agreement with the available experimental data for commodity polymer melts using a common mapping on the Kuhn scale.</description>

      <title>Soft 3D Metamaterial for Low-Frequency Elastic Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Acoustic metamaterials offer exceptional control over wave propagation, but their potential remains unfulfilled due to fabrication constraints. Conventional processes yield mostly rigid, planar structures, whereas soft-matter alternatives have so far been confined to ultrasounds. This work overcomes prior limitations with a fully soft 3D metamaterial operating around 200Hz. The design combines a 3D-printed elastomer lattice with resonant inclusions of liquid metal, injected via a network of mesofluidic channels. Its dynamic response is derived from a hybrid strategy uniting a lumped-element model with finite element analysis. Simulations reveal how the dual-phase design decouples flexural and torsional modes, opening a subwavelength band gap for low-frequency elastic waves. Empirical validation is achieved via a custom camera-based vibrometer. Its high spatiotemporal resolution and full-field capabilities enable direct capture of local modes and evanescent waves underlying the band gap. Accelerometer data corroborate these findings and demonstrate greater attenuation than common silicone elastomers at only half of the density. By combining scalable fabrication, compliance, and operations at frequencies relevant to human tactile perception, this novel metamaterial paves the way for lightweight, high-performance cushioning and handles that protect users from harmful vibration exposure.</description>

      <title>From shape to fate: making bacterial swarming expansion predictable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microbial swarming on mucosal surfaces reshapes microbial communities and influences mucosal healing and antibiotic tolerance. Yet even with time-lapse microscopy and deep learning, analyses of swarming colonies remain descriptive and cannot forecast how their fronts reorganize in time. This limitation is significant because the advancing edge determines access to nutrients, host tissue and competing microbes. We recast the expansion of Enterobacter sp. SM3 swarms as a problem of morphological forecasting, and assemble SwarmEvo, a time-lapse dataset represented as boundary-resolved segmentations. TexPol--Net, a texture- and geometry-aware segmentation model, sharpens diffuse edges and preserves fingered fronts, creating a stable substrate for dynamics. On this representation, we develop Morpher, an autoregressive forecasting network with a ``Morphon'' memory that links local curvature to long-range temporal dependencies. Morpher outperforms leading video-prediction models in maintaining front localization and anisotropic branching, and modest segmentation improvements yield noticeably more stable forecasts. Ablations across sequence models, inference strategies and observation ratios show that attention-based architectures with structural memory best preserve dense-finger propagation. By uniting geometry-aware segmentation with morphology-level forecasting, this framework turns swarming expansion into a predictive dynamical system, enabling quantitative interrogation and potential control of microbial collectives during mucosal repair and gut ecosystem engineering.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.01414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I study via Langevin dynamics simulations two opposite cases of systems of particles that alternate their identity according to density dependent motility (DDM) rules and interact via a soft repulsive potential. In the correlated case, dilute regions are passive and dense regions are active, while in the anti-correlated case, dilute regions are active and dense regions are passive. I classify the emerging steady states, explain the principal phase transitions, and finally suggest directions for further investigation.</description>

      <title>Freezing-Melting Mediated Dewetting Transition for Droplets on Superhydrophobic Surfaces with Condensation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The water-repellence properties of superhydrophobic surfaces make them promising for many applications. However, in some extreme environments, such as high humidities and low temperatures, condensation on the surface is inevitable, which induces the loss of surface superhydrophobicity. In this study, we propose a freezing-melting strategy to achieve the dewetting transition from the Wenzel state to the Cassie-Baxter state. It requires freezing the droplet by reducing the substrate temperature and then melting the droplet by heating the substrate. The condensation-induced wetting transition from the Cassie-Baxter state to the Wenzel state is analyzed first. Two kinds of superhydrophobic surfaces, i.e., single-scale nano-structured superhydrophobic surface and hierarchical-scale micro-nano-structured superhydrophobic surface, are compared and their effects on the static contact states and impact processes of droplets are analyzed. The mechanism for the dewetting transition is analyzed by exploring the differences in the micro/nano-structures of the surfaces and it is attributed to the unique structure and strength of the superhydrophobic surface. These findings will enrich our understanding of the droplet-surface interaction involving phase changes and have great application prospects for the design of superhydrophobic surfaces.</description>

      <title>Depth and slip ratio dependencies of friction for a sphere rolling on a granular slope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally investigate the dynamics of a sphere rolling down a granular slope by varying the initial velocity, slope angle, and sphere density. The results show that the sphere rolls down with constant deceleration while sinking into the granular bed. $\delta/R$ (the sinking depth $\delta$ normalized to the sphere radius $R$) is scaled by the sphere density normalized by the bulk density of the granular layer. To evaluate the translational energy dissipation, we introduce an effective friction coefficient $\mu_\mathrm{d}$. We demonstrate that $\mu_\mathrm{d}$ decreases with increasing the slope angle and the slip ratio. Furthermore, systematic measurements over a wide range of sphere densities reveal that $\mu_\mathrm{d}$ increases linearly with $\delta/R$ : $\mu_\mathrm{d}=\beta(\delta/R)+\mu_0$. The value of $\mu_0$ is linearly decreasing with slip ratio and its coefficient $\beta(\simeq0.41)$ does not vary significantly. The results suggest that the normalized depth and slip ratio determine the effective friction of a rolling sphere.</description>

      <title>A Three-State Thermodynamically Consistent Cross-Bridge Model for Muscle Contraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Muscle contraction is a prototypical multiscale chemomechanical process in which ATP hydrolysis at the molecular level drives force generation and mechanical work at larger scales. A long-standing challenge is to connect microscopic cross-bridge dynamics to macroscopic observables while retaining an explicit, thermodynamically consistent energetic budget for chemical-to-mechanical transduction. Here we use the Energetic Variational Approach (EnVarA) to unify Hill's cycle-affinity viewpoint with Huxley's sliding-filament mechanics within a single thermodynamically closed framework. We formulate a three-state Fokker--Planck-jump description for cross-bridge populations evolving on state-dependent free-energy landscapes, in which ATP hydrolysis enters through local detailed balance and biases the transition rates. Filament sliding velocity is incorporated as a convective transport mechanism in the Fokker--Planck dynamics, so that mechanical power exchange with the external motion emerges transparently from the resulting energy-dissipation law together with chemical input and irreversible dissipation. Under chemostatted conditions and a fast-equilibration closure for the attached substates, the model reduces to a closed two-state molecular motor description; in a further singular limit, this reduction recovers a Huxley-type transport-reaction equation. Proof-of-concept simulations of the reduced model reproduce a Hill-like force-velocity relation and show how ATP availability modulates the force-velocity curve while preserving its characteristic Hill-type shape.</description>

      <title>Rheologically tuned diffusion modulates quorum sensing in Vibrio fischeri</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how the physical properties of a fluid influence bacterial behavior is essential for explaining how microorganisms interact with their environment and with animal hosts. Here, we examine how changes in fluid viscosity and rheological properties affect the locomotion of the marine bacterium Vibrio fischeri and its ability to produce luminescence through cell--cell communication. We track the three-dimensional motion of single cells in well-defined fluids with different physical properties and measure the luminescence emitted by cell populations. We find that fluids with higher viscosity cause V. fischeri to spend more time in a slower, turning-focused swimming mode, which reduces how effectively cells spread out and encounter the chemical signals required to activate luminescence. As a result, luminescence first increases and then decreases in Newtonian fluids, but decreases monotonically in fluids that exhibit non-Newtonian rheological behavior. Computer simulations based on our measurements confirm that the ability of cells to explore their surroundings plays a central role in determining when and how strongly they communicate. These findings reveal a direct link between the physical environment, bacterial movement, and collective behavior, and offer new insight into how microorganisms adapt to complex fluid habitats, including those found inside animal hosts.</description>

      <title>Predicting the hydrogen bond strength from water reorientation dynamics at short timescales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Path-integral molecular dynamics simulations and electronic structure-based energy decomposition analysis (EDA) are employed to connect hydrogen bond (H-bond) strength, its asymmetry, and the total delocalization energy at the water/air interface to experimentally measurable observables, such as the reorientation dynamics and the sum-frequency generation (SFG) spectrum. Using SFG spectra for distinct layers at the water/air interface, we validate the accuracy of our simulations and report a red-shift from the interface to bulk and a strongly bonded water peak at around 3250 cm$^{-1}$ in the layer closest to bulk. The reorientation dynamics of water molecules slow down from the interface to bulk, which correlates with the SFG results. From our EDA based on absolutely localized molecular orbitals, we observe a strong decline in total delocalization energy from bulk to the interface, as well as a decline in the strength of the strongest donor and acceptor interactions. The asymmetry between the two strongest interactions similarly rises towards the interface, while the importance of interactions from the outer solvation shells is greatly diminished and is lower than previously reported. Finally, we find that the strength of the strongest H-bond donor/acceptor is best correlated with the local minimum of the autocorrelation function resembling the L2 band librational motions. Following that, we propose a simple yet quantitative relationship between H-bond strength and the short-time reorientation dynamics at the water/air interface that could potentially be extended to predict H-bond strength in other hydrophobic systems from experimentally obtainable observables.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Machine Learning for Integrating Heterogeneous Analytical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding structure-property relationships in complex materials requires integrating complementary measurements across multiple length scales. Here we propose an interpretable "multimodal" machine learning framework that unifies heterogeneous analytical systems for end-to-end characterization, demonstrated on carbon nanotube (CNT) films whose properties are highly sensitive to microstructural variations. Quantitative morphology descriptors are extracted from SEM images via binarization, skeletonization, and network analysis, capturing curvature, orientation, intersection density, and void geometry. These SEM-derived features are fused with Raman indicators of crystallinity/defect states, specific surface area from gas adsorption, and electrical surface resistivity. Multi-dimensional visualization using radar plots and UMAP reveals clear clustering of CNT films according to crystallinity and entanglements. Regression models trained on the multimodal feature set show that nonlinear approaches, particularly XGBoost, achieve the best predictive accuracy under leave-one-out cross-validation. Feature-importance analysis further provides physically meaningful interpretations: surface resistivity is primarily governed by junction-to-junction transport length scales, crystallinity/defect-related metrics, and network connectivity, whereas specific surface area is dominated by intersection density and void size. The proposed multimodal machine learning framework offers a general strategy for data-driven, explainable characterization of complex materials.</description>

      <title>Superstable Geometry in Triadic Percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Triadic percolation turns bond percolation into a dynamical problem governed by an effective one-dimensional unimodal map. We show that the geometry of superstable cycles provides a direct, map-agnostic probe of local nonlinearity: specifically, the distance from the map's maximum to a distinguished next-to-maximum point on the attracting $2^n$-cycle (which coincides with a preimage of the maximum at $2^n$-superstability) scales as $|\Delta p|^{\gamma}$ with $\gamma = 1/z$, where $z$ is the nonflat order of the maximum. This prediction is verified across canonical unimodal families and heterogeneous triadic ensembles, with Lyapunov spectra corroborating the one-dimensional reduction. A derivative condition on the activation kernel fixes the local nonlinearity order $z$ (and thus, under standard unimodal-map hypotheses, the associated $z$-logistic universality class) and gives conditions under which $z&gt;2$ can be realized. The diagnostic operates directly on orbit data under standard regularity assumptions, providing a practical tool to classify universality in higher-order networks.</description>

      <title>Unbounded Systematic Error in Thin Film Conductivity Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02418v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electrical conductivity is the most fundamental charge transport parameter, and measurements of conductivity are a basic part of materials characterization for nearly all conducting materials. In thin films, conductivity is often measured in four bar architectures in which the current source and voltage measurement are spatially separated to eliminate systematic error due to contact resistance. Despite the apparent simplicity of these measurements, we demonstrate here that the four bar architecture is subject to significant systematic error arising from the finite conductivity of the metal electrodes. Remarkably, these systematic errors can in some cases become unbounded, producing arbitrarily high measured conductivity at modest true film conductivities, within the range relevant to emerging thin film thermoelectric materials such as conducting polymers. These unbounded errors, which can occur even in properly conducted four-point measurements of patterned films, likely explain literature reports of extremely high conductivities in conducting polymers, and can lead to anomalous scaling in temperature dependent studies, potentially leading to incorrect interpretation of the relevant charge transport mechanism. We characterize the device geometric factors that control these errors, which stand partially at odds with those required for accurate Seebeck coefficient measurements. Our analyses allow us to identify device architectures that provide small systematic errors for conductivity and Seebeck coefficient while still providing a low measurement resistance, critical to reducing noise in thermal voltage measurements. These findings provide important guidelines for accurate measurements in the growing field of thin-film thermoelectric materials.</description>

      <title>A Diffuse-Interface Method for Pore Dynamics in Lipid Membranes under Electric Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.03902</link>
      <description>arXiv:1611.03902v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a diffuse-interface continuum model for membrane electroporation that couples a phase field for pore geometry to a quasi-static electrolyte potential and a spatially varying leaky-dielectric model for the transmembrane voltage. The main contribution is a stabilized time-integration strategy for transmembrane voltage $V_m$: the stiff leakage term is treated implicitly while the electrolyte-to-membrane ionic current is lagged, yielding a closed-form update that removes the restriction imposed by the fast dielectric relaxation time. The electrolyte potential is computed efficiently using a semi-analytical spectral Laplace solver: a 2D DCT in the membrane plane reduces the 3D problem to independent 1D ODEs in $z$, solved in closed form and reconstructed by an inverse transform. The coupled method is robust under grid refinement, reproduces the sharp-interface critical-radius bifurcation, and captures electric-field focusing through conductive pores. We also demonstrate stochastic pore nucleation by adding thermal noise to the phase-field dynamics, enabling fully emergent electroporation events without prescribing initial defects.</description>

      <title>Aspect-ratio-dependent void formation in active rhomboidal and elliptical particle systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.00308v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We execute a numerical simulation on active nematics with particles interacting by an excluded volume effect. The systems with rhomboidal particles and that with elliptical particles are considered in order to investigate the effect of the direct contact of particles. In our simulation, the void regions, where the local number density is almost zero, appear in both systems when the aspect ratio of the particles is high. We focused on the relationship between the void regions and the particle orientation of the bulk. The particle number density, particle orientation, topological defects, and void regions are analyzed for different aspect ratios in both systems. The systems with rhomboidal particles have characteristic void sizes, which increase with an increase in the aspect ratio. In contrast, the distribution of the void-region size in the systems with elliptical particles is broad. The present results suggest that the void size in the systems with rhomboidal particles is determined by the correlation length of the particle orientational field around the void regions, while that might be determined by the system size in the systems with elliptical particles.</description>

      <title>Active Screws: Emergent Active Chiral Nematics of Spinning Self-Propelled Rods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12263v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Several types of active agents self-propel by spinning around their propulsion axis, thus behaving as active screws. Examples include cytoskeletal filaments in gliding assays, magnetically-driven colloidal helices, and microorganisms like the soil bacterium $\it{M. xanthus}$. Here, we develop a model for spinning self-propelled rods on a substrate, and we coarse-grain it to derive the corresponding hydrodynamic equations. If the rods propel purely along their axis, they form an active nematic at high density and activity. However, spinning rods can also roll sideways as they move. We find that this transverse motion turns the system into a chiral active nematic. Thus, we identify a mechanism whereby individual chirality can give rise to collective chiral flows. Finally, we analyze experiments on $\it{M. xanthus}$ colonies to show that they exhibit chiral flows around topological defects, with a chiral activity about an order of magnitude weaker than the achiral one. Our work reveals the collective behavior of active screws, which is relevant to colonies of social bacteria and groups of unicellular parasites.</description>

      <title>Likelihood-Based Heterogeneity Inference Reveals Non-Stationary Effects in Biohybrid Cell-Cargo Transport</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12976v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Variability of motility behavior in populations of microbiological agents is a ubiquitous phenomenon even in the case of genetically identical cells. Accordingly, passive objects introduced into such biological systems and driven by them will also exhibit heterogeneous motion patterns. Here, we study a biohybrid system of passive beads driven by active ameboid cells and use a likelihood approach to estimate the heterogeneity of the bead dynamics from their discretely sampled trajectories. We showcase how this approach can deal with information-scarce situations and provides natural uncertainty bounds for heterogeneity estimates. Using these advantages we particularly uncover that the heterogeneity in the system is time-dependent.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.26369v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Active matter has thrived in recent years, driven both by the insight that it underlies fundamental processes in nature, and by its vast potential for applications. This allows for innovation both inspired by experimental observations, and by construction of novel systems with desired properties. In this paper, we develop a novel system in the search for a new kind of pattern formation: microstructural motifs with orthogonal alignment. Taking a simple active Brownian particle (ABP) model applied to dumbbell-shaped particles, we add a quadrupolar interaction by positioning two antiparallel magnetic dipolar moments on each particle. We find that the phase behavior is determined by the competition between active motion and the orthogonal alignment favored by quadrupolar attraction. By varying these quantities, we are able to tune both the internal structure of the aggregates, and find a surprising stability of triangular aggregates, to the point of clusters of size $N=3$ being strongly overrepresented. Although none of the component particles are chiral, the resulting structures spin in a random, fixed direction due to combination of the polarity of the active motion. This results in an ensemble of windmilling (randomly spinning in a circular motion) aggregates with windmill-like shape (due to the three- or four core component dumbbells). Ultimately, this simple model shows an interesting range of microstructural motifs, with great potential for experimental implementations.</description>

Abstract: The difference between free surface energy and fracture toughness in amorphous silica is studied via multi-scale simulations. We combine the homogenization of a molecular dynamics fracture model with a phase-field approach to track and quantify the various energy contributions. We clearly separate free surface energy localized as potential energy on the surface and damage diffusion over a 16-23 A range around the crack path. The plastic contribution is negligible. These findings, which clarify brittle fracture mechanisms in amorphous materials, align with toughness measurements in silica.</description>

      <title>How individual vs shared coordination governs the degree of correlation in rotational vs residence times in a high-viscosity lithium electrolyte</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02457v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Commercially used carbonate-based electrolytes in lithium-ion batteries are susceptible to many challenges, including flammability, volatility, and lower thermal stability. Solvated ionic liquids of LiTFSI salt (lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)-amide) and glyme-based solvents are potential alternative candidates for commonly used electrolytes. We perform classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations study the effect of concentration and temperature on the translational and rotational dynamics. The radial distribution function shows stronger coordination of Li$^+$ ions with tetraglyme(G4), as shown in earlier studies, and forms a stable [Li(G4)]$^+$ cation complex. The self-diffusion coefficients are lower than the values experimentally observed but show better improvement over other classical force fields. An increase in the salt concentrations leads to a higher viscosity of the system and reduces the overall ionic mobility of Li$^{+}$ ions. Diluting the system with a larger number of glyme molecules leads to shorter rotational relaxation times for both TFSI and tetraglyme. Ion-residence times show that Li$^+$ ions form stable and long-lasting complexes with G4 molecules than TFSI anions. The residence time of [Li(G4)]$^+$ complex increases at higher salt concentrations due to the availability of fewer G4 molecules to coordinate with a Li$^+$ ion. G4 is also seen to form polydentate complexes with Li$^+$ without a shared coordination, allowing rotation without breaking coordination, unlike TFSI, which requires coordination disruption for rotation. This distinction explains the poor correlation between rotation and residence time for G4 and the strong correlation for TFSI.</description>
