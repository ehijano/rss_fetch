      <title>Production of Light Nuclei in Au+Au Collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = 7.7-27$ GeV from STAR BES-II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The studies of the production of light nuclei, such as deuteron and helium nuclei, in heavy-ion collisions are essential for understanding the dynamics of nuclear matter under extreme conditions. The yields and ratios of light nuclei serve as an effective method to distinguish between the thermal and coalescence models of light nuclei formation. Within the coalescence framework, the energy dependence of the coalescence parameters reflects the effective volume of the collision system, while in the thermal model yields are governed by chemical freeze-out conditions. The significantly larger datasets from the STAR Beam Energy Scan Phase II (BES-II), combined with enhanced detector capabilities, allow more precise and comprehensive measurements than phase I.
  In these proceedings, we present measurements of light nuclei production, including p, $\rm \bar{p}$, d, $\rm \bar{d}$, $\rm ^3He$, in Au+Au collisions at BES-II energies of $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = 7.7 - 27$ GeV. The results include centrality-dependent transverse momentum spectra and yields ($\mathrm{d}N/\mathrm{d}y$), along with coalescence parameters $B_\mathrm{A}$ and particle yield ratios. The physics implications of these results are discussed.</description>

      <title>Evidence for modest octupole deformation in $^{238}$U from high-energy heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel ``imaging-by-smashing" approach for probing nuclear deformation in high-energy heavy-ion collisions. By analyzing anisotropic-flow ($v_n$) and mean transverse momentum ($\left[p_T\right]$)-based observables in collisions of highly deformed $^{238} \mathrm{U}$ nucleus and nearly spherical $^{197} \mathrm{Au}$ nucleus, we extract the deformation parameters of $^{238}$U. The key observables include the variances $\left\langle v_n^2\right\rangle,\left\langle\left(\delta p_T\right)^2\right\rangle$, and the covariance $\left\langle v_n^2 \delta p_T\right\rangle$. Ratios of these observables between $^{238}$U+$^{238}$U and $^{197}$Au+$^{197}$Au collisions largely cancel final-state effects, thereby isolating the influence of nuclear deformation. We further report the first experimental indication of octupole deformation in $^{238}$U via $v_3$-based observables~\cite{2025rot}. The extracted deformation parameters, comparing with state-of-the-art hydrodynamic model calculations, are consistent with low-energy nuclear structure data. These results establish high-energy collisions as a powerful probe of nuclear shapes on femtosecond timescales.</description>

      <title>Measurements of Light Nuclei (d, t, $^3$He)-$\Lambda$ Correlations in Au+Au Collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=3$ GeV from STAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heavy-ion collisions offer a unique way to study hyperon-nucleon ($Y$-$N$) interactions through two-particle momentum correlations, which reveal the source's space-time structure and the effects of the final state interactions. Correlations between light nuclei (d, t, $^{3}$He) and $\Lambda$ provide insight into hypernuclei structure, binding energies, and many-body interactions that might be relevant to the inner structure of neutron stars. This work presents the first measurements of d-$\Lambda$, t-$\Lambda$, and $^{3}$He-$\Lambda$ correlations from $\sqrt{s_{_{\rm NN}}} = 3$ GeV Au+Au collisions collected in 2021 at STAR. Using the Lednicky-Lyuboshitz model, we extract source sizes and interaction parameters, shedding light on hyperon interactions and light hypernuclei structure.</description>

      <title>Constraining r-process nucleosynthesis via enhanced accuracy neutron-capture experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The isotopic abundances of r-process elements in the solar system are traditionally derived as residuals from the subtraction of s-process contributions from total solar abundances. However, the uncertainties in s-process nucleosynthesis -- particularly those arising from Maxwellian Averaged Cross Sections (MACS) -- propagate directly into the r-process residuals, affecting their reliability. Building upon the seminal work of Goriely (1999), who introduced a multi-event s-process model to quantify these uncertainties, we revisit the problem using a simplified yet effective approach. By assuming that the relative uncertainty in s-process isotopic abundances scales linearly with the MACS uncertainties from data libraries (KADoNiS), we identify a subset of isotopes for which the r-process residuals remain significantly uncertain. Using updated solar abundances (Lodders 2025) and s-process contributions from Bisterzo et al. (2014), we present a short list of isotopes that are prime candidates for improved (n,g) measurements at CERN n_TOF in the near future. Our analysis provides a practical framework for prioritizing future experimental efforts that will profit from upgrades and enhancements of the n_TOF facility. It also highlights the need to revisit key neutron-capture cross sections to refine our understanding of the r-process isotopic abundance pattern, commonly used as a benchmark in stellar models of explosive nucleosynthesis.</description>

      <title>Readout noise of digital frequency multiplexed TES detectors for CUPID</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07223v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconducting transition-edge sensor (TES) detectors have been the standard in Cosmic Microwave Background experiments for almost two decades and are now being adapted for use in nuclear physics, such as neutrinoless double beta decay searches. In this paper we focus on a new high-bandwidth frequency multiplexed TES readout system developed for CUPID, a neutrinoless double beta decay experiment that will replace CUORE. In order to achieve the high energy resolution requirements for CUPID, the readout noise of the system must be kept to a minimum. Low TES operating resistance and long wiring between the readout SQUID and the warm electronics are needed for CUPID, prompting a careful consideration of the design parameters of this application of frequency multiplexing. In this work, we characterize the readout noise of the newly designed frequency multiplexed TES readout system for CUPID and construct a noise model to understand it. We find that current sharing between the SQUID coil impedance and other branches of the circuit, as well as the long output wiring, worsen the readout noise of the system. To meet noise requirements, a SQUID with a low input inductance, high transimpedance and/or low dynamic impedance is needed, and the wiring capacitance should be kept as small as possible. Alternatively, the option of adding a cryogenic low-noise amplifier at the output of the SQUID should be explored.</description>

      <title>Experimental overview: quarkonia as probes for deconfinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09075v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The current status of the experimental investigation of quarkonia in heavy-ion collisions as probes for deconfinement is reviewed. The emphasis is put on the qualitative understanding of charmonia (ccbar bound states) and bottomonia (bbbar) based on the results in the past few years. In particular, the observation of non-primordial J/psi (ccbar) production as signature of deconfinement based on different observables and the sequential suppression patterns of the Upsilon (bbbar) states are discussed. An outlook focusing on the time scale until the next quark matter conference is provided.</description>

      <title>Rapidity spectra in high-energy collisions and longitudinal nuclear suppression from nonadditive statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02548v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the longitudinal nuclear suppression factor defined by a scaled ratio of rapidity distributions. To study this experimental observable, we describe three approaches involving numerical and analytical calculations. We first approach this problem by conducting model studies using EPOS, FTFP$_{BERT}$, and HIJING, and notice that while EPOS shows a decreasing trend of this ratio at forward/backward rapidities, the latter two model calculations display an increment of the ratio. The analytical approaches involve, first, the quasi-exponential distribution obtained from the Tsallis statistics, and second, the nonadditive Boltzmann transport equation in the relaxation time approximation. We notice that our analytical results satisfactorily describe NA61 experimental data (for $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$=6.3, 7.6, 8.8, 12.3, and 17.3 GeV) for the negatively charged pions.</description>

      <title>Off-line Commissioning of the St. Benedict Radiofrequency Quadrupole Cooler-Buncher</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08021v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The St. Benedict ion trapping system, which aims to measure the $\beta-\nu$ angular correlation parameter in superallowed-mixed mirror transitions, is under construction at the University of Notre Dame. These measurements will provide much-needed data to improve the accuracy of the $V_{ud}$ element of the CKM matrix. One of the major components of this system is the radio frequency quadrupole cooler-buncher, which is necessary to create low-emittance ion bunches for injection into the measurement Paul trap. The off-line commissioning of the cooler-buncher, using a potassium ion source, determined that the device could produce cooled ion bunches characterized by a 50-ns full-width-half-maximum time width. The commissioning results also determined the trapping efficiency to be 93(1)$\%$ and the trapping half-life to be 20.0(5) s.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of magic dressing of $^3$He</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02443v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A common concern in high-precision neutron electric dipole moment (nEDM) experiments is that of magnetic field stability. For static fields, this problem can be mitigated through the use of a superconducting holding field coil, which when operated in persistent current mode serves to stabilize the magnetic field. However, such a solution is not viable when time-varying magnetic fields are present, as is the case for the spin dressing mode of the proposed nEDMSF (nEDM super-fluid) experiment. This experiment features an oscillating magnetic field to dress the gyromagnetic ratios of $^3$He and neutrons to the same value, a condition known as critical dressing. Fluctuations in the dressing field amplitude have the potential to disrupt this condition. Here, we investigate a modification to spin dressing, termed ``magic dressing,'' which renders the system insensitive to small variations in dressing field amplitude. We further demonstrate the utility of this method for the single spin-species case using a sample of polarized $^3$He. We find a dramatic increase in transverse relaxation time in the presence of magnetic field gradients.</description>
