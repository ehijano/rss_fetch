      <title>The spatial string tension and its effects on screening correlators in a thermal QCD plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the spatial Wilson line correlator for 2+1 flavor QCD using highly improved staggered quark discretization for fermions and in quenched QCD for a wide range of temperatures, from the chiral crossover temperature $\mathrm{T_{pc}\simeq 156}$ MeV or the deconfinement temperature $\simeq 300$ MeV respectively, up to $2$ GeV. Extracting the spatial string tension for different lattice cut-offs and by performing a continuum extrapolation of this observable, we show that the soft (magnetic) gluons interact non-perturbatively even at temperatures $\gtrsim 1$ GeV. We provide incriminating evidences to demonstrate that dimensionally reduced effective theories can describe these soft quark and gluon quasi-particles for both quenched and $2+1$ flavor QCD, at temperatures $\mathrm{T\gtrsim 5T_{pc}}$. We also show for the first time the imprints of the non-perturbative pseudo-potential in the properties of mesonic screening masses for temperatures ranging from $0.8$-$164$ GeV in the quark-gluon plasma.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report our progress in combining a two-level sampling algorithm with distillation techniques for calculations of disconnected diagrams in quenched QCD. The simulations are performed on a single ensemble at $\beta=6.0$ and volume $V=16^3\times 64$, and at a pion mass of $m_\pi\approx 760~\mathrm{MeV}$.</description>

      <title>$\Delta I =1/2$ process of $K\to\pi\pi$ decay on multiple ensembles with periodic boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present our preliminary results for the $\Delta I = 1/2$ matrix elements of $K\to\pi\pi$ decay and $\varepsilon'$, the measure of direct $CP$ violation in $K\to\pi\pi$, computed on multiple ensembles with periodic boundary conditions (PBC) at the inverse lattice spacings of $a^{-1} \approx 1.0$~GeV and 1.4~GeV. The finer lattice ensemble is newly introduced as an extension to the first PBC calculation [1], while the calculation on the coarser ensemble is updated with the approximately doubled statistics. Our first attempt to take the continuum limit is also discussed with acknowledging potential significance of the $O(a^2)$ scaling violation on these coarse lattices.</description>

      <title>Discrete symmetry and 't Hooft anomalies for 3450 model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report our study of the discrete symmetry for lattice 3450 model proposed by Wang and Wen. Lattice 3450 model is expected to describe the anomaly free chiral U(1) gauge theory in 1+1 dimension using 2+1 dimensional domain-wall fermion with gapping interactions for the mirror sector. We find that the lattice model has exact discrete symmetry in addition to U(1) x U(1) symmetry. Assuming the Zumino-Stora procedure works also for discrete symmetry, we compute the full 't Hooft anomaly for the target continuum U(1) chiral gauge theory with the same discrete symmetry. We show that the mixed and self anomalies involving the discrete symmetry are absent, which is consistent with the expectation that the lattice 3450 produces chiral U(1) gauge theory in the continuum limit.</description>

      <title>SU(6) model revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the vacuum structure of the SU(6) model, a chiral gauge theory, from the perspective of anomaly matching. To this end, we first identify all possible 't Hooft anomalies in the UV theory using the Stora-Zumino procedure. Subsequently, we construct an effective theory by applying the idea of the Wess-Zumino-Witten action to derive the topological terms that encode the 't Hooft anomalies. As a result, we demonstrate that a low-energy effective theory reproducing one of the anomalies, namely the mixed anomaly, is described by a Z3-valued scalar field. On the other hand, the effective theory that accounts for the discrete chiral self-anomaly is significantly more intricate, and elucidating its structure remains an ongoing challenge.</description>

      <title>The perturbative computation of the gradient flow coupling for the twisted Eguchi-Kawai model with the numerical stochastic perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gradient flow method is a renormalization scheme in which the gauge field is flowed by the diffusion equation. The gradient flow scheme has benefits that the observables composed of flowed gauge fields do not require further renormalization and do not depend on the regularization. From the independence of the regularization, this scheme allows us to relate the lattice regularization and the dimensional regularization such as the $\overline{\mathrm{MS}}$ scheme. We compute the gradient flow coupling for the twisted Eguchi--Kawai model using the numerical stochastic perturbation theory. In this presentation we show the results of the perturbative coefficients of the gradient flow coupling and its flow time dependence. We investigate the beta function from the flow time dependence and discuss the lattice artifacts in the large flow time in taking the large-$N$ limit.</description>

      <title>Normalizing flows for SU($N$) gauge theories employing singular value decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a progress report on the use of normalizing flows for generating gauge field configurations in pure SU(N) gauge theories. We discuss how the singular value decomposition can be used to construct gauge-invariant quantities, which serve as the building blocks for designing gauge-equivariant transformations of SU(N) gauge links. Using this novel approach, we build representative models for the SU(3) Wilson action on a \( 4^4 \) lattice with \( \beta = 1 \). We train these models and provide an analysis of their performance, highlighting the effectiveness of the new technique for gauge-invariant transformations. We also provide a comparison between the efficiency of the proposed algorithm and the spectral flow of Wilson loops.</description>

      <title>Tensor-network Toolbox for probing dynamics of non-Abelian Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tensor-network methods are valuable Hamiltonian-simulation methods which enable probing dynamics of strongly-interacting quantum-many-body systems, including gauge theories, without encountering sign problems. They also have the potential to inform efficient quantum-simulation algorithms of the same theories. We develop and benchmark a matrix-product-state (MPS) ansatz for the SU(2) lattice gauge theory using the loop-string-hadron (LSH) framework. The LSH framework has been demonstrated to be advantageous in Hamiltonian simulation of non-Abelian gauge theories. It is applicable to varying gauge groups [SU(2) and SU(3)], boundary conditions, and in higher dimensions. In this work, we report on progress in achieving the continuum limit of the static observables in a SU(2) gauge theory in (1+1) D and pushing the boundary of dynamical studies. The current toolbox can be applied to studying scattering processes in this model. It can also be straightforwardly generalized to (2+1)D given the simplified constraints in an LSH framework.</description>

      <title>Split-even approach to the rare kaon decay $K \to \pi \ell^+ \ell^-$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years the rare kaon decay has been computed directly at the physical point. However, this calculation is currently limited by stochastic noise stemming from a light and charm quark loop GIM subtraction. The split-even approach is an alternative estimator for such loop differences, and has shown a large variance reduction in certain quantities. We present an investigation into the use of the split-even estimator in the calculation of the rare kaon decay.</description>

      <title>Scattering of SIMPlectic Dark Pions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the scattering of two identical pNGBs (pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone Bosons) in Sp(4) gauge theory with two mass-degenerate Dirac fermions in the pseudo-real fundamental representation. This theory serves as a realization of a SIMP (Strongly Interacting Massive Particles) Dark Matter model. SIMPs are an exciting dark matter candidate as they make use of a new relic density mechanism and provide potential solutions to the so-called small-scale structure problems. These theories are realized by a confining dark sector which includes non-perturbative signatures. While most of the research focuses on ChPT (Chiral Perturbation Theory), first-principle verification of these models is indispensable. In these proceedings we give an update on scattering properties in the most common channel and give an outlook on the projects that lie ahead.</description>

      <title>Scale setting of $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ Yang-Mills theories via Twisted Gradient Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present preliminary results for the scale setting of $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ Yang-Mills theories using twisted boundary conditions and the gradient-flow scale $\sqrt{t_0}$. The end goal of this study is to determine the $\mathrm{SU(N)}$ $\Lambda$-parameter through the step-scaling method. The scale $\sqrt{t_0}$, being defined from the flowed action density of the gauge fields, is correlated with their topological charge and thus could be affected by topological freezing. We deal with this problem with the Parallel Tempering on Boundary Conditions algorithm, which we found to be effective for the same numerical setup in a previous work.</description>

      <title>Towards more accurate $B_{(s)}\rightarrow\pi(K)$ and $D_{(s)}\rightarrow\pi(K)$ form factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present progress on the calculation of scalar, vector, and tensor form factors for the following meson decays: $B\rightarrow\pi$, $B_s\rightarrow K$, $D\rightarrow\pi$ and $D_s\rightarrow K$. This calculation uses the MILC HISQ gluon field ensembles with HISQ valence quarks. We generate ensembles of correlator data with varying lattice spacings, some as small as 0.044 fm. Some ensembles have a strange-to-light quark mass ratio of 5:1 and others use the physical light quark mass. The fully-relativistic, heavy-HISQ approach is used for the heavy quark, with simulation masses ranging from the charm to near the bottom. This heavy-HISQ approach provides nearly full coverage of the kinematic range.</description>

      <title>String Breaking in a $2+1$D $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Lattice Gauge Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: String breaking is an intriguing phenomenon crucial to the understanding of lattice gauge theories (LGTs), with strong relevance to both condensed matter and high-energy physics (HEP). Recent experiments investigating string breaking in $2+1$D (two spatial and one temporal dimensions) LGTs motivate a thorough analysis of its underlying mechanisms. Here, we perform matrix product state (MPS) simulations of string breaking in an experimentally relevant $2+1$D $\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGT in the presence of two external charges. We provide a detailed description of the system in the confined phase, highlight a number of mechanisms which are responsible for string breaking, and argue that magnetic fluctuations have a stabilizing effect on the strings. Moreover, we show that deep in the confined regime the problem is dual to one-dimensional free fermions hopping on an open chain. Our work elucidates the microscopic processes of string breaking in $2+1$D LGTs, and our findings can be probed on current superconducting-qubit quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Nonperturbative quantum gravity unlocked through computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Being able to perform explicit computations in a nonperturbative, Planckian regime is key to understanding quantum gravity as a fundamental theory of gravity and spacetime. Rather than a variety of different approaches to quantum gravity, what we primarily need is a gravitational analogue of the highly successful lattice treatment of nonperturbative quantum chromodynamics.
  Unsurprisingly, however, lattice quantum gravity is not simple. The crucial insight that has finally led to success is to build the dynamical and Lorentzian nature of spacetime into the lattices from the outset. Lattice quantum gravity based on causal dynamical triangulations (CDT) puts this idea into practice and is producing new and exciting physical results from numerical experiments.
  This largely nontechnical account describes the challenges and achievements of modern lattice quantum gravity, which has opened an unprecedented computational window on quantum spacetime in a Planckian regime and is reshaping our understanding of what it means to "solve" quantum gravity. This methodology is well placed to unlock the physics of the early universe from first principles. Related topics discussed are the difference between lattice and discrete quantum gravity, and the role of spacetime emergence in the light of computational results.</description>

      <title>CGAN-Based Framework for Meson Mass and Width Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are influential machine learning models that have gained prominence across various research fields, including high-energy physics (HEP) simulations. Among them, Conditional GANs (CGANs) offer a unique advantage by conditioning on specific parameters, making them particularly well-suited for meson studies. Given the limited size of the available meson dataset$ - $based on the quark content, quantum numbers, mass, and width$ - $this study, for the first time, applies the CGAN framework to augment the dataset of mesons, while preserving the inherent characteristics of the original data. Using this enhanced dataset, we employ the CGAN model to estimate the mass and width of both ordinary and exotic mesons, based solely on their quark content and quantum numbers. Our CGAN$ - $based predictions highlight the framework's potential as a reliable tool for meson property estimation, providing valuable insights for future research in particle physics.</description>

      <title>Study of symmetries in finite temperature $N_f=2$ QCD with M\"obius Domain Wall Fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06574v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on the ongoing study of symmetry of $N_f=2$ QCD around the critical temperature. Our simulations of $N_f = 2$ QCD employ the M\"obius domain-wall fermion action with residual mass $\sim 1\mbox{MeV}$ or less, maintaining a good chiral symmetry. Using the screening masses from the two point spatial correlators we compare the mass difference between channels connected through various symmetry transformations. Our analysis focuses on restoration of the $SU(2)_L\times SU(2)_R$ as well as anomalously broken axial $U(1)_A$. We also present additional study of a potential $SU(2)_{CS}$ symmetry which may emerge at sufficiently high temperatures.</description>

Abstract: The four-gluon one-particle irreducible Green function contributes to various quantities with phenomenological relevance. An example where the four-gluon plays a role is the determination of the gluon propagator, a basic building block for QCD, using continuum methods. This four leg Green function is poorly known and we are only starting to grasp its non-perturbative structure. Here, we report on the computation of the one-particle irreducible four-gluon Green function, in the Landau gauge, with lattice simulations. Besides stating the problems associated with the computation, several form factors that characterise this Green function are measured.</description>

      <title>Quantum Many-Body Scarring in a Non-Abelian Lattice Gauge Theory</title>

Abstract: Quantum many-body scarring (QMBS) is an intriguing mechanism of weak ergodicity breaking that has recently spurred significant attention. Particularly prominent in Abelian lattice gauge theories (LGTs), an open question is whether QMBS nontrivially arises in non-Abelian LGTs. Here, we present evidence of robust QMBS in a non-Abelian SU(2) LGT with dynamical matter. Starting in product states that require little experimental overhead, we show that prominent QMBS arises for certain quenches, facilitated through meson and baryon-antibaryon excitations, highlighting its non-Abelian nature. The uncovered scarred dynamics manifests as long-lived coherent oscillations in experimentally accessible local observables as well as prominent revivals in the state fidelity. Our findings bring QMBS to the realm of non-Abelian LGTs, highlighting the intimate connection between scarring and gauge symmetry, and are amenable for observation in a recently proposed trapped-ion qudit quantum computer.</description>
