      <title>Inflation with an Anomalyon and Primordial Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study inflation in a recently proposed gravitational effective field theory describing the trace anomaly. The theory requires an additional scalar which is massless in the early universe. This scalar -- referenced as an anomalyon -- couples to the familiar matter and radiation through the gauge field trace anomaly. We derive a class of cosmological solutions that deviate from the standard inflationary ones only slightly, in spite of the fact that the anomalyon has a sizable time dependent background. On the other hand, the scalar cosmological perturbations in this theory are different from the conventional inflationary perturbations. The inflaton and anomalyon perturbations mix, and one of the diagonal combinations gives the standard nearly scale-invariant adiabatic spectrum, while the other combination has a blue power spectrum at short distance scales. We argue that this blue spectrum can lead to the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs) at distance scales much shorter than the ones tested in CMB observations. The resulting PBHs can be heavy enough to survive to the present day universe. For natural values of the parameters involved the PBHs would constitute only a tiny fraction of the dark matter, but with fine-tunings perhaps all of dark matter could be accounted by them. We also show that the theory predicts primordial gravitational waves which are almost identical to the standard inflationary ones.</description>

      <title>Class $\mathcal{S}$ superconformal indices from maximal supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new gauging of maximal supergravity in five spacetime dimensions with gauge group containing ISO(5), involving the local scaling symmetry of the metric, and admitting a supersymmetric anti-de Sitter vacuum. We show this maximal supergravity to arise by consistent truncation of M-theory on the (non-spherical, non-parallelisable) six-dimensional geometry associated to a stack of $N$ M5-branes wrapped on a smooth Riemann surface. The existence of this truncation allows us to holographically determine the complete, universal spectrum of light operators of the dual four-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=2$ theory of class $\mathcal{S}$. We then compute holographically the superconformal index of the dual field theory at large-$N$, finding perfect agreement with previously known field theory results in specific limits.</description>

      <title>Two types of domain walls in $\mathcal{N}=1$ super-QCD: how they are classified and counted</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study multiplicities and junctions of BPS domain walls interpolating between different chiral vacua in $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetric QCD (SQCD) with the SU$(N)$ gauge group and a varying number of fundamental quarks. Depending on the number of flavors $F$ two distinct classes of {\em degenerate} domain walls emerge: (i) locally distinguishable, i.e. those which differ from each other locally, in local experiments; and (ii) those which have identical local structure and are differentiated only topologically, through judicially chosen compactifications. In the first class two-wall junctions exit while in the second class such junctions do not exist. Acharya and Vafa counted {\em topologically distinguishable} walls in pure super-Yang-Mills. Ritz, Shifman and Vainshtein counted the {\em locally distinguishable} walls in $F=N$ SQCD. In both cases the multiplicity of $k$ walls was the same, $\nu_{N,k}^\text{walls}= N!/\big[(N-k)!k!\big]$.
  We study the general case $0\leqslant F\leqslant N$, with mixed sets of walls from both classes (i) and (ii) simultaneously, and demonstrate that the above overall multiplicity remains intact. We argue that the growth of the quark masses exhibits no phase transition at any finite masses. The locally distinguishable walls can turn into topologically distinguishable only at $m=\infty$. An evolution of the low-energy wall world sheet theory in passage from small to large $m$ is briefly discussed. We also propose a candidate for the low-energy description of wall junctions.
  The tools used are localization of instantons, supersymmetry enhancement on the walls, and circle compactification.</description>

      <title>Tensionless strings on $AdS_3 \times S^3 \times S^3 \times S^1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose that string theory on ${\rm AdS}_3 \times {\rm S}^3 \times {\rm S}^3 \times {\rm S}^1$ with $\textit{two}$ units of NS-NS flux through each of the two $3$-spheres is exactly dual to the symmetric orbifold of $2$ bosons and $8$ free fermions. Here, one of the two bosons describes the compact ${\rm S}^1$, while the other one corresponds to the radial (non-compact) direction of ${\rm AdS}_3$. Unlike the analogous situation for ${\rm AdS}_3 \times {\rm S}^3 \times \mathbb{T}^4$, the description makes sense both in the NS-R as well as the hybrid formulation, and we explain the duality in both frameworks.</description>

      <title>Anyons on M5-Probes of Seifert 3-Orbifolds via Flux Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We observe that there is a rigorous derivation of (abelian) anyonic quantum states, hence of "topological order", on the 1+2-dimensional fixed locus of M5-probes wrapped over a trivially Seifert-fibered 3-orbifold singularity.
  Similar statements have previously been conjectured by appeal to the unknown dynamics of "coincident" M5-branes, but neglecting effects of flux-quantization that, as we highlight, entail anyonic solitons already in the rigorously tractable case of single M5-brane probes.
  This is possible after globally completing the "self-dual" tensor field on probe M5-branes by flux quantization in the non-abelian cohomology theory called equivariant twistorial Cohomotopy, which is admissible by recent results.</description>

      <title>On the stability of holographic confinement with magnetic fluxes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the stability properties of a very simple holographic model for a confining field theory. The gravity dual consists of an Abelian gauge field, with non-trivial magnetic flux, coupled to six-dimensional gravity with a negative cosmological constant. We construct a one-parameter family of regular solitonic solutions, where the gauge field carries flux along a compact circle that smoothly shrinks at a finite value of the holographic direction, introducing a confinement scale in the dual effective four-dimensional field theory. The free energy of these solitonic backgrounds is compared to that of domain-wall solutions representing a five-dimensional conformal field theory. This reveals a zero-temperature first-order phase transition in the dual field theory, separating confining and conformal phases.
  We compute the spectrum of bound states by analysing field fluctuations in the gravity background, after dimensional reduction on the circle. The lightest states are a scalar and a vector particle. A tachyonic instability emerges near a turning point in the free energy, where its concavity changes. The phase transition prevents the realisation of this instability. Within the stable portion of parameter space, all bound states, including the lightest scalar, have masses comparable to other dynamical scales. Near the phase transition and beyond, in metastable and unstable regions, we find deviations in the mass of the lightest scalar, suggesting it couples to the trace of the stress-energy tensor in the field theory, consistently with its interpretation as an approximate dilaton.</description>

      <title>Fermionic Spencer Cohomologies of D=11 Supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We combine the theory of Cartan-Tanaka prolongations with the Molien-Weyl integral formula and Hilbert-Poincar\'e series to compute the Spencer cohomology groups of the $D=11$ Poincar\'e superalgebra $\mathfrak p$, relevant for superspace formulations of $11$-dimensional supergravity in terms of nonholonomic superstructures. This includes novel fermionic Spencer groups, providing with new cohomology classes of $\mathbb Z$-grading $1$ and form number $2$. Using the Hilbert-Poincar\'e series and the Euler characteristic, we also explore Spencer cohomology contributions in higher form numbers. We then propose a new general definition of filtered deformations of graded Lie superalgebras along first-order fermionic directions and investigate such deformations of $\mathfrak p$ that are maximally supersymmetric. In particular, we establish a no-go type theorem for maximally supersymmetric filtered subdeformations of $\mathfrak p$ along timelike (i.e., generic) first-order fermionic directions.</description>

      <title>An entropic puzzle in periodic dilaton gravity and DSSYK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study 2d dilaton gravity theories with a periodic potential, with special emphasis on sine dilaton gravity, which is holographically dual to double-scaled SYK. The periodicity of the potentials implies a symmetry under (discrete) shifts in the momentum conjugate to the length of geodesic slices. This results in divergences. The correct definition is to gauge this symmetry. This discretizes the geodesic lengths. Lengths below a certain threshold are null states. Because of these null states, the entropy deviates drastically from Bekenstein-Hawking and the Hilbert space becomes finite dimensional. The spacetimes have a periodic radial coordinate. These are toy models of 2d quantum cosmology with a normalizable wavefunction. We study two limiting dualities: one between flat space quantum gravity and the Heisenberg algebra, and one between topological gravity and the Gaussian matrix integral. We propose an exact density of states for certain classes of periodic dilaton gravity models.</description>

      <title>Tensor global symmetries and the Stueckelberg mechanism for tensor fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the concept of tensor global symmetries, featuring conserved currents of mixed symmetry and higher spin Nambu-Goldstone bosons. We develop a Stueckelberg mechanism for mixed symmetry tensor fields at the linearized level, focusing on the massive graviton, the massive $(2,1)$ Curtright field and the massive $(2,2)$ field. Counting degrees of freedom, we identify the set of fields that necessarily appear in the gauge invariant Stueckelberg action in each case. These fields transform under shift symmetries and they are a vector and a scalar in the first case, a graviton, a Kalb-Ramond field and a vector in the second case and a Curtright field and a graviton in the third case. The analysis results in gauge invariant and fully conserved currents of mixed symmetry for the corresponding gauge theories, which are linked to their tensor global symmetries and they can be minimally coupled to suitable background fields. Viewing the graviton and the Kalb-Ramond field as Nambu-Goldstone bosons for constant symmetric and antisymmetric shift symmetries, we use a nonminimal coupling to uncover a 't Hooft anomaly in linearized gravity.</description>

      <title>Off-shell minimal form factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study off-shell n-particle form factors of half-BPS operators built from n complex scalar fields at the two-loop order in the planar maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory (sYM). These are known as minimal form factors. We construct their representation as a sum of independent scalar Feynman integrals relying on two complementary techniques. First, by going to the Coulomb branch of the theory by employing the spontaneous symmetry breaking which induces masses, but only for external particles while retaining masslessness for virtual states propagating in quantum loops. For a low number of external legs, this entails an uplift of massless integrands to their massive counterparts. Second, utilizing the N=1 superspace formulation of the N=4 sYM and performing algebra of covariant derivatives off-shell. Both techniques provide identical results. These form factors are then studied in the near-mass-shell limit with the off-shellness regularizing emerging infrared divergences. We observe their exponentiation and confirm the octagon anomalous dimension, not the cusp, as the coefficient of the Sudakov double logarithmic behavior. By subtracting these singularities and defining a finite remainder, we verified that its symbol is identical to the one found a decade ago in the conformal case. Beyond-the-symbol contributions are different in the two cases, however.</description>

Abstract: We investigate a gravitational model based on local Lorentz invariance and general coordinate invariance. The model incorporates classical scale invariance and the irreversible vierbein postulate, which forbid the introduction of dimensionful parameters and a background spacetime at a particular scale. Through the dynamics of the system, we demonstrate the simultaneous emergence of the Planck mass and a curved spacetime background.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review 2d CFT in the bootstrap approach, and sketch the known exactly solvable CFTs with no extended chiral symmetry: Liouville theory, (generalized) minimal models, limits thereof, and loop CFTs, including the $O(n)$, Potts and $PSU(n)$ CFTs.
  Exact solvability relies on local conformal symmetry, and on the existence of degenerate fields. We show how these assumptions constrain the spectrum and correlation functions. We discuss how crossing symmetry equations can be solved analytically and/or numerically, leading to analytic expressions for structure constants in terms of the double Gamma function.
  In the case of loop CFTs, we sketch the corresponding statistical models, and derive the relation between statistical and CFT variables. We review the resulting combinatorial description of correlation functions, and discuss what remains to be done for solving the CFTs.</description>

      <title>Interplay of magnetic field and chemical potential induced anisotropy and frame dependent chaos of a $Q\bar{Q}$ pair in holographic QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the role of both magnetic field and chemical potential on the emergence of chaotic dynamics in the QCD confining string from the holographic principle. An earlier developed bottom-up model of Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton gravity, which mimics QCD features quite well, is used. The qualitative information about the chaos is obtained using the Poincar\'{e} sections and Lyapunov exponents. Our results depend quite strongly on the frame we consider in the analysis. In the string frame, the chemical potential and the magnetic field suppress the chaotic dynamics in both parallel and perpendicular orientations of the string with respect to the magnetic field. Meanwhile, in the Einstein frame, the magnetic field suppresses/enhances the chaotic dynamics when the string is orientated perpendicular/parallel to the magnetic field, while the chemical potential enhances the chaotic dynamics for both orientations. We further analyse the MSS bound in the parameter space of the model and find it to be always satisfied in both frames.</description>

      <title>Hidden Adler zeros and soft theorems for inflationary perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17591v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive soft theorems for on-shell scattering amplitudes from non-linearly realised global space-time symmetries, arising from the flat and decoupling limits of the effective field theories (EFTs) of inflation, while taking particular care of on-shell limits, soft limits, time-ordered correlations, momentum derivatives, energy-momentum conserving delta functions and $i\varepsilon$ prescriptions. Intriguingly, contrary to common belief, we find with a preferred soft hierarchy among the soft momentum $q$, on-shell residue $p_a^0 \pm E_a$, and $\varepsilon$, the soft theorems do not have dependence on off-shell interactions, even in the presence of cubic vertices. We also argue that the soft hierarchy is a natural choice, ensuring the soft limit and on-shell limit commute. Our soft theorems depend solely on on-shell data and hold to all orders in perturbation theory. We present various examples including polynomial shift symmetries, non-linear realisation of Lorentz boosts and dilatations on how the soft theorems work. We find that the collection of exchange diagrams, where the soft momentum is associated with a cubic vertex, exhibits an enhanced soft scaling. The enhanced soft scaling explains why the sum of such diagrams do not enter the soft theorems non-trivially. We further apply the soft theorems to bootstrap the scattering amplitudes of the superfluid and scaling superfluid EFTs, finding agreement with the Hamiltonian analysis.</description>

      <title>Anomalous dimensions in the symmetric orbifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the anomalous conformal dimensions of the symmetric orbifold under the $2$-cycle twisted sector deformation were calculated using the perturbed action of the supercharges. In particular, explicit and simple formulae for the dispersion relations of the torus magnons in the $w$-cycle twisted sector were derived for large $w$. In this paper we reproduce these results from a direct perturbed $2$-point function calculation. In the process we also develop techniques (and a Mathematica code) that allows one to do these calculations for arbitrary quarter BPS states at finite $w$.</description>

      <title>On Twisted $A_{2n}$ Class-S Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the twisted $A_{2n}$ sector of class-S theories. Heretofore, the Coulomb branches of such theories have been poorly understood. In this, and a companion paper, we make progress in our understanding of them. In particular, we find a formula for the dimension of the Coulomb branch of any twisted $A_{2n}$ class-S theory. Deferring a systematic analysis to the companion paper, we here determine many contributions of punctures to the graded Coulomb branch dimensions, and in some low rank cases, all of them. We are then able to identify a variety of known 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ SCFTs with twisted $A_{2n}$ theories, and reproduce many of their known properties, such as S-duality amongst certain Argyres-Douglas theories.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we continue previous work where one-brane spacetimes coupled to the N=2 ungauged five dimensional hypermultiplets were found. We explore their symmetries as well as study their full geodesic structure. The one-branes are characterized by a coupling constant that distinguishes the behavior of the geodesics from smooth and causally connected in the positive case to singular and repulsive in the negative case.</description>

      <title>Entanglement asymmetry in the Hayden-Preskill protocol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the time evolution of entanglement asymmetry of the black hole radiation in the Hayden-Preskill thought experiment. We assume the black hole is initially in a mixed state since it is entangled with the early radiation. Alice throws a diary maximally entangled with a reference system into the black hole. After the black hole has absorbed the diary, Bob tries to recover the information that Alice thought should be destroyed by the black hole. In this protocol, we found that a $U(1)$ symmetry of the radiation emerges before a certain transition time. This emergent symmetry is exact in the thermodynamic limit and can be characterized by the vanished entanglement asymmetry of the radiation. The transition time depends on the initial entropy and the size of the diary. What's more, when the initial state of the black hole is maximally mixed, this emergent symmetry survives during the whole procedure of the black hole radiation. We successfully explained this novel phenomenon using the decoupling inequality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating functions $h_r(\tau)$ of D4-D2-D0 BPS indices, appearing in Calabi-Yau compactifications of type IIA string theory and identical to rank 0 Donaldson-Thomas invariants, are known to be higher depth mock modular forms satisfying a specific modular anomaly equation, with depth determined by the D4-brane charge $r$. We develop a method to solve the anomaly equation for arbitrary charges, in terms of indefinite theta series. This allows us to find the generating functions up to modular forms that can be fixed by computing just a finite number of Fourier coefficients of $h_r$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Certain holographic dark energy (HDE) models allow for the possibility of a ``long freeze,'' in which the scale factor evolves to a constant in the long-time limit. Here we extend previous calculations by adding a nonrelativistic matter component. The addition of a matter component tends to destroy the long freeze behavior, driving the universe to recollapse. Long freeze evolution is still possible, but only for a limited set of HDE models.</description>

      <title>Non-Local Classical Field Theory with Fractional Operators on $\mathbb{S}^3 \times \mathbb{R}^1$ Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a theoretical framework on non-local classical field theory using fractional integrodifferential operators. Due to the lack of easily manageable symmetries in traditional fractional calculus and the difficulties that arise in the formalism of multi-fractional calculus over $\mathbb{R}^{\text{D}}$ space, we introduce a set of new fractional operators over the $\mathbb{S}^3 \times \mathbb{R}^1$ space. The redefined fractional integral operator results in the non-trivial measure canonically. The redefined fractional differential operator can account for the spacetime symmetries for the underlying space $\mathbb{S}^3 \times \mathbb{R}^1$ with the Lorentzian signature $(+, -, -, - , -)$. We conclude that the field equation for the non-local classical field can be obtained as the consequence of the optimization of the action, considering the non-local variations in the field after defining the non-local Lagrangian density as $\mathcal{L}(\phi_{a}\left(x\right), \mathbb{\eth}^\alpha (\phi_{a}\left(x\right)))$, the function of the symmetric Fractional derivative of the field in the context of the kinetic term, and the field itself.</description>

      <title>Gross-Neveu-Yukawa SO(2) and SO(3) tensorial criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the relativistic SO(2)- and SO(3)-invariant Gross-Neveu-Yukawa field theories for real, rank-two, symmetric, traceless tensor order parameters coupled to $N_{\text{f}}$ flavors of two-component Dirac fermions. These field theories arise as an effective description of fractionalized spin-orbital liquids. The two theories are the simplest and special cases of the more general class of field theories with SO($N$) symmetric tensor order parameter coupled to Dirac fermions, in which the symmetry is low enough to allow only one, and not the usual two quartic self-interaction terms. Using two-loop renormalization group near the upper critical dimension, we demonstrate that the theory exhibits a new critical fixed point and the concomitant continuous phase transition for any value of $N_{\text{f}}$. We discuss the crucial role of the symmetry-allowed sextic self-interactions in the selection of the ground state configuration in the case of SO(3). The universal quantities such as the the anomalous dimensions of order parameters and fermions, the correlation length exponent, and the mass gap ratio between order parameter and fermion masses are computed up to $\epsilon^{2}$ order.</description>

      <title>The pole inflation from non-compact isometry in Weyl gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose the microscopic origin of the pole inflation from the scalar fields of non-compact isometry in Weyl gravity. We show that the $SO(1,N)$ isometry in the field space in combination with the Weyl symmetry relates the form of the non-minimal couplings to the one of the potential in the Jordan frame, as required for the pole inflation. In the presence of an explicit breaking of the $SO(1,N)$ symmetry in the coefficient of the potential, we realize the pole inflation near the pole of the inflaton kinetic term. Applying the general form of the Weyl invariant Lagrangian to both the Higgs pole inflation and the PQ pole inflation, we find that there is one parameter family of the solutions for the pole inflation, depending on the overall coefficient of the Weyl covariant derivatives for scalar fields. The same coefficient not only makes the predictions of the pole inflation varying, being compatible with the Planck data, but also determines the mass of the Weyl gauge field. We also show that the isocurvature perturbations of the axion can be suppressed sufficiently in the case of the PQ pole inflation, due to a large effective axion decay constant during inflation.</description>

      <title>Gauss-Bonnet dynamical compactification scenarios and their ghosts in the tensor sectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a cosmological context, the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory contains, in $d+4$ dimensions, a dynamical compactification scenario in which the additional dimensions settle down to a configuration with a constant radion/scale factor. Sadly however this work demonstrates that such a quite appealing framework is plagued by instabilities, either from the background configuration's unsteadiness or the ghostly behaviors of the tensorial perturbations. New and stable solutions are found by relaxing one of the hypotheses defining the original compactification scenario. However, such configurations do not respect the current bounds on the speed of propagation of gravitational waves, and thus have to be discarded. Those results thus advocate for a comprehensive study of compactification scenarios in the Gauss-Bonnet framework, their stability, and the effects of matter inclusion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The final stage of black hole evaporation is a potent probe of physics beyond the Standard Model: Hawking-Bekenstein radiation may be affected by quantum gravity "memory burden effects", or by the presence of "dark", beyond-the-Standard-Model degrees of freedom in ways that are testable with high-energy gamma-ray observations. We argue that information on either scenario can best be inferred from measurements of the evaporation's lightcurve and by correlating observations at complementary energies. We offer several new analytical insights in how such observations map on the fundamental properties of the evaporating black holes and of the possible exotic particles they can evaporate into.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we analyze the characteristics of electromagnetic (EM) radiation associated with scalar and axion field oscillations in different background field setups. Because the scalar field and axion field have different parity and couple with the EM field in different forms, the EM signals generated by the scalar and axion can be used to distinguish them. More interestingly, resonance effects amplify the difference between the two fields and consequent EM signal strength, which helps us distinguish and detect them in future observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Black hole (BH) mergers are natural sources of gravitational waves (GWs) and are possibly associated with electromagnetic events. Such events from a charged rotating BH with an accretion on to it could be more energetic and ultra-short-lived if the magnetic force dominates the accretion process because the attraction of ionized fluid with a strong magnetic field around the rotating BH further amplifies the acceleration of the charged particle via a gyromagnetic effect. Thus a stronger magnetic field and gravitational pull will provide an inward force to any fluid displaced in the radial direction and move it toward the axis of rotation with an increasing velocity. After many twists during rotation and the existence of restoring agents, Such events could produce a narrow intense jet starts in the form of Poynting flux along the axis of rotation resembling the Blandford-Znajek (BZ) mechanism. We investigated a charged rotating BH and obtained characteristic results (e.g., the remnant mass, magnetic field strength, luminosity, opening angle, viewing angle, and variation of viewing angle on the SGRB luminosity detection) that have a nice coincidence with rare events having GW associated with EM counterparts. This study gives a new insight into events with a strongly magnetized disk dominating the accretion process of energy extraction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyse the dynamics of the Friedmann-Lema\^itre universes taking into account the different roles played by the fluid parameter and the cosmological constant, as well as the degenerate character of the equations. We find that the Friedmann-Lema\^itre system reduces to four qualitatively inequivalent normal forms and write down the sets of all stable perturbations that may result (the `versal unfoldings'). These sets are of small codimension up to three. We then describe all possible parameter-dependent solutions and their transfigurations to other forms during evolution through the bifurcation sets, these are also fully described. This analysis leads to a picture of cosmological evolution determined by new parameters related to codimension which are zero in standard cosmology. The emerging versal solutions are all free of singularities, while other properties of them are also discussed.</description>

Structure of the matter is idealized as 1-, 2- or 3-dimensional periodic Coulomb lattices (pasta phases) at average baryon density in the range of $0.005n_0-0.5n_0$ with $n_0\sim0.16$ fm$^{-3}$, corresponding to the inner crust of neutron stars. In the earlier work, the bulk and the surface nuclear properties in this scenario were described on the basis of different nuclear interactions. As a result, predictions for the inner crust structure based on those numerical results are not necessarily self-consistent. In this work, we solve this problem by describing the nuclear properties and proton-proton Cooper pairing in a unified manner, \emph{i.e.} based on the same nuclear interaction. We calculate the surface tension to the leading order (planar surface) and to the next-to-leading order (from nonzero principal curvature) at the Extended Thomas-Fermi level. Next, we develop and solve a system of equations within the compressible liquid drop model (LDM), which provides us with all necessary information about the macroscopic static energy spectrum of the nuclear structure. We find that the curvature corrections change the ground state in a relevant way. We also find that, typically, the energy differences between the different pasta phases are less than the thermal energy for temperatures $\sim10^8-10^9$ K, which implies that the real nuclear pasta phases are likely polymorphic. Finally, for 1-dimensional pasta phase we evaluate the superconducting coherence length of protons, the London penetration depth and the superconducting energy gap. Our results offer a preliminary insight into rich magnetic properties of the pasta phases.</description>

      <title>The general property of the tensor gravitational memory effect in theories of gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, it is shown that based on the linear analysis, as long as a theory of gravity is diffeomorphism invariant and possesses the tensor degrees of freedom propagating at a constant, isotropic speed without dispersion, its asymptotic symmetry group of an isolated system contains the (extended/generalized) Bondi-Metzner-Sachs group. The tensor gravitational wave induces the displacement, spin and center-of-mass memory effects. They depend on the asymptotic shear tensor. The displacement memory effect is the vacuum transition and parameterized by a supertranslation transformation. All of these hold even when the Lorentz symmetry is broken by a special timelike direction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that, in the framework of quantum field theory in curved spacetime, the semiclassical energy-momentum tensor of the neutrino flavor vacuum fulfills the equation of state of dust and cold dark matter. We consider spherically symmetric spacetimes, and we demonstrate that, within the weak field approximation, the flavor vacuum contributes as a Yukawa correction to the Newtonian potential. This corrected potential may account for the flat rotation curves of spiral galaxies. In this perspective, neutrino mixing could contribute to dark matter</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the quantized $\mathrm{SL}_2$-character variety of a once-punctured torus. We show that this quantized algebra has three $\mathbb{Z}_2$-invariant subalgebras that are isomorphic to quantized $K$-theoretic Coulomb branches in the sense of Braverman, Finkelberg, and Nakajima. These subalgebras are permuted by the $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$ mapping class group action. Our results confirm various predictions from the physics literature about 4d $\mathcal{N}=2^*$ theories and their dualities.</description>

      <title>On generalized black brane solutions in the model with multicomponent anisotropic fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1112.1706</link>
      <description>arXiv:1112.1706v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A family of spherically $O(d_0 + 1)$-symmetric solutions in the model with $m$-component anisotropic fluid is obtained. The metrics are defined on a manifold which contains a product of $n-1$ Ricci-flat ``internal'' spaces. The equation of state for any $s$-th component is defined by a vector $U^s = (U^s_i)$ belonging to $R^{n + 1}$ and obeying inequalities $U^s_1 = q_s &gt; 0$, $s = 1, \ldots,m$. The solutions are governed by moduli functions $H_s$ which are solutions to (master) non-linear differential equations with certain boundary conditions imposed. It is shown that for coinciding $q_s = q$ there exists a subclass of solutions with a horizon when $q = 1, 2, \ldots$ and $U^s$-vectors correspond to certain semisimple Lie algebras. An extension of these solutions to block-orthogonal set of vectors $U^s$ with natural parameters $q_s$ coinciding inside blocks is also proposed. $q$-analogues of black brane/hole solutions are presented, e.g. generalising $M_2 \cap M_5$ dyonic solution in $D =11$ supergravity and Myers-Perry charged black hole solution in dimension $D = 2 + d_0$.</description>

      <title>Note on Warped Compactification -- Finite Brane Potentials and Non-Hermiticity --</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05141v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study radius stabilization in the Randall-Sundrum model without assuming any unnaturally large stabilizing scalar potential parameter at the boundary branes ($\gamma$) by the frequently used superpotential method. Employing a perturbative expansion in $1/\gamma^2$ and the backreaction parameter, we obtain approximate analytical expressions for the radion mass and wavefunction. We validate them through a dedicated numerical analysis, which solves the linearized coupled scalar and metric field equations exactly. It is observed that the radion mass decreases with decreasing $\gamma$. Below a critical value of $\gamma$, the radion becomes tachyonic, suggesting destabilization of the extra dimension. We also address the issue of non-Hermiticity of the differential operator that determines the radion and Kaluza-Klein (KK) mode wavefunctions in the finite $\gamma$ limit. It is accomplished by finding an explicit form of the general scalar product that re-establishes the orthogonality in the KK decomposition.</description>

      <title>Nonperturbative correlation functions from homotopy algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10935v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The formula for correlation functions based on quantum $A_\infty$ algebras in arXiv:2203.05366, arXiv:2305.11634, and arXiv:2305.13103 requires us to divide the action into the free part and the interaction part. We present a new form of the formula which does not involve such division. The new formula requires us to choose a solution to the equations of motion which does not have to be real, and we claim that the formula gives correlation functions evaluated on the Lefschetz thimble associated with the solution we chose. Our formula correctly reproduces correlation functions in perturbation theory, but it can be valid nonperturbatively, and we present numerical evidence for scalar field theories in zero dimensions both in the Euclidean case and the Lorentzian case that correlation functions for finite coupling constants can be reproduced. When the theory consists of a single Lefschetz thimble, our formula gives correlation functions of the theory by choosing the solution corresponding to the thimble. When the theory consists of multiple Lefschetz thimbles, we need to evaluate the ratios of the partition functions for those thimbles and we describe a method of such evaluations based on quantum $A_\infty$ algebras in a forthcoming paper.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12303v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate a tree-level equivalence between four distinct infrared objects in $(d+2)$-dimensional abelian gauge theories. These are ($i$) the large gauge charge $Q_\varepsilon$ where the function $\varepsilon$ on the sphere parameterizing large gauge transformations is identified with the Goldstone mode $\theta$ of spontaneously broken large gauge symmetry; ($ii$) the soft effective action that captures the dynamics of the soft and Goldstone modes; ($iii$) the edge mode action with Neumann boundary conditions; and ($iv$) the Wilson line dressing of a scattering amplitude, including a novel dressing for soft photons, which have local charge distributions despite having vanishing global charge. The promotion of the large gauge parameter to the dynamical Goldstone and the novel dressing of soft gauge particles give rise to intriguing possibilities for the future study of infrared dynamics of gauge theories and gravity.</description>

Abstract: We study the back-reaction of a quantum scalar field on anti-de Sitter (AdS) space-time. The renormalized expectation value of the stress-energy tensor operator for a massless, conformally-coupled quantum scalar field on global AdS space-time in four space-time dimensions acts as a source term on the right-hand-side of the Einstein equations for the quantum-corrected metric. We solve the quantum-corrected Einstein equations numerically and find deviations from pure AdS which increase as the temperature of the quantum scalar field state increases. We interpret these quantum-corrected metrics as asymptotically-AdS solitons, and study the mass of these solitons as a function of the temperature of the quantum scalar field.</description>

      <title>BTZ Black Hole In The Non-Extensive Generalizations of Gibbs Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01149v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the thermodynamics and thermodynamic geometry of the (2+1) dimensional Banados-Teitelboim-Zanelli(BTZ) black hole within the framework of the non-extensive generalizations of Gibbs entropy. We investigate both the rotating (R-BTZ) and the charged (C-BTZ) BTZ black holes in these non-extensive entropy formalisms. We write down the Bekenstein-Hawking(BH) entropy of the black hole in terms of the non-extensive entropies namely: Kaniadakis entropy, Renyi entropy and Barrow entropy. We investigate their impact on the thermodynamic phase structure and geometry of the BTZ black holes in both the ensembles i.e. the fixed $(J)$ and fixed $(\Omega)$ ensemble for the R-BTZ black hole and the fixed $(Q)$ and the fixed $(\Phi)$ ensemble for the C-BTZ black hole where $ J$, $\Omega$, $Q$ and $\Phi$ represent the angular momentum, angular velocity, charge and the electric potential of the respective black holes . We investigate the Ruppeiner and geometrothermodynamic(GTD) geometries of the black hole for all the non-extensive entropy cases. We find that there are Davies type along with Hawking-Page phase transitions in both the charged and rotating BTZ black hole for the Kaniadakis entropy case in all the above mentioned thermodynamic ensembles. These phase transitions were not seen in the BH entropy case. We also find that the Ruppeiner and the GTD scalar for the Kaniadakis entropy show curvature singularities corresponding to the Davies type phase transitions in both the rotating and charged BTZ black holes.</description>

Abstract: We discuss non-invertible symmetries in toroidal compactifications of higher dimensional Yang-Mills theory with magnetic fluxes, which can be regarded as an effective action of type IIB string theory with magnetized D-branes. Specifically, we derive fusion rules of discrete isometry operators, which are invariant under the $\mathbb{Z}_N$ orbifold twist. It turns out that degenerate chiral zero-modes non-trivially transform under the non-invertible symmetries in the context of quantum mechanics. Hence, non-invertible symmetries correspond to flavor symmetries of chiral zero modes and determine their flavor structure. We explicitly show the representations and selection rules of chiral zero modes on their wave functions. These zero modes may correspond to generations of quarks and leptons in four-dimensional low-energy effective field theory.</description>

      <title>Imaginary part of timelike entanglement entropy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22684v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the imaginary part of the timelike entanglement entropy. In the context of field theory, it is more appropriate to obtain the timelike entanglement entropy through the Wick rotation of the twist operators. It is found that, in certain special cases, the imaginary part of the timelike entanglement entropy is related to the commutator of the twist operator and its first-order temporal derivative. To evaluate these commutators, we employ the operator product expansion of the twist operators, revealing that the commutator is generally universal across most scenarios. However, in more general cases, the imaginary part of the timelike entanglement entropy proves to be more complex. We compute the commutator of the twist operators along with its higher-order temporal derivatives. Utilizing these results, we derive a modified formula for the imaginary part of the timelike entanglement entropy. Furthermore, we extend this formula to the case of strip subregion in higher dimensions. Our analysis shows that for the strip geometry, the imaginary part of the timelike entanglement entropy is solely related to the commutators of the twist operator and its first-order temporal derivative. The findings presented in this paper provide valuable insights into the imaginary part of timelike entanglement entropy and its physical significance.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we construct Yang-Mills theory in the $\kappa$-space-time. We derive Yang-Mills equations in the $\kappa$-deformed space-time, valid up to first order in the deformation parameter $a$, using the generalisation of Feynman's approach. We first derive the $\kappa$-deformed Wong's equation and using it, in the Jacobi identity involving velocities and coordinates of $\kappa$-deformed space-time, we derive the $\kappa$-deformed homogeneous Yang-Mills equations. We then construct the Lagrangian for Yang-Mills theory in $\kappa$-deformed space-time and show that it is invariant under SU(N) transformation. We also derive the expression for the force experienced by an isospin-carrying particle in the presence of Yang-Mills field in the $\kappa$-space-time.</description>

Abstract: We develop the deformation theory of instantons on asymptotically conical $Spin(7)$-manifolds where the instanton is asymptotic to a fixed nearly $G_2$-instanton at infinity. By relating the deformation complex with spinors, we identify the space of infinitesimal deformations with the kernel of the twisted negative Dirac operator on the asymptotically conical $Spin(7)$-manifold.
  Finally we apply this theory to describe the deformations of Fairlie-Nuyts-Fubini-Nicolai (FNFN) $Spin(7)$-instantons on $\mathbb{R}^8$, where $\mathbb{R}^8$ is considered to be an asymptotically conical $Spin(7)$-manifold asymptotic to the cone over $S^7$. We calculate the virtual dimension of the moduli space using Atiyah-Patodi-Singer index theorem and the spectrum of the twisted Dirac operator.</description>

      <title>Extreme mass-ratio inspirals into black holes surrounded by scalar clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.16093v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study extreme mass-ratio binary systems in which a stellar mass compact object spirals into a supermassive black hole surrounded by a scalar cloud. Scalar clouds can form through superradiant instabilities of massive scalar fields around spinning black holes and can also serve as a proxy for dark matter halos. Our framework is fully relativistic and assumes that the impact of the cloud on the geometry can be treated perturbatively. As a proof of concept, here we consider a point particle in circular, equatorial motion around a non-spinning black hole surrounded either by a spherically symmetric or a dipolar non-axisymmetric scalar cloud, but the framework can in principle be generalized to generic black hole spins and scalar cloud geometries. We compute the leading-order power lost by the point particle due to scalar radiation and show that, in some regimes, it can dominate over gravitational-wave emission. We confirm the presence of striking signatures due to the presence of a scalar cloud that had been predicted using Newtonian approximations, such as resonances that can give rise to sinking and floating orbits, as well as "sharp features" in the power lost by the particle at given orbital radii. Finally, for a spherically symmetric scalar cloud, we also compute the leading-order corrections to the black-hole geometry and to the gravitational-wave energy flux, focusing only on axial metric perturbations for the latter. We find that, for non-compact clouds, the corrections to the (axial) gravitational-wave fluxes at high frequencies can be understood in terms of a gravitational-redshift effect, in agreement with previous works.</description>

      <title>Holographic Energy Correlators for Confining Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12123v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a holographic calculation of energy correlators in a simple model of confinement based on a warped extra dimension with an IR brane. For small distances we reproduce the constant correlators of a strongly-coupled conformal field theory, while for large distances the effects of confinement dominate and the correlators decay exponentially. We find exact shockwave solutions to the Einstein equations in the presence of the IR brane, hence avoiding the need for a perturbative expansion in terms of Witten diagrams. While some of the expected qualitative features of energy correlators in quantum chromodynamics (QCD) are reproduced, our crude model of confinement does not capture the effects of asymptotic freedom nor exhibit jetty behavior. We expect that our method can also be applied to more realistic models of confinement incorporating asymptotic freedom, which should fix some of the deviations from QCD.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the Dirac spectrum from chiral symmetry restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03546v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I derive constraints on the Dirac spectrum in the chirally symmetric phase of a gauge theory with two massless fermion flavors. Using only general properties of correlation functions of scalar and pseudoscalar bilinears, I prove that in the chiral limit of vanishing fermion mass $m$ the corresponding susceptibilities and all their derivatives with respect to $m^2$ must be finite. I then use the resulting spectral constraints to show that effective breaking of the anomalous $\mathrm{U}(1)_A$ symmetry is allowed in the $\mathrm{SU}(2)_A$ symmetric phase in the chiral limit, and leads to distinctive spectral features: (i) the spectral density must develop a singular $O(m^4)/\lambda$ peak as $m\to 0$, (ii) the two-point eigenvalue correlator of near-zero modes must be singular, and (iii) near-zero modes cannot be localized. Moreover, in the symmetric phase the topological charge distribution must be indistinguishable from that of an ideal gas of instantons and anti-instantons of vanishing density, to leading order in $m$.</description>

      <title>Tidal deformability of black holes surrounded by thin accretion disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14208v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The tidal Love numbers of self-gravitating compact objects describe their response to external tidal perturbations, such as those from a companion in a binary system, offering valuable insights into their internal structure. For static tidal fields, asymptotically flat black holes in vacuum exhibit vanishing Love numbers in general relativity, even though this property is sensitive to the presence of an external environment. In this work we study the tidal deformability of black holes surrounded by thin accretion disks, showing that the Love numbers could be large enough to mask any effect of modified gravity and to intrinsically limit tidal tests of black-hole mimickers. Furthermore, we investigate the measurability of the tidal parameters with next-generation gravitational wave experiments, like LISA and Einstein Telescope. Our findings suggest that these parameters could be measured with high precision, providing a powerful tool to probe the environment around coalescing binary systems.</description>

      <title>Inflation models with Peccei-Quinn symmetry and axion kinetic misalignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17013v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a consistent framework with the $U(1)$ Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry for obtaining the initial condition for axion kinetic misalignment from inflation. We introduce a PQ complex scalar field and an extra Higgs doublet, which are conformally coupled to gravity, and three right-handed neutrinos for the seesaw mechanism. In the DFSZ type scenarios for the axion, we obtain the PQ anomalies from the Standard Model quarks carrying nonzero PQ charges in some of two Higgs doublet models, solving the strong CP problem by the QCD potential for the axion. Assuming that the PQ symmetry is explicitly violated in the scalar potential by quantum gravity effects, we show that a sufficiently large initial axion velocity can be obtained at the end inflation while avoiding the axion quality problem. As inflation is driven by the radial distance from the origin in the space of scalar fields close to the pole of the kinetic terms in the Einstein frame, we obtain successful inflationary predictions and set the initial axion velocity at the end of inflation. Focusing on the pure PQ inflation with a small running quartic coupling for the PQ field, we discuss the post-inflationary dynamics for the inflaton and the axion. As a result, we show that a sufficiently high reheating temperature, can be obtained dominantly from the Higgs-portal couplings to the PQ field, while being consistent with axion kinetic misalignment, the stability for the Higgs fields during inflation and the non-restoration of the PQ symmetry after reheating.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the Primordial Black Hole Abundance through Scalar-Induced Gravitational Waves from Advanced LIGO and Virgo's First Three Observing Runs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07976v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As a promising dark matter candidate, primordial black holes (PBHs) lighter than $\sim10^{-18}M_{\odot}$ are supposed to have evaporated by today through Hawking radiation. This scenario is challenged by the memory burden effect, which suggests that the evaporation of black holes may slow down significantly after they have emitted about half of their initial mass. We explore the astrophysical implications of the memory burden effect on the PBH abundance by today and the possibility for PBHs lighter than $\sim10^{-18}M_{\odot}$ to persist as dark matter. Our analysis utilizes current LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA data to constrain the primordial power spectrum and infer the PBH abundance. We find a null detection of scalar-induced gravitational waves that accompanied the formation of the PBHs. Then we find that PBHs are ruled out within the mass range $\sim[10^{-24},10^{-19}]M_{\odot}$. Furthermore, we expect that next-generation gravitational wave detectors, such as the Einstein Telescope and the Cosmic Explorer, will provide even more stringent constraints. Our results indicate that future detectors can reach sensitivities that could rule out PBH as dark matter within $\sim[10^{-29}M_{\odot},10^{-16}M_{\odot}]$ in the null detection of scalar-induced gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>Corrections to Conformal Charge at BKT Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01683v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The conformal anomaly is key to describing the physics of interacting field theories in two dimensions, and has been shown to obtain finite-size corrections that are useful to numerical and experimental studies. At Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transitions, the corrections are logarithmic with previously unknown universal coefficients. In this paper, I reveal the universal, $1^{st}$-order correction to the conformal anomaly for finite-sized systems at BKT transitions. This term results solely from topological defects that are irrelevant in the infrared limit. I compare the result with careful observations of entanglement for the quantum Heisenberg model with periodic boundary conditions in one spatial dimension.</description>

      <title>A new rotating Lorentzian wormhole spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09202v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A rotating version of a known static, spherically symmetric, zero Ricci scalar Lorentzian wormhole is constructed. It turns out that for this given non-rotating geometry, the standard Newman-Janis algorithm does not produce a rotating wormhole and, therefore, the method pioneered by Azreg-A\"inou has to be used. The rotating spacetime thus obtained is shown to be regular with wormhole features, though it is no longer a $R=0$ spacetime. The required matter is found to violate the energy conditions, as expected. A few other characteristic properties of this new rotating spacetime are mentioned. Finally, we calculate the shadow for this geometry and discuss its features {\em vis-a-vis} the Kerr geometry and available EHT observations.</description>

      <title>On the breakdown of dimensional reduction and supersymmetry in random-field models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11147v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the breakdown of the Parisi-Sourlas supersymmetry (SUSY) and of the dimensional-reduction (DR) property in the random field Ising and O($N$) models as a function of space dimension $d$ and/or number of components $N$. The functional renormalization group (FRG) predicts that this takes place below a critical line $d_{\rm DR}(N)$. We revisit the perturbative FRG results for the RFO($N$)M in $d=4+\epsilon$ and carry out a more comprehensive investigation of the nonperturbative FRG approximation for the RFIM. In light of this FRG description, we discuss the perturbative results in $\epsilon=6-d$ recently derived for the RFIM by Kaviraj, Rychkov, and Trevisani. We stress in particular that the disappearance of the SUSY/DR fixed point below $d_{\rm DR}$ arises as a consequence of the nonlinearity of the FRG equations and cannot be found via the perturbative expansion in $\epsilon=6-d$ (nor in $1/N$). We also provide an error bar on the value of the critical dimension $d_{\rm DR}$ for the RFIM, which we find around $5.11\pm0.09$, by studying several successive orders of the nonperturbative FRG approximation scheme.</description>

      <title>Fusion rules and rigidity for weight modules over the simple admissible affine $\mathfrak{sl}(2)$ and $\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal vertex operator superalgebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11387v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the categories of weight modules over the simple $\mathfrak{sl}(2)$ and $\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal vertex operator algebras at fractional admissible levels and central charges are rigid (and hence the categories of weight modules are braided ribbon categories) and that the decomposition formulae of fusion products of simple projective modules conjectured by Thomas Creutzig, David Ridout and collaborators hold (including when the decomposition involves summands that are indecomposable yet not simple). In addition to solving this old open problem, we develop new techniques for the construction of intertwining operators by means of integrating screening currents over certain cycles, which are expected to be of independent interest, due to their applicability to many other algebras. In the example of $\mathfrak{sl}(2)$ these new techniques allow us to give explicit formulae for a logarithmic intertwining operator from a pair of simple projective modules to the projective cover of the tensor unit, namely, the vertex operator algebra as a module over itself.</description>

      <title>Langlands Duality and Invariant Differential Operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16432v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Langlands duality is one of the most influential topics in mathematical research. It has many different appearances and influential subtopics. Yet there is a topic that until now seems unrelated to the Langlands program. That is the topic of invariant differential operators. That is strange since both items are deeply rooted in Harish-Chandra's representation theory of semisimple Lie groups. In this paper we start building the bridge between the two programs.</description>
