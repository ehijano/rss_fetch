      <title>Measuring and Modeling Bursty Human Phenomena</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bursty dynamics characterizes systems that evolve through short active periods of several events, which are separated by long periods of inactivity. Systems with such temporal heterogeneities are not only found in nature but also include examples from most aspects of human dynamics. In this Chapter, we briefly introduce such bursty phenomena by first walking through the most prominent observations of bursty human behavior. We then introduce several conventional measures that have been developed for characterizing bursty phenomena. Finally, we discuss the fundamental modeling directions proposed to understand the emergence of burstiness in human dynamics through the assumption of task prioritization, temporal correlations, and external factors. This Chapter is only a concise introduction to the field. Still, it provides the most important references, which will help interested readers to learn in depth the ever-growing research area of bursty human dynamics.</description>

      <title>Integrated GIS- and network-based framework for assessing urban critical infrastructure accessibility and resilience: the case of Hurricane Michael</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a framework for assessing urban critical infrastructure resilience during extreme events, such as hurricanes. The approach combines GIS and network analysis with open remote sensing data of the aftermath, vector data on infrastructure, and socio-demographic attributes of populations in affected areas. Using Panama City as an example case study, this paper quantifies hurricane impacts on residents and identifies vulnerable locations for urban planners' attention. Simulations demonstrate how implementing measures at identified weak points can improve system resilience. Comparing pre-hurricane conditions with the aftermath and several years later allows observing network property changes and assessing overall resilience improvements. Findings indicate that individuals over 65 in the studied settlement are more susceptible to disasters, while males in this age category face higher risks.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of 'Dunkelflaute' event detection methods considering grid operators' needs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weather conditions associated with low electricity production from renewable energy sources (RES) can result in challenging 'dunkelflaute' events, where 'dunkel' means dark and 'flaute' refers to low windspeeds. In a power system relying significantly on RES, such events can pose a risk for maintaining resource adequacy, i.e. the balance between generation and demand, particularly if they occur over a large geographical area and for an extended period of time. This risk is further emphasized in periods of cold ('kalte') temperature, known as 'kalte dunkelflaute'.
  In this paper, we perform a literature review of different methods to identify dunkelflaute events from hourly RES production and load data alone. We then validate three of these methods by comparing their results with periods of shortage identified from a detailed power system simulation model used by grid operators (ERAA2023). Strengths and weaknesses of these methods are discussed in terms of their data requirements, ease of application, and skill in detecting dunkelflaute events.
  We find that all three 'dunkelflaute' event detection methods have some ability to identify potential energy shortages, but none are able to detect all events. Most likely other factors such as the presence of energy storage capacity, non-weather-dependent outages, and model-related factors limit the skill of these methods. We find that all three methods perform best if the residual load is used as input, rather than hourly RES production or load alone. Overall, we find that Otero'22 is the method that yields the best results while being straightforward to implement and requiring only data with daily resolution. The results hold for countries relying on a small or a large share of RES production in their electricity mix.</description>

      <title>Urban Scaling is hardwired in the human brain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emerging field of the Science of Cities has unveiled previously undiscovered facets of urban life. Contrary to the expectation of chaotic behaviour influenced solely by cultural and geographic factors, cities globally exhibit universal power-law trends in urban scaling. Leveraging recent advances in mathematical descriptions of urban dynamics, this study investigates the interplay among fundamental allometry, fractal dimension, and the number of close contacts within cities. Through a dynamic exploration of these factors, a causal relationship is established, shedding light on the intricate dynamics that shape urban environments. Remarkably, our analysis suggests that the Big Five personality traits play a pivotal role in determining the fractal aspects of urban life. This research contributes to the understanding of urban scaling and proposes a novel connection between human personality traits and the structural patterns observed in cities, opening avenues for further interdisciplinary exploration.</description>

      <title>Spatio-Temporal SIR Model of Pandemic Spread During Warfare with Optimal Dual-use Healthcare System Administration using Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large-scale crises, including wars and pandemics, have repeatedly shaped human history, and their simultaneous occurrence presents profound challenges to societies. Understanding the dynamics of epidemic spread during warfare is essential for developing effective containment strategies in complex conflict zones. While research has explored epidemic models in various settings, the impact of warfare on epidemic dynamics remains underexplored. In this study, we proposed a novel mathematical model that integrates the epidemiological SIR (susceptible-infected-recovered) model with the war dynamics Lanchester model to explore the dual influence of war and pandemic on a population's mortality. Moreover, we consider a dual-use military and civil healthcare system that aims to reduce the overall mortality rate which can use different administration policies. Using an agent-based simulation to generate in silico data, we trained a deep reinforcement learning model for healthcare administration policy and conducted an intensive investigation on its performance. Our results show that a pandemic during war conduces chaotic dynamics where the healthcare system should either prioritize war-injured soldiers or pandemic-infected civilians based on the immediate amount of mortality from each option, ignoring long-term objectives. Our findings highlight the importance of integrating conflict-related factors into epidemic modeling to enhance preparedness and response strategies in conflict-affected areas.</description>

      <title>When LLMs Play the Telephone Game: Cumulative Changes and Attractors in Iterated Cultural Transmissions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04503v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) start interacting with each other and generating an increasing amount of text online, it becomes crucial to better understand how information is transformed as it passes from one LLM to the next. While significant research has examined individual LLM behaviors, existing studies have largely overlooked the collective behaviors and information distortions arising from iterated LLM interactions. Small biases, negligible at the single output level, risk being amplified in iterated interactions, potentially leading the content to evolve towards attractor states. In a series of telephone game experiments, we apply a transmission chain design borrowed from the human cultural evolution literature: LLM agents iteratively receive, produce, and transmit texts from the previous to the next agent in the chain. By tracking the evolution of text toxicity, positivity, difficulty, and length across transmission chains, we uncover the existence of biases and attractors, and study their dependence on the initial text, the instructions, language model, and model size. For instance, we find that more open-ended instructions lead to stronger attraction effects compared to more constrained tasks. We also find that different text properties display different sensitivity to attraction effects, with toxicity leading to stronger attractors than length. These findings highlight the importance of accounting for multi-step transmission dynamics and represent a first step towards a more comprehensive understanding of LLM cultural dynamics.</description>

      <title>High-Resolution Rooftop-PV Potential Assessment for a Resilient Energy System in Ukraine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06937v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rooftop photovoltaic (RTPV) systems are essential for building a decarbonized and, due to its decentralized structure, more resilient energy system, and are particularly important for Ukraine, where recent conflicts have damaged more than half of its electricity and heat supply capacity. Favorable solar irradiation conditions make Ukraine a strong candidate for large-scale PV deployment, but effective policy requires detailed data on spatial and temporal generation potential. This study fills the data gap by using open-source satellite building footprint data corrected with high-resolution data from eastern Germany. This approach allowed accurate estimates of rooftop area and PV capacity and generation across Ukraine, with simulations revealing a capacity potential of 238.8 GW and a generation potential of 290 TWh/a excluding north-facing. The majority of this potential is located in oblasts (provinces) across the country with large cities such as Donetsk, Dnipro or Kyiv and surroundings. These results, validated against previous studies and available as open data, confirm Ukraine's significant potential for RTPV, supporting both energy resilience and climate goals.</description>

      <title>Consensus formation and relative stimulus perception in quality-sensitive, interdependent agent systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14856v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform a comprehensive analysis of a collective decision-making model inspired by honeybee behavior. This model integrates individual exploration for option discovery and social interactions for information sharing, while also considering option qualities. Our assessment of the decision process outcome employs standard consensus metrics and investigates its correlation with convergence time, revealing common trade-offs between speed and accuracy. Furthermore, we show the model's compliance with Weber's Law of relative stimulus perception, aligning with previous analysis of collective decision problems. Our study also identifies non-equilibrium critical behavior in specific limits of the model, where the highest values of consensus are achieved. This result highlights the intriguing relationship between optimal performance, critically, and the fluctuations caused by finite size effects, often seen in biological systems. Our findings are especially relevant for finite adaptive systems, as they provide insights into navigating decision-making scenarios with similar options more effectively.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Evolution of Altruistic Punishment with a PDE Model of Cultural Multilevel Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18419v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two mechanisms that have been used to study the evolution of cooperative behavior are altruistic punishment, in which cooperative individuals pay additional costs to punish defection, and multilevel selection, in which competition between groups can help to counteract individual-level incentives to cheat. Boyd, Gintis, Bowles, and Richerson have used simulation models of cultural evolution to suggest that altruistic punishment and pairwise group-level competition can work in concert to promote cooperation, even when neither mechanism can do so on its own. In this paper, we formulate a PDE model for multilevel selection motivated by the approach of Boyd and coauthors, modeling individual-level birth-death competition with a replicator equation based on individual payoffs and describing group-level competition with pairwise conflicts based on differences in the average payoffs of the competing groups. Building off of existing PDE models for multilevel selection with frequency-independent group-level competition, we use analytical and numerical techniques to understand how the forms of individual and average payoffs can impact the long-time ability to sustain altruistic punishment in group-structured populations. We find several interesting differences between the behavior of our new PDE model with pairwise group-level competition and existing multilevel PDE models, including the observation that our new model can feature a non-monotonic dependence of the long-time collective payoff on the strength of altruistic punishment. Going forward, our PDE framework can serve as a way to connect and compare disparate approaches for understanding multilevel selection across the literature in evolutionary biology and anthropology.</description>
