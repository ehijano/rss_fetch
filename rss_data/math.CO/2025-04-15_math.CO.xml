      <title>Hamiltonian cycles in tough $(P_4 \cup P_1)$-free graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1973, Chv\'atal conjectured that there exists a constant $t_0$ such that every $t_0$-tough graph on at least three vertices is Hamiltonian. This conjecture has inspired extensive research and has been verified for several special classes of graphs. Notably, Jung in 1978 proved that every 1-tough $P_4$-free graph on at least three vertices is Hamiltonian. However, the problem remains challenging even when restricted to graphs with no induced $P_4\cup P_1$, the disjoint union of a path on four vertices and a one-vertex path. In 2013, Nikoghosyan conjectured that every 1-tough $(P_4\cup P_1)$-free graph on at least three vertices is Hamiltonian. Later in 2015, Broersma remarked that ``this question seems to be very hard to answer, even if we impose a higher toughness." He instead posed the following question: ``Is the general conjecture of Chv\'atal's true for $(P_4\cup P_1)$-free graphs?" We provide a positive answer to Broersma's question by establishing that every $23$-tough $(P_4\cup P_1)$-free graph on at least three vertices is Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Refinement of Hikita's $e$-positivity theorem via Abreu--Nigro's $g$-functions and restricted modular law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the symmetric functions \( g_{\mm,k}(x;q) \), introduced by
  Abreu and Nigro for a Hessenberg function \( \mm \) and a positive
  integer \( k \), which refine the chromatic symmetric function.
  Building on Hikita's recent breakthrough on the Stanley--Stembridge
  conjecture, we prove the \( e \)-positivity of \( g_{\mm,k}(x;1) \),
  refining Hikita's result. We also provide a Schur expansion of the
  sum \( \sum_{k=1}^n e_k(x) g_{\mm,n-k}(x;q) \) in terms of
  \( P \)-tableaux with 1 in the upper-left corner. We introduce a
  restricted version of the modular law as our main tool. Then, we
  show that any function satisfying the restricted modular law is
  determined by its values on disjoint unions of path graphs.</description>

      <title>On the $d$-transversal number of cylindrical and toroidal grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a positive integer $d$, a $d$-transversal set of a graph $G$ is an edge subset $T\subseteq E(G)$ such that $|T\cap M|\geq d$ for every maximum matching $M$ of $G$. The $d$-transversal number of $G$, denoted by $\tau_d(G)$, is the minimum cardinality of a $d$-transversal set in $G$. It is NP-complete to determine the $d$-transversal number of a bipartite graph for any fixed $d\geq 1$. Ries et al. (Discrete Math. 310 (2010) 132-146) established the $d$-transversal number of rectangular grids $P_m\square P_n$. In this paper, we consider cylindrical grids $P_m\square C_n$ and toroidal grids $C_m\square C_n$. We derive explicit expressions for the $d$-transversal numbers of $P_m\square C_n$ for $m\geq 1$ and even $n\geq 4$, or even $m\geq 2$ and $n=3$, and of $C_m\square C_n$ with even order, for $1\leq d\leq \frac{mn}{2}$. For the other cases we obtain explicit expressions or bounds for their $d$-transversal numbers.</description>

      <title>Real-rooted integer polynomial enumeration algorithms and interlacing polynomials via linear programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the algorithms of Robinson, Smyth, and McKee--Smyth to enumerate all real-rooted integer polynomials of a fixed degree, where the first few (at least three) leading coefficients are specified. Additionally, we introduce new linear programming algorithms to enumerate all feasible interlacing polynomials of a given polynomial that comes from a certain family of real-rooted integer polynomials. These algorithms are further specialised for the study of real equiangular lines, incorporating additional number-theoretic constraints to restrict the enumeration. Our improvements significantly enhance the efficiency of the methods presented in previous work by the authors.</description>

      <title>Positivity properties of $q$-hit numbers in the finite general linear group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of counting matrices over a finite field with fixed rank and support contained in a fixed set. The count of such matrices gives a $q$-analogue of the classical rook and hit numbers, known as the $q$-rook and $q$-hit numbers. They are known not to be polynomial in $q$ in general. We use inclusion-exclusion on the support of the matrices and the orbit counting method of Lewis et al. to show that the residues of these functions in low degrees are polynomial. We define a generalization of the classical rook and hit numbers which count placements of certain classes of graphs. These give us a formula for residues of the $q$-rook and $q$-hit numbers in low degrees. We analyze the residues of the $q$-hit number and show that the coefficient of $q-1$ in the $q$-hit number is always non-negative.</description>

      <title>Neighborhood unions and disjoint chorded cycles in $2$-connected graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A {\em chorded cycle} $C$ is a graph that contains a spanning cycle and at least one additional edge. Let $G$ be a graph and let $NC_{2}(G)=min\{|N_{G}(x)\cup N_{G}(y)||xy \notin E(G),x,y \in V(G)\}$. In 2010, Gao \cite{YGJ} and Qiao \cite{SNQ} independently proved if $G$ is a graph of order at least $4s$ and $NC_{2}(G) \geq 4s+1$, then $G$ contains $s$ vertex-disjoint chorded cycles, respectively. In 2022, Gould raised a question of whether increasing connectivity would improve outcome. In this paper, we solved the case that $k=2$, and prove that if $G$ be a $2$-connected graph with at least $4s$ vertices and $NC_{2}(G) \geq 4s$, then $G$ contains $s$ vertex-disjoint chorded cycles. The condition is sharp.</description>

      <title>The characteristic polynomials of $r$-uniform hypercycles with length $l$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $C_{l}$ be a cycle with length $l.$ The $r$-uniform hypercycle with length $l$ is obtained by adding $r-2$ new vertices in every edge of $C_{l},$ denoted by $C_l^{(r)}$. In this paper, we deduce some higher-order traces for the adjacent tensor of $C_l^{(r)}$ by BEST Theorem. Then we obtain higher-order spectral moments according to the relationship between eigenvalues of power hypergraphs and eigenvalues of signed graphs. Finally, the general expression of the characteristic polynomials of $C_l^{(r)}$ is given. Furthermore, by using this general expression, we present the characteristic polynomials of $C_5^{(r)}$ and $C_6^{(r)}$ as examples.</description>

      <title>A permutation based approach to the $q$-deformation of the Dynkin Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Introduced by Solomon, the descent algebra is a significant subalgebra of the group algebra of the symmetric group $\mathbf{k}S_n$ related to many important algebraic and combinatorial topics. It contains all the classical Lie idempotents of $\mathbf{k}S_n$, in particular the Dynkin operator, a fundamental tool for studying the free Lie algebra. We look at a $q$-deformation of the Dynkin operator and study its action over the descent algebra with classical combinatorial tools like Solomon's Mackey formula. This leads to elementary proofs that the operator is indeed an idempotent for $q=1$ as well as to interesting formulas and algebraic structures especially when $q$ is a root of unity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we explore links between Riordan arrays and lattice paths. We begin by describing Riordan arrays, and some of their generalizations, including rectifications and triangulations. We the consider Riordan array links to lattice paths with steps of type $(a,b)$, where $a$ and $b$ are nonnegative. We consider common Riordan arrays that are linked to lattice paths, as well as showing links between almost Riordan arrays and lattice paths. We then consider lattice paths with step sets that include downward steps, and show how the $A$-matrix characterization of Riordan arrays plays a key role in analysing corresponding Riordan arrays.</description>

      <title>A SageMath Package for Analytic Combinatorics in Several Variables: Beyond the Smooth Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The field of analytic combinatorics in several variables (ACSV) develops techniques to compute the asymptotic behaviour of multivariate sequences from analytic properties of their generating functions. When the generating function under consideration is rational, its set of singularities forms an algebraic variety -- called the singular variety -- and asymptotic behaviour depends heavily on the geometry of the singular variety. By combining a recent algorithm for the Whitney stratification of algebraic varieties with methods from ACSV, we present the first software that rigorously computes asymptotics of sequences whose generating functions have non-smooth singular varieties (under other assumptions on local geometry). Our work is built on the existing sage_acsv package for the SageMath computer algebra system, which previously gave asymptotics under a smoothness assumption. We also report on other improvements to the package, such as an efficient technique for determining higher order asymptotic expansions using Newton iteration, the ability to use more efficient backends for algebraic computations, and a method to compute so-called critical points for any multivariate rational function through Whitney stratification.</description>

      <title>Arbitrary orientations of cycles in oriented graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that every sufficiently large oriented graph $G$ with both minimum indegree and outdegree at least $(3|V(G)|-1)/8$ contains every possible orientation of a Hamilton cycle. This improves on an approximate result by Kelly and solves a problem of H\"aggkvist and Thomason from 1995. Moreover the bound is best possible. We also obtain a pancyclicity result for arbitrary orientations. More precisely, we show that the above degree condition is sufficient to guarantee a cycle of every possible orientation and of every possible length unless $G$ is isomorphic to one of exceptional oriented graphs.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we defined neo balcobalancing numbers, neo Lucas-balcobalancing numbers, neo balcobalancers and neo Lucas-balcobalancers and derived the general terms of these numbers in terms of balancing numbers. Conversely we deduced the general terms of balancing, cobalancing, Lucas-balancing and Lucas-cobalancing numbers in terms of these numbers. We also deduced some relations on Binet formulas, recurrence relations, relationship with Pell, Pell-Lucas, triangular, square triangular numbers, Pythagorean triples and Cassini identities. We also formulate the sum of first $n$-terms of these numbers and obtained some formulas for the sums of Pell, Pell-Lucas, balancing and Lucas-cobalancing numbers in terms of these numbers.</description>

      <title>Generalized Natural Density $\DF(\mathfrak{F}_n)$ of Fibonacci Word</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores profound generalizations of the Fibonacci sequence, delving into random Fibonacci sequences, $k$-Fibonacci words, and their combinatorial properties. We established that the $n$-th root of the absolute value of terms in a random Fibonacci sequence converges to $1.13198824\ldots$, a symmetry identity for sums involving Fibonacci words, $\sum_{n=1}^{b} \frac{(-1)^n F_a}{F_n F_{n+a}} = \sum_{n=1}^{a} \frac{(-1)^n F_b}{F_n F_{n+b}}$, and an infinite series identity linking Fibonacci terms to the golden ratio. These findings underscore the intricate interplay between number theory and combinatorics, illuminating the rich structure of Fibonacci-related sequences. We provide, according to this paper, new concepts of density of Fibonacci word.</description>

      <title>Maximizing subgraph density in graphs of bounded degree and clique number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We asymptotically determine the maximum density of subgraphs isomorphic to $H$, where $H$ is any graph containing a dominating vertex, in graphs $G$ on $n$ vertices with bounded maximum degree and bounded clique number. That is, we asymptotically determine the constant $c=c(H,\Delta,\omega)$ such that ex$(n,H,\{K_{1,\Delta+1},K_{\omega+1}\})=(1-o_n(1))cn$. More generally, if $H$ has at least $u$ dominating vertices, then we find the maximum density of subgraphs isomorphic to $H$ in graphs $G$ that have $p$ cliques of size $u$, have bounded clique number, and are $K_u\vee I_{\Delta+1}$-free. For example, we asymptotically determine the constant $d=d(H,\Delta,\omega)$ such that mex$(m,H,\{K_{1,1,\Delta+1},K_{\omega+1}\})=(1-o_m(1))dm$. Then we localize these results, proving a tight inequality involving the sizes of the locally largest cliques and complete split graphs.</description>

      <title>Nonnegativity of signomials with Newton simplex over convex sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a class of signomials whose positive support is the set of vertices of a simplex and which may have multiple negative support points in the simplex. Various groups of authors have provided an exact characterization for the global nonnegativity of a signomial in this class in terms of circuit signomials and that characterization provides a tractable nonnegativity test. We generalize this characterization to the constrained nonnegativity over a convex set $X$. This provides a tractable $X$-nonnegativity test for the class in terms of relative entropy programming and in terms of the support function of $X$.

      <title>The diagonal and Hadamard grade of hypergeometric functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diagonals of rational functions are an important class of functions arising in number theory, algebraic geometry, combinatorics, and physics. In this paper we study the diagonal grade of a function $f$, which is defined to be the smallest $n$ such that $f$ is the diagonal of a rational function in variables $x_0,\dots, x_n$. We relate the diagonal grade of a function to the nilpotence of the associated differential equation. This allows us to determine the diagonal grade of many hypergeometric functions and answer affirmatively the outstanding question on the existence of functions with diagonal grade greater than $2$. In particular, we show that $\prescript{}{n}F_{n-1}(\frac{1}{2},\dots, \frac{1}{2};1\dots,1 \mid x)$ has diagonal grade $n$ for each $n\geq 1$. Our method also applies to the generating function of the Ap\'ery sequence, which we find to have diagonal grade $3$. We also answer related questions on Hadamard grades posed by Allouche and Mend\`es France. For example, we show that $\prescript{}{n}F_{n-1}(\frac{1}{2},\dots, \frac{1}{2};1\dots,1 \mid x)$ has Hadamard grade $n$ for all $n\geq 1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the generalized Chv\'atal-Sankoff constant $\gamma_{k,d}$, which represents the normalized expected length of the longest common subsequence (LCS) of $d$ independent uniformly random strings over an alphabet of size $k$. We derive asymptotically tight bounds for $\gamma_{2,d}$, establishing that $\gamma_{2,d} = \frac{1}{2} + \Theta\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{d}}\right)$. We also derive asymptotically near-optimal bounds on $\gamma_{k,d}$ for $d\ge \Omega(\log k)$.</description>

      <title>Target Pebbling in Trees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph pebbling is a game played on graphs with pebbles on their vertices. A pebbling move removes two pebbles from one vertex and places one pebble on an adjacent vertex. A configuration $C$ is a supply of pebbles at various vertices of a graph $G$, and a distribution $D$ is a demand of pebbles at various vertices of $G$. The $D$-pebbling number, $\pi(G, D)$, of a graph $G$ is defined to be the minimum number $m$ such that every configuration of $m$ pebbles can satisfy the demand $D$ via pebbling moves. The special case in which $t$ pebbles are demanded on vertex $v$ is denoted $D=v^t$, and the $t$-fold pebbling number, $\pi_{t}(G)$, equals $\max_{v\in G}\pi(G,v^t)$. It was conjectured by Alc\'on, Gutierrez, and Hurlbert that the pebbling numbers of chordal graphs forbidding the pyramid graph can be calculated in polynomial time. Trees, of course, are the most prominent of such graphs. In 1989, Chung determined $\pi_t(T)$ for all trees $T$. In this paper, we provide a polynomial-time algorithm to compute the pebbling numbers $\pi(T,D)$ for all distributions $D$ on any tree $T$, and characterize maximum-size configurations that do not satisfy $D$.</description>

      <title>Finding large $k$-colorable induced subgraphs in (bull, chair)-free and (bull,E)-free graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Max Partial $k$-Coloring problem, where we are given a vertex-weighted graph, and we ask for a maximum-weight induced subgraph that admits a proper $k$-coloring. For $k=1$ this problem coincides with Maximum Weight Independent Set, and for $k=2$ the problem is equivalent (by complementation) to Minimum Odd Cycle Transversal. Furthermore, it generalizes $k$-Coloring. We show that Max Partial $k$-Coloring on $n$-vertex instances with clique number $\omega$ can be solved in time
  * $n^{\mathcal{O}(k\omega)}$ if the input graph excludes the bull and the chair as an induced subgraph,
  * $n^{\mathcal{O}(k\omega \log n)}$ if the input graph excludes the bull and E as an induced subgraph.
  This implies that $k$-Coloring can be solved in polynomial time in the former class, and in quasipolynomial-time in the latter one.</description>

      <title>The varieties generated by 3-hypergraph semirings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper the 3-hypergraph semigroups and 3-hypergraph semirings from 3-hypergraphs $\mathbb{H}$ are introduced and the varieties generated by them are studied. It is shown that all 3-hypergraph semirings $S_{\scriptscriptstyle \mathbb{H}}$ are nonfinitely based and subdirectly irreducible. Also, it is proved that each variety generated by 3-hypergraph semirings is equal to a variety generated by 3-uniform hypergraph semirings. It is well known that both variety $\mathbf{V}(S_c(abc))$ (see, J. Algebra 611: 211--245, 2022 and J. Algebra 623: 64--85, 2023) and variety $\mathbf{V}(S_{\scriptscriptstyle \mathbb{H}})$ play key role in the theory of variety of ai-semirings, where 3-uniform hypergraph $\mathbb{H}$ is a 3-cycle. They are shown that each variety generated by 2-robustly strong 3-colorable 3-uniform hypergraph semirings is equal to variety $\mathbf{V}(S_c(abc))$, and each variety generated by so-called beam-type hypergraph semirings or fan-type hypergraph semirings is equal to the variety $\mathbf{V}(S_{\scriptscriptstyle \mathbb{H}})$ generated by a 3-uniform 3-cycle hypergraph semiring $S_{\scriptscriptstyle \mathbb{H}}$. Finally, an infinite ascending chain is provided in the lattice of subvarieties of the variety generated by all 3-uniform hypergraph semirings. This implies that the variety generated by all 3-uniform hypergraph semirings has infinitely many subvarieties.</description>

      <title>Self-Orthogonal Cellular Automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is known that no-boundary Cellular Automata (CA) defined by bipermutive local rules give rise to Latin squares. In this paper, we study under which conditions the Latin square generated by a bipermutive CA is self-orthogonal, i.e. orthogonal to its transpose. We first enumerate all bipermutive CA over the binary alphabet up to diameter $d=6$, remarking that only some linear rules give rise to self-orthogonal Latin squares. We then give a full theoretical characterization of self-orthogonal linear CA, by considering the square matrix obtained by stacking the transition matrices of the CA and of its transpose, and determining when it is invertible. Interestingly, the stacked matrix turns out to have a circulant structure, for which there exists an extensive body of results to characterize its invertibility. Further, for the case of the binary alphabet we prove that irreducibility is a sufficient condition for self-orthogonality, and we derive a simpler characterization which boils down to computing the parity of the central coefficients of the local rule.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note, I develop a representation-theoretic refinement of the Iwasawa theory of finite Cayley graphs. Building on analogies between graph zeta functions and number-theoretic L-functions, I study $\mathbb{Z}_\ell$-towers of Cayley graphs and the asymptotic growth of their Jacobians. My main result establishes that the Iwasawa polynomial associated to such a tower admits a canonical factorization indexed by the irreducible representations of the underlying group. This leads to the definition of representation-theoretic Iwasawa polynomials, whose properties are studied.</description>

      <title>Direct and Inverse Problems for Restricted Signed Sumsets -- I</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $A=\{a_{1},\ldots,a_{k}\}$ be a nonempty finite subset of an additive abelian group $G$. For a positive integer $h$, the $h$-fold signed sumset of $A$, denoted by $h_{\pm}A$, is defined as $$h_{\pm}A=\left\lbrace \sum_{i=1}^{k} \lambda_{i} a_{i}: \lambda_{i} \in \{-h, \ldots, 0, \ldots, h\} \ \text{for} \ i= 1, 2, \ldots, k \ \text{and} \ \sum_{i=1}^{k} \left|\lambda_{i} \right| =h\right\rbrace,$$ and the restricted $h$-fold signed sumset of $A$, denoted by $h^{\wedge}_{\pm}A$, is defined as $$h^{\wedge}_{\pm}A=\left\lbrace \sum_{i=1}^{k} \lambda_{i} a_{i}: \lambda_{i} \in \left\lbrace -1, 0, 1\right\rbrace \ \text{for} \ i= 1, 2, \ldots, k \ \text{and} \ \sum_{i=1}^{k} \left|\lambda_{i} \right| = h\right\rbrace. $$ A direct problem for the sumset $h^{\wedge}_{\pm}A$ is to find the optimal size of $h^{\wedge}_{\pm}A$ in terms of $h$ and $|A|$. An inverse problem for this sumset is to determine the structure of the underlying set $A$ when the sumset $h^{\wedge}_{\pm}A$ has optimal size. While some results are known for the signed sumsets in finite abelian groups due to Bajnok and Matzke, not much is known for the restricted $h$-fold signed sumset $h^{\wedge}_{\pm}A$ even in the additive group of integers $\Bbb Z$. In case of $G = \Bbb Z$, Bhanja, Komatsu and Pandey studied these problems for the sumset $h^{\wedge}_{\pm}A$ for $h=2, 3$, and $k$, and conjectured the direct and inverse results for $h \geq 4$. In this paper, we prove these conjectures completely for the sets of positive integers. In a subsequent paper, we prove these conjectures for the sets of nonnegative integers.</description>

Abstract: Let $A=\{a_{1},\ldots,a_{k}\}$ be a nonempty finite subset of an additive abelian group $G$. For a positive integer $h$, the restricted $h$-fold signed sumset of $A$, denoted by $h^{\wedge}_{\pm}A$, is defined as $$h^{\wedge}_{\pm}A = \left\lbrace \sum_{i=1}^{k} \lambda_{i} a_{i}: \lambda_{i} \in \left\lbrace -1, 0, 1\right\rbrace \ \text{for} \ i= 1, 2, \ldots, k \ \text{and} \ \sum_{i=1}^{k} \left|\lambda_{i} \right| =h\right\rbrace. $$ A direct problem for the restricted $h$-fold signed sumset is to find the optimal size of $h^{\wedge}_{\pm}A$ in terms of $h$ and $|A|$. An inverse problem for this sumset is to determine the structure of the underlying set $A$ when the sumset has optimal size. While the signed sumsets (which is defined differently compared to the restricted signed sumset) in finite abelian groups has been investigated by Bajnok and Matzke, the restricted $h$-fold signed sumset $h^{\wedge}_{\pm}A$ is not well studied even in the additive group of integers $\Bbb Z$. Bhanja, Komatsu and Pandey studied these problems for the restricted $h$-fold signed sumset for $h=2, 3$, and $k$, and conjectured some direct and inverse results for $h \geq 4$. In a recent paper, Mistri and Prajapati proved these conjectures completely for the set of positive integers. In this paper, we prove these conjectures for the set of nonnegative integers, which settles all the conjectures completely.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct, for each real number $0\leq \alpha \leq 1$, a random walk on a finitely generated semigroup whose speed exponent is $\alpha$. We further show that the speed function of a random walk on a finitely generated semigroup can be arbitrarily slow, yet tending to infinity. These phenomena demonstrate a sharp contrast from the group-theoretic setting. On the other hand, we show that the distance of a random walk on a finitely generated semigroup from its starting position is infinitely often larger than a non-constant universal lower bound, excluding a certain degenerate case.</description>

      <title>Abstract simplicial complexes in {\tt Macaulay2}</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: {\tt AbstractSimplicialComplexes.m2} is a computer algebra package written for the computer algebra system {\tt Macaulay2} \cite{M2}. It provides new infrastructure to work with abstract simplicial complexes and related homological constructions. Its key novel feature is to implement each given abstract simplicial complex as a certain graded list in the form of a hash table with integer keys. Among other features, this allows for a direct implementation of the associated reduced and non-reduced simplicial chain complexes. Further, it facilitates construction of random simplicial complexes. The approach that we employ here builds on the {\tt Macaulay2} package {\tt Complexes.m2} \cite{Stillman:Smith:Complexes.m2}. It complements and is entirely different from the existing {\tt Macaulay2} simplicial complexes framework that is made possible by the package {\tt SimplicialComplexes.m2} \cite{Smith:et:al:SimplicialComplexes.m2:jsag}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the primary methods of studying the topology of configurations of points in a graph and configurations of disks in a planar region has been to examine discrete combinatorial models arising from the underlying spaces. Despite the success of these models in the graph and disk settings, they have not been constructed for the vast majority of surface configuration spaces. In this paper, we construct such a model for the ordered configuration space of $m$ points in an oriented surface $\Sigma$. More specifically, we prove that if we give $\Sigma$ a certain cube complex structure $K$, then the ordered configuration space of $m$ points in $\Sigma$ is homotopy equivalent to a subcomplex of $K^{m}$</description>

      <title>Applications of infinite lower triangular matrices and their group structure in combinatorics and the theory of orthogonal polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.12373v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the set of lower-triangular, infinite matrices with natural operations such as addition, multiplication by a number or matrix multiplication. With respect to every of these operations separately, the set preserves the group structure. With respect to all three operations considered jointly, the set becomes an algebra with unity. We indicate important properties of the obtained in this way algebraic structures. In particular, we indicate several sub-groups or sub-rings. Among sub-groups, we consider the group of Riordan matrices and indicate its several sub-groups. We also present many examples (in fact around 20) of such matrices composed of the sequences of important families of polynomials or numbers as entries of certain lower-triangular infinite matrices. By applying well-known matrix operations such as multiplication and calculating an inverse, we see that such representation can be and is a source of getting new, important relationships between these families.</description>

      <title>The chromatic number of the plane with an interval of forbidden distances is at least 7</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.10163v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The work is devoted to one of the variations of the Hadwiger--Nelson problem on the chromatic number of the plane. In this formulation one needs to find for arbitrarily small $\varepsilon$ the least possible number of colors needed to color a Euclidean plane in such a way that any two points, the distance between which belongs to the interval $[1-\varepsilon, 1+\varepsilon]$, are colored differently. The conjecture proposed by G. Exoo in 2004, states that for arbitrary positive $\varepsilon$ at least 7 colors are required. Also, with a sufficiently small $\varepsilon$ the number of colors is exactly 7. The main result of the present paper is that the conjecture is true for the Euclidean plane as well as for any Minkowski plane.</description>

      <title>Weak diameter choosability of graphs with an excluded minor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17795v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Weak diameter coloring of graphs recently attracted attention partially due to its connection to asymptotic dimension of metric spaces. We consider weak diameter list-coloring of graphs in this paper. Dvo\v{r}\'{a}k and Norin proved that graphs with bounded Euler genus are 3-choosable with bounded weak diameter. In this paper, we extend their result by showing that for every graph $H$, $H$-minor free graphs are 3-choosable with bounded weak diameter. The upper bound 3 is optimal and it strengthens an earlier result for non-list-coloring $H$-minor free graphs with bounded weak diameter. As a corollary, $H$-minor free graphs with bounded maximum degree are 3-choosable with bounded clustering, strengthening an earlier result for non-list-coloring.
  When $H$ is planar, we prove a much stronger result: for every 2-list-assignment $L$ of an $H$-minor free graph, every precoloring with bounded weak diameter can be extended to an $L$-coloring with bounded weak diameter. As a corollary, for any planar graph $H$ and $H$-minor free graph $G$, there are exponentially many list-colorings of $G$ with bounded weak diameter (and with bounded clustering if $G$ also has bounded maximum degree); and every graph with bounded layered tree-width and bounded maximum degree has exponentially many 3-colorings with bounded clustering.
  We also show that the aforementioned results for list-coloring cannot be extended to odd minor free graphs by showing that some bipartite graphs with maximum degree $\Delta$ are $k$-choosable with bounded weak diameter only when $k=\Omega(\log\Delta/\log\log\Delta)$. On the other hand, we show that odd $H$-minor graphs are 3-colorable with bounded weak diameter, implying an earlier result about clustered coloring of odd $H$-minor free graphs with bounded maximum degree.</description>

      <title>Irreducible characters and bitrace for the $q$-rook monoid</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13681v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies irreducible characters of the $q$-rook monoid algebra $R_n(q)$ using the vertex algebraic method. Based on the Frobenius formula for $R_n(q)$, a new iterative character formula is derived with the help of the vertex operator realization of the Schur symmetric function. The same idea also leads to a simple proof of the Murnaghan-Nakayama rule for $R_n(q)$. We also introduce the bitrace for the $q$-rook monoid and derive its combinatorial formula as a generalization of the bitrace formula for the Iwahori-Hecke algebra. The character table of $R_n(q)$ with $|\mu|=5$ is listed in the appendix.</description>

Abstract: In this note, we explore the connections between the confluent Vandermonde matrix and several mathematical topics, including interpolating polynomials, Hasse derivatives, LU factorization, companion matrices and their Jordan forms, and the Chinese remainder theorem. Using a unified approach based on polynomial evaluations and derivative computations at selected points, we provide accessible proofs that not only clarify key results but also offer insights for both experienced researchers and those new to the subject.</description>

      <title>Local symmetries in partially ordered sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14533v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Partially ordered sets (posets) play a universal role as an abstract structure in many areas of mathematics. For finite posets, an explicit enumeration of distinct partial orders on a set of unlabelled elements is known only up to a cardinality of 16 (listed as sequence A000112 in the OEIS), but closed expressions are unknown. By considering the automorphisms of (finite) posets, I introduce a formulation of local symmetries. These symmetries give rise to a division operation on the set of posets and lead to the construction of symmetry classes that are easier to characterise and enumerate. Furthermore, we consider polynomial expressions that count certain subsets of posets with a large number of layers (a large height). As an application in physics, local symmetries or rather their absence helps to distinguish causal sets (locally finite posets) that serve as discrete spacetime models from generic causal sets.</description>

      <title>On the number of sets with small sumset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04492v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate subsets with small sumset in arbitrary abelian groups. For an abelian group $G$ and an $n$-element subset $Y \subseteq G$ we show that if $m \ll s^2/(\log n)^2$, then the number of subsets $A \subseteq Y$ with $|A| = s$ and $|A + A| \leq m$ is at most \[2^{o(s)}\binom{\frac{m+\beta}{2}}{s},\] where $\beta$ is the size of the largest subgroup of $G$ of size at most $\left(1+o(1)\right)m$. This bound is sharp for $\mathbb{Z}$ and many other groups. Our result improves the one of Campos and nearly bridges the remaining gap in a conjecture of Alon, Balogh, Morris, and Samotij.
  We also explore the behaviour of uniformly chosen random sets $A \subseteq \{1,\ldots,n\}$ with $|A| = s$ and $|A + A| \leq m$. Under the same assumption that $m \ll s^2/(\log n)^2$, we show that with high probability there exists an arithmetic progression $P \subseteq \mathbb{Z}$ of size at most $m/2 + o(m)$ containing all but $o(s)$ elements of $A$. Analogous results are obtained for asymmetric sumsets, improving results by Campos, Coulson, Serra, and W\"otzel.
  The main tool behind our results is a more efficient container-type theorem developed for sets with small sumset, which gives an essentially optimal collection of containers. The proof of this combines an adapted hypergraph container lemma, that caters to the asymmetric setup as well, with a novel ``preprocessing'' graph container lemma, which allows the hypergraph container lemma to be called upon significantly less times than was necessary before.</description>

      <title>Digraph Placement Games</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12219v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers a natural ruleset for playing a partisan combinatorial game on a directed graph, which we call Digraph Placement. Given a digraph $G$ with a not necessarily proper $2$-coloring of $V(G)$, the Digraph Placement game played on $G$ by the players Left and Right, who play alternately, is defined as follows. On her turn, Left chooses a blue vertex which is deleted along with all of its out-neighbours. On his turn Right chooses a red vertex, which is deleted along with all of its out-neighbours. A player loses if on their turn they cannot move. We show constructively that Digraph Placement is a universal partisan ruleset; for all partisan combinatorial games $X$ there exists a Digraph Placement game, $G$, such that $G = X$. Digraph Placement and many other games including Nim, Poset Game, Col, Node Kayles, Domineering, and Arc Kayles are instances of a class of placement games that we call conflict placement games. We prove that $X$ is a conflict placement game if and only if it has the same literal form as a Digraph Placement game. A corollary of this is that deciding the winner of a Digraph Placement game is PSPACE-hard. Next, for a game value $X$ we prove bounds on the order of a smallest Digraph Placement game $G$ such that $G = X$.</description>

      <title>On the oriented diameter of graphs with given minimum degree</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06587v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Erd\H{o}s, Pach, Pollack, and Tuza [\textit{J. Combin. Theory Ser. B, 47(1) (1989), 73-79}] proved that the diameter of a connected $n$-vertex graph with minimum degree $\delta$ is at most $\frac{3n}{\delta+1}+O(1)$. The oriented diameter of an undirected graph $G$, denoted by $\overrightarrow{\text{diam}}(G)$, is the minimum diameter of a strongly connected orientation of $G$. Bau and Dankelmann [\textit{European J. Combin., 49 (2015), 126-133}] showed that for every bridgeless $n$-vertex graph $G$ with minimum degree $\delta$, $\overrightarrow{\text{diam}}(G) \leq \frac{11n}{\delta+1}+9$. They also showed an infinite family of graphs with oriented diameter at least $\frac{3n}{\delta+1} + O(1)$ and posed the problem of determining the smallest possible value $c$ for which $\overrightarrow{\text{diam}}(G) \leq c \cdot\frac{3n}{\delta+1}+O(1)$ holds. In this paper, we show that the smallest value $c$ such that the upper bound above holds for all $\delta\geq 2$ is $1$, which is best possible.</description>

      <title>New arithmetic invariants for cospectral graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01551v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An invariant for cospectral graphs is a property shared by all cospectral graphs. In this paper, we establish three novel arithmetic invariants for cospectral graphs, revealing deep connections between spectral properties and combinatorial structures. More precisely, one of our main results shows that for any two cospectral graphs $G$ and $H$ with adjacency matrices $A(G)$ and $A(H)$, respectively, the following congruence holds for all integers $m\geq 0$:\[e^{\rm T}A(G)^me\equiv e^{\rm T}A(H)^me \pmod{4},\] where $e$ is the all-one vector. Moreover, we present a number of fascinating applications. Specifically: i) Resolving a conjecture proposed by the third author, we demonstrate that under certain conditions, every graph cospectral with a graph $G$ is determined by its generalized spectrum. ii) We demonstrate that whenever the complements of two trees are cospectral, then one tree has a perfect matching if and only if the other does. An analogous result holds for the existence of triangles in general graphs. iii) An unexpected connection to the polynomial reconstruction problem is also provided, showing that the parity of the constant term of the characteristic polynomial is reconstructible.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01383v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A classic problem in data analysis is studying the systems of subsets defined by either a similarity or a dissimilarity function on $X$ which is either observed directly or derived from a data set. For an electrical network there are two functions on the set of the nodes defined by the resistance matrix and the response matrix either of which defines the network completely. We argue that these functions should be viewed as a similarity and a dissimilarity function on the set of the nodes moreover they are related via the covariance mapping also known as the Farris transform or the Gromov product. We will explore the properties of electrical networks from this point of view. It has been known for a while that the resistance matrix defines a metric on the nodes of the electrical networks. Moreover for a circular electrical network this metric obeys the Kalmanson property as it was shown recently. We will call such a metric an electrical Kalmanson metric. The main results of this paper is a complete description of the electrical Kalmanson metrics in the set of all Kalmanson metrics in terms of the geometry of the positive Isotropic Grassmannian whose connection to the theory of electrical networks was discovered earlier. One important area of applications where Kalmanson metrics are actively used is the theory of phylogenetic networks which are a generalization of phylogenetic trees. Our results allow us to use in phylogenetics the powerful methods of reconstruction of the minimal graphs of electrical networks and possibly open the door into data analysis for the methods of the theory of cluster algebras.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we study hook lengths in $\ell$-regular partitions and $\ell$-distinct partitions. More precisely, we establish hook length inequalities between $\ell$-regular partitions and $\ell$-distinct partitions for hook lengths $2$ and $3$, by deriving asymptotic formulas for the total number of hooks of length $t$ in both partition classes, for $t = 1, 2, 3$. From these asymptotics, we show that the ratio of the total number of hooks of length $t$ in $\ell$-regular partitions to those in $\ell$-distinct partitions tends to a constant that depends on $\ell$ and $t$. We also provide hook length inequalities within $\ell$-regular partitions and within $\ell$-distinct partitions.</description>

      <title>Ellipsoidal designs and the Prouhet--Tarry--Escott problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17106v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The notion of ellipsoidal design was first introduced by Pandey (2022) as a full generalization of spherical designs on the unit circle $S^1$. In this paper, we elucidate the advantage of examining the connections between ellipsoidal design and the two-dimensional Prouhet--Tarry--Escott problem, say ${\mathrm PTE}_2$, originally introduced by Alpers and Tijdeman (2007) as a natural generalization of the classical one-dimensional PTE problem (${\mathrm PTE}_1$). We first provide a combinatorial criterion for the construction of solutions of ${\mathrm PTE}_2$ from a pair of ellipsoidal designs. We also give an arithmetic proof of the Stroud-type bound for ellipsoidal designs, and then establish a classification theorem for designs with equality. Such a classification result is closely related to an open question on the existence of rational spherical $4$-designs on $S^1$, discussed in Cui, Xia and Xiang (2019). As far as the authors know, a family of ideal solutions found by Alpers and Tijdeman is the first and the only known parametric solution of degree $5$ for ${\mathrm PTE}_2$. As one of our main theorems, we prove that the Alpers--Tijdeman solution is equivalent to a certain two-dimensional extension of the famous Borwein solution for ${\mathrm PTE}_1$. As a by-product of this theorem, we discover a family of ellipsoidal $5$-designs among the Alpers--Tijdeman solution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14918v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In their famous 1974 paper introducing the local lemma, Erd\H{o}s and Lov\'asz posed a question-later referred by Erd\H{o}s as one of his three favorite open problems: What is the minimum number of edges in an $r$-uniform, intersecting hypergraph with cover number $r$? This question was solved up to a constant factor in Kahn's remarkable 1994 paper. More recently, motivated by applications to Bollob\'as' ''power of many colours'' problem, Alon, Buci\'c, Christoph, and Krivelevich introduced a natural generalization by imposing a space constraint that limits the hypergraph to use only $n$ vertices. In this note we settle this question asymptotically, up to a logarithmic factor in $n/r$ in the exponent, for the entire range.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16403v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A classical result by Kreweras (1965) allows one to compute the number of plane partitions of a given skew shape and bounded parts as certain determinants. We prove that these determinants expand as polynomials with nonnegative coefficients. This result can be reformulated in terms of order polynomials of cell posets of skew shapes, and explains important positivity phenomena about the Ehrhart polynomials of shard polytopes, matroids, and order polytopes. Among other applications, we generalize a positivity statement from Schubert calculus by Fomin and Kirillov (1997) from straight shapes to skew shapes. We show that all shard polytopes are Ehrhart positive and, stronger, that all fence posets, including the zig-zag poset, and all circular fence posets have order polynomials with nonnegative coefficients. We discuss a general method for proving positivity which reduces to showing positivity of the linear terms of the order polynomials. We propose positivity conjectures on other relevant classes of posets.</description>

      <title>On a conjecture concerning 4-coloring of graphs with one crossing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08327v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We conjecture that every graph of minimum degree five with no separating triangles and drawn in the plane with one crossing is 4-colorable. In this paper, we use computer enumeration to show that this conjecture holds for all graphs with at most 28 vertices, explore the consequences of this conjecture and provide some insights on how it could be proved.</description>

      <title>Fortuitous sequences of flips of the top of a stack of n burnt pancakes for all n&gt;24</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1601.06278</link>
      <description>arXiv:1601.06278v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Burnt pancakes problem was defined by Gates and Papadimitriou in 1979. A stack $S$ of pancakes with a burnt side must be sorted by size, the smallest on top, and each pancake with burnt side down. The only operation allowed is to split stack in two parts and flip upper part. $g(S)$ is the minimal number of flips needed to sort stack $S$. Stack $S$ may be $-I_n$ when pancakes are in right order but upside down or $-f_n$ when all pancakes are right side up but sorted in reverse order. Gates et al. proved that $g(-f_n)\ge 3n/2-1$. In 1995 Cohen and Blum proved that $g(-I_n)=g(-f_n)+1\ge 3n/2$. In 1997 Heydari and Sudborough proved that $g(-I_n)\le 3(n+1)/2$ whenever some fortuitous sequence of flips exists. They gave fortuitous sequences for $n$=3, 15, 27 and 31. They showed that two fortuitous sequences $S_n$ and $S_{n'}$ may combine into another fortuitous sequence $S_{n''}$ with $n''=n+n'-3$. So a fortuitous sequence $S_n$ gives a fortuitous sequence $S_{n+12}$. This proves that $g(-I_n)\le 3(n+1)/2$ if $n$ is congruent to 3 modulo 4 and $n\ge 23$. In 2011 Josef Cibulka enhanced Gates and Papadimitriou's lower bound thanks to a potential function. He got so $g(-I_n)\ge3n/2+1$ if $n &gt; 1$ proving thereby, that $g(-I_n)=3(n+1)/2$ if $n$ is congruent to 3 modulo 4 and $n\ge 23$. This paper explains how to build generalized fortuitous sequences for $n=15, 19, 23$ and every $n\ge 25$, odd or even, proving thereby that $g(-I_n)=\lceil 3n/2\rceil+1$ for these $n$. It gives $g(-I_n)$ for all $n$.</description>

      <title>Translation-like actions by $\mathbb{Z}$, the subgroup membership problem, and Medvedev degrees of effective subshifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.14820v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that every infinite, locally finite, and connected graph admitsa translation-like action by $\mathbb{Z}$, and that this action can be takento be transitive exactly when the graph has either one or two ends.The actions constructed satisfy $d(v,v\ast 1)\leq3$ for every vertex$v$. This strengthens a theorem by Brandon Seward. We also study the effective computability of translation-like actionson groups and graphs. We prove that every finitely generated infinitegroup with decidable word problem admits a translation-like actionby $\mathbb{Z}$ which is computable, and satisfies an extra condition whichwe call decidable orbit membership problem. As a nontrivial application of our results, we prove that for everyfinitely generated infinite group with decidable word problem, effectivesubshifts attain all $\Pi_{1}^{0}$ Medvedev degrees. This extends a classification proved by Joseph Miller for $\mathbb{Z}^{d},$ $d\geq1$.</description>

      <title>Unimodal sequences and mixed false theta functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09789v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider two-parameter generalizations of Hecke-Appell type expansions for the generating functions of unimodal and special unimodal sequences. We then determine their explicit representations which involve mixed false theta functions. These results complement recent striking work of Mortenson and Zwegers on the mixed mock modularity of the generalized $U$-function due to Hikami and Lovejoy. As an application, we demonstrate how to recover classical partial theta function identities which appear in Ramanujan's lost notebook and in work of Warnaar.</description>

      <title>Explicit Folded Reed-Solomon and Multiplicity Codes Achieve Relaxed Generalized Singleton Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15925v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove that explicit FRS codes and multiplicity codes achieve relaxed generalized Singleton bounds for list size $L\ge1.$ Specifically, we show the following: (1) FRS code of length $n$ and rate $R$ over the alphabet $\mathbb{F}_q^s$ with distinct evaluation points is $\left(\frac{L}{L+1}\left(1-\frac{sR}{s-L+1}\right),L\right)$ list-decodable (LD) for list size $L\in[s]$. (2) Multiplicity code of length $n$ and rate $R$ over the alphabet $\mathbb{F}_p^s$ with distinct evaluation points is $\left(\frac{L}{L+1}\left(1-\frac{sR}{s-L+1}\right),L\right)$ LD for list size $L\in[s]$.
  Choosing $s=\Theta(1/\epsilon^2)$ and $L=O(1/\epsilon)$, our results imply that both FRS codes and multiplicity codes achieve LD capacity $1-R-\epsilon$ with optimal list size $O(1/\epsilon)$. This exponentially improves the previous state of the art $(1/\epsilon)^{O(1/\epsilon)}$ established by Kopparty et. al. (FOCS 2018) and Tamo (IEEE TIT, 2024). In particular, our results on FRS codes fully resolve a open problem proposed by Guruswami and Rudra (STOC 2006). Furthermore, our results imply the first explicit constructions of $(1-R-\epsilon,O(1/\epsilon))$ LD codes of rate $R$ with poly-sized alphabets.
  Our method can also be extended to analyze the list-recoverability (LR) of FRS codes. We provide a tighter radius upper bound that FRS codes cannot be $(\frac{L+1-\ell}{L+1}(1-\frac{mR}{m-1})+o(1),\ell, L)$ LR where $m=\lceil\log_{\ell}{(L+1)}\rceil$. We conjecture this bound is almost tight when $L+1=\ell^a$ for any $a\in\mathbb{N}^{\ge 2}$. To give some evidences, we show FRS codes are $\left(\frac{1}{2}-\frac{sR}{s-2},2,3\right)$ LR, which proves the tightness in the smallest non-trivial case. Our bound refutes the possibility that FRS codes could achieve LR capacity $(1-R-\epsilon, \ell, O(\frac{\ell}{\epsilon}))$. This implies an intrinsic separation between LD and LR of FRS codes.</description>

      <title>Dimension of Diophantine approximation and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12826v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we construct a new family of sets via Diophantine approximation, in which the classical examples are endpoints.
  Our first application is on their Hausdorff dimension. We show a recent result of Ren and Wang, known sharp on orthogonal projections in the plane, is also sharp on $A+cB$, $c\in C$, thus completely settle this ABC sum-product problem. Higher dimensional examples are also discussed.
  In addition to Hausdorff dimension, we also consider Fourier dimension. In particular, now for every $0\leq t\leq s\leq 1$ we have an explicit construction in $\mathbb{R}$ of Hausdorff dimension $s$ and Fourier dimension $t$, together with a measure $\mu$ that captures both dimensions.
  In the end we give new sharpness examples for the Mockenhaupt-Mitsis-Bak-Seeger Fourier restriction theorem. In particular, to deal with the non-geometric case we construct measures of "Hausdorff dimension" $a$ and Fourier dimension $b$, even if $a&lt;b$. This clarifies some difference between sets and measures.</description>

      <title>Hilbert-Kamke equations and geometric designs of degree five for classical orthogonal polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21151v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we elucidate the advantage of examining the connections between Hilbert-Kamke equations and geometric designs, or Chebyshev-type quadrature, for classical orthogonal polynomials. We first establish a classification theorem for such 5-designs with 6 points. The proof is based on an elementary polynomial identity and some advanced techniques on the computation of the genus of a certain irreducible curve. We then prove a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of 5-designs with rational points, especially for the Chebyshev measure of the first kind. It is noteworthy that this result presents a completely explicit construction of rational designs. Moreover, we create novel connections among Hilbert-Kamke equations, geometric designs and the Prouhet-Tarry-Escott (PTE) problem. For example, we establish that the 5-designs with 6 points for the Chebyshev measure appear in the famous parametric solution for the PTE problem found by Borwein (2002).</description>
