      <title>Teachers of bachelors lab courses collaborating to promote open inquiry: a case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A group of university bachelors teachers of open inquiry lab courses in science subjects collaborated in a Networked Faculty Learning Community (NFLC) with the final goal to share their course materials publicly. In this paper we describe their collaborative process, communication on the topic and their road to a common definition of open inquiry as a didactical method. The study emerged organically during the collaboration of this NFLC as the group increasingly recognized the value of documenting their endeavours, allowing others to learn and grow as they did. We can conclude that learning takes place in such a community, even though professional development was not the NFLC s intention.</description>

      <title>Notes from the Physics Teaching Lab: NMR Experiments at 21 Gauss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe a series of laboratory experiments that can be performed with the Quantum Control apparatus sold by TeachSpin, which uses pulsed NMR techniques to observe the precession of protons in a liquid water sample. With a uniform background magnetic field of 21 Gauss, the protons precess at about 90 kHz, yielding numerous relatively simple observations and measurements that are well suited to undergraduate physics teaching labs. Our goal in this paper is to document some of these experiments in detail, thereby making it easier for instructors to choose material that is best suited for their curricula.</description>
