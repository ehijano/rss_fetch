      <title>Bivalent Quantum Indeterminacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides a novel metametaphysical approach to quantum indeterminacy. More specifically, it argues that bivalent quantum logic can successfully account for this kind of indeterminacy, given the non-truth-functional character of its disjunction. Furthermore, it suggests that the determinable-based account of quantum indeterminacy illustrates precisely this possibility.</description>

      <title>Galileo Galilei and Satellite Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1492, for the first time, an unknown ocean opened up before sailors: weeks of navigation and no idea how to pinpoint their location. Since ancient times, navigators had known how to determine latitude by using the North Star, but the "problem of longitude" was different. More than a century later, Galileo Galilei discovered in Padua Jupiter's satellites and quickly realized that a sailor who could observe their eclipses would know his own longitude. Yet his brilliant insight was 400 years ahead of the technology of his time. Impractical at sea, on land this idea became a formidable tool for cartography and ushered in the age of the image of the world. Today the technique can be realized thanks to artificial satellites, and the Tuscan genius' name has reached space with the European satellite system named Galileo. An exhibition in Paris, organized by the Permanent Representation of Italy to the International Organizations, Sorbonne University, and the Galileo Museum in Florence, and directed by Asia Ruffo di Calabria of the Musee des Arts et Metiers, by Quentin Cheval-Galland of the Sorbonne University, and by Alessandro De Angelis, allowed visitors to observe inventions of the time and some writings by Galileo on the theme of geolocation. The exhibition was held in Paris in June 2024. It was replicated in Prague in October 2024, in Amsterdam in December 2025, and at the Perimeter Institute in Waterloo, Canada, in February 2025.</description>

      <title>Incoherent? No, Just Decoherent: How Quantum Many Worlds Emerge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The modern Everett interpretation of quantum mechanics describes an emergent multiverse. The goal of this paper is to provide a perspicuous characterisation of how the multiverse emerges making use of a recent account of (weak) ontological emergence. This will be cashed out with a case study that identifies decoherence as the mechanism for emergence. The greater metaphysical clarity enables the rebuttal of critiques due to Baker (2007) and Dawid and Th\'ebault (2015) that cast the emergent multiverse ontology as incoherent; responses are also offered to challenges to the Everettian approach from Maudlin (2010) and Monton (2013).</description>

      <title>Decoherence and Probability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01317v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One cannot justifiably presuppose the physical salience of structures derived via decoherence theory based upon an entirely uninterpreted use of the quantum formalism. Non-probabilistic accounts of the emergence of probability via decoherence are unconvincing. An alternative account of the emergence of probability involves the combination of a partially interpreted decoherence model and an averaging of observables with respect to a positive-definite quasi-probability function and neglect of terms $O(\hbar)$. Our analysis delimits the context in which the combination of decoherence and a semi-classical averaging allows us to recover a classical probability model within an emergent coarse-grained description.</description>
