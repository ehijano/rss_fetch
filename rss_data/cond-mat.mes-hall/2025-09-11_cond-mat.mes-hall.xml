      <title>Non-monotonic band flattening near the magic angle of twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ (tMoTe$_2$) is an emergent platform for exploring exotic quantum phases driven by the interplay between nontrivial band topology and strong electron correlations. Direct experimental access to its momentum-resolved electronic structure is essential for uncovering the microscopic origins of the correlated topological phases therein. Here, we report angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements of tMoTe$_2$, revealing pronounced twist-angle-dependent band reconstruction shaped by orbital character, interlayer coupling, and moir\'e potential modulation. Density functional theory (DFT) captures the qualitative evolution, yet underestimates key energy scales across twist angles, highlighting the importance of electronic correlations. Notably, the hole effective mass at the K point exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on twist angle, peaking near 2{\deg}, consistent with band flattening at the magic angle predicted by continuum models. Via electrostatic gating and surface dosing, we further visualize the evolution of electronic structure versus doping, enabling direct observation of the conduction band minimum and confirm tMoTe$_2$ as a direct band gap semiconductor. These results establish a spectroscopic foundation for modeling and engineering emergent quantum phases in this moir\'e platform.</description>

      <title>Sliding-tuned Quantum Geometry in Moir\'e Systems: Nonlinear Hall Effect and Quantum Metric Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sliding is a ubiquitous phenomenon in moir\'e systems, but its direct influence on moir\'e bands, especially in multi-twist moir\'e systems, has been largely overlooked to date. Here, we theoretically show that sliding provides a unique pathway to engineer the quantum geometry (Berry curvature and quantum metric) of moir\'e bands, exhibiting distinct advantages over conventional strategies. Specifically, we first suggest alternating twisted trilayer $\mathrm{MoTe_2}$ (AT3L-$\mathrm{MoTe_2}$) and chirally twisted triple bilayer graphene (CT3BLG) as two ideal paradigmatic systems for probing sliding-engineered quantum geometric phenomena. Then, two sliding-induced exotic quantum geometry phenomena are predicted: (1) an intrinsic nonlinear Hall effect via sliding-produced non-zero Berry curvature dipole, with CT3BLG as an ideal platform; (2) significant quantum metric modulation in AT3L-$\mathrm{MoTe_2}$, enabling tests of quantum geometric criteria for fractional Chern insulating state (FCIS). Our work establishes sliding as a new degree of freedom for manipulating quantum geometry of moir\'e bands, which emerges as a signature phenomenon of multi-twist moir\'e systems.</description>

      <title>Visualizing Electronic Structure of Twisted Bilayer MoTe2 in Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pursuit of emergent quantum phenomena lies at the forefront of modern condensed matter physics. A recent breakthrough in this arena is the discovery of the fractional quantum anomalous Hall effect (FQAHE) in twisted bilayer MoTe2 (tbMoTe2), marking a paradigm shift and establishing a versatile platform for exploring the intricate interplay among topology, magnetism, and electron correlations. While significant progress has been made through both optical and electrical transport measurements, direct experimental insights into the electronic structure - crucial for understanding and modeling this system - have remained elusive. Here, using spatially and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy ({\mu}-ARPES), we directly map the electronic band structure of tbMoTe2. We identify the valence band maximum, whose partial filling underlies the FQAHE, at the K points, situated approximately 150 meV above the {\Gamma} valley. By fine-tuning the doping level via in-situ alkali metal deposition, we also resolve the conduction band minimum at the K point, providing direct evidence that tbMoTe2 exhibits a direct band gap - distinct from all previously known moire bilayer transition metal dichalcogenide systems. These results offer critical insights for theoretical modeling and advance our understanding of fractionalized excitations and correlated topological phases in this emergent quantum material.</description>

      <title>Gain-driven magnon-polariton dynamics in the ultrastrong coupling regime: Effective circuit approach for coherence versus nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically study the dynamics of gain-driven magnon-polaritons (MPs), which characterizes auto-oscillation of MPs, across the strong coupling (SC) and ultrastrong coupling (USC) regimes. Taking into account the magnon dynamics via the magnetic flux, we present an effective circuit model of gain-driven MPs, which allows to manipulate the coupling strength of MPs by tuning the size of a ferromagnet and incorporates the self-Kerr nonlinearity of magnons due to the shape magnetic anisotropy. In the SC regime, we find that the self-Kerr nonlinearity generates a frequency shift and reduces the coherent magnon-photon coupling. In contrast, in the USC regime, we find that the coherent magnon-photon coupling not only overcomes the self-Kerr nonlinearity but also effectively couples to gain via the imaginary part of complex eigenfrequencies, resulting in magnon-like auto-oscillations. Subsequently, the USC enables one to widely tune the auto-oscillation frequency by means of an external magnetic field. These findings indicate that there is a trade-off relation between the coupling strength of MPs and the self-Kerr nonlinearity of magnons. This work is attributed to understanding of the interplay between gain-loss and USC in nonlinear polariton dynamics, offering a novel principle for frequency tunable maser-like devices based on gain-driven MPs.</description>

      <title>Bilateral Hydrogenation Realizes High-Temperature Quantum Anomalous Hall Insulator in 2D Cr$_{\text{2}}$Ge$_{\text{2}}$Te$_{\text{6}}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pursuit of high-temperature quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) insulators faces fundamental challenges, including narrow topological gaps and low Curie temperatures ($T_{\text{C}}$) in existing materials. Here, we propose a transformative strategy using bilateral hydrogenation to engineer a robust QAH state in the topologically trivial ferromagnetic semiconductor Cr$_{\text{2}}$Ge$_{\text{2}}$Te$_{\text{6}}$. First-principles calculations reveal that hydrogenation induces a topological phase transition in Cr$_{\text{2}}$Ge$_{\text{2}}$Te$_{\text{6}}$ by shifting its Dirac points-originally embedded in the conduction bands-to the vicinity of the Fermi level in Cr$_{\text{2}}$Ge$_{\text{2}}$Te$_{\text{6}}$H$_{\text{6}}$. This electronic restructuring, coupled with spin-orbit coupling, opens a global topological gap of 118.1 meV, establishing a robust QAH state with Chern number $C=$ 3. Concurrently, hydrogenation enhances ferromagnetic superexchange via the $d_{z^{2}}$-$p_{z}$-$d_{xz}$ channel, significantly strengthening the nearest-neighbor coupling $J_{\text{1}}$ by 3.06 times and switching $J_{\text{2}}$ from antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic. Monte Carlo simulations predict a high $T_{\text{C}}$ = 198 K, sustained well above liquid nitrogen temperature and far exceeding pristine Cr$_{\text{2}}$Ge$_{\text{2}}$Te$_{\text{6}}$ (28 K). This work establishes surface hydrogenation as a powerful route to simultaneously control topology and magnetism in 2D materials, unlocking high-temperature QAH platforms for dissipationless spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Lifetime of bimerons and antibimerons in two-dimensional magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Soliton-based computing architectures have recently emerged as a promising avenue to overcome fundamental limitations of conventional information technologies, the von Neumann bottleneck. In this context, magnetic skyrmions have been widely considered for in-situ processing devices due to their mobility and enhanced lifetime in materials with broken inversion symmetry. However, modern applications in non-volatile reservoir or neuromorphic computing raise the additional demand for non-linear inter-soliton interactions. Here we report that solitons in easy-plane magnets, such as bimerons and antibimerons, show greater versatility and potential for non-linear interactions than skyrmions and antiskyrmions, making them superior candidates for this class of applications. Using first-principles and transition state theory, we predict the coexistence of degenerate bimerons and antibimerons at zero field in a van der Waals heterostructure Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$/Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$ -- an experimentally feasible system. We demonstrate that, owing to their distinct structural symmetry, bimerons exhibit fundamentally different behavior from skyrmions and cannot be regarded as their in-plane counterparts, as is often assumed. This distinction leads to unique properties of bimerons and antibimerons, which arise from the unbroken rotational symmetry in easy-plane magnets. These range from anisotropic soliton-soliton interactions to strong entropic effects on their lifetime, driven by the non-local nature of thermal excitations. Our findings reveal a broader richness of solitons in easy-plane magnets and underline their unique potential for spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Mott transition, high-order van Hove singularity, and mean-field phase diagram of twisted double bilayer WSe${}_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experiments on twisted double bilayer tungsten diselenide have demonstrated that moir\'e semiconductors can be used to realize a relativistic Mott transition, i.e., a quantum phase transition from a Dirac semimetal to a correlated insulating state, by twist-angle tuning. In addition, signatures of van Hove singularities were observed in the material's moir\'e valence bands, suggesting further potential for the emergence of strongly-correlated states in this moir\'e semiconductor. Based on a Bistritzer-MacDonald-type continuum model, we provide a detailed analysis of the twist-angle dependence of the system's moir\'e valence band structure, focusing on both, the evolution of the Dirac excitations and the Fermi-surface structure with its Lifshitz transitions across the van Hove fillings. We exhibit that the twist angle can be used to band engineer a high-order van Hove singularity with power-law exponent~$-1/4$ in the density of states, which can be accessed by gate tuning of the hole filling. We then study the magnetic phase diagram of an effective Hubbard model for twisted double bilayer tungsten diselenide on the effective moir\'e honeycomb superlattice with tight-binding parameters fitted to the two topmost bands of the continuum model. To that end, we employ a self-consistent Hartree-Fock mean-field approach in real space. Fixing the angle-dependent Hubbard interaction based on the experimental findings, we explore a broad parameter range of twist angle, filling, and temperature. We find a rich variety of magnetic states that we expect to be accessible in future experiments by twist or gate tuning, including, e.g., a non-coplanar spin-density wave with non-zero spin chirality and a half-metallic uniaxial spin-density wave.</description>

      <title>Acousto-optical Floquet engineering of a single-photon emitter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The combination of solid state single-photon emitters and mechanical excitations into hybrid infrastructures is a promising approach for new developments in quantum technology. Here we investigate theoretically the resonance fluorescence (RF) spectrum of an acoustically modulated single-photon emitter under arbitrarily strong optical driving. In the spectrum, the combination of Mollow triplet physics and phonon sidebands results in a complex structure of crossings, anti-crossings, and line suppressions. We apply Floquet theory to develop an analytical expression for the RF spectrum. Complemented with perturbative and non-perturbative techniques, this allows us to fully understand the underlying acousto-optical double dressing physics of the hybrid quantum system, explaining the observed spectral features. We use these insights to perform an experimental feasibility study of existing emitter-based acousto-optical platforms and come to the conclusion that bulk acoustic waves interfaced with quantum dots render a promising infrastructure to perform acousto-optical Floquet engineering.</description>

      <title>Bulk Thermal Conductance of the 5/2 and 7/3 Fractional Quantum Hall States in the Corbino Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, making use of time-resolved in situ Joule heating of a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) in the Corbino geometry, we report bulk thermal conductance measurements for the {\nu} = 5/2 and {\nu} = 7/3 fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states for electron temperatures ranging from 20 to 150 mK. We compare our findings with a recent study by Melcer et al. [Nature 625, 489 (2024)] that observed a finite bulk thermal conductivity \k{appa}xx in FQH states. In spite of the large size difference and the vastly different experimental schemes used to extract \k{appa}xx, we find in large part that both experiments yield similar results and conclude that the bulk of FQH states thermally conducts and violate the Wiedemann-Franz law by a wide margin. Slight discrepancies between both studies are further discussed in terms of particle-hole symmetry in the vicinity of the 5/2 and 7/3 FQH states.</description>

      <title>Magnetotransport across Weyl semimetal grain boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A clean interface between two Weyl semimetals features a universal, field-linear tunnel magnetoconductance of $(e^2/h)N_\mathrm{ho}$ per magnetic flux quantum, where $N_\mathrm{ho}$ is the number of chirality-preserving topological interface Fermi arcs. In this work we show that the linearity of the magnetoconductance is robust with to interface disorder. The slope of the magnetoconductance changes at a characteristic field strength $B_\mathrm{arc}$ -- the field strength for which the time taken to traverse the Fermi arc due to the Lorentz force is equal to the mean inter-arc scattering time. For fields much larger than $B_\mathrm{arc}$, the magnetoconductance is unaffected by disorder. For fields much smaller than $B_\mathrm{arc}$, the slope is no longer determined by $N_\mathrm{ho}$ but by the simple fraction $N_\mathrm{L} N_\mathrm{R}/(N_\mathrm{L}+N_\mathrm{R})$, where $N_\mathrm{L}$ and $N_\mathrm{R}$ are the numbers of Weyl-node pairs in the left and right Weyl semimetal, respectively. We also consider the effect of spatially correlated disorder potentials, where we find that $B_\mathrm{arc}$ decreases exponentially with increasing correlation length. Our results provide a possible explanation for the recently observed robustness of the negative linear magnetoresistance in grained Weyl semimetals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kinetic constraints are generally expected to slow down dynamics in many-body systems, obstructing or even completely suppressing transport of conserved charges. Here, we show how gauge theories can defy this wisdom by yielding constrained models with faster-than-diffusive dynamics. We first show how, upon integrating out the gauge fields, one-dimensional U(1) lattice gauge theories are exactly mapped onto XX models with non-local constraints. This new class of kinetically constrained models interpolates between free theories and highly constrained local fermionic models. We find that energy transport is superdiffusive over a broad parameter regime. Even more drastically, spin transport exhibits ballistic behavior, albeit with anomalous finite-volume properties as a consequence of gauge invariance. Our findings are relevant to current efforts in quantum simulations of gauge-theory dynamics and anomalous hydrodynamics in closed quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum sensing with a spin ensemble in a two-dimensional material</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum sensing with solid-state spin defects has transformed nanoscale metrology, offering sub-wavelength spatial resolution with exceptional sensitivity to multiple signal types. Maximizing these advantages requires minimizing both the sensor-target separation and detectable signalthreshold. However, leading platforms such as nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond suffer performance degradation near surfaces or in nanoscale volumes, motivating the search for optically addressable spin sensors in atomically thin, two-dimensional (2D) materials. Here, we present an experimental framework to probe a novel 2D spin ensemble, including its Hamiltonian, coherent sensing dynamics, and noise environment. Using a central spin system in a 2D hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) crystal, we fully map the hyperfine interactions with proximal nuclear spins, demonstrate programmable switching between magnetic and electric sensing, and introduce a robust method for reconstructing the environmental noise spectrum explicitly accounting for quantum control imperfections. We achieve a record coherence time of 80 $\mu$s and nanotesla-level AC magnetic sensitivity at a 10 nm target distance, reaching the threshold for detecting a single nuclear spin in nanoscale spectroscopy. Leveraging the broad opportunities for defect engineering in atomically thin hosts, these results lay the foundation for next-generation quantum sensors with ultrahigh sensitivity, tunable noise selectivity, and versatile quantum functionalities.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional flat bands and possible interlayer triplet pairing superconductivity in the alternating twisted NbSe$_2$ moir\'e bulk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Moir\'e superlattices hosting flat bands and correlated states have emerged as a focal topic in condensed matter research. Through first-principles calculations, we investigate three-dimensional flat bands in alternating twisted NbSe$_2$ moir\'e bulk structures. These structures exhibit enhanced interlayer interactions compared to twisted bilayer configurations. Our results demonstrate that moir\'e bulks undergo spontaneous large-scale structural relaxation, resulting in the formation of remarkably flat energy bands at twist angles $\leq$ 7.31{\deg}. The $k_z$-dependent dispersion of flat bands across different moir\'e bulks reveals their intrinsic three-dimensional character. The presence of out-of-plane mirror symmetry in these moir\'e bulk structures suggests possible interlayer triplet superconducting pairing mechanisms that differ from those in twisted bilayer systems. Our work paves the way for exploring potential three-dimensional flat bands in other moir\'e bulk systems.</description>

      <title>Giant near-field nonlinear electrophotonic effects in an angstrom-scale plasmonic junction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.09173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Plasmons facilitate a strong confinement and enhancement of near-field light, offering exciting opportunities to enhance nonlinear optical responses at the nanoscale. However, despite significant advancements, the electrically tunable range of the nonlinear optical responses at nanometer-scale plasmonic structures remains limited to a few percents per volt. Here, we transcend the limitation of the nanometer regime by expanding the concept of electrophotonics into angstrom-scale platform, enabling high-performance modulation of near-field nonlinear optical responses inaccessible in prior architectures. We demonstrate ~2000% enhancement in second-harmonic generation (SHG) within 1 V of voltage application by utilizing an angstrom-scale plasmonic gap between a metallic tip and a flat metal substrate in a scanning tunneling microscope. Extending this near-field SHG scheme to sum-frequency generation that is accompanied by large frequency upconversion, we also found that such giant electrical modulation of plasmon-enhanced nonlinear optical phenomena is effective over mid-infrared to visible broad wavelength range. Our results and concepts lay the foundation for developing near-field-based angstrom-scale nonlinear electrophotonics with significant modulation depth at low driving voltage.</description>

      <title>Diffraction-Unlimited Tip-Enhanced Sum-Frequency Vibrational Nanoscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sum-frequency generation (SFG) is a powerful second-order nonlinear spectroscopic technique that provides detailed insights into molecular structures and absolute orientations at surfaces and interfaces. However, conventional SFG based on far-field schemes suffers from the diffraction limit of light, which inherently averages spectroscopic information over micrometer-scale regions and obscures nanoscale structural inhomogeneity. Here, we overcome this fundamental limitation by leveraging a highly confined optical near field within a tip-substrate nanogap of a scanning tunneling microscope (STM), pushing the spatial resolution of SFG down to ~10 nm, a nearly two-orders-of-magnitude improvement over conventional far-field SFG. By capturing tip-enhanced SFG (TE-SFG) spectra concurrently with STM scanning, we demonstrate the capability to resolve nanoscale variation in molecular adsorption structures across distinct interfacial domains. To rigorously interpret the observed TE-SFG spectra, we newly developed a comprehensive theoretical framework for the TE-SFG process and confirm via numerical simulations that the TE-SFG response under our current experimental conditions is dominantly governed by the dipole-field interactions, with negligible contributions from higher-order multipole effects. The dominance of the dipole mechanism ensures that the observed TE-SFG spectra faithfully reflect not only nanoscale interfacial structural features but also absolute up/down molecular orientations. This study presents the first experimental realization of diffraction-unlimited second-order nonlinear vibrational SFG nanoscopy, opening a new avenue for nanoscale domain-specific investigation of molecular structures and dynamics within inhomogeneous interfacial molecular systems beyond the conventional far-field SFG and STM imaging.</description>

      <title>Projector Method for Nonlinear Light-Matter Interactions and Quantum Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a systematic projector-based Feynman diagram framework that intrinsically encodes quantum geometry for nonlinear optical responses. By explicitly incorporating geometric quantities such as the quantum geometric tensor, quantum hermitian connection, and triple phase product, the method ensures component-wise gauge invariance and seamlessly extends to multiband systems, enabling accurate calculations of quantum geometry and nonlinear optical responses. We derive the projector formalism in Wannier function basis and implement the \textit{ab initio} calculations of shift current in GeS, demonstrating excellent agreement with the sum rule and Wilson loop approaches. This work extends projector-based representations within the Wannier functions basis, offering an efficient and reliable tool for investigating nonlinear light-matter interactions and quantum geometry in realistic materials.</description>

      <title>Non-Abelian Electric Field and Zitterbewegung on a Photonic Frequency Chain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.09304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The synthetic frequency dimension, which realizes fictitious spatial dimensions from the spectral degree of freedom, has emerged as a promising platform for engineering artificial gauge fields in studying quantum simulations and topological physics with photons. A current central task for frequency-domain photons is the creation and manipulation of nontrivial non-Abelian field strength tensors and observing their governing dynamics. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a miniaturized scheme for creating non-Abelian electric fields in a photonic frequency chain using a polarization-multiplexed, time-modulated ring resonator. By engineering spin-orbit coupling via modulation dephasing, polarization rotation, and polarization retardation, we achieve programmable control over synthetic Floquet bands and their quasimomentum spin-resolved textures. Leveraging self-heterodyne coherent detection, we demonstrate Zitterbewegung -- a trembling motion of photons -- induced by non-Abelian electric fields on the frequency chain. We further observe the interference between Zitterbewegung and Bloch oscillations arising from the coexistence of non-Abelian and Abelian electric fields. Our work bridges synthetic dimensions with non-Abelian gauge theory for versatile photonic emulation of relativistic quantum mechanics and spinor dynamics, and can be instrumental in applications like frequency-domain optical computation and multimodal frequency comb control.</description>

      <title>Observation of the crossover from quantum fluxoid to half-quantum fluxoid in a chiral superconducting device</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.09431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological superconductors are one of the intriguing material groups from the viewpoint of not only condensed matter physics but also industrial application such as quantum computers based on Majorana fermion. For the real application, developments of the thin-film topological superconductors are highly desirable. Bi/Ni bilayer is a possible candidate for thin-film chiral superconductors where the time-reversal symmetry is broken. Here we report the phase shift of resistance oscillations by half flux quantum in a ring-shaped device of epitaxial Bi/Ni bilayer induced by a small magnetic field through the ring. The half quantum fluxoid can be a decisive evidence for unconventional superconductors where the superconducting order parameter has an internal degree of freedom. The present result provides a functional operating principle for quantum devices where the phase of the supercurrent can be shifted by \pi with a small magnetic field, based on the internal degree of freedom possessed by topological superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Flux-driven charge and spin transport in a dimerized Hubbard ring with Fibonacci modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study quantum transport in a one-dimensional Hubbard ring with dimerized nearest-neighbor hoppings and a Fibonacci-modulated onsite potential. For non-interacting case our analysis reveals that at half-filling, the charge current along with the Drude weight decreases with increasing onsite potential when inter-cell hopping dominates over the intra-cell hopping, while for dominating intra-cell hopping it shows non-monotonic behavior with sharp peak at certain critical modulation strength, indicating enhanced transport. Moving away from half-filling gives rise to re-entrant features in both quantities at fillings associated with Fibonacci numbers. On the other hand, in spin-imbalanced systems, both spin and charge current shows multiple peaks and re-entrant behavior, tunable via hopping dimerization and filling. Including the on-site Hubbard interaction preserves the re-entrant behavior in current and moreover favors finite transport which is absent in the non-interacting ring. These results reveal rich interplay among Fibonacci modulated potential, electron fillings, hopping dimerization and interaction.</description>

Abstract: Unconventional orbital paramagnetism without enhanced density of states was recently discovered in the nodal-line semimetal ZrSiS. We propose a novel interband mechanism, linked to the negative curvature of energy dispersions, which successfully accounts for the observed anomalous response. This negative curvature originates from energy variation along the nodal line, inherent in realistic nodal-line materials. Our results suggest that such orbital paramagnetism provides strong evidence for the presence of nodal lines in ZrSiS, and serves as a hallmark of other nodal-line materials.</description>

      <title>Interaction-Induced Topological Phase Transition in Magnetic Weyl Semimetals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17044v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the tremendous interest raised by the recent realization of magnetic Weyl semimetals and the observation of giant anomalous Hall signals, most of the theories used to interpret experimental data overlook the influence of magnetic fluctuations, which are ubiquitous in such materials and can massively impact topological and transport properties. In this work, we predict that in such magnetic topological systems, the interaction between electrons and magnons substantially destabilizes the Weyl nodes, leading to a topological phase transition below the Curie temperature. Remarkably, the sensitivity of the Weyl nodes to electron-magnon interaction depends on their spin chirality. We find that Weyl nodes with a trivial chirality are more sensitive to electron-magnon interactions than Weyl nodes presenting an inverted chirality, demonstrating the resilience of the latter compared to the former. Our results open perspectives for the interpretation of the transport signatures of Weyl semimetals, especially close to the Curie temperature.</description>

Abstract: Amorphous Al$_{2}$O$_{3}$ is a fundamental component of modern superconducting qubits. While amphorphous oxides offer distinct advantages, such as directional isotropy and a consistent bulk electronic gap, in realistic systems these compounds support two-level systems (TLSs) which couple to the qubit, expediting decoherence. In this work, we perform a first-principles study of amorphous Al$_{2}$O$_{3}$ and identify low-energy modes in the electronic and phonon spectra as a possible origin for TLSs.</description>

      <title>Chirality-Driven Magnetization Emerges from Relativistic Four-Current Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03781v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS) is a striking quantum phenomenon in which electron transport through chiral molecules leads to spin polarization -- even in the absence of external magnetic fields or magnetic components. Although observed in systems such as DNA, helicenes, proteins, and polymers, the fundamental physical origin of CISS remains unresolved. Here, we introduce a time-dependent relativistic four-current framework, in which charge and current densities evolve according to the time-dependent variational principle. Real-time relativistic four-current simulations enable direct analysis of helical currents and induced magnetization dynamics. Applied to helicenes -- axially chiral molecules lacking stereocenters -- our simulations reveal curvature-induced helical electron currents that generate spontaneous magnetic fields aligned along the molecular axis. These fields are handedness-dependent and reach magnitudes of $10^{-1}$ Tesla per single helicene strand. Our results suggest that CISS may arise from intrinsic, relativistic curvature-induced helical currents and the associated magnetic fields within chiral molecules. This four-current mechanism offers a self-contained explanation for the driving force underlying spin selectivity, independent of interfacial effects or unphysically enhanced spin-orbit coupling. Furthermore, our results provide a new perspective that offers a unifying framework with the potential to reconcile many existing hypotheses and theoretical models, while also suggesting several testable predictions that can be examined experimentally.</description>

      <title>Quantum theory of fractional topological pumping of lattice solitons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.00090v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the hallmarks of topological quantum systems is the robust quantization of particle transport, which is the origin of the integer-valued Quantum Hall conductivity. In the presence of interactions the topological transport can also become fractional. Recent experiments on topological pumps constructed by arrays of photonic waveguides have demonstrated both integer and fractional transport of lattice solitons. Here a background medium mediates interactions between photons via a Kerr nonlinearity and leads to the formation of self-bound composites, called lattice solitons. Upon increasing the interaction strength of these solitons a sequence of transitions was observed from a phase with integer transport in a pump cycle through different phases of fractional transport to a phase with no transport. We here present a full quantum description of topological pumps of solitons. This approach allows us to identify a topological invariant, a many-body Chern number, determined by the band structure of the center-of-mass (COM) momentum of the solitons, which fully governs their transport. Increasing the interaction leads to a successive merging of COM bands which explains the observed sequence of topological phase transitions and also the potential for a breakdown of topological quantization for intermediate interaction strength.</description>

      <title>Three-Majorana Cotunneling Interferometer for Non-Abelian Braiding and Topological Quantum Gate Implementation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03553v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel scheme for performing Majorana zero mode (MZM) braiding utilizing cotunneling processes in a three-MZM system incorporating reference arms. This approach relies on the interference between cotunneling paths through the MZMs and reference arms, establishing an effective, tunable coupling between the MZMs. The strength and sign of this coupling can be manipulated via the reference arms and applied magnetic flux. Notably, the introduction of a half quantum flux reverses the coupling sign, enabling an echo-like protocol to eliminate dynamic phases during braiding. Our setup, requiring only three MZMs, represents a minimal platform for demonstrating non-Abelian braiding statistics. We demonstrate that this system facilitates the implementation of Clifford gates via braiding and, significantly, permits the realization of non-Clifford gates, such as the $T$ gate, by geometric phase, thereby offering a potential pathway towards universal topological quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Thermoelectric Fingerprinting of Bloch- and N\'{e}el-type Skyrmions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21160v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions are nanoscale spin textures that exhibit topological stability, which, along with novel thermal and electrical transport properties, make them the ideal candidates for a variety of novel technological applications. Accessing the skyrmion spin texture at the nanoscale and understanding its interaction with local thermal gradients is essential for engineering skyrmion-based transport phenomena. However, direct experimental insight into the local thermoelectric response of single skyrmions remains limited. To address this, we employ scanning thermoelectric microscopy~(SThEM) to probe the nanoscale thermoelectric response from a single skyrmion. By mapping the local thermoelectric voltage with nanoscale precision, we reveal a unique spatially resolved response that is the convolution of the underlying spin texture of the skyrmion and its interaction with the highly localised thermal gradient originating from the heated probe. We combine this with thermoelectric modelling of a range of skyrmion spin textures to reveal unique thermoelectric responses and allow the possibility of SThEM to be used as a tool to distinguish nanoscale spin textures. These findings provide fundamental insights into the interaction of topologically protected spin textures with local thermal gradients and the resultant spin transport. We demonstrate a novel route to characterise nanoscale spin textures, accelerating the material optimisation cycle, while also opening the possibility to harness skyrmions for spin caloritronics.</description>

Abstract: By means of an integral experimental and $ab$ $initio$/DFT approach we contribute here to enlighten and quantify the origin of dynamic hyperfine interactions (HFIs) assigned to the electron-capture (EC) decay aftereffects (ECAE) phenomenon observed in time-differential perturbed $\gamma$-$\gamma$ angular correlation (TDPAC) experiments in oxides doped with ($^{111}$In (EC)$\rightarrow$)$^{111}$Cd as probe-atom. In previous works [Darriba et al., Phys. Rev. B 105, 195201 (2022)] we proposed an $ab$ $initio$ scenario in which the fluctuating electric-field gradients (EFG) producing the dynamic HFI were related with fluctuating electronic environments close to the $^{111}$Cd nucleus, succeeding to identify the environment which produce the final static EFG when the dynamic ($on-off$) process has stopped. In this work we show that in addition it is possible to obtain, for each temperature and HFI observed, the set of initial electronic configurations close to the probe nucleus as well as their related EFGs among which the system fluctuates to generate these dynamic HFIs. For this, we demonstrate analytically and check experimentally the conditions to stablish the equivalence between the two approaches most used to analyze this type of dynamic HFIs, proposed by B\"averstam et al. and by Lupascu et al.. To unravel the unexpected TDPAC results in $^{111}$In($\rightarrow$ $^{111}$Cd)-implanted $\alpha$-Al$_2$O$_3$ single crystals reported in the literature, we perform a complete $ab$ $initio$/DFT study of Cd-doped $\alpha$-Al$_2$O$_3$ semiconductor and a detailed defect formation energy analysis as a function of the charge state of the Cd impurity. The presence of an unexpected second interaction was a key factor to provide experimental support to identify and quantify the different charge states the $^{111}$Cd atom goes through during its electronic recovery process.</description>

      <title>Nanoscale photonic neuron with biological signal processing</title>

Abstract: Computational hardware designed to mimic biological neural networks holds the promise to resolve the drastically growing global energy demand of artificial intelligence. A wide variety of hardware concepts have been proposed, and among these, photonic approaches offer immense strengths in terms of power efficiency, speed and synaptic connectivity. However, existing solutions have large circuit footprints limiting scaling potential and they miss key biological functions, like inhibition. We demonstrate an artificial nano-optoelectronic neuron with a circuit footprint size reduced by at least a factor of 100 compared to existing technologies and operating powers in the picowatt regime. The neuron can deterministically receive both exciting and inhibiting signals that can be summed and treated with a non-linear function. It demonstrates several biological relevant responses and memory timescales, as well as weighting of input channels. The neuron is compatible with commercial silicon technology, operates at multiple wavelengths and can be used for both computing and optical sensing. This work paves the way for two important research paths: photonic neuromorphic computing with nanosized footprints and low power consumption, and adaptive optical sensing, using the same architecture as a compact, modular front end</description>

      <title>Laser-engineered $\Gamma$-point Topology in Trigonal Bismuthene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08068v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $\Gamma$-point topology represents a significant segment in the family of topological insulators. Here we provide a comprehensive prediction of light-induced $\Gamma$-point-based topological manipulation in trigonal bismuthene and its derivatives. Our findings unveil a two-stage process of topological phase transitions (TPT) as the laser intensity increases. Initially, a quantum-spin-Hall or metallic state transitions to a quantum-anomalous-Hall (QAH) state ($C$ = $\pm$3), followed by another TPT that yields a compensated Chern-insulating state ($C$ = 0). The trigonal warping model accounts for these states, describing the $C_{3z}$-rotational band-inversion process, which is determined by $\pm$1 orders of replica bands. Notably, this high Chern-number QAH state persists over a broad range of laser parameters, maintaining functionality beyond room temperature as evidenced by the large global gaps ($\geq$ 60 meV). Our work provides a comprehensive roadmap towards the designer $\Gamma$-point topology under laser excitation, facilitating applications of artificial topological materials.</description>

      <title>Self-consistent surface superconductivity in time-reversal symmetric Weyl semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05381v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Weyl semimetals host topologically protected surface states, the so-called Fermi arcs, that have a penetration depth into the bulk that depends on surface-momentum, and diverges at the Weyl points. It has recently been observed in PtBi$_2$ that such Fermi arc states can become superconducting, with a critical temperature larger than that of the bulk. Here we introduce a general variational method that captures the interplay between surface and bulk superconductivity, for any bulk Hamiltonian that harbors (topological) surface states with varying penetration depth. From the self-consistent solutions we establish that the surface state localization length of Weyl semimetals leads to characteristic features in the surface superconductivity, with a gap depending on surface momentum and a penetration length for the order parameter that is temperature-dependent due to competition with the bulk superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Signatures of edge states in antiferromagnetic van der Waals Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18578v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The combination of superconductivity and magnetic textures represents a promising approach to explore unconventional superconducting phenomena, including new correlated and topological phases. Van der Waals (vdW) materials have emerged in this context as a versatile platform to explore the interplay between these two competing orders. Here, we report on individual NbSe2/NiPS3/NbSe2 vdW Josephson junctions behaving as superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs), which we attribute to the interplay between the superconductivity of NbSe2 and the spin texture of the vdW antiferromagnetic insulator NiPS3. The SQUID behavior, which persists for in-plane magnetic fields of at least 6 T, is the result of interference between localized transport channels that form in two separate regions of the sample. Microscopic modeling of the antiferromagnet insulator/superconductor (AFI/S) interface reveals the formation of localized states at the edges of the junction that can lead to localized channels that dominate the transport. Our findings highlight the potential of vdW superconducting heterostructures with AFs as platforms for engineering and probing novel superconducting phenomena, and they establish a new route for lithographic-free SQUIDs that operate in high magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Designing Antiferromagnetic Spin-1/2 Chains in Janus Fullerene Nanoribbons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18849v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We design antiferromagnetic spin-1/2 chains in fullerene nanoribbons by introducing extra C$_{60}$ cages at one of their edges. The resulting odd number of intermolecular bonds induces an unpaired $\pi$-electron and hence a quantised magnetic moment in otherwise non-magnetic nanoribbons. We further reveal the formation of an antiferromagnetic ground state upon the linear arrangement of spin-1/2 C$_{60}$ cages that is insensitive to the specific structural motifs. Compared with graphene nanoribbons, Janus fullerene nanoribbons may offer an experimentally more accessible route to magnetic edge states with atomic precision in low-dimensional carbon nanostructures, possibly serving as a versatile nanoarchitecture for scalable spin-based devices and the exploration of many-body quantum phases.</description>
