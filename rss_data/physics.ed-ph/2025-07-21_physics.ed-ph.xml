      <title>An Adversarial Quantum Key Distribution Project</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) is a popular introduction to quantum technologies used in education and public outreach, as very little background in quantum theory is needed and the practical applications are easily understood. There is considerably less exposure to the many real-world considerations of practical QKD, as access to the necessary hardware is quite limited. Here we describe a simple, simulation-based QKD project that can be implemented with only a minimal background in quantum concepts and programming. Students are assembled in small groups to develop an ``Alice and Bob'' protocol for securely distributing symmetric keys in a simulated noisy channel. Their protocol is then shared anonymously with another group who plays the role of Eve and attempts to steal as much secret key as possible. The adversarial aspect is popular with students, and the project itself provides a deeper understanding and appreciation for practical QKD.</description>

      <title>Assessing students understanding of the concept of electric potential difference based on the SOLO taxonomy in upper-secondary students for a targeted assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of potential difference is fundamental to understanding electricity in upper secondary physics courses. However, students often find it challenging to grasp. To address this, we designed and implemented a test aimed at assessing students comprehension of potential difference. This researcher developed test, with a reliability coefficient of 0.74, was administered to 92 students in grades 11 and 12. To evaluate the test and gauge the depth of student learning, we employed the Structure of Observed Learning Outcomes SOLO Taxonomy. Our study is the first to apply the SOLO Taxonomy to this physics topic, contributing new insights to educational literature. The analysis revealed that 71% of students displayed prestructural and unistructural levels of understanding which is the shallowest learning stage while only 3% achieved higher levels of comprehension. Additionally, our analysis of student responses identified areas where understanding diverged from scientific explanations. By analyzing these difficulties, educators can develop targeted assessments and implement similar practices to improve learning before these challenges become deeply ingrained.</description>

      <title>High stakes exams inflate a gender gap and contribute to systematic grading errors in introductory physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09418v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Previous research has suggested that changing the percentage of the course grade associated with exam grades in STEM courses can change the gender gap in the course. It has also been shown that assessments with the highest stakes have the lowest (relative) scores for female students. Previous research by the authors has shown that the implementation of retake exams can eliminate the gender gap in introductory physics courses. This paper explores several different hypotheses for why retake exams are associated with a zeroed gender gap. Two independent measurements comparing exams with different stakes are used in support of the argument that the entire gender gap on introductory physics exams may be due to the stakes associated with those exams. In other words, these data support the idea that a gender grade gap on exams is not measuring a gender difference in the physics knowledge or physics ability of these students. Implications suggest that instructors should choose lower stakes assessment options if they are interested in exam measurements that are not influenced by differences in students' performance related to exam stakes.</description>
