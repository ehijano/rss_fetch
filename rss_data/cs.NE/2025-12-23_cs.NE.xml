      <title>Benchmarking metaheuristic algorithms for the bi-objective redundancy allocation problem in repairable systems with multiple strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article investigates a bi-objective redundancy allocation problem (RAP) for repairable systems, defined as cost minimization and availability maximization. Binary decisions jointly select the number of components and the standby strategy at the subsystem level. Four redundancy strategies are considered: cold standby, warm standby, hot standby, and a mixed strategy. System availability is evaluated using continuous-time Markov chains. The main novelty is a large, controlled benchmark that compares 65 multi-objective metaheuristics under two initialization settings, with and without Scaled Binomial Initialization (SBI), on six case studies of rising structural and dimensional complexity and four weight limits. Each run uses a fixed budget of 2x10^6 evaluations, and repeated runs support statistical comparisons based on hypervolume and budget-based performance. The Pareto-optimal sets are dominated by hot standby and mixed redundancy, while cold and warm standby are rare in the full populations and almost absent from the Pareto fronts. Hot standby is favored under tight weight limits, whereas mixed redundancy becomes dominant when more spares are allowed. Algorithm results show strong budget effects, so a single overall ranking can be misleading. SBI gives a clear hypervolume gain and can change method rankings; in several cases, the SBI initial population is already close to the best-found reference. NSGAIIARSBX-SBI performs well for medium and large budgets, while NNIA-SBI and CMOPSO-SBI are strongest when the budget is tight. Finally, larger systems require much more search effort to reach high-quality fronts, highlighting the need to plan the evaluation budget in practical RAP studies. The code and the results are available at a Zenodo repository https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17981720.</description>

      <title>Learning-Assisted Multi-Operator Variable Neighborhood Search for Urban Cable Routing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Urban underground cable construction is essential for enhancing the reliability of city power grids, yet its high construction costs make planning a worthwhile optimization task. In urban environments, road layouts tightly constrain cable routing. This, on the one hand, renders relation-only models (i.e., those without explicit routes) used in prior work overly simplistic, and on the other hand, dramatically enlarges the combinatorial search space, thereby imposing much higher demands on algorithm design. In this study, we formulate urban cable routing as a connectivity-path co-optimization problem and propose a learning-assisted multi-operator variable neighborhood search (L-MVNS) algorithm. The framework first introduces an auxiliary task to generate high-quality feasible initial solutions. A hybrid genetic search (HGS) and A* serve as the connectivity optimizer and the route-planning optimizer, respectively. Building on these, a multi-operator variable neighborhood search (MVNS) iteratively co-optimizes inter-substation connectivity and detailed routes via three complementary destruction operators, a modified A* repair operator, and an adaptive neighborhood-sizing mechanism. A multi-agent deep reinforcement learning module is further embedded to prioritize promising neighborhoods. We also construct a standardized and scalable benchmark suite for evaluation. Across these cases, comprehensive experiments demonstrate effectiveness and stability: relative to representative approaches, MVNS and L-MVNS reduce total construction cost by approximately 30-50%, with L-MVNS delivering additional gains on larger instances and consistently higher stability.</description>

      <title>Modality-Dependent Memory Mechanisms in Cross-Modal Neuromorphic Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Memory-augmented spiking neural networks (SNNs) promise energy-efficient neuromorphic computing, yet their generalization across sensory modalities remains unexplored. We present the first comprehensive cross-modal ablation study of memory mechanisms in SNNs, evaluating Hopfield networks, Hierarchical Gated Recurrent Networks (HGRNs), and supervised contrastive learning (SCL) across visual (N-MNIST) and auditory (SHD) neuromorphic datasets. Our systematic evaluation of five architectures reveals striking modality-dependent performance patterns: Hopfield networks achieve 97.68% accuracy on visual tasks but only 76.15% on auditory tasks (21.53 point gap), revealing severe modality-specific specialization, while SCL demonstrates more balanced cross-modal performance (96.72% visual, 82.16% audio, 14.56 point gap). These findings establish that memory mechanisms exhibit task-specific benefits rather than universal applicability. Joint multi-modal training with HGRN achieves 94.41% visual and 79.37% audio accuracy (88.78% average), matching parallel HGRN performance through unified deployment. Quantitative engram analysis confirms weak cross-modal alignment (0.038 similarity), validating our parallel architecture design. Our work provides the first empirical evidence for modality-specific memory optimization in neuromorphic systems, achieving 603x energy efficiency over traditional neural networks.</description>

      <title>Clustering-based Transfer Learning for Dynamic Multimodal MultiObjective Evolutionary Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamic multimodal multiobjective optimization presents the dual challenge of simultaneously tracking multiple equivalent pareto optimal sets and maintaining population diversity in time-varying environments. However, existing dynamic multiobjective evolutionary algorithms often neglect solution modality, whereas static multimodal multiobjective evolutionary algorithms lack adaptability to dynamic changes. To address above challenge, this paper makes two primary contributions. First, we introduce a new benchmark suite of dynamic multimodal multiobjective test functions constructed by fusing the properties of both dynamic and multimodal optimization to establish a rigorous evaluation platform. Second, we propose a novel algorithm centered on a Clustering-based Autoencoder prediction dynamic response mechanism, which utilizes an autoencoder model to process matched clusters to generate a highly diverse initial population. Furthermore, to balance the algorithm's convergence and diversity, we integrate an adaptive niching strategy into the static optimizer. Empirical analysis on 12 instances of dynamic multimodal multiobjective test functions reveals that, compared with several state-of-the-art dynamic multiobjective evolutionary algorithms and multimodal multiobjective evolutionary algorithms, our algorithm not only preserves population diversity more effectively in the decision space but also achieves superior convergence in the objective space.</description>

      <title>Scalable Dendritic Modeling Advances Expressive and Robust Deep Spiking Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06355v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dendritic computation endows biological neurons with rich nonlinear integration and high representational capacity, yet it is largely missing in existing deep spiking neural networks (SNNs). Although detailed multi-compartment models can capture dendritic computations, their high computational cost and limited flexibility make them impractical for deep learning. To combine the advantages of dendritic computation and deep network architectures for a powerful, flexible and efficient computational model, we propose the dendritic spiking neuron (DendSN). DendSN explicitly models dendritic morphology and nonlinear integration in a streamlined design, leading to substantially higher expressivity than point neurons and wide compatibility with modern deep SNN architectures. Leveraging the efficient formulation and high-performance Triton kernels, dendritic SNNs (DendSNNs) can be efficiently trained and easily scaled to deeper networks. Experiments show that DendSNNs consistently outperform conventional SNNs on classification tasks. Furthermore, inspired by dendritic modulation and synaptic clustering, we introduce the dendritic branch gating (DBG) algorithm for task-incremental learning, which effectively reduces inter-task interference. Additional evaluations show that DendSNNs exhibit superior robustness to noise and adversarial attacks, along with improved generalization in few-shot learning scenarios. Our work firstly demonstrates the possibility of training deep SNNs with multiple nonlinear dendritic branches, and comprehensively analyzes the impact of dendrite computation on representation learning across various machine learning settings, thereby offering a fresh perspective on advancing SNN design.</description>

      <title>A Systematic Survey on Large Language Models for Evolutionary Optimization: From Modeling to Solving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08269v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), with their strong understanding and reasoning capabilities, are increasingly being explored for tackling optimization problems, especially in synergy with evolutionary computation. While several recent surveys have explored aspects of LLMs for optimization, there remains a need for an integrative perspective that connects problem modeling with solving workflows. This survey addresses this gap by providing a comprehensive review of recent developments and organizing them within a structured framework. We classify existing research into two main stages: LLMs for optimization modeling and LLMs for optimization solving. The latter is further divided into three paradigms according to the role of LLMs in the optimization workflow: LLMs as stand-alone optimizers, low-level LLMs embedded within optimization algorithms, and high-level LLMs for algorithm selection and generation. For each category, we analyze representative methods, distill technical challenges, and examine their interplay with traditional approaches. We also review interdisciplinary applications spanning the natural sciences, engineering, and machine learning. By contrasting LLM-driven and conventional methods, we highlight key limitations and research gaps, and point toward future directions for developing self-evolving agentic ecosystems for optimization.

      <title>Network-Optimised Spiking Neural Network for Event-Driven Networking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23516v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time-critical networking requires low-latency decisions from sparse and bursty telemetry, where fixed-step neural inference waste computation. We introduce Network-Optimised Spiking (NOS), a two-state neuron whose variables correspond to normalised queue occupancy and a recovery resource. NOS combines a saturating excitability nonlinearity for finite buffers, service and damping leaks, graph-local inputs with per-link gates and delays, and differentiable resets compatible with surrogate gradients and neuromorphic deployment. We establish existence and uniqueness of subthreshold equilibria, derive Jacobian-based local stability tests, and obtain a scalar network stability threshold that separates topology from node physics through a Perron-mode spectral condition. A stochastic arrival model aligned with telemetry smoothing links NOS responses to classical queueing behaviour while explaining increased variability near stability margins. Across chain, star, and scale-free graphs, NOS improves early-warning F1 and detection latency over MLP, RNN, GRU, and temporal-GNN baselines under a common residual-based protocol, while providing practical calibration and stability rules suited to resource-constrained networking deployments.

Abstract: AlphaEvolve (Novikov et al., 2025) is a generic evolutionary coding agent that combines the generative capabilities of LLMs with automated evaluation in an iterative evolutionary framework that proposes, tests, and refines algorithmic solutions to challenging scientific and practical problems. In this paper we showcase AlphaEvolve as a tool for autonomously discovering novel mathematical constructions and advancing our understanding of long-standing open problems.
  To demonstrate its breadth, we considered a list of 67 problems spanning mathematical analysis, combinatorics, geometry, and number theory. The system rediscovered the best known solutions in most of the cases and discovered improved solutions in several. In some instances, AlphaEvolve is also able to generalize results for a finite number of input values into a formula valid for all input values. Furthermore, we are able to combine this methodology with Deep Think and AlphaProof in a broader framework where the additional proof-assistants and reasoning systems provide automated proof generation and further mathematical insights.
  These results demonstrate that large language model-guided evolutionary search can autonomously discover mathematical constructions that complement human intuition, at times matching or even improving the best known results, highlighting the potential for significant new ways of interaction between mathematicians and AI systems. We present AlphaEvolve as a powerful new tool for mathematical discovery, capable of exploring vast search spaces to solve complex optimization problems at scale, often with significantly reduced requirements on preparation and computation time.</description>

      <title>Keep It Light! Simplifying Image Clustering Via Text-Free Adapters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04226v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the era of pre-trained models, effective classification can often be achieved using simple linear probing or lightweight readout layers. In contrast, many competitive clustering pipelines have a multi-modal design, leveraging large language models (LLMs) or other text encoders, and text-image pairs, which are often unavailable in real-world downstream applications. Additionally, such frameworks are generally complicated to train and require substantial computational resources, making widespread adoption challenging. In this work, we show that in deep clustering, competitive performance with more complex state-of-the-art methods can be achieved using a text-free and highly simplified training pipeline. In particular, our approach, Simple Clustering via Pre-trained models (SCP), trains only a small cluster head while leveraging pre-trained vision model feature representations and positive data pairs. Experiments on benchmark datasets, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-20, CIFAR-100, STL-10, ImageNet-10, and ImageNet-Dogs, demonstrate that SCP achieves highly competitive performance. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical result explaining why, at least under ideal conditions, additional text-based embeddings may not be necessary to achieve strong clustering performance in vision.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.23083v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-capacity kernel Hopfield networks exhibit a \textit{Ridge of Optimization} characterized by extreme stability. While previously linked to \textit{Spectral Concentration}, its origin remains elusive. Here, we analyze the network dynamics on a statistical manifold, revealing that the Ridge corresponds to the Edge of Stability, a critical boundary where the Fisher Information Matrix becomes singular. We demonstrate that the apparent Euclidean force antagonism is a manifestation of \textit{Dual Equilibrium} in the Riemannian space. This unifies learning dynamics and capacity via the Minimum Description Length principle, offering a geometric theory of self-organized criticality.</description>

      <title>Arc Gradient Descent: A Mathematically Derived Reformulation of Gradient Descent with Phase-Aware, User-Controlled Step Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06737v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The paper presents the formulation, implementation, and evaluation of the ArcGD optimiser. The evaluation is conducted initially on a non-convex benchmark function and subsequently on a real-world ML dataset. The initial comparative study using the Adam optimiser is conducted on a stochastic variant of the highly non-convex and notoriously challenging Rosenbrock function, renowned for its narrow, curved valley, across dimensions ranging from 2D to 1000D and an extreme case of 50,000D. Two configurations were evaluated to eliminate learning-rate bias: (i) both using ArcGD's effective learning rate and (ii) both using Adam's default learning rate. ArcGD consistently outperformed Adam under the first setting and, although slower under the second, achieved superior final solutions in most cases. In the second evaluation, ArcGD is evaluated against state-of-the-art optimizers (Adam, AdamW, Lion, SGD) on the CIFAR-10 image classification dataset across 8 diverse MLP architectures ranging from 1 to 5 hidden layers. ArcGD achieved the highest average test accuracy (50.7%) at 20,000 iterations, outperforming AdamW (46.6%), Adam (46.8%), SGD (49.6%), and Lion (43.4%), winning or tying on 6 of 8 architectures. Notably, while Adam and AdamW showed strong early convergence at 5,000 iterations, but regressed with extended training, whereas ArcGD continued improving, demonstrating generalization and resistance to overfitting without requiring early stopping tuning. Strong performance on geometric stress tests and standard deep-learning benchmarks indicates broad applicability, highlighting the need for further exploration. Moreover, it is also shown that a limiting variant of ArcGD can be interpreted as a sign-based momentum-like update, highlighting conceptual connections between the inherent mechanisms of ArcGD and the Lion optimiser.</description>
