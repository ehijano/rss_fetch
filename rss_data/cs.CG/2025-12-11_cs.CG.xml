      <title>Near-Linear and Parameterized Approximations for Maximum Cliques in Disk Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A \emph{disk graph} is the intersection graph of (closed) disks in the plane. We consider the classic problem of finding a maximum clique in a disk graph. For general disk graphs, the complexity of this problem is still open, but for unit disk graphs, it is well known to be in P. The currently fastest algorithm runs in time $O(n^{7/3+ o(1)})$, where $n$ denotes the number of disks~\cite{EspenantKM23, keil_et_al:LIPIcs.SoCG.2025.63}. Moreover, for the case of disk graphs with $t$ distinct radii, the problem has also recently been shown to be in XP. More specifically, it is solvable in time $O^*(n^{2t})$~\cite{keil_et_al:LIPIcs.SoCG.2025.63}. In this paper, we present algorithms with improved running times by allowing for approximate solutions and by using randomization:
  (i) for unit disk graphs, we give an algorithm that, with constant success probability, computes a $(1-\varepsilon)$-approximate maximum clique in expected time $\tilde{O}(n/\varepsilon^2)$; and
  (ii) for disk graphs with $t$ distinct radii, we give a parameterized approximation scheme that, with a constant success probability, computes a $(1-\varepsilon)$-approximate maximum clique in expected time $\tilde{O}(f(t)\cdot (1/\varepsilon)^{O(t)} \cdot n)$.</description>

      <title>Magic Gems: A Polyhedral Framework for Magic Squares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Magic Gems, a geometric representation of magic squares as three-dimensional polyhedra. By mapping an n x n magic square onto a centered coordinate grid with cell values as vertical displacements, we construct a point cloud whose convex hull defines the Magic Gem. This reveals a connection between magic square constraints and statistical structure: we prove that magic squares have vanishing covariances between position and value. We introduce a covariance energy functional -- the sum of squared covariances with row, column, and diagonal indicator variables -- and prove for n=3 (via exhaustive enumeration) that its zeros are precisely the magic squares. Large-scale sampling for n=4,5 (460+ million arrangements) provides strong numerical evidence that this characterization extends to larger orders. Perturbation analysis demonstrates that magic squares are isolated local minima. The representation is invariant under dihedral symmetry D_4, yielding canonical geometric objects for equivalence classes.</description>

      <title>On Mobile Ad Hoc Networks for Coverage of Partially Observable Worlds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the movement and placement of mobile agents to establish a communication network in initially unknown environments. We cast the problem in a computational-geometric framework by relating the coverage problem and line-of-sight constraints to the Cooperative Guard Art Gallery Problem, and introduce its partially observable variant, the Partially Observable Cooperative Guard Art Gallery Problem (POCGAGP). We then present two algorithms that solve POCGAGP: CADENCE, a centralized planner that incrementally selects 270 degree corners at which to deploy agents, and DADENCE, a decentralized scheme that coordinates agents using local information and lightweight messaging. Both approaches operate under partial observability and target simultaneous coverage and connectivity. We evaluate the methods in simulation across 1,500 test cases of varied size and structure, demonstrating consistent success in forming connected networks while covering and exploring unknown space. These results highlight the value of geometric abstractions for communication-driven exploration and show that decentralized policies are competitive with centralized performance while retaining scalability.</description>

      <title>Coloring Geometric Hypergraphs: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The \emph{chromatic number} of a hypergraph is the smallest number of colors needed to color the vertices such that no edge of at least two vertices is monochromatic. Given a family of geometric objects $\mathcal{F}$ that covers a subset $S$ of the Euclidean space, we can associate it with a hypergraph whose vertex set is $\mathcal F$ and whose edges are those subsets ${\mathcal{F}'}\subset \mathcal F$ for which there exists a point $p\in S$ such that ${\mathcal F}'$ consists of precisely those elements of $\mathcal{F}$ that contain $p$. The question whether $\mathcal F$ can be split into 2 coverings is equivalent to asking whether the chromatic number of the hypergraph is equal to 2.
  There are a number of competing notions of the chromatic number that lead to deep combinatorial questions already for abstract hypergraphs. In this paper, we concentrate on \emph{geometrically defined} (in short, \emph{geometric}) hypergraphs, and survey many recent coloring results related to them. In particular, we study and survey the following problem, dual to the above covering question. Given a set of points $S$ in the Euclidean space and a family $\mathcal{F}$ of geometric objects of a fixed type, define a hypergraph ${\mathcal H}_m$ on the point set $S$, whose edges are the subsets of $S$ that can be obtained as the intersection of $S$ with a member of $\mathcal F$ and have at least $m$ elements. Is it true that if $m$ is large enough, then the chromatic number of ${\mathcal H}_m$ is equal to 2?</description>

      <title>Flexible realizations existence: NP-completeness on sparse graphs and algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13721v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the questions in Rigidity Theory is whether a realization of the vertices of a graph in the plane is flexible, namely, if it allows a continuous deformation preserving the edge lengths. A flexible realization of a connected graph in the plane exists if and only if the graph has a NAC-coloring, which is a surjective edge coloring by two colors such that for each cycle, either all the edges have the same color, or there are at least two edges of each color. The question whether a graph has a NAC-coloring, and hence also the existence of a flexible realization, has been proven to be NP-complete. We show that this question is also NP-complete on graphs with maximum degree five and on graphs with the average degree at most $4+\varepsilon$ for every fixed $\varepsilon &gt;0$. We also show that NAC-colorings can be counted in linear time for graphs with bounded treewidth. Since the only existing implementation of checking the existence of a NAC-coloring is rather naive, we propose new algorithms along with their implementation, which is significantly faster. We also focus on searching all NAC-colorings of a graph, since they provide useful information about its possible flexible realizations.</description>
