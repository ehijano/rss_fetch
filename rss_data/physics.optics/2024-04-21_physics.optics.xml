      <title>A Generalized Expression for Accelerating Beamlet Decomposition Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Paraxial diffraction modeling based on the Fourier transform has seen widespread implementation for simulating the response of a diffraction-limited optical system. For systems where the paraxial assumption is not sufficient, a class of algorithms has been developed that employs hybrid propagation physics to compute the propagation of an elementary beamlet along geometric ray paths. These "beamlet decomposition" algorithms include the well-known Gaussian Beamlet Decomposition (GBD) algorithm, of which several variants have been created. To increase the computational efficiency of the GBD algorithm, we derive an alternative expression of the technique that utilizes the analytical propagation of beamlets to tilted planes. We then use this accelerated algorithm to conduct a parameter-space search to find the optimal combination of free parameters in GBD to construct the analytical Airy function. The experiment is conducted on a consumer-grade CPU, and a high-performance GPU, where the new algorithm is 34 times faster than the previously published algorithm on CPUs, and 67,513 times faster on GPUs.</description>

      <title>Recoil heating of a dielectric particle illuminated by a linearly polarized plane wave within the Rayleigh regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the recoil heating phenomenon experienced by a dielectric spherical particle when it interacts with a linearly polarized plane wave within the Rayleigh regime. We derive the fluctuating force acted upon the particle arising from the fluctuations of the electromagnetic fields. Our derivations reveal that the spectral density of the fluctuating force along the propagation direction is $7\hbar \omega_0 P_{\mathrm{scat}}/5c^2$. Meanwhile, along the direction of the electric and magnetic fields, it is $11\hbar \omega_0 P_{\mathrm{scat}}/5c^2$ and $2\hbar \omega_0 P_{\mathrm{scat}}/5c^2$, respectively. Here, $P_{\mathrm{scat}}$ denotes the power scattered by the particle, $\hbar\omega_0$ represents the energy of a photon, and $c$ is the speed of light. Recoil heating imposes fundamental limitations in levitated optomechanics, constraining the minimum temperatures achievable in cooling processes, the coherence time of the system, and the sensitivity of force measurements.</description>

      <title>Iso-entropy partially coherent optical fields that cannot be inter-converted unitarily</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For partially coherent optical fields in which a single binary degree of freedom (DoF) is relevant, such as polarization, entropy uniquely identifies the class of optical fields that can be converted into each other via unitary transformations. However, when multiple DoFs are taken into consideration, entropy no longer serves this purpose. We investigate the structure of the family of iso-entropy partially coherent optical fields defined by two binary DoFs (polarization and two spatial modes) and described by a 4x4 coherence matrix G. We find that the rank of G (the number of its non-zero eigenvalues) plays a critical role in this context: whereby any pair of iso-entropy rank-2 fields can be converted into each other unitarily, this is not necessarily the case for a pair of rank-3 or rank-4 fields. Furthermore, unitary transformations between iso-entropy fields of different ranks are strictly forbidden. Instead, such conversions require entropy-maintaining non-unitary transformations that potentially combine filtering projections and randomizing operations. We experimentally synthesize partially coherent iso-entropy optical fields of all ranks, and tomographically reconstruct their coherence matrices. Moreover, we steer the coherence matrix over iso-entropy trajectories that maintain a fixed rank (intra-rank conversion) or that involve changes in the rank (inter-rank conversion). These findings offer a new perspective for the potential utility of partially coherent light in optical communications and sensing.</description>

      <title>Effective Sorting of Fractional Optical Vortex Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mode sorter is the crucial component of the communication systems based on orbital angular momentum (OAM). However, schemes proposed so far can only effectively sort integer OAM (IOAM) modes. Here, we demonstrate the effective sorting of fractional OAM (FOAM) modes by utilizing the coordinate transformation method, which can convert FOAM modes to IOAM modes. The transformed IOAM modes are subsequently sorted by using a mode conversion method called topological charge matching. The validation of our scheme is verified by implementing two sorting processes and corresponding mode purity analyses, both theoretically and experimentally. This new sorting method exhibits a huge potential of implementing a highly confidential and high-capacity FOAM-based communication system, which may inspire further applications in both classical and quantum regimes.</description>

      <title>Lasing and spasing with active individual core-shell plasmonic nanoresonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active core-shell nanoresonators were designed in order to achieve large near-field enhancement, large power-outflow and minimal spaser threshold in the pump E-field strength. Gain-metal-dielectric (GMD) and gain-metal-gain (GMG) nanoresonator compositions were optimized with corresponding objective functions. The average local E-field, power-outflow and extinction cross-section were mapped above the pump E-field strength and dye concentration parameter plane with the criterion that the local E-field is smaller than the damage threshold of the nanoresonator. Regions, corresponding to the maxima in the average local E-field, the highest power-outflow, or to the zero-crossing of the extinction cross-section, were selected for detailed studies. The spectral distribution of the near-field enhancement, optical cross-sections, optical responses, quantum efficiencies, as well as the polar angle distribution of the far-field radiated power and the local charge distribution of dominant modes were inspected. Based on the results the GMD nanoresonator composition is proposed to maximize local E-field in near-field amplifiers, to maximize power-outflow in far-field-emitting lasers and to minimize threshold E-field in spasers. Comparing the complete characteristics, both compositions are suitable for different operation regions, the GMG is proposed as near-field amplifier and far-field out-coupling nanolaser, whereas the GMD is unambiguously preferable to achieve optimal spaser properties.</description>

      <title>Plasmonic nanoprism distributions to promote enhanced and uniform energy deposition in passive and active targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Passive and active targets, implanted with gold nanoprisms, were designed to achieve enhanced and uniform power absorption during two-sided illumination by short laser pulses. The target length was adjusted to match the short laser pulse-length. Capabilities of three different, uniform, single-peaked Gaussian and adjusted, nanoresonator number density distributions were compared. The average local E-field inside the gain medium and on the surface of the nanoprisms were mapped as a function of the pump E-field strength and dye concentration, assuming a uniform nanoresonator distribution. The optimal parameters were adopted to each inspected nanoprism distributions. The time-evolution of the near-field enhancement (NFE), integrated power-loss and deposited energy were determined, additionally, the time-evolution of the standard deviation of these quantities was monitored. A comparative study was performed on passive and active targets, to determine the most advantageous nanoprism number density distribution type and to consider the advantages of dye doping. Based on the results, the adjusted distribution is proposed both in passive and active targets. Doping with the dye is advantageous in every inspected distribution in decreasing the minimal standard deviation of the NFE. It is advantageous in decreasing the delay of the minimal standard deviation in the power-loss and deposited energy, the standard deviation of the NFE as well as in increasing the FOM of the NFE in the uniform and adjusted distributions. In addition, doping allows for decreasing the delay of the minimal standard deviation in the NFE / increasing the mean NFE / decreasing the standard deviation of the power-loss and deposited energy in the uniform / Gaussian / adjusted distribution.</description>

      <title>Phase-space analysis of a two-section InP laser as an all-optical spiking neuron: dependency on control and design parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using a rate-equation model we numerically evaluate the carrier concentration and photon number in an integrated two-section semiconductor laser, and analyse its dynamics in three-dimensional phase space. The simulation comprises compact model descriptions extracted from a commercially-available generic InP technology platform, allowing us to model an applied reverse-bias voltage to the saturable absorber. We use the model to study the influence of the injected gain current, reverse-bias voltage, and cavity mirror reflectivity on the excitable operation state, which is the operation mode desired for the laser to act as an all-optical integrated neuron. We show in phase-space that our model is capable of demonstrating four different operation modes, i.e. cw, self-pulsating and an on-set and excitable mode under optical pulse injection. In addition, we show that lowering the reflectivity of one of the cavity mirrors greatly enhances the control parameter space for excitable operation, enabling more relaxed operation parameter control and lower power consumption of an integrated two-section laser neuron.</description>

Abstract: Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond are a leading modality for magnetic sensing and imaging under ambient conditions. However, these sensors suffer from degraded performance due to paramagnetic impurities and regions of stress in the diamond crystal lattice. This work demonstrates a quantum diamond microscope (QDM) for simultaneous mapping and spatial correlation of key properties of a millimeter-scale NV-diamond sensor chip, including: NV ensemble photoluminescence (PL) amplitude, spin-lattice relaxation time (T$_1$), and homogeneous and inhomogeneous spin coherence lifetimes (T$_2$ and T$_2^*$), as well as lattice stress/strain, birefringence magnitude, and birefringence angle of the diamond crystal.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study collective light scattering from linear crystals with up to twelve $^{40}\text{Ca}^+$ ions, acting as coherent single photon emitters. Light-scattering is induced by two-photon laser excitation, starting from the S$_{1/2}$ to D$_{5/2}$ quadrupole transition at 729~nm in combination with laser excitation of the D$_{5/2}$ to P$_{3/2}$ dipole transition at 854~nm, followed by a decay back to S$_{1/2}$ via a single photon emission near 393~nm. The scattered intensity is recorded in the far field, featuring the interference of emitted light fields of the entire crystal. Furthermore, we demonstrate spin-dependent coherent scattering and unveil the time evolution of a previously encoded spin texture in a crystal employing the recorded dynamics of the spatial frequency components of the fringe pattern.</description>

      <title>Superradiant phase transition in a large interacting driven atomic ensemble in free space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atomic ensembles strongly interacting with light constitute rich quantum-optical many-body systems, with the potential for observing cooperative effects and dissipative nonequilibrium phase transitions. We theoretically analyze the conditions under which a driven atomic ensemble in free space, characterized by strong dipole-dipole interactions and large spatial extent, can undergo a superradiant phase transition, also known as cooperative resonance fluorescence. In an atomic array, stationary states that conserve the collective pseudospin exhibit completely cooperative decay and undergo a second-order phase transition in the large atom number limit. In contrast, decay mechanisms on longer timescales that fail to conserve pseudospin can lead to discontinuous first-order phase transition at a critical finite atom number, disrupting cooperation despite sharing many similar observable characteristics. A hallmark of the superradiant phase transition is an abrupt shift from total light reflection off the atoms to rapidly increasing transmission, accompanied by significant quantum fluctuations, as a function of light intensity.</description>

      <title>Spin-Wave Self-Imaging: Experimental and Numerical Demonstration of Caustic and Talbot-like Diffraction Patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extending the scope of the self-imaging phenomenon, traditionally associated with linear optics, to the domain of magnonics, this study presents the experimental demonstration and numerical analysis of spin-wave (SW) self-imaging in an in-plane magnetized yttrium iron garnet film. We explore this phenomenon using a setup in which a plane SW passes through a diffraction grating, and the resulting interference pattern is detected using Brillouin light scattering. We have varied the frequencies of the source dynamic magnetic field to discern the influence of the anisotropic dispersion relation and the caustic effect on the analyzed phenomenon. We found that at low frequencies and diffraction fields, the caustics determine the interference pattern. However, at large distances from the grating, when the waves of high diffraction order and number of slits contribute to the interference pattern, the self-imaging phenomenon and Talbot-like patterns are formed. This methodological approach not only sheds light on the behavior of SW interference under different conditions but also enhances our understanding of the SW self-imaging process in both isotropic and anisotropic media.</description>

      <title>Theory of Optomechanical Locking in Driven-Dissipative Coupled Polariton Condensates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08420v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ubiquitous phenomenon of synchronization is inherently characteristic of dynamical dissipative non-linear systems. In particular, synchronization has been theoretically and experimentally demonstrated for exciton-polariton condensates with time-independent coupling. Unlike that case, we theoretically investigate the effects of a fixed mechanical harmonic driving, i.e., a coherent phonon population, that induces time modulation in the coupling of two coupled condensates. Our model applies both to electrically generated modulation, through coherent bulk acoustic waves, and to self-induced optomechanical vibrations. We consider linear as well as quadratic phonon-displacement-induced modulations of the polariton coupling. Peculiar asynchronously locked phases are found and analyzed in the context of synchronization and Josephson-type oscillations phenomena that appear in the non-driven case. Notably, Arnold tongues corresponding to the asynchronously locked phases emerge at condensate detunings that correspond to integer numbers of the mechanical frequency and also to rational fractions of it. Unlocked quasiperiodic and chaotic regimes can also be reached. In particular, the phonon-induced fractional locking frequencies arrange in a Farey sequence that produces a devil's staircase of the steady-state dressed detuning between the condensates. Importantly, both polariton-polariton and reservoir-polariton interactions facilitate the realization of coherent phonon-induced asynchronously locked phases. The relation to recent experiments on optomechanically driven condensates in arrays of polariton traps is discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09462v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rich structure of transverse spatial modes of structured light has facilitated their extensive applications in quantum information and optical communication. The Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) modes, which carry a well-defined orbital angular momentum (OAM), consist of a complete orthogonal basis describing the transverse spatial modes of light. The application of OAM in free-space optical communication is restricted due to the experimentally limited OAM numbers and the complex OAM recognition methods. Here, we present a novel method that uses the advanced deep learning technique for LG modes recognition. By discretizing the spatial modes of structured light, we turn the OAM state regression into classification. A proof-of-principle experiment is also performed, showing that our method effectively categorizes OAM states with small training samples and high accuracy. By assigning each category a classical information, we further apply our approach to an image transmission task, demonstrating the ability to encode large data with low OAM number. This work opens up a new avenue for achieving high-capacity optical communication with low OAM number based on structured light.</description>

      <title>Waveguide Tailored Radiation Pattern of Nanoparticles for Tunable Multimodal Guided Surface Lattice Resonances in Asymmetric Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07417v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Surface lattice resonances (SLRs) in metasurfaces are promising in applications of sub-wavelength devices.Tunable and multimodal SLRs further enhance their appeal for flexible and multi-wavelength light-matter interactions. While multimodal SLRs offer promising properties, their realization often requires sophisticated designs, leading to limited tunability. Furthermore, current high-Q SLR implementations necessitate a homogeneous index in the operational environment, restricting potential applications such as biosensors that are typically operated in an aqueous or air cladding on a substrate. Here we present guided-SLRs (gSLRs) that are easily accessible in index-discontinuous environments, offering multimodal properties and straightforward tunability of resonances wavelengths, mode number, and mode coupling strengths. The gSLRs are achieved by coupling scattered light from metasurface units into a slab waveguide, creating a light ropagating channel in the lattice plane within an index-asymmetric environment. Tailoring the radiation pattern of individual units with guided transverse electric (TE) and transverse magnetic (TM) modes, multimodal resonances in both orthogonal and parallel coupling directions are accomplished. Mode number and mode frequency positions can be easily controlled by adjusting the waveguide configuration, while mode strength is tuned by vertical positions of lattices in the slab. Multimodal gSLRs with strong intensities and tunable ositions extending from visible to near-infrared range are achieved when compose metasurfaces with gold nanoparticle-on-mirror (NPoM) cavities. This easy-to-access, actively tunable and multimodal gSLR in inhomogeneous mediums will advance the realization of ultrathin and ultracompact nano-optical and optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Error Mitigated Metasurface-Based Randomized Measurement Schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.08755v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Estimating properties of quantum states via randomized measurements has become a significant part of quantum information science. In this paper, we design an innovative approach leveraging metasurfaces to perform randomized measurements on photonic qubits, together with error mitigation techniques that suppress realistic metasurface measurement noise. Through fidelity and purity estimation, we confirm the capability of metasurfaces to implement randomized measurements and the unbiased nature of our error-mitigated estimator. Our findings show the potential of metasurface-based randomized measurement schemes in achieving robust and resource-efficient estimation of quantum state properties.</description>

      <title>Multifold enhancement of quantum SNR by using an EMCCD as a photon number resolving device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04184v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Electron Multiplying Charge Coupled Devices (EMCCD), owing to their high quantum efficiency and spatial resolution, are widely used to study typical quantum optical phenomena and related applications. Researchers have already developed a procedure that enables one to statistically determine whether a pixel detects a single photon, based on whether its output is higher or lower than the estimated noise level. However, these techniques are feasible at extremely low photon numbers (about 0.15 mean number of photons per pixel per exposure), allowing for at most one photon per pixel. This limitation necessitates a very large number of frames required for any study. In this work, we present a method to estimate the mean rate of photons per pixel per frame for arbitrary exposure time. Subsequently, we make a statistical estimate of the number of photons (greater than or equal to 1) incident on each pixel. This allows us to effectively utilize the EMCCD as a photon number resolving device. This immediately augments the acceptable light levels in the experiments, leading to significant reduction in the required experimentation time. As evidence of our approach, we quantify contrast in quantum correlation exhibited by a pair of spatially entangled photons generated by Spontaneous Parametric Down Conversion process. In comparison to conventional methods, our method realizes an enhancement in the signal to noise ratio by about a factor of 3 for half the data collection time. This SNR can be easily enhanced by minor modifications in experimental parameters such as exposure time etc.</description>

      <title>RCS reduction method with anomalous reflection metasurfaces using Floquet analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00858v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This letter proposes the design and the measurement of a periodic metasurface that performs anomalous reflection with reduced RCS in a parasitic direction. A previous study proposed a semi-analytical model to predict the behaviour, in terms of RCS, of such a metasurface. This work will therefore focus the discussion on fabrication and measurement issues. The synthesis, design specifications, fabrication method and experimental setup are presented and discussed. The measurement results are extensively discussed as well, enlightening some limitations in the context of metasurface RCS measurements. The proposed metasurface indeed performs the anticipated reduction of the RCS level in the considered Floquet direction. The well-agreeing simulation and experimental results demonstrates the accuracy of the modelling and the efficiency of the optimisation procedure.</description>

      <title>5.0 $\mu$m emitting Interband Cascade Lasers with Superlattice and Bulk AlGaAsSb Claddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19165v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a comparison between interband cascade lasers (ICLs) with a 6-stage active region emitting at 5 $\mu$m with AlSb/InAs superlattice claddings and bulk Al_0.85 Ga_0.15 As_0.07 Sb_0.93 claddings. Utilizing bulk AlGaAsSb claddings with its lower refractive index compared to the mostly used AlSb/InAs superlattice claddings, the mode-confinement in the active region increases by 14.4% resulting in an improvement of the lasing threshold current density. For broad area laser and under pulsed excitation, the ICL with AlGaAsSb claddings shows a lower threshold current density of J_th=396 A/cm$^2$ compared to J_th=521 A/cm$^2$ for the reference ICL with superlattice claddings. Additionally, a higher characteristic temperature was obtained for the ICL with bulk claddings. A measured pulsed operation is observed up to 65 C.</description>
