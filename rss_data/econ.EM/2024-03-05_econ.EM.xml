      <title>Calibrating doubly-robust estimators with unbalanced treatment assignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning methods, particularly the double machine learning (DML) estimator (Chernozhukov et al., 2018), are increasingly popular for the estimation of the average treatment effect (ATE). However, datasets often exhibit unbalanced treatment assignments where only a few observations are treated, leading to unstable propensity score estimations. We propose a simple extension of the DML estimator which undersamples data for propensity score modeling and calibrates scores to match the original distribution. The paper provides theoretical results showing that the estimator retains the DML estimator's asymptotic properties. A simulation study illustrates the finite sample performance of the estimator.</description>

      <title>Improved Tests for Mediation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Testing for a mediation effect is important in many disciplines, but is made difficult - even asymptotically - by the influence of nuisance parameters. Classical tests such as likelihood ratio (LR) and Wald (Sobel) tests have very poor power properties in parts of the parameter space, and many attempts have been made to produce improved tests, with limited success. In this paper we show that augmenting the critical region of the LR test can produce a test with much improved behavior everywhere. In fact, we first show that there exists a test of this type that is (asymptotically) exact for certain test levels $\alpha $, including the common choices $\alpha =.01,.05,.10.$ The critical region of this exact test has some undesirable properties. We go on to show that there is a very simple class of augmented LR critical regions which provides tests that are nearly exact, and avoid the issues inherent in the exact test. We suggest an optimal and coherent member of this class, provide the table needed to implement the test and to report p-values if desired. Simulation confirms validity with non-Gaussian disturbances, under heteroskedasticity, and in a nonlinear (logit) model. A short application of the method to an entrepreneurial attitudes study is included for illustration.</description>

      <title>High-Dimensional Tail Index Regression: with An Application to Text Analyses of Viral Posts in Social Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the empirical power law of the distributions of credits (e.g., the number of "likes") of viral posts in social media, we introduce the high-dimensional tail index regression and methods of estimation and inference for its parameters. We propose a regularized estimator, establish its consistency, and derive its convergence rate. To conduct inference, we propose to debias the regularized estimate, and establish the asymptotic normality of the debiased estimator. Simulation studies support our theory. These methods are applied to text analyses of viral posts in X (formerly Twitter) concerning LGBTQ+.</description>

      <title>Minimax-Regret Sample Selection in Randomized Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are often run in settings with many subpopulations that may have differential benefits from the treatment being evaluated. We consider the problem of sample selection, i.e., whom to enroll in an RCT, such as to optimize welfare in a heterogeneous population. We formalize this problem within the minimax-regret framework, and derive optimal sample-selection schemes under a variety of conditions. We also highlight how different objectives and decisions can lead to notably different guidance regarding optimal sample allocation through a synthetic experiment leveraging historical COVID-19 trial data.</description>

      <title>Tilting Approximate Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.10869</link>
      <description>arXiv:1805.10869v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Model approximations are common practice when estimating structural or quasi-structural models. The paper considers the econometric properties of estimators that utilize projections to reimpose information about the exact model in the form of conditional moments. The resulting estimator efficiently combines the information provided by the approximate law of motion and the moment conditions. The paper develops the corresponding asymptotic theory and provides simulation evidence that tilting substantially reduces the mean squared error for parameter estimates. It applies the methodology to pricing long-run risks in aggregate consumption in the US, whereas the model is solved using the Campbell and Shiller (1988) approximation. Tilting improves empirical fit and results suggest that approximation error is a source of upward bias in estimates of risk aversion and downward bias in the elasticity of intertemporal substitution.</description>

      <title>Policy Learning under Endogeneity Using Instrumental Variables</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.09883v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the identification and estimation of individualized intervention policies in observational data settings characterized by endogenous treatment selection and the availability of instrumental variables. We introduce encouragement rules that manipulate an instrument. Incorporating the marginal treatment effects (MTE) as policy invariant structural parameters, we establish the identification of the social welfare criterion for the optimal encouragement rule. Focusing on binary encouragement rules, we propose to estimate the optimal policy via the Empirical Welfare Maximization (EWM) method and derive convergence rates of the regret (welfare loss). We consider extensions to accommodate multiple instruments and budget constraints. Using data from the Indonesian Family Life Survey, we apply the EWM encouragement rule to advise on the optimal tuition subsidy assignment. Our framework offers interpretability regarding why a certain subpopulation is targeted.</description>

      <title>Estimating overidentified linear models with heteroskedasticity and outliers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.17615v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Overidentified two-stage least square (TSLS) is commonly adopted by applied economists to address endogeneity. Though it potentially gives more efficient or informative estimate, overidentification comes with a cost. The bias of TSLS is severe when the number of instruments is large. Hence, Jackknife Instrumental Variable Estimator (JIVE) has been proposed to reduce bias of overidentified TSLS. A conventional heuristic rule to assess the performance of TSLS and JIVE is approximate bias. This paper formalizes this concept and applies the new definition of approximate bias to three classes of estimators that bridge between OLS, TSLS and a variant of JIVE, namely, JIVE1. Three new approximately unbiased estimators are proposed. They are called AUK, TSJI1 and UOJIVE. Interestingly, a previously proposed approximately unbiased estimator UIJIVE can be viewed as a special case of UOJIVE. While UIJIVE is approximately unbiased asymptotically, UOJIVE is approximately unbiased even in finite sample. Moreover, UOJIVE estimates parameters for both endogenous and control variables whereas UIJIVE only estimates the parameter of the endogenous variables. TSJI1 and UOJIVE are consistent and asymptotically normal under fixed number of instruments. They are also consistent under many-instrument asymptotics. This paper characterizes a series of moment existence conditions to establish all asymptotic results. In addition, the new estimators demonstrate good performances with simulated and empirical datasets.</description>

Abstract: We discuss techniques of estimation and inference for nonstationary nonlinear cohort panels with learning from experience, showing, inter alia, the consistency and asymptotic normality of the nonlinear least squares estimator used in empirical practice. Potential pitfalls for hypothesis testing are identified and solutions proposed. Monte Carlo simulations verify the properties of the estimator and corresponding test statistics in finite samples, while an application to a panel of survey expectations demonstrates the usefulness of the theory developed.</description>

      <title>Multivariate Tie-breaker Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.10030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.10030v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a tie-breaker design (TBD), subjects with high values of a running variable are given some (usually desirable) treatment, subjects with low values are not, and subjects in the middle are randomized. TBDs are intermediate between regression discontinuity designs (RDDs) and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) by allowing a tradeoff between the resource allocation efficiency of an RDD and the statistical efficiency of an RCT. We study a model where the expected response is one multivariate regression for treated subjects and another for control subjects. For given covariates, we show how to use convex optimization to choose treatment probabilities that optimize a D-optimality criterion. We can incorporate a variety of constraints motivated by economic and ethical considerations. In our model, D-optimality for the treatment effect coincides with D-optimality for the whole regression, and without economic constraints, an RCT is globally optimal. We show that a monotonicity constraint favoring more deserving subjects induces sparsity in the number of distinct treatment probabilities and this is different from preexisting sparsity results for constrained designs. We also study a prospective D-optimality, analogous to Bayesian optimal design, to understand design tradeoffs without reference to a specific data set. We apply the convex optimization solution to a semi-synthetic example involving triage data from the MIMIC-IV-ED database.</description>

      <title>Yurinskii's Coupling for Martingales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.00362v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Yurinskii's coupling is a popular theoretical tool for non-asymptotic distributional analysis in mathematical statistics and applied probability, offering a Gaussian strong approximation with an explicit error bound under easily verified conditions. Originally stated in $\ell^2$-norm for sums of independent random vectors, it has recently been extended both to the $\ell^p$-norm, for $1 \leq p \leq \infty$, and to vector-valued martingales in $\ell^2$-norm, under some strong conditions. We present as our main result a Yurinskii coupling for approximate martingales in $\ell^p$-norm, under substantially weaker conditions than those previously imposed. Our formulation further allows for the coupling variable to follow a more general Gaussian mixture distribution, and we provide a novel third-order coupling method which gives tighter approximations in certain settings. We specialize our main result to mixingales, martingales, and independent data, and derive uniform Gaussian mixture strong approximations for martingale empirical processes. Applications to nonparametric partitioning-based and local polynomial regression procedures are provided.</description>

      <title>Structure-agnostic Optimality of Doubly Robust Learning for Treatment Effect Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14264v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Average treatment effect estimation is the most central problem in causal inference with application to numerous disciplines. While many estimation strategies have been proposed in the literature, the statistical optimality of these methods has still remained an open area of investigation, especially in regimes where these methods do not achieve parametric rates. In this paper, we adopt the recently introduced structure-agnostic framework of statistical lower bounds, which poses no structural properties on the nuisance functions other than access to black-box estimators that achieve some statistical estimation rate. This framework is particularly appealing when one is only willing to consider estimation strategies that use non-parametric regression and classification oracles as black-box sub-processes. Within this framework, we prove the statistical optimality of the celebrated and widely used doubly robust estimators for both the Average Treatment Effect (ATE) and the Average Treatment Effect on the Treated (ATT), as well as weighted variants of the former, which arise in policy evaluation.</description>

      <title>Extremal quantiles of intermediate orders under two-way clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19268v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates extremal quantiles under two-way cluster dependence. We demonstrate that the limiting distribution of the unconditional intermediate order quantiles in the tails converges to a Gaussian distribution. This is remarkable as two-way cluster dependence entails potential non-Gaussianity in general, but extremal quantiles do not suffer from this issue. Building upon this result, we extend our analysis to extremal quantile regressions of intermediate order.</description>

      <title>An Empirical Analysis of Scam Tokens on Ethereum Blockchain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19399v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article presents an empirical investigation into the determinants of total revenue generated by counterfeit tokens on Uniswap. It offers a detailed overview of the counterfeit token fraud process, along with a systematic summary of characteristics associated with such fraudulent activities observed in Uniswap. The study primarily examines the relationship between revenue from counterfeit token scams and their defining characteristics, and analyzes the influence of market economic factors such as return on market capitalization and price return on Ethereum. Key findings include a significant increase in overall transactions of counterfeit tokens on their first day of fraud, and a rise in upfront fraud costs leading to corresponding increases in revenue. Furthermore, a negative correlation is identified between the total revenue of counterfeit tokens and the volatility of Ethereum market capitalization return, while price return volatility on Ethereum is found to have a positive impact on counterfeit token revenue, albeit requiring further investigation for a comprehensive understanding. Additionally, the number of subscribers for the real token correlates positively with the realized volume of scam tokens, indicating that a larger community following the legitimate token may inadvertently contribute to the visibility and success of counterfeit tokens. Conversely, the number of Telegram subscribers exhibits a negative impact on the realized volume of scam tokens, suggesting that a higher level of scrutiny or awareness within Telegram communities may act as a deterrent to fraudulent activities. Finally, the timing of when the scam token is introduced on the Ethereum blockchain may have a negative impact on its success. Notably, the cumulative amount scammed by only 42 counterfeit tokens amounted to almost 11214 Ether.</description>
