      <title>Finite-size effects in two-photon correlations of exciton Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accessing two-photon statistics via Hunbary Brown and Twiss (HBT)-type measurements is essential for investigations of excitonic Bose-condensates. In this paper we make use of quantum hydrodynamics in order to study the finite-size impact on the two-photon emission intensity of a 2D condensate of excitons. We use the developed approach to calculate the two-photon decay time of exciton condensate in GaAs quantum wells and MoS$_2$ bilayers. We demonstrate that the registered signal scales on the sample size in a qualitatively different manner than the Bogoliubov theory predicts.</description>

      <title>Quantum Fluids of Light in 2D Artificial Reconfigurable Aperiodic Crystals with Tailored Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aperiodic crystals are the intermediates between strictly periodic crystalline matter and amorphous solids. The lack of translational symmetry combined with intrinsic long-range order endows aperiodic crystals with unique physical characteristics, while at the same time dramatically enriching the spectrum and localization properties. Here, we demonstrate exciton-polariton condensation in a two-dimensional Penrose tiling with $C_{10}$ rotational symmetry - the first signature of quasicrystalline order in a quantum fluid of light. We identify a regime, wherein near-perfect delocalization and synchronization of a quantum fluid of light occurs at mesoscopic length-scales extending beyond 100x the healing length and the size of each individual condensate. Realizing long-range order in fully reconfigurable aperiodic crystals of nonlinear, and open-dissipative quantum fluids, lays the foundations for testing a broad range of universality classes of continuous phase transitions beyond the limits of mathematically verifiable models in regular lattices.</description>

      <title>General collisionless kinetic approach to studying excitations in arbitrary-spin quantum atomic gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a general kinetic approach to studying high-frequency collective excitations in arbitrary-spin quantum gases. To this end, we formulate a many-body Hamiltonian that includes the multipolar exchange interaction as well as the coupling of a multipolar moment with an external field. By linearizing the respective collisionless kinetic equation, we find a general dispersion equation that allows us to examine the high-frequency collective modes for arbitrary-spin atoms obeying one or another quantum statistics. We analyze some of its particular solutions describing spin waves and zero sound for Bose and Fermi gases.</description>

      <title>Gapped and gapless quantum spin liquids on the ruby lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ruby lattice has been the subject of much interest recently due its realization in Rydberg atom arrays, where its rich variety of frustrated interactions gives rise to topologically ordered quantum spin liquids. Similarly, numerical studies of ruby-lattice spin models, with both isotropic and anisotropic interactions, have provided evidence of gapped and gapless spin-liquid ground states with different low-energy gauge structures. Motivated by these findings, we perform a projective symmetry group (PSG) classification of U(1) and $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ fermionic spinon mean-field theories$\unicode{x2014}$respecting space-group and time-reversal symmetries$\unicode{x2014}$for $S=1/2$ spins. We obtain a total of 50 U(1) and 64 $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ PSGs, and upon restricting their realization via mean-field $\textit{Ans\"atze}$ with up to second-nearest-neighbor singlet amplitudes (relevant to the models studied here), only 8 U(1) and 18 $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ distinct states are obtained. We present the singlet fields for all $\textit{Ans\"atze}$ up to third-nearest-neighboring bonds and discuss their spinon dispersions as well as their dynamical spin structure factors. Building on this information, we also obtain the phase diagram of the Heisenberg model in the presence of first ($J_{1}$), second ($J_{1}'$), and third ($J_{2}$) neighbor antiferromagnetic couplings within a self-consistent mean-field approximation.</description>

      <title>One-body correlations and momentum distributions of trapped 1D Bose gases at finite temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a general approximate method for calculating the one-body correlations and the momentum distributions of one-dimensional Bose gases at finite interaction strengths and temperatures trapped in smooth confining potentials. Our method combines asymptotic techniques for the long-distance behavior of the gas (similar to Luttinger liquid theory) with known short-distance expansions. We derive analytical results for the limiting cases of strong and weak interactions, and provide a general procedure for calculating one-body correlations at any interaction strength. A step-by-step explanation of the numerical method used to compute Green's functions (needed as input to our theory) is included. We benchmark our method against exact numerical calculations and compare its predictions to recent experimental results.</description>

      <title>Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations and integrable Landau-Zener models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the relationship between integrable Landau-Zener (LZ) models and Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov (KZ) equations. The latter are originally equations for the correlation functions of two-dimensional conformal field theories, but can also be interpreted as multi-time Schr\"odinger equations. The general LZ problem is to find the probabilities of tunneling from eigenstates at $t=t_\text{in}$ to the eigenstates at $t\to+\infty$ for an $N\times N$ time-dependent Hamiltonian $\hat H(t)$. A number of such problems are exactly solvable in the sense that the tunneling probabilities are elementary functions of Hamiltonian parameters and time-dependent wavefunctions are special functions. It has recently been proposed that exactly solvable LZ models map to KZ equations. Here we use this connection to identify and solve various integrable hyperbolic LZ models $\hat H(t)=\hat A+\hat B/t$ for $N=2, 3$, and $4$, where $\hat A$ and $\hat B$ are time-independent matrices. Some of these models have been considered, though not fully solved, before and others are entirely new.</description>

      <title>Effective (Floquet) Lindblad generators from spectral unwinding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A mathematical description of the reduced dynamics of an open quantum system can often be given in terms of a completely positive and trace preserving (CPTP) map, also known as quantum channel. In a seminal work by Wolf et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 101, 150402 (2008)], it was shown that deciding whether a given quantum channel was generated from an underlying effective Markovian dynamics, with time-independent Lindbladian generator, is generally an NP-hard problem. In this work we show that in cases where one has access to the full reduced dynamics at all previous times (the dynamical map) one can significantly facilitate the search for an effective generator by making use of Floquet theory. By performing a spectral unwinding such that the effective micromotion is minimized, the effective Floquet generator is often an excellent candidate for an effective Lindblad generator, hence significantly reducing the complexity of the search for an effective Lindblad generator in many (though not all) cases. Our results are relevant for engineering Floquet Lindbladians in complex many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Liouvillian skin effects and fragmented condensates in an integrable dissipative Bose-Hubbard model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10261v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strongly interacting non-equilibrium systems are of great fundamental interest, yet their inherent complexity make then notoriously hard to analyze. We demonstrate that the dynamics of the Bose-Hubbard model, which by itself evades solvability, can be solved exactly at any interaction strength in the presence of loss tuned to a rate matching the hopping amplitude. Remarkably, the full solvability of the corresponding Liouvillian, and the integrability of the pertinent effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, survives the addition of disorder and generic boundary conditions. By analyzing the Bethe ansatz solutions we find that even weak interactions change the qualitative features of the system, leading to an intricate dynamical phase diagram featuring non-Hermitian Mott-skin effects, disorder induced localization, highly degenerate exceptional points, and a Bose glass-like phase of fragmented condensates. We discuss realistic implementations of this model with cold atoms.</description>

      <title>Coulomb universality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04761v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by a number of realizations of long-range interacting systems, including ultra-cold atomic and molecular gases, we study a neutral plasma with power-law interactions longer-ranged than Coulombic. We find that beyond a crossover length, such interactions are universally screened down to a standard Coulomb form in all spatial dimensions. This implies, counter-intuitively, that in two dimensions and below, such a "super-Coulombic" gas is asymptotically Coulombically confining at low temperatures. At higher temperatures, the plasma undergoes a deconfining transition that in two dimensions is the same Kosterlitz-Thouless transition that occurs in a conventional Coulomb gas, but at an elevated temperature that we calculate. We also predict that in contrast, above two dimensions, even when naively the bare potential is confining, there is no confined phase of the plasma at any nonzero temperature. In addition, the super-Coulomb to Coulomb crossover is followed at longer length scales by an unconventional "Debye-Huckel" screening, which leads to faster-than-Coulombic, power-law decay of the screened potential, in contrast to the usual exponentially decaying Yukawa potential. Furthermore, we show that power-law potentials, that fall off more rapidly than Coulomb, are screened down to a shorter-ranged power-law, rather than an exponential Debye-Huckel Yukawa form. We expect these prediction to be testable in simulations, and hope they will inspire experimental studies in various platforms.</description>

      <title>Universal fragmentation in annihilation reactions with constrained kinetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16950v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In reaction-diffusion models of annihilation reactions in low dimensions, single-particle dynamics provides a bottleneck for reactions, leading to an anomalously slow approach to the empty state. Here, we construct a reaction model with a reciprocal bottleneck on particle dynamics where single-particle motion conserves the center of mass. We show that such a constrained reaction-diffusion dynamics does not approach an empty state but freezes at late times in a state with fragmented particle clusters, and that the late-time dynamics and asymptotic density are universal. Our setup thus constitutes a minimal model for the fragmentation of a one-dimensional lattice into independent particle clusters, and we provide exact results for the final density in the large-reaction rate limit. We suggest that the universal reaction dynamics could be observable in experiments with cold atoms or in the Auger recombination of exciton gases.</description>

Abstract: To explore the influence of quantum-geometric effects on the Ginzburg-Landau coherence length in a dilute flat-band superconductor, we adopt a BCS-BEC crossover approach to the multiband pyrochlore-Hubbard model near the critical temperature for superconductivity. Our self-consistent formulation for this three-dimensional lattice benchmarks very well against the so-called zero-temperature coherence length, demonstrating the monotonic decay of the coherence length to zero as the interaction strength increases. Additionally, we show that the effective mass of the many-body bound states (i.e., Cooper pairs) is nearly identical to that of the lowest-lying two-body bound states in the dilute flat-band limit.</description>
