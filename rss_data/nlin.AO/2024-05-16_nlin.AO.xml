      <title>Phase holonomy underlies puzzling temporal patterns in Kuramoto models with two sub-populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a geometric investigation of curious dynamical behaviors previously reported in Kuramoto models with two sub-populations. Our study demonstrates that chimeras and traveling waves in such models are associated with the birth of geometric phase. Although manifestations of geometric phase are frequent in various fields of Physics, this is the first time (to our best knowledge) that such a phenomenon is exposed in ensembles of Kuramoto oscillators or, more broadly, in complex systems.</description>

      <title>Challenges and opportunities for digital twins in precision medicine: a complex systems perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The adoption of digital twins (DTs) in precision medicine is increasingly viable, propelled by extensive data collection and advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), alongside traditional biomedical methodologies. However, the reliance on black-box predictive models, which utilize large datasets, presents limitations that could impede the broader application of DTs in clinical settings. We argue that hypothesis-driven generative models, particularly multiscale modeling, are essential for boosting the clinical accuracy and relevance of DTs, thereby making a significant impact on healthcare innovation. This paper explores the transformative potential of DTs in healthcare, emphasizing their capability to simulate complex, interdependent biological processes across multiple scales. By integrating generative models with extensive datasets, we propose a scenario-based modeling approach that enables the exploration of diverse therapeutic strategies, thus supporting dynamic clinical decision-making. This method not only leverages advancements in data science and big data for improving disease treatment and prevention but also incorporates insights from complex systems and network science, quantitative biology, and digital medicine, promising substantial advancements in patient care.</description>

      <title>Pedestrian evacuations with imitation of cooperative behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the dynamics of room evacuation for mixed populations that include both competitive and cooperative individuals through numerical simulations using the social force model. Cooperative agents represent well-trained individuals who know how to behave in order to reduce risks within high-density crowds. We consider that competitive agents can imitate cooperative behavior when they are in close proximity to cooperators. We study the effects of the imitation of cooperative behavior on the duration and safety of evacuations, analyzing evacuation time and other quantities of interest for varying parameters such as the proportions of mixing, the aspect ratio of the room, and the parameters characterizing individual behaviors. Our main findings reveal that the addition of a relatively small number of cooperative agents into a crowd can reduce evacuation time and the density near the exit door, making the evacuation faster and safer despite an increase in the total number of agents. In particular, for long spaces such as corridors, a small number of added cooperative agents can significantly facilitate the evacuation process. We compare our results with those of systems without imitation and also study the general role of cooperation, providing further analysis for homogeneous populations. Our main conclusions emphasize the potential relevance of training people how to behave in high-density crowds</description>

      <title>Exploring the Interplay of Intrinsic Fluctuation and Complexity in Intracellular Calcium Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09386v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The concentration of intracellular calcium ion (Ca$^{2+}$) exhibits complex oscillations, including bursting and chaos, as observed experimentally. These dynamics are influenced by inherent fluctuations within cells, which serve as crucial determinants in cellular decision-making processes and fate determination. In this study, we systematically explore the interplay between intrinsic fluctuation and the complexity of intracellular cytosolic Ca$^{2+}$ dynamics using complexity measures such as permutation entropy (PE) and statistical complexity (SC). Using the chemical Langevin equation, we simulate the stochastic dynamics of cytosolic Ca$^{2+}$. Our findings reveal that PE and SC effectively characterize the diverse, dynamic states of cytosolic Ca$^{2+}$ and illustrate their interactions with intrinsic fluctuation. PE analysis elucidates that the chaotic state is more sensitive to intrinsic fluctuation than the other periodic states. Furthermore, we identify distinct states of cytosolic Ca$^{2+}$ occupying specific locations within the theoretical bounds of the complexity-entropy causality plane. These locations indicate varying complexity and information content as intrinsic fluctuation varies. When adjusting the permutation order, the SC for the different states exhibits peaks in an intermediate range of intrinsic fluctuation values. Additionally, we identify scale-free or self-similar patterns in this intermediate range, which are further corroborated by multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis. These high-complexity states likely correspond to optimal Ca$^{2+}$ dynamics with biological significance, revealing rich and complex dynamics shaped by the interplay of intrinsic fluctuation and complexity. Our investigation enhances our understanding of how intrinsic fluctuation modulates the complexity of intracellular Ca$^{2+}$ dynamics that play crucial roles in biological cells.</description>

      <title>Effects of self-avoidance on the packing of stiff rods on ellipsoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.00921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.00921v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using a statistical-mechanics approach, we study the effects of geometry and self-avoidance on the ordering of slender filaments inside non-isotropic containers, considering cortical microtubules in plant cells, and packing of genetic material inside viral capsids as concrete examples. Within a mean-field approximation, we show analytically how the shape of the container, together with self-avoidance, affects the ordering of the stiff rods. We find that the strength of the self-avoiding interaction plays a significant role in the preferred packing orientation, leading to a first-order transition for oblate cells, where the preferred orientation changes from azimuthal, along the equator, to a polar one, when self-avoidance is strong enough. While for prolate spheroids the ground state is always a polar-like order, strong self-avoidance results with a deep meta-stable state along the equator. We compute the critical surface describing the transition between azimuthal and polar ordering in the three dimensional parameter space (persistence length, eccentricity, and self-avoidance) and show that the critical behavior of this system is in fact related to the butterfly catastrophe model. We calculate the pressure and shear stress applied by the filament on the surface, and the injection force needed to be applied on the filament in order to insert it into the volume. We compare these results to the pure mechanical study where self-avoidance is ignored, and discuss similarities and differences.</description>
