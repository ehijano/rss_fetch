      <title>Short- and long-term relationships between the Yucatan Channel transport and the Loop Current System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work uses twin 22-year free-running simulations of the Gulf of Mexico hydrodynamics performed with the HYCOM, one considering only ocean dynamics and the other incorporating atmospheric forcing, to study the behavior of the Yucatan Channel transport (YCT), the Loop Current (LC), the Loop Current Eddies (LCEs), their relationships, and the atmospheric forcing effect on them in short (daily) and long (monthly) time scales. A more comprehensive description of the LC intrusion and LCE separations was obtained by considering the upper eastern or western YCT (whose magnitudes are determined by the longitudinal displacements of the Yucatan Current's core), a perspective not evident when considering the upper total YCT; specifically, the eastern YCT provides the most meaningful description of the studied processes. Atmospheric forcing mainly affects the extended stage of the LC by creating a higher dispersion in the YCT and LC circulation values in comparison when considering only ocean dynamics. For the long-term analysis, standardized indexes that integrate the daily values of the eastern YCT and LC circulation in time were used; their temporal propagation and persistence (the changes of their characteristics from short to long time scales) were studied. Intrinsic ocean dynamics produces a persistent YCT and LC intrusion behavior and consistent LCE separation patterns from daily to 5-month scales. The atmospheric forcing effects are more emphasized on the LC intrusion and LCE separations than on the YCT: the YCT persistence is maintained but not that of the LC intrusion. An increased occurrence of LCE separations with low or moderate LC intrusion is expected due to climate change. Using the standardized indexes of the LC metrics to construct a predictive model of the LC intrusion and LCE separations using only current and past LC information is proposed for future research.</description>

      <title>Emergent vorticity asymmetry of one and two-layer shallow water system captured by a next-order balanced model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quasigeostrophic (QG) system has served as a useful simplified model for understanding geophysical physical fluid phenomena. The fact that it is based on only one prognostic variable $\textrm{ -- }$ potential vorticity (PV) $\textrm{ -- }$ is a simplification that has facilitated much theoretical understanding. However, although QG captures many geophysical turbulence phenomena, it misses important features that occur in shallow water systems at finite Rossby numbers, even those that are "balanced". For example, QG does not capture the emergent vorticity asymmetry or the finite divergence of the velocity fields. Here we present a next-order-in-Rossby extension of QG in the single-layer and multi-layer shallow water context: SWQG$^{+1}$. A freely decaying simulation shows that SWQG$^{+1}$ can capture the negatively skewed vorticity found in simulations of the shallow water model in the same setting. We also extend the model to the multi-layer configuration. Simulation of nonlinear evolution of a baroclinically unstable jet in SWQG$^{+1}$ shows that it can capture vorticity asymmetry and finite divergence of strain-driven fronts. We propose here that SWQG$^{+1}$ could be a useful intermediate model for theoretical and numerical study of the balanced dynamics of geophysical physical fluid dynamics, with possible applications for forward and inverse modeling of atmospheres and oceans on Earth and other planets.</description>

      <title>Improving the parametrization of transport and mixing processes in planetary atmospheres: the importance of implementing the full Coriolis acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the ongoing characterisation of the atmospheres of exoplanets by the JWST, we are unveiling a large diversity of planetary atmospheres, both in terms of composition and dynamics. As such, it is necessary to build coherent atmospheric models for exoplanetary atmospheres to study their dynamics in any regime of thickness, stratification and rotation. However, many models only partially include the Coriolis acceleration with only taking into account the local projection of the rotation vector along the vertical direction (this is the so-called "Traditional Approximation of Rotation") and do not accurately model the effects of the rotation when it dominates the stratification.
  In this contribution, we report the ongoing efforts to take the full Coriolis acceleration into account for the transport of momentum and the mixing of chemicals. First, we show how the horizontal local component of the rotation vector can deeply modifies the instabilities of horizontal sheared flows and the turbulence they can trigger. Next, we show how the interaction between waves and zonal winds can be drastically modified because of the modification of the wave damping or breaking when taking into account the full Coriolis acceleration. These works are devoted to improve the parameterization of waves and turbulent processes in global atmospheric models.</description>

      <title>Optical turbulence in the atmospheric surface layer at the Pamir Plateau Muztagh-ata site</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21347v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we conducted a detailed analysis of optical turbulence in the Atmospheric Surface Layer (ASL) at Muztagh-ata site during on-site testing. We utilized ultrasonic anemometers positioned on a 30-meter tower to collect and process data at five height levels, obtaining data from October 1, 2021 to the present. We investigated the behavior of optical turbulence parameters (\(C_n^2\) and seeing \(\varepsilon\)) in the ASL. Nighttime \(C_n^2\) primarily fluctuated in the range of \(10^{-16}\) to \(10^{-14}\), exhibiting an exponential decrease with height. During the day, it showed a \(h^{-0.82}\) dependency, while at night, it displayed a \(h^{-0.48}\) dependency. Additionally, we presented the distribution of seeing across different layers within the ASL, showing a gradual decrease with increasing height, with a median seeing of 0.24 arcseconds at nighttime and 0.48 arcseconds at daytime between 6-30m. We investigated the relationship between surface temperature inversion, seeing in the ASL, and wind speed at the site. Our results show that under temperature inversion conditions, seeing significantly improves and is often accompanied by low to moderate wind speeds, while high wind speeds are usually associated with poorer seeing. Preliminary calculations and observational results, combined with the high altitude and unique geographical location, suggest that Muztagh-ata site has the potential to be an outstanding optical astronomical observatory in the western plateau of china.</description>

      <title>Enhancing 3D Planetary Atmosphere Simulations with a Surrogate Radiative Transfer Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08556v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work introduces an approach to enhancing the computational efficiency of 3D atmospheric simulations by integrating a machine-learned surrogate model into the OASIS global circulation model (GCM). Traditional GCMs, which are based on repeatedly numerically integrating physical equations governing atmospheric processes across a series of time-steps, are time-intensive, leading to compromises in spatial and temporal resolution of simulations. This research improves upon this limitation, enabling higher resolution simulations within practical timeframes. Speeding up 3D simulations holds significant implications in multiple domains. Firstly, it facilitates the integration of 3D models into exoplanet inference pipelines, allowing for robust characterisation of exoplanets from a previously unseen wealth of data anticipated from JWST and post-JWST instruments. Secondly, acceleration of 3D models will enable higher resolution atmospheric simulations of Earth and Solar System planets, enabling more detailed insights into their atmospheric physics and chemistry. Our method replaces the radiative transfer module in OASIS with a recurrent neural network-based model trained on simulation inputs and outputs. Radiative transfer is typically one of the slowest components of a GCM, thus providing the largest scope for overall model speed-up. The surrogate model was trained and tested on the specific test case of the Venusian atmosphere, to benchmark the utility of this approach in the case of non-terrestrial atmospheres. This approach yields promising results, with the surrogate-integrated GCM demonstrating above 99.0% accuracy and 147 factor GPU speed-up of the entire simulation compared to using the matched original GCM under Venus-like conditions.</description>
