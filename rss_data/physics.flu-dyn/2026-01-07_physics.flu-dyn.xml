      <title>Complex-time singular structure of the 1D Hou-Luo model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Starting from smooth initial data, we investigate the complex-time analytic structure of the one-dimensional Hou--Luo (HL) model, a wall approximation of the three-dimensional axisymmetric Euler equations. While the finite-time blow-up in this setting has been already established, here we chart the entire singular landscape. This analysis is enabled by a novel formulation of the HL model in Lagrangian coordinates, in which the time-Taylor coefficients of the flow fields are evaluated symbolically to high truncation order. Our results are threefold. First, we show that the Lagrangian series for the vorticity converges within the complex-time disc of radius~$t_\star &gt;0$ and is free from (early-time) resonances that impede the Eulerian formulation. Second, applying asymptotic analysis on the series, we recover both the blow-up time and the singularity exponent with high accuracy. This also enables a quantitative assessment of the Beale--Kato--Majda criterion, which we find correctly identifies the blow-up time, but washes out the local singularity exponent, as it relies on a spatial supremum. Third, and most importantly, we develop a Lagrangian singularity theory that predicts the eye-shaped singularity profile observed in Eulerian coordinates by exploiting the driving mechanism of the blow-up: The accumulation of multiple fluid particles at the same Eulerian position. The employed techniques extend recently introduced methods for the inviscid Burgers equation [C. Rampf et al., Phys. Rev. Fluids 7 (2022) 10, 104610], and can be further adapted to higher spatial dimensions or other hydrodynamical equations.</description>

      <title>Relaxation and statistical equilibria in generalised two-dimensional flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study relaxation toward statistical equilibrium states of inviscid generalised two-dimensional flows, where the generalised vorticity $q$ is related to the streamfunction $\psi$ via $q=(-\nabla^2)^{\frac{\alpha}{2}}\psi$, with the parameter $\alpha$ controlling the strength of the nonlinear interactions. The equilibrium solutions exhibit an $\alpha \mapsto -\alpha$ symmetry, under which generalised energy $E_G$ and enstrophy $\Omega_G$ are interchanged.For initial conditions that produce condensates, we find long-lived quasi-equilibrium states far from the thermalised solutions we derive using canonical ensemble theory. Using numerical simulations we find that in the limit of vanishing nonlinearity, as $\alpha \to 0$, the time required for partial thermalisation $\tau_{th}$ scales like $1/\alpha$. So, the relaxation of the system toward equilibrium becomes increasingly slow as the system approaches the weakly nonlinear limit. This behaviour is also captured by a reduced model we derive using multiple scale asymptotics. These findings highlight the role of nonlinearity in controlling the relaxation toward equilibrium and that the inherent symmetry of the statistical equilibria determines the direction of the turbulent cascades.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Flow Initialization Framework for CFD Acceleration of Underwater Vehicle in Vertical-Plane Oblique Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of flow fields around underwater vehicles undergoing vertical-plane oblique motions is critical for hydrodynamic analysis, but it often requires computationally expensive CFD simulations. This study proposes a Data-Driven Flow Initialization (DDFI) framework that accelerates CFD simulation by integrating deep neural network (DNN) to predict full-domain flow fields. Using the suboff hull under various inlet velocities and angles of attack as an example, a DNN is trained to predict velocity, pressure, and turbulent quantities based on mesh geometry, operating conditions, and hybrid vectors. The DNN can provide reasonably accurate predictions with a relative error about 3.3%. To enhance numerical accuracy while maintaining physical consistency, the DNN-predicted flow fields are utilized as initial solutions for the CFD solver, achieving up to 3.5-fold and 2.0-fold speedup at residual thresholds of 5*10^(-6)and 5*10^(-8), respectively. This method maintains physical consistency by refining neural network outputs via traditional CFD solvers, balancing computational efficiency and accuracy. Notably, reducing the size of training set does not exert an essential impact on acceleration performance. Besides, this method exhibits cross-mesh generalization capability. In general, this proposed hybrid approach offers a new pathway for high-fidelity and efficient full-domain flow field predictions around complex underwater vehicles.</description>

      <title>ML enhanced measurement of the electrostatic charge distribution of powder conveyed through a duct</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electrostatic charge acquired by powders during transport through ducts can cause devastating dust explosions. Our recently developed laser-optical measurement technique can resolve the powder charge along a one-dimensional (1D) path. However, the charge across the duct's complete two-dimensional (2D) cross-section, which is the critical parameter for process safety, is generally unavailable due to limited optical access. To estimate the complete powder charge distribution in a conveying duct, we propose a machine learning (ML) approach using a shallow neural network (SNN). The ML algorithm is trained with cross-sectional data extracted from four different three-dimensional direct numerical simulations of a turbulent duct flow with varying particle size. Through this training with simulation data, the ML algorithm can estimate the powder charge distribution in the duct's cross-section based on only 1D measurements. The results reveal an average $L^1$-error of the reconstructed 2D cross-section of 1.63 %.</description>

      <title>Statistical State Dynamics Based Study of the Turbulent Ekman Layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Streamwise roll and streak structures (RSS) are prominent features observed in both atmospheric and oceanic planetary boundary layers (PBL) as well as in laboratory scale Wall bounded shear flows. Despite their structural similarity across these systems, the mechanisms responsible for forming and sustaining the RSS remain debated. This study demonstrates that the same turbulence sustaining mechanism previously identified in Wall bounded shear flows using the Statistical State Dynamics (SSD) formulation of the Navier Stokes equations (Farrell &amp; Ioannou 2012; Farrell et al. 2017) also operates in the Ekman layer. By extending the SSD based stability analysis methods previously used for studying roll formation in wall bounded shear flows to the Ekman layer, we show that the well known Reynolds stress driven instability mechanism in wall-bounded turbulence acts together with inflectional instability to produce and sustain RSS in the Ekman layer. These results enhance the mechanistic understanding of RSS formation and evolution in the turbulent Ekman layer and provide a fundamental link between geophysical Ekman-layer turbulence and turbulence in engineering-scale shear flows.</description>

      <title>Unifying Viscocapillary and Inertial Regimes in Selective Withdrawal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Selective withdrawal extracts only a single phase from a stratified multi-layer system. Entrainment occurs when a critical condition draws up the static layer which is not being withdrawn. Existing studies provide robust scalings within distinct limiting regimes. These include viscocapillary-dominated entrainment at low Reynolds number. They also include inertia-dominated entrainment at high Reynolds number. However, a single unifying representation remains to be explored in the literature. This limitation is most evident in transitional conditions between classical limits. It is also pronounced when the lower layer is non-Newtonian. Here we report selective-withdrawal experiments spanning these conditions. The upper layer is Newtonian, using PDMS or soybean oil. The lower layer is either Newtonian water or shear-thinning xanthan-gum solutions. We propose a unified framework that connects these previously separated regimes. The framework adopts a ``Moody diagram'' type representation for selective withdrawal. We collapse normalized critical submergence height using a Reynolds-like control parameter. Surface-tension effects enter subdominantly through the capillary length. The resulting master curve captures the transition between dominant balances. It connects viscous and shear-controlled entrainment to inertial entrainment. The collapse also clarifies how shear thinning enters the organization. Shear thinning primarily renormalizes the viscous correction through an effective viscosity. It does not alter the inertial baseline scale that anchors the normalization. This regime-spanning representation avoids regime-by-regime correlation switching. It provides a compact diagnostic for entrainment thresholds across fluid types. The diagnostic applies to Newtonian and generalized-Newtonian two-layer systems.</description>

      <title>Fast and slow surfactants in turbulent bubble breakup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When a large air cavity breaks in a turbulent flow, it goes through very large deformations and cascading events of new interface formation, including elongated filaments and bubbles over a wide range of scales, with their rate of formation controlled by turbulence and capillary processes. We experimentally investigate the effects of surfactants and salt on the fragmentation, and observe an order of magnitude increase of the number of bubbles being produced in some cases. For bubbles larger than the Hinze scale $d_H$ (defined as the balance between surface tension and turbulence stresses), we observe that bubble size distributions remain unchanged for all solutions tested. For bubbles below $d_H$, however, we observe an increase of the number of bubbles produced and an associated steepening of the bubble size distribution upon the addition of surfactant or salt. This later effect is only visible for some of the surfactants tested when their adsorption timescale is fast enough compared to the rate at which new interfaces are being generated by turbulence.</description>

      <title>Effect of Electric Charge on Biotherapeutic Transport, Binding and Absorption: A Computational Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores the effects of electric charge on the dynamics of drug transport and absorption in subcutaneous injections of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). We develop a novel mathematical and computational model, based on the Nernst-Planck equations and porous media flow theory, to investigate the complex interactions between mAbs and charged species in subcutaneous tissue. The model enables us to study short-term transport dynamics and long-term binding and absorption for two mAbs with different electric properties. We examine the influence of buffer pH, body mass index, injection depth, and formulation concentration on drug distribution and compare our numerical results with experimental data from the literature.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic Whispering: Enabling Near-Field Silent Communication via Artificial Lateral Line Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To address the imperative for covert underwater swarm coordination, this paper introduces "Hydrodynamic Whispering," a near-field silent communication paradigm utilizing Artificial Lateral Line (ALL) arrays. Grounded in potential flow theory, we model the transmitter as an oscillating dipole source. The resulting pressure field exhibits steep nearfield attenuation (scaling with 1/r^2, naturally delimiting a secure "communication bubble" with intrinsic Low Probability of Interception (LPI) properties. We propose a transceiver architecture featuring a Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK) modulation scheme adapted for mechanical actuator inertia, coupled with a bio-inspired 24-sensor conformal array. To mitigate low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) in turbulent environments,a Spatio-Temporal Joint Processing framework incorporating Spatial Matched-Field Beamforming is developed. Simulation results demonstrate that the system achieves an array gain of approximately 13.8 dB and maintains a near-zero Bit Error Rate (BER) within the effective range. This study validates the feasibility of utilizing localized hydrodynamic pressure fluctuations for reliable and secure short-range underwater networking.</description>

      <title>OpenFOAM computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solver for magnetohydrodynamic open cycles, applied to the Sakhalin pulsed magnetohydrodynamic generator (PMHDG)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the current study, we present a mathematical and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model for simulating open-cycle linear Faraday-type continuous-electrode channels of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) power generators, operating on combustion plasma. The model extends the Favre-averaged Navier-Stokes equations to account for the electric properties of the flowing plasma gas and its reaction to the applied magnetic field. The model takes into account various effects, such as the Lorentz force, turbulence, compressibility, and energy extraction from the plasma, and it adopts an electric potential technique along with the low magnetic Reynolds number (Rem) approximation. The model is numerically implemented using the multiphysics open-source computer programming environment "OpenFOAM," which combines the finite volume method (FVM) and the object-oriented programming (OOP) concept. The capabilities of the model are demonstrated by simulating the supersonic channel of the large-scale pulsed MHD generator (PMHDG) called "Sakhalin", with the aid of collected data and empirical expressions in the literature about its tested operation. Sakhalin was the world's largest PMHDG, with a demonstrated peak electric power output of 510 MW. Sakhalin operated on solid-propellant plasma (SPP), and it had a single supersonic divergent Faraday-type continuous-electrode channel with a length of 4.5 m. We check the validity of the model through comparisons with independent results for the Sakhalin PMHDG. Then, we process our three-dimensional simulation results to provide scalar characteristics of the Sakhalin channel, one-dimensional profiles along the longitudinal centerline, and three-dimensional distributions in the entire channel.</description>

      <title>What happens if you put your head in the Geneva water jet? An inquiry-based physics activity exploring fluid dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe a physics education activity for third-year Bachelor students, inspired by a humorous question about the Geneva water jet. The exercise engages students in key scientific practices: reformulating everyday questions in scientific terms, constructing simplified models, performing semi-quantitative estimations, and comparing alternative solution methods. Students explore approaches based on Bernoulli principle and a power analysis, revealing consistent results when assumptions are carefully considered. The activity emphasizes critical reasoning, including identifying relevant data, making approximations, and applying energy and mass conservation to incompressible fluids. It also fosters metacognitive skills and higher-order thinking (HOT), illustrating the universality of fundamental physical principles across diverse phenomena. By situating the task in a relatable, real-world context, the activity motivates students while exposing them to problem-solving challenges rarely encountered in traditional instruction, such as Fermi-type estimation and cross-context knowledge transfer.</description>

      <title>Dynamical bicontinuous networks from 3D active phase separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study phase separation between coexisting active and passive fluids in three-dimensions, using both numerical simulation and experiments. Chaotic flows of the active phase drive giant interfacial deformations and cause the co-existing phases to interpenetrate, generating a continuously reconfiguring bicontinuous steady-state morphology that persists over the lifetime of the active fluid. We demonstrate how activity controls the structure of the bicontinuous network. Quantitative analysis reveals the dominance of dynamical steady-state sheet-like interfaces, in marked difference from the transient bicontinuous structures observed in passive liquid-liquid phase separation, where saddle-like surfaces dominate. These results demonstrate how active stresses suppress the coarsening dynamics of conventional phase separation, generating steady-state reconfigurable morphologies not accessible with conventional surface-modifying agents or through quenching of transient phase separated structures.</description>

      <title>A practical guide to estimation and uncertainty quantification of aerodynamic flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20280v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many applications in aerodynamics, particularly in closed-loop control, depend on sensors to estimate the evolving state of the flow. This estimation task is inherently accompanied by uncertainty due to the noisy measurements of sensors or the non-uniqueness of the underlying mapping. Knowledge of this uncertainty can be as important for decision-making as that of the state itself. Uncertainty tracking is challenged by the often-nonlinear relationship between the measurements and the flow state. For example, a collection of passing vortices leaves a footprint in wall pressure that depends nonlinearly on the vortices' strengths and positions. In this paper, we outline recent approaches to flow estimation and illuminate them with worked examples and selected case studies. We review relevant probability tools, including sampling and estimation, in the powerful setting of Bayesian inference and demonstrate these in static flow estimation examples. We then review unsteady examples and illustrate the application of sequential estimation, and particularly, the ensemble Kalman filter. Finally, we discuss uncertainty quantification in neural network approximations of the mappings between sensor measurements and flow states. Recent aerodynamic applications have shown that the flow state can be encoded into a very low-dimensional latent space. We discuss the uncertainty implications of this encoding.</description>

Abstract: Underground gas storage is a critical technology in global efforts to mitigate climate change. In particular, hydrogen storage offers a promising solution for integrating renewable energy into the power grid. When injected into the subsurface, hydrogen's low viscosity compared to the resident brine causes a bubble of hydrogen trapped beneath caprock to spread rapidly into an aquifer through release of a thin gas layer above the brine, complicating recovery. In long aquifers, the large viscous pressure drop between source and outlet induces significant pressure variations, potentially leading to substantial density changes in the injected gas. To examine the role of gas compressibility in the spreading dynamics, we use long-wave theory to derive coupled nonlinear evolution equations for the gas pressure and gas/liquid interface height, focusing on the limit of long domains, weak gas compressibility and low gas/liquid viscosity ratio. Simulations are supplemented with a comprehensive asymptotic analysis of parameter regimes. Unlike the near-incompressible limit, in which gas spreading rates are dictated by the source strength and viscosity ratio, and compressive effects are transient, we show how compression of the main gas bubble can generate dynamic pressure changes that are coupled to those in the thin gas layer that spreads over the liquid, with compressive effects having a sustained influence along the layer. This coupling allows compressibility to reduce spreading rates and gas pressures. We characterise this behaviour via a set of low-order models that reveal dominant scalings, highlighting the role of compressibility in mediating the evolution of the gas layer.</description>

      <title>Scaling transition in horizontal convection near the density maximum</title>

Abstract: Horizontal convection (HC) serves as a canonical model for geophysical and industrial flows driven by differential heating along a surface. While the classical Oberbeck-Boussinesq (OB) approximation is well-established, the impact of a nonlinear equation of state, specifically the density maximum of water near $4^\circ\mathrm{C}$, remains underexplored. This study investigates Non-Oberbeck-Boussinesq (NOB) effects on HC via direct numerical simulations (DNS) over a Rayleigh number range of $10^6 \le Ra \le 5\times 10^{10}$. We examine two configurations: Classical HC (CHC) and Symmetric HC (SHC). Our results reveal that the NOB-SHC case undergoes a structural transition, evolving from a bicellular structure to a full-depth, single-roll circulation driven by central `mixing plumes'. This reorganization manifests as transitional anomalies in Reynolds number ($Re$) scaling, whereas the emergence of full-depth plumes fundamentally alters the heat transport mechanism. Consequently, unlike the classical Rossby scaling ($Nu \sim Ra^{1/5}$) observed in reference cases, the NOB-SHC regime exhibits an enhanced heat transport scaling ranging from $Nu \sim Ra^{1/4}$ to $Ra^{1/3}$. To rationalize this behavior, we extend the Shishkina-Grossmann-Lohse (SGL) theory by incorporating a generalized potential energy transfer term ($\Phi_{i2}$). The theoretical framework demonstrates that the global scaling law is dictated by the characteristic plume height ($\hat{z}$). Specifically, when plumes penetrate the entire cavity depth ($\hat{z} \sim H$), as observed in the NOB-SHC case, the flow transcends classical bounds for OB HC, accessing a regime analogous to Rayleigh B\'enard convection. The proposed theory successfully unifies the scaling laws for both OB and NOB fluids, showing excellent agreement with numerical data.</description>

      <title>High-Fidelity Simulations of Two Miscible Fluids in Small Scale Turbulent Mixers Using a Variational Multiscale Finite Element Method</title>

Abstract: Turbulent mixers have been widely used in industrial settings for chemical production and increasingly for therapeutic nanoparticle formulation by antisolvent precipitation. The quality of the product is closely related to the fluid and mixing dynamics inside the mixers. Due to the rapid time scales and small sizes of many turbulent mixing geometries, computational fluid dynamics simulations have been the primary tool used to predict and understand fluid behavior within these mixers. In this study, we used the residual-based variational multiscale finite element method to perform high-fidelity turbulent simulations on two commonly used turbulent mixers: the multi-inlet vortex mixer (MIVM) and the confined impinging jets mixer (CIJM). We simulated two geometric variations, two-inlets and four-inlets, of the MIVM and two different inflow ratios of the CIJM. Through detailed turbulence results, we identify differences in turbulence onset, total energy, and mixing performance of the two MIVM configurations. With the CIJM results, we demonstrate the effect of the flow rate ratio on the impingement behavior, and as a result, on the mixing performance and turbulence. The cross-comparison between the two mixers shows key differences in turbulence and mixing behaviors, such as the turbulence onset, the energy decay, and the output mixing index. This study demonstrates the importance of a high-accuracy numerical scheme in simulating the turbulent mixers and understanding the similarities and differences among mixers. Furthermore, the results show potential for optimizing the operating conditions to achieve the best mixing performance.</description>

      <title>Excitation of Inertial Modes in 3D Simulations of Rotating Convection in Planets and Stars</title>

Abstract: Thermal convection in rotating stars and planets drives anisotropic turbulence and differential rotation, both capable of feeding energy into global oscillations. Using 3D simulations of rotating convection in spherical shells, we show that inertial modes--oscillations restored by the Coriolis force--emerge naturally in rotationally constrained turbulence, without imposing any external forcing other than thermal/buoyancy driving. By varying the rotation rate at fixed Rayleigh number, we find that coherent modes appear only when the convective Rossby number, the ratio of the rotation period to the convective turnover time, falls below about one-half, where rotation dominates the dynamics. These modes are mostly retrograde in the rotating frame, equatorially symmetric, and confined to mid and high latitudes, with discrete frequencies well below twice the background rotation rate. At lower viscosities, or smaller Prandtl number, mode excitation becomes more efficient and a broader spectrum of inertial modes emerges. While the precise excitation mechanism remains uncertain, our results suggest that the modes are driven by instabilities due to differential rotation rather than stochastic forcing by convection. We conclude that similar inertial modes are likely to exist in the interiors of giant planets and stars, though their low frequencies will make them difficult to detect.</description>

      <title>A Cartesian Cut-Cell Two-Fluid Method for Two-Phase Diffusion Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19407v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a Cartesian cut-cell finite-volume method for sharp-interface two-phase diffusion problems in static geometries. The formulation follows a two-fluid approach: independent diffusion equations are discretized in each phase on a fixed Cartesian grid, while the phases are coupled through embedded interface conditions enforcing continuity of diffusive flux and a general jump law. Cut cells are treated by integrating the governing equations over phase-restricted control volumes and surfaces, yielding discrete divergence and gradient operators that are locally conservative within each phase. Interface coupling is achieved by introducing a small set of interfacial unknowns per cut cell on the embedded boundary; the resulting algebraic system involves only bulk and interfacial averages. A key feature of the method is the use of a reduced set of geometric information based solely on low-order moments (trimmed volumes, apertures and interface measures/centroids), allowing robust implementation without constructing explicitly cut-cell polytopes. The method supports steady (Poisson) and unsteady (diffusion) regimes and incorporates Dirichlet, Neumann, Robin boundary conditions and general jumps. We validate the scheme on one-, two- and three-dimensional single-phase and two-phase benchmarks, including curved embedded boundaries, Robin conditions and strong property/jump contrasts. The results demonstrate a superlinear convergence behavior, sharp enforcement of interfacial laws and excellent conservation properties. Extensions to moving interfaces and Stefan-type free-boundary problems are natural perspectives of this framework.</description>
