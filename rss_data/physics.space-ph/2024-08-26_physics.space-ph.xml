      <title>Ultrafast measurement of field-particle energy transfer during chorus emissions in space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chorus is one of the strongest electromagnetic emissions naturally occurring in space, and can cause hazardous radiations to humans and satellites1-3. Although chorus has attracted extreme interest and been intensively studied for decades4-7, its generation and evolution remain highly debated, due to the complexity of the underlying physics and the limited capacity of previous spacecraft missions7. Chorus has also been believed to be governed by planetary magnetic dipolar fields5,7. Contrary to such conventional expectation, here we report unexpected observations of chorus in the terrestrial neutral sheet where magnetic dipolar effect is absent. Using unprecedentedly high-cadence data from the Magnetospheric Multiscale Mission, we present the first, ultrafast measurements of the wave dispersion relation and electron three-dimensional distributions within the waves, showing smoking-gun evidences for chorus-electron interactions and development of electron holes in the wave phase space. We estimate field-particle energy transfer inside the waves and find that the waves were extracting energy from local thermal electrons, in line with the wave positive growth rate derived from instability analysis. Our observations, opening new pathways for resolving long-standing controversies regarding the chorus emissions, are crucial for understanding nonlinear energy transport ubiquitously observed in space and astrophysical environments.</description>

      <title>Stratified Resistive Tearing Instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Resistive tearing instabilities are common in fluids that are highly electrically conductive and carry strong currents. We determine the effect of stable stratification on the tearing instability under the Boussinesq approximation. Our results generalise previous work that considered only specific parameter regimes, and we show that the length scale of the fastest growing mode depends non-monotonically on the stratification strength. We confirm our analytical results by solving the linearised equations numerically, and we discuss whether the instability could operate in the solar tachocline.</description>

      <title>BxC Toolkit: Generating Tailored Turbulent 3D Magnetic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09587v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Turbulent states are ubiquitous in plasmas and the understanding of turbulence is fundamental in modern astrophysics. Numerical simulations, which are the state-of-the-art approach to the study of turbulence, require substantial computing resources. Recently, attention shifted to methods for generating synthetic turbulent magnetic fields, affordably creating fields with parameter-controlled characteristic features of turbulence. In this context, the BxC toolkit was developed and validated against direct numerical simulations (DNS) of isotropic turbulent magnetic fields. Here, we demonstrate novel extensions of BxC to generate realistic turbulent magnetic fields in a fast, controlled, geometric approach. First, we perform a parameter study to determine quantitative relations between the BxC input parameters and desired characteristic features of the turbulent power spectrum, such as the extent of the inertial range, its spectral slope, and the injection and dissipation scale. Second, we introduce in the model a set of structured background magnetic fields B0, as a natural and more realistic extension to the purely isotropic turbulent fields. Third, we extend the model to include anisotropic turbulence properties in the generated fields. With all these extensions combined, our tool can quickly generate any desired structured magnetic field with controlled, anisotropic turbulent fluctuations, faster by orders of magnitude with respect to DNSs. These can be used, e.g., to provide initial conditions for DNS simulations or easily generate synthetic data for many astrophysical settings, all at otherwise unaffordable resolutions.</description>
