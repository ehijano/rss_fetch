      <title>Malliavin Calculus for the one-dimensional Stochastic Stefan Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the one-dimensional outer stochastic Stefan problem with reflection which models the short-time prediction of the price or spread of one volatile asset traded in a financial market. The problem admits maximal solutions as long as the velocity of the moving boundary stays bounded, [3,6,7]. We apply Malliavin calculus on the transformed equation and prove first that its maximal solution u has continuous paths a.s. In the case of the unreflected problem, the previous enables localization of a proper approximating sequence of the maximal solution. Then, we derive there locally the differentiability of maximal $u$ in the Malliavin sense. The novelty of this work, apart from the derivation of continuity of the paths for the maximal solution with reflection, is that for the unreflected case we introduce a localization argument on maximal solutions and define efficiently the relevant sample space. More precisely, we present a methodology suitable for the proof of the expected local only (in the sample space) existence of the Malliavin derivative.</description>

      <title>$\alpha$-stable L\'evy processes entering the half space or a slab</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent fluctuation identities for $\alpha$-stable L\'evy processes have decomposed paths using generalised spherical polar coordinates revealing an underlying Markov Additive Process (MAP) for which a more advanced form of excursion theory can be exploited. Inspired by this approach, we give a different decomposition of the $d$-dimensional isotropic $\alpha$-stable L\'evy processes in terms of orthogonal coordinates. Accordingly we are able to develop a number of $n$-tuple laws for first entrance into a half-space. We also numerically construct the law of first entry of the process into a slab of the form $(-1, 1)\times \mathbb{R}^{d-1}$ using a walk-on-half-spaces Monte Carlo approach.</description>

      <title>Complete corrected formula for generating functions of the hypergeometric distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hypergeometric distribution is a popular distribution, whose properties have been extensively investigated. Generating functions of this distribution, such as the probability-generating function, the moment-generating function, and the characteristic function, are known to involve the Gauss hypergeometric function. We elucidate that the existing formula of generating functions is incomplete and provide the corrected formula. In view of the utility and applicability of the hypergeometric distribution, the exact and correct foundation is crucially important.</description>

      <title>Limit fluctuations of stationary measures of totally asymmetric simple exclusion processes with open boundaries on the coexistence line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterize limit fluctuations of height functions of the totally asymmetric simple exclusion processes with open boundaries at the co-existence line under the stationary measures. The limit behavior of the height functions at the co-existence line was known to be exotic in the sense that the first-order limit theorem (when divided by $n$) has a random limit. Here, we show that with a random centering and then divided by $\sqrt n$, the second-order limit of the height functions is a (random) mixture of two independent Brownian motions.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics of the overlap distribution of branching Brownian motion at high temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At high temperature, the overlap of two particles chosen independently according to the Gibbs measure of the branching Brownian motion converges to zero as time goes to infinity. We investigate the precise decay rate of the probability to obtain an overlap greater than $a$, for some $a&gt;0$, in the whole subcritical phase of inverse temperatures $\beta \in [0,\beta_c)$. Moreover, we study this probability both conditionally on the branching Brownian motion and non-conditionally. Two sub-phases of inverse temperatures appear, but surprisingly the threshold is not the same in both cases.</description>

      <title>Interplay between local and global order controls bifurcations in nonreciprocal systems without a conservation law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We elucidate the generic bifurcation behavior of local and global order in short-range interacting nonreciprocal lattice systems without conservation laws. We show that a critical magnitude of nearest-neighbor correlations within the respective lattices controls the emergence of coherent oscillations of global order as a result of frustration. Local order is maintained during these oscillations, implying non-trivial spatio-temporal correlations. Ghost states emerge in the strong-interaction regime. The residence time in either of these states eventually diverges, giving rise to ordered non-equilibrium steady states via a saddle-node-infinite-period bifurcation. Our work provides a comprehensive microscopic understanding of collective phenomena in nonreciprocal matter without conservation laws, which may be relevant e.g. for understanding enzyme clustering.</description>

      <title>Importance Corrected Neural JKO Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In order to sample from an unnormalized probability density function, we propose to combine continuous normalizing flows (CNFs) with rejection-resampling steps based on importance weights. We relate the iterative training of CNFs with regularized velocity fields to a JKO scheme and prove convergence of the involved velocity fields to the velocity field of the Wasserstein gradient flow (WGF). The alternation of local flow steps and non-local rejection-resampling steps allows to overcome local minima or slow convergence of the WGF for multimodal distributions. Since the proposal of the rejection step is generated by the model itself, they do not suffer from common drawbacks of classical rejection schemes. The arising model can be trained iteratively, reduces the reverse Kulback-Leibler (KL) loss function in each step, allows to generate iid samples and moreover allows for evaluations of the generated underlying density. Numerical examples show that our method yields accurate results on various test distributions including high-dimensional multimodal targets and outperforms the state of the art in almost all cases significantly.</description>

      <title>Design and inference for multi-arm clinical trials with informational borrowing: the interacting urns design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper deals with a new design methodology for stratified comparative experiments based on interacting reinforced urn systems. The key idea is to model the interaction between urns for borrowing information across strata and to use it in the design phase in order to i) enhance the information exchange at the beginning of the study, when only few subjects have been enrolled and the stratum-specific information on treatments' efficacy could be scarce, ii) let the information sharing adaptively evolves via a reinforcement mechanism based on the observed outcomes, for skewing at each step the allocations towards the stratum-specific most promising treatment and iii) make the contribution of the strata with different treatment efficacy vanishing as the stratum information grows. In particular, we introduce the Interacting Urns Design, namely a new Covariate-Adjusted Response-Adaptive procedure, that randomizes the treatment allocations according to the evolution of the urn system. The theoretical properties of this proposal are described and the corresponding asymptotic inference is provided. Moreover, by a functional central limit theorem, we obtain the asymptotic joint distribution of the Wald-type sequential test statistics, which allows to sequentially monitor the suggested design in the clinical practice.</description>

      <title>Orthodiagonal Maps, Tilings of Rectangles, and their Convergence to Conformal Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A classic result of Brooks, Smith, Stone and Tutte \cite{BSST40} associates to any finite planar network with distinguished source and sink vertices, a tiling of a rectangle by smaller subrectangles whose aspect ratios are given by the conductances of corresponding edges in the network. This tiling can be viewed as a discrete analogue of the uniformizing conformal map that maps a simply connected domain with four distinguished prime ends to a rectangle, so that the four prime ends are mapped to the four corners of the rectangle. We make this intuition precise by showing that if $\Omega$ is a simply connected domain with four distinguished prime ends $A,B,C,D$ in counterclockwise order and $(\Omega_{n})_{n\geq{1}}$ is a sequence of orthodiagonal maps with distinguished boundary vertices $A_{n}, B_{n}, C_{n}, D_{n}$ in counterclockwise order, that are finer and finer approximations of $\Omega$ with its distinguished boundary points $A,B,C,D$, then the corresponding "rectangle tiling maps" converge uniformly on compacts to the aforementioned conformal map on $\Omega$.</description>

      <title>Comparative Analyses of the Type D ASEP: Stochastic Fusion and Crystal Bases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Type D asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP) is a particle system involving two classes of particles that can be viewed from both a probabilistic and an algebraic perspective (arXiv:2011.13473). From a probabilistic perspective, we perform stochastic fusion on the Type D ASEP and analyze the outcome on generator matrices, limits of drift speed, stationary distributions, and Markov self-duality. From an algebraic perspective, we construct a fused Type D ASEP system from a Casimir element of $U_q(so_6)$, using crystal bases to analyze and manipulate various representations of $U_q(so_6)$. We conclude that both approaches produce different processes and therefore the previous method of arXiv:1908.02359, which analyzed the usual ASEP, does not generalize to all finite-dimensional simple Lie algebras.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1901.04086v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Here I prove non-central limit theorems for non-linear functionals of vector valued stationary random fields under appropriate conditions. They are the multivariate versions of the results in paper\cite{2}. Previously A. M. Arcones formulated a theorem in paper\cite{1} which can be considered as the multivariate generalization of these results. But I found Arcones' discussion incomplete, and in my opinion to give a complete proof first a more profound foundation of the theory of vector valued Gaussian stationary random fields has to be worked out. This was done in my paper\cite{4} which enabled me to adapt the method in paper\cite{2} to the study of the vector valued case. Here I prove with its help the desired multivariate version of the results in paper\cite{2}.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic Limits of non-Markovian Interacting Particle Systems on Sparse Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.01587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.01587v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider an interacting particle system indexed by the vertices of a (possibly random) locally finite graph whose vertices and edges are equipped with marks representing parameters of the model such as the environment and initial conditions. Each particle takes values in a countable state space and evolves according to a pure jump process whose jump intensities depend on only the states (or histories) and marks of itself and particles and edges in its neighborhood. Under mild conditions, it is shown that if the sequence of (marked) interaction graphs converges locally in probability to a limit (marked) graph that satisfies a certain finite dissociability property, then the corresponding sequence of empirical measures of the particle trajectories converges weakly to the law of the marginal dynamics at the root vertex of the limit graph. The proof of this limit relies on several results of independent interest. First, such interacting particle systems are shown to be well-posed on almost surely finitely dissociable graphs, which include graphs of maximal bounded degree and any Galton-Watson tree whose offspring distribution has a finite first moment. A counterexample is provided to show that well-posedness can fail for dynamics on graphs outside this class. Second, the dynamics on a locally convergent sequence of graphs are shown to converge in the local weak sense to the dynamics on the limit graph when the latter is finitely dissociable. Finally, the dynamics are also shown to exhibit an (annealed) asymptotic correlation decay property. These results complement recent work that establishes hydrodynamic limits of locally interacting probabilistic cellular automata and diffusions on sparse random graphs. However, the analysis of jump processes requires very different techniques, including percolation arguments and notions such as (consistent) spatial localization and causal chains.</description>

      <title>Critical Exponents for Marked Random Connection Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.07398v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Here we prove critical exponents for Random Connections Models (RCMs) with random marks. The vertices are given by a marked Poisson point process on $\mathbb{R}^d$ and an edge exists between any pair of vertices independently with a probability depending upon their spatial displacement and on their respective marks. Given conditions on the edge probabilities, we prove mean-field lower bounds for the susceptibility and percolation functions. In particular, we prove the equality of the susceptibility and percolation critical intensities. If we assume that a form of the triangle condition holds, then we also prove that the susceptibility, percolation and cluster tail critical exponents exist and take their mean-field values. Our proof approach adapts the differential inequality and magnetization function approaches that have been previously applied to discrete homogeneous settings to our continuum marked setting. This includes a proof of the analyticity of the magnetization function in the required parameter regime.</description>

      <title>Random subsets of Cantor sets generated by trees of coin flips</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.04569v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a natural way to construct a random subset of a homogeneous Cantor set $C$ in $[0,1]$ via random labelings of an infinite $M$-ary tree, where $M\geq 2$. The Cantor set $C$ is the attractor of an equicontractive iterated function system $\{f_1,\dots,f_N\}$ that satisfies the open set condition with $(0,1)$ as the open set. For a fixed probability vector $(p_1,\dots,p_N)$, each edge in the infinite $M$-ary tree is independently labeled $i$ with probability $p_i$, for $i=1,2,\dots,N$. Thus, each infinite path in the tree receives a random label sequence of numbers from $\{1,2,\dots,N\}$. We define $F$ to be the (random) set of those points $x\in C$ which have a coding that is equal to the label sequence of some infinite path starting at the root of the tree.
  The set $F$ may be viewed as a statistically self-similar set with extreme overlaps, and as such, its Hausdorff and box-counting dimensions coincide. We prove non-trivial upper and lower bounds for this dimension, and obtain the exact dimension in a few special cases. For instance, when $M=N$ and $p_i=1/N$ for each $i$, we show that $F$ is almost surely of full Hausdorff dimension in $C$ but of zero Hausdorff measure in its dimension.
  For the case of two maps and a binary tree, we also consider deterministic labelings of the tree where, for a fixed integer $m\geq 2$, every $m$th edge is labeled $1$, and compute the exact Hausdorff dimension of the resulting subset of $C$.</description>

      <title>Obliquely reflecting Brownian motion in nonpolyhedral, piecewise smooth cones, with an example of application to diffusion approximation of bandwidth sharing queues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.06745v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work gives sufficient conditions for uniqueness in law of semimartingale, obliquely reflecting Brownian motion in a nonpolyhedral, piecewise ${\cal C}^2$ cone, with radially constant, Lipschitz continuous direction of reflection on each face.
  The conditions are shown to be verified by the conjectured diffusion approximation to the workload in a class of bandwidth sharing networks, thus ensuring that the conjectured limit is uniquely characterized. This is a key step in proving the diffusion approximation.
  This uniqueness result is made possible by replacing the Krein-Rutman theorem used by Kwon and Williams (1993) in a smooth cone with the recent reverse ergodic theorem for inhomogeneous, killed Markov chains of Costantini and Kurtz (2024).</description>

      <title>Scaling limit of multi-type invariant measures via the directed landscape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.09284v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the large scale limits of multi-type invariant distributions and Busemann functions of planar stochastic growth models in the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) class. We identify a set of sufficient hypotheses for convergence of multi-type invariant measures of last-passage percolation (LPP) models to the stationary horizon (SH), which is the unique multi-type stationary measure of the KPZ fixed point. Our limit theorem utilizes conditions that are expected to hold broadly in the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang class, including convergence of the scaled last-passage process to the directed landscape. We verify these conditions for the six exactly solvable models whose scaled bulk versions converge to the directed landscape, as shown by Dauvergne and Vir\'ag. We also present a second, more general, convergence theorem with potential future applications to polymer models and particle systems. Our paper is the first to show convergence to the SH without relying on information about the structure of the multi-type invariant measures of the prelimit models. These results are consistent with the conjecture that the SH is the universal scaling limit of multi-type invariant measures in the KPZ class.</description>

      <title>Tightness and weak convergence in the topology of local uniform convergence for stochastic processes in the dual of a nuclear space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.04612v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\Phi'$ denote the strong dual of a nuclear space $\Phi$ and let $C_{\infty}(\Phi')$ be the collection of all continuous mappings $x:[0,\infty) \rightarrow \Phi'$ equipped with the topology of local uniform convergence. In this paper we prove sufficient conditions for tightness of probability measures on $C_{\infty}(\Phi')$ and for weak convergence in $C_{\infty}(\Phi')$ for a sequence of $\Phi'$-valued processes. We illustrate our results with two applications. First, we show the central limit theorem for local martingales taking values in the dual of an ultrabornological nuclear space. Second, we prove sufficient conditions for the weak convergence in $C_{\infty}(\Phi')$ for a sequence of solutions to stochastic partial differential equations driven by semimartingale noise.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12281v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate an analogue of the irreducible convex paving in the context of generalised convexity. Consider two Radon probability measures $\mu,\nu$ ordered with respect to a cone $\mathcal{F}$ of functions on $\Omega$ stable under maxima. Under the assumption that any $\mathcal{F}$-transport between $\mu$ and $\nu$ is local, we establish the existence of the finest partitioning of $\Omega$, depending only on $\mu,\nu$ and the cone $\mathcal{F}$, into $\mathcal{F}$-convex sets, called irreducible components, such that any $\mathcal{F}$-transport between $\mu$ and $\nu$ must adhere to this partitioning.
  Furthermore, we demonstrate that a set, whose sections are contained in the corresponding irreducible components, is a polar set with respect to all $\mathcal{F}$-transports between $\mu$ and $\nu$ if and only if it is a polar set with respect to all transports. This provides an affirmative answer to a generalisation of a conjecture proposed by Ob{\l}\'oj and Siorpaes regarding polar sets in the martingale transport setting.
  Among our contributions is also a generalisation of the Strassen's theorem to the setting of generalised convexity</description>

Abstract: We present a range of applications of localisation for constrained transports for pairs of probability measures in order with respect to a lattice cone.
  These examples comprise irreducible convex paving for martingale transports in infinite-dimensional spaces, irreducible convex paving for submartingale transports, localisation of the Monge--Kantorovich problem, pavings for harmonic transports, pavings for solutions of martingale problems.
  Furthermore, we consider approximating martingale transports and characterise the polar sets in this setting, identifying them as the trivial polar sets -- the sets whose projections have vanishing measures. This provides a negative answer to a question of Cox</description>

      <title>Coarse embeddability, $L^1$-compression and Percolations on General Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04222v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that a locally finite, connected graph has a coarse embedding into a Hilbert space if and only if there exist bond percolations with arbitrarily large marginals and two-point function vanishing at infinity. We further show that the decay of the two-point function is stretched exponential with stretching exponent $\alpha\in[0,1]$ if and only if the $L^1$-compression exponent of the graph is at least $\alpha$, leading to a probabilistic characterization of this exponent. These results are new even in the particular setting of Cayley graphs of finitely generated groups. The proofs build on new probabilistic methods introduced recently by the authors to study group-invariant percolation on Cayley graphs [25,26], which are now extended to the general, non-symmetric situation of graphs to study their coarse embeddability and $L^1$-compression exponents.</description>

      <title>Zigzag path connects two Monte Carlo samplers: Hamiltonian counterpart to a piecewise deterministic Markov process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.07694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2104.07694v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Zigzag and other piecewise deterministic Markov process samplers have attracted significant interest for their non-reversibility and other appealing properties for Bayesian posterior computation. Hamiltonian Monte Carlo is another state-of-the-art sampler, exploiting fictitious momentum to guide Markov chains through complex target distributions. We establish an important connection between the zigzag sampler and a variant of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo based on Laplace-distributed momentum. The position and velocity component of the corresponding Hamiltonian dynamics travels along a zigzag path paralleling the Markovian zigzag process; however, the dynamics is non-Markovian in this position-velocity space as the momentum component encodes non-immediate pasts. This information is partially lost during a momentum refreshment step, in which we preserve its direction but re-sample magnitude. In the limit of increasingly frequent momentum refreshments, we prove that Hamiltonian zigzag converges strongly to its Markovian counterpart. This theoretical insight suggests that, when retaining full momentum information, Hamiltonian zigzag can better explore target distributions with highly correlated parameters by suppressing the diffusive behavior of Markovian zigzag. We corroborate this intuition by comparing performance of the two zigzag cousins on high-dimensional truncated multivariate Gaussians, including a 11,235-dimensional target arising from a Bayesian phylogenetic multivariate probit modeling of HIV virus data.</description>

      <title>Fair Incentives for Repeated Engagement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.00002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.00002v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a decision-maker's problem of finding optimal monetary incentive schemes for retention when faced with agents whose participation decisions (stochastically) depend on the incentive they receive. Our focus is on policies constrained to fulfill two fairness properties that preclude outcomes wherein different groups of agents experience different treatment on average. We formulate the problem as a high-dimensional stochastic optimization problem, and study it through the use of a closely related deterministic variant. We show that the optimal static solution to this deterministic variant is asymptotically optimal for the dynamic problem under fairness constraints. Though solving for the optimal static solution gives rise to a non-convex optimization problem, we uncover a structural property that allows us to design a tractable, fast-converging heuristic policy. Traditional schemes for retention ignore fairness constraints; indeed, the goal in these is to use differentiation to incentivize repeated engagement with the system. Our work (i) shows that even in the absence of explicit discrimination, dynamic policies may unintentionally discriminate between agents of different types by varying the type composition of the system, and (ii) presents an asymptotically optimal policy to avoid such discriminatory outcomes.</description>

      <title>A Restless Bandit Model for Dynamic Ride Matching with Reneging Travelers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.12431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.12431v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies a large-scale ride-matching problem with a large number of travelers who are either drivers with vehicles or riders looking for sharing vehicles. Drivers can match riders that have similar itineraries and share the same vehicle; and reneging travelers, who become impatient and leave the service system after waiting a long time for shared rides, are considered in our model. The aim is to maximize the long-run average revenue of the ride service vendor, which is defined as the difference between the long-run average reward earned by providing ride services and the long-run average penalty incurred by reneging travelers. The problem is complicated by its scale, the heterogeneity of travelers (in terms of origins, destinations, and travel preferences), and the reneging behaviors. To this end, we formulate the ride-matching problem as a specific Markov decision process and propose a scalable ride-matching policy, referred to as Bivariate Index (BI) policy. The BI policy prioritizes travelers according to a ranking of their bivariate indices, which we prove, in a special case, leads to an optimal policy to the relaxed version of the ride-matching problem. For the general case, through extensive numerical simulations for systems with real-world travel demands, it is demonstrated that the BI policy significantly outperforms baseline policies.</description>

      <title>Central limit theorem on CAT(0) spaces with contracting isometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.11648v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a group with a non-elementary action on a proper CAT(0) space $X$, and let $\mu$ be a measure on $G$ such that the random walk $(Z_n)_n$ generated by $\mu$ has finite second moment on $X$. Let $o$ be a basepoint in $X$, and assume that there exists a rank one isometry in $G$. We prove that in this context, $(Z_n o )_n$ satisfies a Central Limit Theorem, namely that the random variables $\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}(d(Z_n o, o) - n \lambda) $ converge in law to a non-degenerate Gaussian distribution $N_\mu$, for $\lambda$ the (positive) drift of the random walk. The strategy relies on the use of hyperbolic models introduced by H. Petyt, A. Zalloum and D. Spriano, which are analogues of curve graphs and cubical hyperplanes for the class of CAT(0) spaces. As a side result, we prove that the probability that the nth-step $Z_n$ acts on $X$ as a contracting isometry goes to 1 as $n$ goes to infinity.</description>

      <title>Buffon-Laplace Needle Problem as a geometric probabilistic approach to filtration process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06670v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Buffon-Laplace Needle Problem considers a needle of a length $l$ randomly dropped on a large plane distributed with vertically parallel lines with distances $a$ and $b$ ($a \geqslant b$), respectively. As a classical problem in stochastic probability, it serves as a mathematical basis of various physical literature, such as the efficiency of a filter and the emergence of clogging in filtration process. Yet its potential application is limited by previous focus on its original form of the `short' needle case of $l &lt; b$ and its analytical difficulty in a general sense. Here, rather than a `short' two-dimensional needle, we analytically solve the problems with two- and three-dimensional needles and spherocylinders of arbitrary length and radius dropped on a grid with any rectangular shape. We further confirm our analytical theory with Monte Carlo simulation. Our framework here helps to provide a geometric analytical perspective to filtration process, and also extend the analytical power of the needle problem into unexplored parameter regions for physical problems involving stochastic processes.</description>

      <title>A stochastic perturbation approach to nonlinear bifurcating problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16803v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Incorporating probabilistic terms in mathematical models is crucial for capturing and quantifying uncertainties of real-world systems. However, stochastic models typically require large computational resources to produce meaningful statistics. For such reason, the development of reduction techniques becomes essential for enabling efficient and scalable simulations of complex scenarios while quantifying the underlying uncertainties. In this work, we study the accuracy of Polynomial Chaos (PC) surrogate expansion of the probability space on a bifurcating phenomena in fluid dynamics, namely the Coand\u{a} effect. In particular, we propose a novel non-deterministic approach to generic bifurcation problems, where the stochastic setting gives a different perspective on the non-uniqueness of the solution, also avoiding expensive simulations for many instances of the parameter. Thus, starting from the formulation of the Spectral Stochastic Finite Element Method (SSFEM), we extend the methodology to deal with solutions of a bifurcating problem, by working with a perturbed version of the deterministic model. We discuss the link between the deterministic and the stochastic bifurcation diagram, highlighting the surprising capability of PC polynomials coefficients of giving insights on the deterministic solution manifold.</description>

      <title>Analyticity for locally stable hard-core gases via recursion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04451v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In their recent works [Comm. Math. Phys. 399:1 (2023)] and [arXiv:2109.01094], Michelen and Perkins proved that the pressure of a system of particles with repulsive pair interactions is analytic for activities up to $e\Delta_{\phi}(\beta)^{-1}$, where $\Delta_{\phi}(\beta)\in(0,C_{\phi}(\beta)]$ is a constant they called the potential-weighted connective constant. This paper extends their method to locally stable, tempered, and hard-core pair potentials. Our main result is that the pressure of such a system is analytic for activities up to $e^{2-2W(eA_{\phi}(\beta)/\Delta_{\phi}(\beta))}\Delta_{\phi}(\beta)^{-1}e^{-(\beta C+1)}$, where $C\ge0$ is the local stability constant, $W(\cdot)$ the Lambert $W$-function, $A_{\phi}(\beta)$ the contribution from the attraction in the pair potential to the temperedness constant, and $\Delta_{\phi}(\beta)\in[A_{\phi}(\beta),C_{\phi}(\beta)]$ a counterpart of the constant defined by Michelen and Perkins. The main ingredients in the proof include a recursive identity for the one-point density tailored to locally stable hard-core potentials and a corresponding notion of modulations of an activity function. In the high-temperature regime, our result surpasses the classical Penrose-Ruelle bound of $C_{\phi}(\beta)^{-1}e^{-(\beta C+1)}$ by at least a factor of $e^{2}$.</description>
