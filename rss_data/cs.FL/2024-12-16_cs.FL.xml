      <title>Congruence-based Learning of Probabilistic Deterministic Finite Automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work studies the question of learning probabilistic deterministic automata from language models. For this purpose, it focuses on analyzing the relations defined on algebraic structures over strings by equivalences and similarities on probability distributions. We introduce a congruence that extends the classical Myhill-Nerode congruence for formal languages. This new congruence is the basis for defining regularity over language models. We present an active learning algorithm that computes the quotient with respect to this congruence whenever the language model is regular. The paper also defines the notion of recognizability for language models and shows that it coincides with regularity for congruences. For relations which are not congruences, it shows that this is not the case. Finally, it discusses the impact of this result on learning in the context of language models.</description>

      <title>Simulating Hard Attention Using Soft Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study conditions under which transformers using soft attention can simulate hard attention, that is, effectively focus all attention on a subset of positions. First, we examine several variants of linear temporal logic, whose formulas have been previously been shown to be computable using hard attention transformers. We demonstrate how soft attention transformers can compute formulas of these logics using unbounded positional embeddings or temperature scaling. Second, we demonstrate how temperature scaling allows softmax transformers to simulate a large subclass of average-hard attention transformers, those that have what we call the uniform-tieless property.</description>

      <title>Language Inclusion for Boundedly-Ambiguous Vector Addition Systems is Decidable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.08033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.08033v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problems of language inclusion and language equivalence for Vector Addition Systems with States (VASSes) with the acceptance condition defined by the set of accepting states (and more generally by some upward-closed conditions). In general the problem of language equivalence is undecidable even for one-dimensional VASSes, thus to get decidability we investigate restricted subclasses. On one hand we show that the problem of language inclusion of a VASS in k-ambiguous VASS (for any natural k) is decidable and even in Ackermann. On the other hand we prove that the language equivalence problem is Ackermann-hard already for deterministic VASSes. These two results imply Ackermann-completeness for language inclusion and equivalence in several possible restrictions. Some of our techniques can be also applied in much broader generality in infinite-state systems, namely for some subclass of well-structured transition systems.</description>

      <title>Languages given by Finite Automata over the Unary Alphabet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.06435v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the complexity of operations on finite automata and the complexity of their decision problems when the alphabet is unary. Let $n$ denote the maximum of the number of states of the input finite automata considered in the corresponding results. The following main results are obtained:
  (1) Given two unary NFAs recognising $L$ and $H$, respectively, one can decide whether $L \subseteq H$ as well as whether $L = H$ in time $2^{O((n \log n)^{1/3})}$. The previous upper bound on time was $2^{O((n \log n)^{1/2})}$ as given by Chrobak (1986), and this bound was not significantly improved since then.
  (2) Given two unary UFAs (unambiguous finite automata) recognising $L$ and $H$, respectively, one can determine a UFA recognising $L \cup H$ and a UFA recognising complement of $L$, where these output UFAs have the number of states bounded by a quasipolynomial in $n$. However, in the worst case, a UFA for recognising concatenation of languages recognised by two $n$-state UFAs, uses $2^{\Theta((n \log^2 n)^{1/3})}$ states.
  (3) Given a unary language $L$, if $L$ contains the word of length $k$, then let $L(k)=1$ else let $L(k)=0$. Let $\omega_L$ be the $\omega$-word $L(0)L(1)\ldots$ and let $\cal L$ be a fixed $\omega$-regular language. The last section studies how difficult it is to decide, given an $n$-state UFA or NFA</description>

      <title>Positional $\omega$-regular languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15384v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the context of two-player games over graphs, a language $L$ is called positional if, in all games using $L$ as winning objective, the protagonist can play optimally using positional strategies, that is, strategies that do not depend on the history of the play. In this work, we describe the class of parity automata recognising positional languages, providing a complete characterisation of positionality for $\omega$-regular languages. As corollaries, we establish decidability of positionality in polynomial time, finite-to-infinite and 1-to-2-players lifts, and show the closure under union of prefix-independent positional objectives, answering a conjecture by Kopczy\'nski in the $\omega$-regular case.</description>

      <title>One-dimensional cellular automata with a unique active transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03601v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A one-dimensional cellular automaton $\tau : A^\mathbb{Z} \to A^\mathbb{Z}$ is a transformation of the full shift defined via a finite neighborhood $S \subset \mathbb{Z}$ and a local function $\mu : A^S \to A$. We study the family of cellular automata whose finite neighborhood $S$ is an interval containing $0$, and there exists a pattern $p \in A^S$ satisfying that $\mu(z) = z(0)$ if and only if $z \neq p$; this means that these cellular automata have a unique \emph{active transition}. Despite its simplicity, this family presents interesting and subtle problems, as the behavior of the cellular automaton completely depends on the structure of $p$. We show that every cellular automaton $\tau$ with a unique active transition $p \in A^S$ is either idempotent or strictly almost equicontinuous, and we completely characterize each one of these situations in terms of $p$. In essence, the idempotence of $\tau$ depends on the existence of a certain subpattern of $p$ with a translational symmetry.</description>
