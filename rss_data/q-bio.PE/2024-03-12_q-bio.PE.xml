      <title>Repetitive Infection Spreading and Directed Evolution in the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Susceptible Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study two simple mathematical models of the epidemic. At first, we study the repetitive infection spreading in a simplified SIRS model including the effect of the decay of the acquired immune. The model is an intermediate model of the SIRS model including the recruitment and death terms and the SIR model in which the recovered population is assumed to be never infected again. When the decay rate \delta of the immune is sufficiently small, the multiple infection spreading occurs in spikes. The model equation can be reduced to be a map when the decay rate \delta is sufficiently small, and the spike-like multiple infection spreading is reproduced in the mapping. The period-doubling bifurcation and chaos are found in the simplified SIRS model with seasonal variation. The nonlinear phenomena are reproduced by the map. Next, we study coupled SIRS equations for the directed evolution where the mutation is expressed with a diffusion-type term. A kind of reaction-diffusion equation is derived by the continuum approximation for the infected population I. The reaction-diffusion equation with the linear dependence of infection rate on the type space has an exact Gaussian solution with a time-dependent average and variance. The propagation of the Gaussian pulse corresponds to the successive transitions of the dominant variant.</description>

      <title>Effects of diffusion and advection on predator prey dynamics in an advective patchy environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a specialist predator-prey patchy model over the closed stream network. We study the dynamics and the asymptotic profiles of positive steady states according to the mortality rate of the specialist predators, advection and diffusion rates. We verify that the specialist predators can successfully invade as long as the mortality rate is sufficiently small. On the other hand, the impacts of diffusion and advection on the asymptotic profiles of positive steady states and on the concentration of the species are given.</description>

      <title>Neutral Diversity in Experimental Metapopulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.06393v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: New automated and high-throughput methods allow the manipulation and selection of numerous bacterial populations. In this manuscript we are interested in the neutral diversity patterns that emerge from such a setup in which many bacterial populations are grown in parallel serial transfers, in some cases with population-wide extinction and splitting events. We model bacterial growth by a birth-death process and use the theory of coalescent point processes. We show that there is a dilution factor that optimises the expected amount of neutral diversity for a given amount of cycles, and study the power law behaviour of the mutation frequency spectrum for different experimental regimes. We also explore how neutral variation diverges between two recently split populations by establishing a new formula for the expected number of shared and private mutations. Finally, we show the interest of such a setup to select a phenotype of interest that requires multiple mutations.</description>

      <title>Limit theorems for the site frequency spectrum of neutral mutations in an exponentially growing population</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.03346v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The site frequency spectrum (SFS) is a widely used summary statistic of genomic data. Motivated by recent evidence for the role of neutral evolution in cancer, we investigate the SFS of neutral mutations in an exponentially growing population. Using branching process techniques, we establish (first-order) almost sure convergence results for the SFS of a Galton-Watson process, evaluated either at a fixed time or at the stochastic time at which the population first reaches a certain size. We finally use our results to construct consistent estimators for the extinction probability and the effective mutation rate of a birth-death process.</description>

      <title>Effects of heterogeneous opinion interactions in many-agent systems for epidemic dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08262v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we define a kinetic model for understanding the impact of heterogeneous opinion formation dynamics on epidemics. The considered many-agent system is characterized by nonsymmetric interactions which define a coupled system of kinetic equations for the evolution of the opinion density in each compartment. In the quasi-invariant limit we may show positivity and uniqueness of the solution of the problem together with its convergence towards an equilibrium distribution exhibiting bimodal shape. The tendency of the system towards opinion clusters is further analyzed by means of numerical methods, which confirm the consistency of the kinetic model with its moment system whose evolution is approximated in several regimes of parameters.</description>
