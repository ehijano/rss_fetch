      <title>The affect of Some Meteorological Parameters on Particulate Matters Concentration Over Iraq using Remote Sensing dataset</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10285v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Numerous countries have built urban stations for monitoring the amount of PM2.5 in the atmosphere. In Iraq, there aren't enough stations to monitor PM2.5 pollution levels across all governorates. As a result, satellite remote sensing data is used in the majority of studies aimed at monitoring PM2.5 and the impact of other factors on it. The current study aimed to analyze the spatial and temporal distribution of (PM2.5) and its relationship with the meteorological parameters.(Air temperature, Relative humidity, Precipitation and wind speed) in Iraq during two periods (2001 and 2022). The dataset adopted in the study were downloaded from the Giovanni user interface which is based on satellite remote sensing data and reanalysis by MERRA-2model which produce by NASA. The output results shows that, the seasonal and annual PM2.5 concentration values increased from 2001 to 2022 due especially in the center and south of Iraq with the highest values of PM2.5 concentration recorded in the summers of 2001 and 2022 being 172.41 micro.g/m3 and 190.06 micro.g/m3 (increased 10.24%), respectively. Because of the low average temperature and the influence of northeasterly winds bringing continental air from Central Asia, PM2.5 values in northern and northeastern Iraq are lower than those in the center and southern regions. in 2001, they ranged from 8.41 to 12.6 micro.g/m3, whereas in 2022, they ranged from 9.02 to 15.98 micro.g/m3 throughout the year. Rainfall during the cold months in the north and northeast is an essential factor in cleaning the air of PM2.5. Also, study results indicate that the max. of PM 2.5 values have consistently exceeded the upper limits of PM2.5 quarterly standards set by both the US and Iraqi regulations, for the years 2001 and 2022, but the min. PM2.5 values are within both standards.</description>

      <title>A continuous data assimilation closure for modeling statistically steady turbulence in large-eddy simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12858v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A closure model is presented for large-eddy simulation (LES) based on the three-dimensional variational data assimilation algorithm. The approach aims at reconstructing high-fidelity kinetic energy spectra in coarse numerical simulations by including feedback control to represent unresolved dynamics interactions in the flow as stochastic processes. The forcing uses statistics obtained from off-line high-fidelity data and requires only few parameters compared to the number of degrees of freedom of LES. This modeling strategy is applied to geostrophic turbulence on the sphere. It proves to accurately recover the energy spectra, the interscale energy transfer and the zonal velocity profiles in the coarse model, for three generic situations.</description>
