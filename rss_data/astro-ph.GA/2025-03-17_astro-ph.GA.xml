      <title>Tentative rotation in a galaxy at z$\sim$14 with ALMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10751v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We re-analysed ALMA observations of the [OIII]$\lambda$88$\mu$m emission line in JADES-GS-z14.0, so far the most distant spectroscopically confirmed galaxy at z=14.18. Our analysis shows a tentative detection of a velocity gradient of [OIII]$\lambda$88$\mu$m using three independent tests: 1) construction of moment maps; 2) extraction of integrated spectra from a grid of apertures; and 3) spectro-astrometry in both the image and uv planes. We performed kinematical fitting using the KinMS code and estimated a dynamical mass of log$_{10}$(M$_{\rm dyn}$/$\rm M_\odot$)= 9.4$^{+0.8}_{-0.4}$, with the bulk of the uncertainties due to the degeneracy between dynamical mass and inclination. We measure an upper limit on the velocity dispersion ($\sigma_{v}$) of $&lt;40~$ km/s~which results in an estimate of V$_{\rm rot}/\sigma&gt;$ 2.5. This result, if confirmed with higher-resolution observations, would imply that kinematically cold discs are already in place at $z\sim14$. Comparison with mock observations from the SERRA cosmological simulations confirms that even low-resolution observations are capable of detecting a velocity gradient in $z&gt;10$ galaxies as compact as JADES-GS-z14.0. This work shows that deeper ALMA or JWST/NIRSpec IFS observations with high spatial resolution will be able to estimate an accurate dynamical mass for JADES-GS-z14.0, providing an upper limit to the stellar mass of this over-luminous galaxy.</description>

      <title>Bloodhound Unleashed: Particle-based Substructure Tracking for Cosmological Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern studies of galaxy formation rely heavily on numerical simulations, which in turn require tools to identify and track self-bound structures in stars and dark matter. In this paper, we present Bloodhound, a new halo tracking algorithm optimized to track and characterize substructure in cosmological simulations, a regime that is crucial for studies of the nature of dark matter but where standard methods often have difficulties. Using simulations of Milky Way-mass haloes, we demonstrate that Bloodhound extends subhalo tracking by $3-4\, \mathrm{Gyr}$ on average, and significantly longer for subhaloes with small pericentres, relative to the widely used ROCKSTAR $+$ consistent-trees halo tracking pipeline. We also show that Bloodhound provides continuous tracking, mitigating an issue for the standard technique where subhaloes can be lost and then found again -- but assigned to a new merger tree -- after several snapshots. This improved tracking leads to a substantially larger number of surviving subhaloes in the inner regions of dark matter haloes, which has several implications for studies of the Milky Way's satellite galaxy system and its use for constraining properties of dark matter. For example, within the radius where current surveys are complete to ultra-faint galaxies ($D_{\rm MW} \lesssim 50$ kpc), Bloodhound finds more than twice as many subhaloes above the atomic cooling scale relative to the standard tracking method. Our results underscore the importance of robust subhalo tracking techniques in advancing our understanding of galaxy formation and cosmological models.</description>

      <title>Extremely iron-poor O-type stars in the Magellanic Bridge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To study stars analogous to those in the early Universe with redshift z &gt; 3, we need to probe environments with low metallicities. Until recently, massive O-type stars with metallicities lower than that of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC, Z &lt; 20%Z_sol) were only known in compact dwarf galaxies. Observations of stars in such distant galaxies (&gt; 1 Mpc) suffer from limited S/N ratios and spatial resolution. Recently, a few O-type stars were identified in the nearby Magellanic Bridge which offers a unique laboratory with low gas density and metal content. We acquired high-resolution HST-COS FUV spectra of two O-type stars in the Magellanic Bridge. Using the UV forest of iron lines from these observations, we aim to precisely measure the inherent iron abundances and determine the metallicity of the stars. Using detailed expanding non-LTE atmosphere models, we generate synthetic spectra for different iron abundances and for a range of microturbulent velocities. We use Bayesian posterior sampling to measure the iron abundance and compute uncertainties based on the possible range of microturbulent velocities.
  The O stars in the Magellanic Bridge have severely sub-SMC Fe abundances, reaching as low as 10.8% and 3.6% Fe_sol. The most Fe-deficient star also shows alpha-enhancement. These stars are the nearest extremely metal-poor O stars discovered to date. Our finding marks the first robust determination of O-star iron abundances in a metallicity regime comparable to dwarf galaxies like Sextans A and Leo P. The iron abundances of the stars do not correlate with their oxygen abundances. Our results highlight the problem of using oxygen-based metallicities. The proximity of the stars in the Bridge combined with their different abundance patterns underlines that the ISM of the Magellanic Bridge must be highly inhomogeneous and is not properly mixed.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Relationship Between Stellar Mass, Metallicity, and Star Formation Rate at $z \sim 2.3$ in KBSS-MOSFIRE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The metal enrichment of a galaxy is determined by the cycle of baryons in outflows, inflows, and star formation. The relative contribution and timescale of each process sets the relationship between stellar mass, metallicity, and the star formation rate (SFR). In the local universe, galaxies evolve in an equilibrium state where the timescales on which SFR and metallicity vary are comparable, and define a surface in mass-metallicity-SFR space known as the Fundamental Metallicity Relation (FMR). However, high-redshift observations suggest that this state of equilibrium may not persist throughout cosmic time. Using galaxies from the Keck Baryonic Structure Survey (KBSS) observed with MOSFIRE, we explore the relationship between stellar mass, gas-phase oxygen abundance, and SFR at $z \sim 2.3$. Across strong-line calibrations and SFR calculation methods, KBSS galaxies are inconsistent with the locally-defined FMR. We use both parametric and non-parametric methods of exploring a mass-metallicity-SFR relation. When using a parametric approach, we find no significant reduction mass-metallicity relation scatter when folding in SFR as a third parameter, although a non-parametric approach reveals that there could be a weak, redshift-dependent anticorrelation between residual gas-phase oxygen abundance, and SFR. Injection-recovery tests show that a significant reduction in scatter requires a stronger anticorrelation between SFR and residual metallicity. Our results suggest that the local FMR may not persist to $z \sim 2.3$, implying that $z \sim 2.3$ galaxies may not be in the equilibrium state described by the FMR and are more similar to higher redshift galaxies.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of self-gravitating fermions as a robust theory for dark matter halos: Stability analysis applied to the Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a framework for dark matter (DM) halo formation based on a kinetic theory of self-gravitating fermions together with a solid connection to thermodynamics. Based on maximum entropy arguments, this approach predicts a most likely phase-space distribution which takes into account the Pauli exclusion principle, relativistic effects, and particle evaporation. The most general equilibrium configurations depend on the particle mass and develop a degenerate compact core embedded in a diluted halo, both linked by their fermionic nature. By applying such a theory to the Milky Way we analyze the stability of different families of equilibrium solutions with implications on the DM distribution and the mass of the DM candidate. We find that stable core-halo profiles, which explain the DM distribution in the Galaxy, exist only in the range $mc^2 \approx 194 - 387\,\rm{keV}$. The lower bound is a consequence of imposing thermodynamical stability on the core-halo solutions having a $4.2\times 10^6 M_\odot$ quantum core mass alternative to the black hole hypothesis at the Galaxy center. The upper bound is solely an outcome of general relativity when the quantum core reaches the Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit and undergoes gravitational collapse towards a black hole. We demonstrate that there exists a set of stable core-halo profiles which are astrophysically relevant in the sense that their total mass is finite, do not suffer from the gravothermal catastrophe, and agree with observations. The morphology of the outer halo tail is described by a polytrope of index $5/2$, developing a sharp decline of the density beyond $25\,\rm{kpc}$ in excellent agreement with the latest Gaia DR3 rotation curve data. Moreover, we obtain a total mass of about $2\times 10^{11} M_\odot$ including baryons and a local DM density of about $0.4\,\rm{GeV}\,c^{-2}\,\rm{cm}^{-3}$ in line with recent independent estimates.</description>

      <title>Dot to dot: high-$z$ little red dots in $M_{\rm bh}$-$M_{\rm \star}$ diagrams with galaxy-morphology-specific scaling relations and nuclear star clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-redshift little red dots (LRDs) detected with the James Webb Space Telescope are considered the cores of emerging galaxies. For the first time, we compare LRDs in $M_{\rm bh}$-$M_{\star}$ diagrams with an array of $z=0$ galaxy-morphology-dependent scaling relations, along with the $M_{\rm bh}$-$M_{\rm \star,nsc}$ relation for nuclear star clusters. The $M_{\rm bh}$-$M_{\rm \star,sph}$ relations for spheroidal stellar systems are characterised by a nearly parallel set of quasi-quadratic (or steeper) distributions that are known to trace the `punctuated equilibrium' of galaxies, reflecting their stepwise growth in black hole mass and merger-built bulge/spheroid mass. We show that LRDs are not equivalent to nuclear star clusters, with the latter having higher $M_{\rm bh}/M_{\star}$ ratios. However, the least massive LRDs exhibit similar $M_{\rm bh}$ and $M_{\rm \star,gal}$ values as ultracompact dwarf (UCD) galaxies. We show that the LRDs span the $M_{\rm bh}$-$M_{\rm \star,gal}$ diagram from UCD galaxies to primaeval lenticular galaxies. In contrast, spiral galaxies and the subset of major-merger-built early-type galaxies define offset relations. Additionally, we observe that low-$z$ galaxies with active galactic nuclei align with the steep black hole scaling relations for disc galaxies defined by primarily inactive galaxies with directly measured black hole masses. Collectively, this highlights the benefits of considering galaxy morphology, which reflects their accretion and merger history, to understand the coevolution of galaxies and their black holes.</description>

      <title>ChemicalUniverseMachine I: Uncovering the Cosmic Evolution of Metals in the Galaxy-ISM-CGM Ecosystem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an empirical chemical evolution model that explains the distribution of metals in the interstellar medium (ISM) and the circumgalactic medium (CGM) of galaxies based on the UniverseMachine and NeutralUniverseMachine models in the framework of $\Lambda$CDM structure formation. We parameterize the fractions of outflowing metals returned and mixed into the multi-phase ISM of the star-forming regions ($f_{\rm H2}$) and into the neutral gas regions ($f_{\rm HI}$); metal production, transfer, and dilution are caused by star formation, galaxy mergers, and gas inflow from the inter-galactic medium, respectively, with rates determined by the (Neutral)UniverseMachine models. Using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm, we explore the posterior distributions of metal return and mixing consistent with observed mass-metallicity relations in HII regions (at $0&lt;z&lt;5$), HI damped Lyman-alpha systems (at $1&lt;z&lt;4$), and the CGM (at $z=0$). We find that the fraction of metals present in the ISM, $f_{\rm H2}+f_{\rm HI}$, increases with halo mass from $\sim20$\% at $10^{10}M_\odot$ to $\sim80$\% at $10^{13}M_\odot$. These fractions increase mildly at higher redshifts, to $\sim30$\% at $10^{10}M_\odot$ and $\sim80$\% at $10^{13}M_\odot$ at $z=5$. Interestingly, there is no significant redshift evolution of $f_{\rm H2}+f_{\rm HI}$ at fixed circular velocity, suggesting that metal distribution between the ISM and CGM is universally determined by the halo potential well depth. CGM metal enrichment is thus slow in high-$z$ halos with deep potential wells. While $f_{\rm H2}$ monotonically increases with halo mass, $f_{\rm HI}$ peaks at $\sim10^{12}-10^{13} M_\odot$, suggesting that reinfall may be inefficient in larger-mass halos.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Characterization of Galaxy-Cool CGM Connections at $z&lt;0.4$ with DESI Year 1 Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the relationships between the properties of the cool circumgalactic medium (CGM), traced by Ca II absorption lines, and those of galaxies at $z&lt;0.4$ by utilizing a galaxy-quasar pair sample compiled from the Year 1 data of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). This large dataset, containing $\sim 900,000$ galaxy-quasar pairs within $200\,\rm kpc$, enables us to obtain composite spectra with sensitivity reaching to $\text{m\r{A}}$ level and to explore the Ca II absorption as a function of stellar mass, SFR, redshift, and galaxy types, including AGNs. Our results show a positive correlation between the absorption strength and stellar mass of star-forming galaxies with $\langle W_{0}^{\rm Ca\ II}\rangle \propto M_{*}^{0.5}$ over three orders of magnitude in stellar mass from $\sim 10^{8}$ to $10^{11} \, M_{\odot}$, while such a mass dependence is weaker for quiescent galaxies. For galaxies with similar mass, we find that Ca II absorption is stronger around star-forming galaxies than around quiescent galaxies especially within the inner regions ($&lt;30\,\rm kpc$) of the halos. Among star-forming galaxies, the Ca II absorption further correlates with SFR, following $\propto \mathrm{SFR^{0.3}}$. However, in contrast to the results at higher redshifts, we find that stronger absorption around star-forming galaxies is not preferentially observed along the minor axis of galaxies, indicating a possible redshift evolution of CGM dynamics resulting from galactic feedback. Moreover, no significant difference between the properties of the cool gas around AGNs and galaxies is detected. Finally, we measure the absorption profiles with respect to the virial radius of dark matter halos and estimate the total Ca II mass in the CGM. The results show that the CGM contains a metal mass comparable to the metal mass in the ISM of galaxies.</description>

      <title>Extraction of HI gas with bulk motions in the disk of galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new method for extracting bulk motion gases in the disk of a galaxy from HI data cubes, offering improvements over classical techniques like moment analysis and line profile fitting. Our approach decomposes the line-of-sight velocity profiles into multiple Gaussian components, which are then classified into (underlying and dominant) bulk and non-bulk motion gases based on criteria such as HI surface density, velocity dispersion, kinetic energy, and rotation velocity. A 2D tilted-ring analysis is employed to refine the kinematical parametres of the galaxy disk, ensuring robust extraction of the bulk motion gases. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method using the HI data cubes of NGC 4559 from the WSRT-HALOGAS survey, distinguishing between bulk and non-bulk gas components. From this, we find that approximately 50% of the HI gas in NGC 4559 is classified as non-bulk, possibly linked to processes such as stellar feedback. This work provides a robust framework for analysing HI kinematics of galaxies from high sensitivity HI observations of galaxies like MeerKAT-MHONGOOSE and FAST-FEASTS and allows us to best exploit the kinematic information of the complex gas dynamics within galaxy disks.</description>

      <title>The Origin of the Gas and Its Low Star Formation Efficiency in Quiescent Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quiescent galaxies (QGs) typically have little cold gas to form stars. The discovery of gas-rich QGs challenges our conventional understanding of the evolutionary paths of galaxies. We take advantage of a new catalog of nearby, massive galaxies with robust, uniformly derived physical properties to better understand the origin of gas-rich QGs. We perform a comparative analysis of the cold interstellar medium and star formation properties of carefully matched samples of galaxies with varying degrees of star formation activity and gas richness. QGs with different gas content have virtually identical morphological types, light concentration, mass-size relation, stellar age, dark matter halo mass, and black hole activity. The only distinguishing characteristic is the environment. Gas-rich satellite QGs reside in a lower-density environment than their gas-poor counterparts, as a consequence of which they manage to retain their gas and experience a higher probability of cold gas accretion or gas-rich mergers. The environmental densities of central QGs are similar regardless of their gas content. We suggest that the cold gas resides mainly in the outskirts of the gas-rich QGs, where bars, if present, cannot transport it inward efficiently to fuel central star formation. The prominent bulges in gas-rich QGs stabilize the cold gas from fragmentation and leads to low star formation efficiency.</description>

      <title>Optical Monitoring and Long-term Optical Spectral Variability of BL Lacertae Object S5 0716+714</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present photometric observations of the BL Lacertae object S5 0716+714 with a temporal resolution of 120 s in the Sloan i' and r' bands. These observations were conducted using the Comet Search Program telescope at Xingming Observatory from 2018 December 22 to 2020 February 15, and more than 5600 effective images were obtained on each filter across 79 nights. Additionally, we compiled long-term variability data spanning 34 yr in the optical UBVRI bands. Using the power-enhanced F-test and nested ANOVA test, we found intraday variability (IDV) on 31 nights and possible IDV on 20 nights in the i' band. Similarly, IDV was detected on 35 nights in the r' band, while possible IDV was observed on 22 nights. The minimum variability timescale is 7.33 minutes, and the estimated black hole masses are (0.68- 5.12)*10^8 Msun. The spectral variability and long-term optical light curves reveal a bluer-when-brighter trend on intraday timescales. The long-term optical flux density and spectral index exhibit periodic variability with a timescale of about 1038 days. An anticorrelation between optical flux and spectral index was observed, with a time delay of -140 days. Variability across different optical bands exhibited a strong correlation, with no discernible time lag. From the IDV, spectral variability, correlation, and time delays between different bands, we conclude that these radiation characteristics may result from the shock-in-jet model scenario.</description>

      <title>Spatially resolved circumnuclear coronal $[{\rm Fe\,VII}]\,\lambda6087$ emission in nearby Seyfert galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coronal lines are forbidden emission lines with a ionisation potential $\chi\gtrsim100\,{\rm eV}$. They are linked to energetic phenomena triggered by AGNs in the circumnuclear medium. We present the first high-angular-resolution integral-field analysis of the $[{\rm Fe\,VII}]\,\lambda6087$ coronal line in a sample of four nearby low-inclination Seyfert galaxies (three of Type 1 and one of Type 2). The data were obtained with the adaptive-optics-assisted mode of MUSE, and have angular resolutions of $0.06-0.18\,{\rm arcsec}$, allowing us to probe regions down to a few tens of parsecs in size. In three of the objects, we find a resolved coronal emission in a relatively compact configuration ($\lesssim200\,{\rm pc}$ in radius). The coronal emission is smooth and symmetric with respect to the centre of the galaxy, except for one object where an off-nucleus clump of emission is detected. Through the use of spectroastrometry we find that the $[{\rm Fe\,VII}]$ outflow of the Type 2 AGN host has a redshifted and a blueshifted component whose centroids are separated by $\sim20\,{\rm pc}$. We interpret this as evidence that some of the coronal emission comes from the inner part of a biconic outflow, also seen in low-ionisation lines. Similar $[{\rm Fe\,VII}]$ properties are found in two of the Type 1 AGN hosts, but with a much smaller separation between the centroids of the lobes of the outflow ($&lt;7\,{\rm pc}$). This could be due to the foreshortening of the axis of the bicone in Type 1 objects. We also studied the spectrum of the unresolved nuclear source and found that in three out of four galaxies a fraction of at least $\sim60\%$ of the $[\textrm{Fe VII}]$ emission has kinematics similar to those of $[{\rm O\,III}]$. We conclude that part of the coronal emission within the inner few tens of parsecs is co-spatial and shares kinematics with the outflows as traced by lower-ionisation lines.</description>

      <title>The Complex Magnetic Field of the Extreme Galactic Center: PRIMA Science Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) of the Galactic Center (GC) region of the Milky Way contains a substantial fraction of the molecular mass of the Galaxy &gt;10e7 solar masses yet exhibits an order of magnitude lower star formation efficiency (SFE) than expected given the high densities found in this region. There are multiple possible explanations for the depressed SFE in the CMZ, like feedback, strong turbulence, longer free-fall timescales, and high magnetic field strengths. It is currently unclear which of these mechanisms is the dominant inhibitor of star formation in the CMZ. It is important to understand the star formation process in the extreme environment of the CMZ because it is the only Galactic nuclear region we are able to study at high spatial resolutions with current observatories. One way to determine the relative importance of the different SFE inhibiting mechanisms is through multi-spatial and multi-frequency polarimetric observations of the CMZ. Such observations will provide insight into the behavior of the magnetic field in this unique environment. These observations will complement radio observations of non-thermal structures revealing the magnetic field morphology and polarization. The PRobe far--Infrared Mission for Astrophysics (PRIMA) will be uniquely capable of contributing to such explorations by providing unique resolutions and frequencies for polarimetric observations. The PRIMAger instrument will yield polarimetric observations covering the wavelength range 80 -- 261 um with beam sizes ranging from 11 -- 28'', capabilities that complement existing and upcoming observatories.</description>

      <title>Fe Abundances of Early Galaxies at $z=9-12$ Derived with Deep JWST Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive Fe-abundance ratios of 6 galaxies at $z=9-12$ with $-22&lt;M_{\mathrm{UV}}&lt;-19$ whose JWST/NIRSpec spectra achieve very high signal-to-noise ratios, $\mathrm{SNR}=40-230$, at the rest-frame UV wavelength. We fit stellar synthesis model spectra to these JWST spectra, carefully masking out nebular emission, interstellar absorption, and non-iron stellar absorption lines, and obtain Fe-abundance ratios of $\mathrm{[Fe/H]}=-2-0$ for 4 galaxies and upper limits of $\mathrm{[Fe/H]}\sim-1$ for 2 galaxies. We compare these [Fe/H] values with the oxygen abundances of these galaxies ($7.2&lt;12+\log{\mathrm{(O/H)}}&lt;7.9$) in the same manner as previous studies of low-$z$ galaxies, and derive oxygen-to-iron abundance ratios [O/Fe]. We find that majority of (4 out of 6) galaxies are consistent with iron-poor abundance ratios ($\mathrm{[O/Fe]}\gtrsim0$) while that 2 out of 6 galaxies, GS-z11-0 and GN-z11, show Fe enhancements ($\mathrm{[O/Fe]}&lt;0$), especially GS-z11-0 ($z=11.12$) with a Fe enhancement ($\mathrm{[O/Fe]}=-0.91_{-0.42}^{+0.35}$) beyond the solar-abundance ratio at $\sim3\sigma$. Because, unlike GS-z11-0, GN-z11 ($z=10.60$) may be an AGN, we constrain [O/Fe] via FeII emission under the assumption of AGN and confirm that the Fe enhancement is consistent even in the case of AGN. While [O/Fe] values of the majority of the galaxies are explained by the chemical enrichment of core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe), the Fe enhancements of GS-z11-0 and GN-z11 are puzzling. We develop chemical evolution models, and find that the iron enhancements against oxygen in GS-z11-0 and GN-z11 can be explained by 1) pair-instability supernovae/bright hypernovae with little contribution of CCSNe or 2) Type-Ia supernovae with short delay time ($\sim30-50$ Myr) with a top-light initial mass function.</description>

      <title>A Census of the Most Obscured Galaxy Nuclei over Cosmic Time to be revealed by PRIMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Characterizing the growth of supermassive Black Holes (SMBHs) is critical to the evolution of galaxies, however the majority of this activity is obscured, rendering traditional tracers of active SMBHs, such as in the restframe optical/UV, ineffective. The mid-infrared has been particularly successful in revealing obscured AGN activity however much of this work is confined to the local universe due to the lack of a far-IR telescope with the required sensitivity and wavelength coverage. In this work we demonstrate the effectiveness of PRIMA (PRobe far-Infrared Mission for Astrophysics), a concept 1.8m far-IR observatory, to detect and characterize deeply obscured galaxy nuclei over cosmic time. With the PRIMAger instrument covering 25 - 235 $\mu$m, we find that we can accurately detect obscured nuclei via the deep silicate absorption at restframe $9.8 \mu$m between $z=2-7$. Additionally, the FIRESS spectrograph can produce R$\sim$100 spectra of obscured nuclei out to $z\sim7$, detecting Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs), ices, ionized and molecular gas. With the large number of deeply obscured nuclei PRIMA can detect and characterize, such a mission is critical to understanding the growth of SMBHs.</description>

      <title>L\'evy Flights and Leaky Boxes: Anomalous Diffusion of Cosmic Rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In classical diffusion, particle step-sizes have a Gaussian distribution. However, in superdiffusion, they have power-law tails, with transport dominated by rare, long L\'evy flights. Similarly, if the time interval between scattering events has power-law tails, subdiffusion occurs. Both forms of anomalous diffusion are seen in cosmic ray (CR) particle tracking simulations in turbulent magnetic fields. They also likely occur if CRs are scattered by discrete intermittent structures. Anomalous diffusion mimics a scale-dependent diffusion coefficient, with potentially wide-ranging consequences. However, the finite size of galaxies implies an upper bound on step-sizes before CRs escape. This truncation results in eventual convergence to Gaussian statistics by the central limit theorem. Using Monte-Carlo simulations, we show that this occurs in both standard finite-thickness halo models, or when CR diffusion transitions to advection or streaming-dominated regimes. While optically thick intermittent structures produce power-law trapping times and thus subdiffusion, gaussianization also eventually occurs on timescales longer than the maximum trapping time. Anomalous diffusion is a transient, and converges to standard diffusion on the (usually short) timescale of particle escape, either from confining structures (subdiffusion), or the system as a whole (superdiffusion). Thus, standard assumptions of classical diffusion are physically justified in most applications, despite growing simulation evidence for anomalous diffusion. However, if escape times are long, this is no longer true. For instance, anomalous diffusion in the CGM or ICM would change CR pressure profiles. Finally, we show the standard diagnostic for anomalous diffusion, $\langle d^2 \rangle \propto t^{\alpha}$ with $\alpha \neq 1$, is not justified for truncated L\'evy flights, and propose an alternative robust measure.</description>

      <title>SIDM Concerto: Compilation and Data Release of Self-interacting Dark Matter Zoom-in Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present SIDM Concerto: $14$ cosmological zoom-in simulations in cold dark matter (CDM) and self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) models based on the Symphony and Milky Way-est suites. SIDM Concerto includes one Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC)-mass system (host mass $\sim 10^{11}~M_{\mathrm{\odot}}$), two Milky Way (MW) analogs ($\sim 10^{12}~M_{\mathrm{\odot}}$), two group-mass hosts ($\sim 10^{13}~M_{\mathrm{\odot}}$), and one low-mass cluster ($\sim 10^{14}~M_{\mathrm{\odot}}$). Each host contains $\approx 2\times 10^7$ particles and is run in CDM and one or more strong, velocity-dependent SIDM models. Our analysis of SIDM (sub)halo populations over seven subhalo mass decades reveals that: (i) the fraction of core-collapsed isolated halos and subhalos peaks at a maximum circular velocity corresponding to the transition of the SIDM cross section from a $v^{-4}$ to $v^0$ scaling; (ii) SIDM subhalo mass functions are suppressed by $\approx 50\%$ relative to CDM in LMC, MW, and group-mass hosts but are consistent with CDM in the low-mass cluster host; (iii) subhalos' inner density profile slopes, which are more diverse in SIDM than in CDM, are sensitive to both the amplitude and shape of the SIDM cross section. Our simulations provide a benchmark for testing SIDM predictions with astrophysical observations of field and satellite galaxies, strong lensing systems, and stellar streams.

      <title>Parallel Collisionless Shocks in strongly Magnetized Electron-Ion Plasma. I. Temperature anisotropies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collisionless electron-ion shocks are fundamental to astrophysical plasmas, yet their behavior in strong magnetic fields remains poorly understood. Using Particle-in-Cell (PIC) simulations with the SHARP-1D3V code, we investigate the role of the ion magnetization parameter $\sigma_i$ in parallel shock transitions. Strongly magnetized converging flows ($\sigma_i &gt; 1$) exhibit lower density compression ratios ($R \sim 2$), smaller entropy jumps, and suppressed particle acceleration, while maintaining pressure anisotropy stability due to conserved perpendicular temperatures across the shock, alongside increased parallel temperatures. In contrast, weakly magnetized shocks drive downstream mirror and firehose instabilities due to ion temperature anisotropy, which are suppressed in strongly magnetized cases. Additionally, weakly magnetized shocks exhibit the onset of a supra-thermal population induced by shock-drift acceleration, with most of the upstream kinetic energy thermalized for both electrons and ions in the downstream region. Our results demonstrate that perpendicular temperatures for both species are conserved in strongly magnetized cases and highlight deviations from standard ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) behavior. These findings provide critical insights into the role of magnetic fields in parallel collisionless astrophysical shocks.</description>

      <title>A FLASH on Blazars: Capturing the Radio Realm of 4FGL Blazars with SKAO Pathfinders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10811v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work investigates the multi-wavelength properties of 165 4FGL blazars from the Fermi-LAT fourth source catalogue, looking for with counterparts in the Australian SKA Pathfinder (ASKAP) First Large Absorption Survey in HI (FLASH) continuum. Using high-resolution data from FLASH and complementary radio datasets, combined with archival Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) observations, we perform detailed spectral energy distribution (SED) analyses across cm-to-mm wavelengths. Our findings reveal that most blazars exhibit re-triggered peaked spectra, indicative of emission dominated by a single emitting region. Additionally, we identify strong correlations between radio and gamma-ray luminosities, highlighting the significant role of relativistic jets in these active galactic nuclei. The inclusion of spectroscopic redshifts from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and Gaia enables a comprehensive analysis of the evolutionary trends and physical characteristics of the sources. Furthermore, we report a tight Radio-X-ray Correlation for Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars, contrasting with the more scattered behaviour observed in BL-Lacs, reflecting their distinct accretion and jet-driving mechanisms. These results provide critical insights into the physics of blazars and their environments, paving the way for future studies with next-generation facilities like the SKA Observatory (SKAO) for radio observations and Cherenkov Telescope Array for gamma-ray studies.</description>

      <title>Near-infrared Spectral Properties of Type Ib/Ic Supernova Progenitors and Implications for JWST and NGRST Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While about 20 Type II supernova progenitors have been identified using optical data from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), direct detection of type Ib/Ic supernova (SN Ib/Ic) progenitors remains challenging due to their faint optical brightness and highly obscured environments. This study aims to investigate the detection limits and advantages of near-infrared (near-IR) observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope (NGRST) for the detection of SN Ib/Ic progenitors. The spectral energy distributions of SN Ib/Ic progenitor models with various masses, chemical compositions, and mass-loss rates are calculated with the non-LTE radiative transfer code CMFGEN. We then assess the detectability of SN Ib/Ic progenitors using near-IR filters from the JWST and the NGRST, comparing the results to the capabilities of the HST. Our analysis indicates that near-IR observations significantly outperform the HST in detecting SN Ib/Ic progenitors when considering the effect of extinction. Near-IR magnitudes also provide better constraints on the mass-loss rates of progenitors because of the free-free emission from the wind matter. Additionally, near-IR magnitudes and color-color diagrams are effective in distinguishing SN Ib/Ic progenitors from possible companion and/or background objects. This study suggests that the JWST and the NGRST can play a crucial role in advancing our understanding of SN Ib/Ic progenitors by improving detectability and offering better constraints on progenitor properties. We emphasize that observations with exposure times exceeding 1 hour would be needed to detect typical SNe Ib/Ic progenitors at distances greater than 10 Mpc.</description>

      <title>Fast spectral line calculations with the escape probability method and tests with synthetic observations of interstellar clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radiative transfer effects need to be taken into account when analysing spectral line observations. When the data are not sufficient for detailed modelling, simpler methods are needed. The escape probability formalism (EPF) is one such tool. We wish to quantify the model errors in the EPF analysis of interstellar clouds and cores. We introduce PEP, a parallel program for calculating fast EPF parameters quickly. We model full radiative transfer to generate synthetic observations for various cloud models. These are examined with the PEP program, and their results are compared to the actual beam-averaged kinetic temperatures, column densities, and volume densities. PEP enables the calculations of even millions of parameter combinations in a matter of seconds. However, the simple assumptions of EPF can lead to significant errors. In the tests the errors were typically within a factor of two, but could in some cases reach an order of magnitude. The model errors are thus similar or even larger than the statistical errors caused by the typical observational noise. Due to degeneracies, parameter combinations are better constrained than the individual parameters. The model errors could be reduced by using full radiative transfer modelling. However, in the absence of full knowledge of the source structure, the errors are difficult to quantify. We also present a method for approximate handling of hyperfine structure lines in EPF calculations. Both the observational statistical errors and the model errors need to be considered when estimating the reliability of EPF results. Full radiative transfer modelling is needed to better understand the true uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Surface brightness-color relations for red giant branch stars using asteroseismic radii and Gaia distances (the ARD method)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aims. Asteroseismic radius and Gaia distance (ARD) method has been proposed to establish the SBCRs for late-type stars. Methods. We select Kepler RGB stars with high-precision asteroseismic radii (uncertainties &lt; 1%) and cross-match them with 2MASS, APASS, and Gaia to obtain Johnson-B, Johnson-V, G, J, H, and Ks-band photometric data. After applying selection criteria, we obtain 626 RGB stars to build the SBCR. Among these, 100 RGBs are used as independent validation for the distance, and the remaining samples are used to fit the SBCR. Results. First, using 526 targets with asteroseismic radii and Gaia distances, nine SBCRs are proposed based on 2MASS (J, H, Ks), APASS (Johnson-B, Johnson-V), and Gaia (G) photometry. The average rms scatter in these relations is 0.075 mag, which corresponds to an uncertainty of approximately 3.5% in distance. These relations are further validated using 100 independent samples with Gaia distances, showing no bias, with a dispersion of approximately 3%. Compared to interferometric measurements, a systematic underestimation of 2.3% was observed, and the discrepancy decreases as the angular diameter increases. Additionally, the distances of eclipsing binaries in the Large Magellanic Cloud and Small Magellanic Cloud obtained using our SBCRs are generally consistent with those measured in the literature, with a dispersion of 1% and a slight overestimation of 1% to 2.5%. Conclusions. The ARD method capitalizes on two key advantages for precise stellar distance determination: a statistically robust sample of homogeneous RGB stars with low observational costs, and independent distance verification through Gaia data. Such SBCRs can be further calibrated and expanded more efficiently and effectively.</description>

      <title>Physical conditions around high-mass young star-forming objects via simultaneous observations of excited OH and methanol masers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Astrophysical masers are widely used in star formation studies. In particular, they are valuable in investigations of high-mass star-forming regions that are difficult to observe at optical frequencies. We used multi-transition data to derive physical conditions in the immediate environment of forming high-mass stars. Simultaneous observations of two maser transitions, excited OH at 6.035 GHz and methanol at 6.668 GHz, were made using e-Merlin. Both transitions are radiatively pumped but prefer diverse physical conditions. We imaged ten high-mass star-forming sites with milliarcsecond angular resolution, identifying regions where excited OH and methanol masers coexist and where they avoid each other. Moreover, we identified circularly polarized Zeeman splitting pairs of the OH transition, estimating magnetic field strengths in the range from 0.2 to 10.6~mG. The detection of linearly polarized components enabled us to compare the directions of magnetic field vectors with the outflows coming from the young star-forming objects. We found that the two maser lines appeared to coexist in six high-mass star-forming regions, in cloudlets separated by up to 205~au. Where the lines show avoidance, this can be related to changes in dust and gas temperatures; we also found a few examples suggestive of a high gas density. In seven sources, Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests show the nonrandom relationship between the position angles of distribution of the two maser transitions. We did not obtain consistent results regarding the direction of the magnetic field and outflow.</description>

      <title>Elemental abundances of 44 very metal-poor stars determined from Subaru/IRD near-infrared spectra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Abundances of five elements, Na, Mg, Al, Si, and Sr, are investigated for 44 very metal-poor stars (-4.0 &lt; [Fe/H] &lt; -1.5) in the Galactic halo system based on an Local Thermodinamic Equilibrium (LTE) analysis of high-resolution near-infrared spectra obtained with the Infrared Doppler instrument (IRD) on the Subaru Telescope. Mg and Si abundances are determined for all 44 stars. The Si abundances are determined from up to 29 lines, which provide reliable abundance ratios compared to previous results from a few optical lines. The Mg and Si of these stars are over-abundant, relative to iron, and are well-explained by chemical-evolution models. No significant scatter is found in the abundance ratios of both elements with respect to iron, except for a few outliers. The small scatter of the abundance ratios of these elements provides constraints on the variations of stellar and supernova's yields at very low metallicity. Al abundances are determined for 27 stars from near-infrared lines (e.g., 1312nm), which are expected to be less affected by non-LTE (NLTE) effects than optical resonance lines. The average of the [Al/Fe] ratios is close to the solar value, and no dependence on metallicity is found over -3.0 &lt; [Fe/H] &lt; -2.0. Na abundances are determined for 12 stars; they exhibit Solar abundance ratios and no dependence on metallicity. The Sr abundances determined from the Sr II triplet are significantly higher than those from the optical resonance lines obtained by previous studies for our sample. This discrepancy shows a clear dependence on temperature and surface gravity, supporting models that predict large NLTE effects on the near-infrared lines for metal-poor red giants.</description>

      <title>A metallicity scale derived from Fe I and FeH lines in the APOGEE M dwarf spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present metallicities derived from a sample of eleven M dwarfs belonging to wide binary systems with warmer FG primary companions observed by the high-resolution (R=22,500) near-infrared SDSS-IV APOGEE spectra. Using a plane-parallel one-dimensional local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) abundance analysis, we determine effective temperatures ($T_{\rm eff}$) based on the abundance equilibrium from the Fe I, FeH, OH, and H$_2$O spectral lines. We obtained three $T_{\rm eff}$ scales based on these lines and found that, regardless of the chosen $T_{\rm eff}$ scale, the M dwarf metallicities agree well with those of the warmer primaries, where the upper mean abundance difference limit is 0.04 $\pm$ 0.06. This good agreement confirms that FeH lines are a reliable indicator of $T_{\rm eff}$ in the $H-$band spectra.</description>

      <title>Microlensing Constraints on the Stellar and Planetary Mass Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mass function (MF) of isolated objects measured by microlensing consists of both a stellar and a planetary component. We compare the microlensing MFs of Gould et al (2022) and Sumi et al (2023) to other measurements of the MF. The abundance of brown dwarfs in the Sumi et al (2023) stellar MF is consistent with measurements from the local solar neighborhood (Kirkpatrick et al 2024). Microlensing free-floating planets ($\mu$FFPs) may may be free-floating or orbit host stars with semimajor axes $a\gtrsim 10~\mathrm{au}$ and therefore can constrain the populations of both free-floating planetary-mass objects and wide-orbit planets. Comparisons to radial velocity and direct imaging planet populations suggest that either most of the $\mu$FFP population with masses $&gt;1~M_{\rm Jup}$ is bound to hosts more massive than M dwarfs or some fraction of the observed bound population actually comes from the low-mass tail of the stellar population. The $\mu$FFP population also places strong constraints on planets inferred from debris disks and gaps in protoplanetary disks observed by ALMA.</description>

      <title>Neutrinos as a new tool to characterise the Milky Way Centre</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Central Molecular Zone (CMZ), a star-forming region rich in molecular clouds located within hundreds of parsecs from the centre of our Galaxy, converts gas into stars less efficient than anticipated. A key challenge in refining star-formation models is the lack of precise mapping of these dense molecular hydrogen clouds, where traditional tracers often yield inconsistent results due to environmental limitations. We demonstrate how, in the not-so-far future, neutrinos will emerge as a robust mass tracer thanks to advancements in neutrino telescopes. Since neutrinos are produced alongside gamma-rays when cosmic-rays interact with molecular clouds, they offer a complementary, systematics-independent measurement of the gas density. In an optimistic case where most gamma-ray emission from the Galactic Centre region originates from pion decays, we expect several tens of muon neutrinos to be detected in about two decades by KM3NeT, Baikal-GVD, and P-ONE combined, which will enable a better determination of the baryonic content in the Galactic Centre region. The CMZ will serve as a testbed to calibrate conventional tracers against neutrinos, ultimately improving gas measurements in distant galaxies, where neutrinos are undetectable, but traditional tracers remain available.</description>

      <title>Massive star cluster formation II. Runaway stars as fossils of sub-cluster mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12286v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two main mechanisms have classically been proposed for the formation of runaway stars. In the binary supernova scenario (BSS), a massive star in a binary explodes as a supernova, ejecting its companion. In the dynamical ejection scenario, a star is ejected during a strong dynamical encounter between multiple stars. We propose a third mechanism for the formation of runaway stars: the subcluster ejection scenario (SCES), where a subset of stars from an infalling subcluster is ejected out of the cluster via a tidal interaction with the contracting gravitational potential of the assembling cluster. We demonstrate the SCES in a star-by-star simulation of the formation of a young massive cluster from a $10^6\rm~M_\odot$ gas cloud using the Torch framework. This star cluster forms hierarchically through a sequence of subcluster mergers determined by the initial turbulent, spherical conditions of the gas. We find that these mergers drive the formation of runaway stars in our model. Late-forming subclusters fall into the central potential, where they are tidally disrupted, forming tidal tails of runaway stars that are distributed highly anisotropically. Runaways formed in the same SCES have similar ages, velocities, and ejection directions. Surveying observations, we identify several SCES candidate groups with anisotropic ejection directions. The SCES is capable of producing runaway binaries: two wide dynamical binaries in infalling subclusters were tightened through ejection. This allows for another velocity kick via subsequent via a subsequent BSS ejection. An SCES-BSS ejection is a possible avenue for the creation of hypervelocity stars unbound to the Galaxy. We expect nonspherical initial gas distributions to increase the number of calculated runaway stars. The observation of groups of runaway stars formed via the SCES can thus reveal the assembly history of their natal clusters.</description>

      <title>Compact Binary Formation in Open Star Clusters III: Probability of Binary Black Holes Hidden in Gaia Black Hole Binary</title>

Abstract: The Gaia mission and its follow-up observations have discovered a few candidates of non-interacting single black holes (BHs) and visible stars: Gaia BH1, BH2, and BH3. We call them ``astrometric BH binaries'' collectively. This paper addresses the question if some of these candidates may indeed harbor binary BHs (BBHs), namely, they may be ``astrometric BBH triples'' that have not been discovered yet. We focus on open star clusters, one of the promising formation sites of astrometric BH binaries, and estimate the formation rate of such astrometric BBH triples using gravitational $N$-body simulations. We find that formation efficiency of astrometric BBH triples is fairly high if they are in low-metallicity environments; $\sim 10^{-6} {\rm M}_\odot^{-1}$ or $\sim 10$ \% of astrometric BH binaries. On the other hand, no such astrometric BBH triple is formed in the solar-metallicity environments. Most of the astrometric BBH triples in our simulations turn out to be dynamically stable for $10$ Gyrs, indicating that $\sim 10$ \% of astrometric BH binary candidates may indeed harbor inner BBHs if they originate from open star clusters in low-metallicity environments. Astrometric BBH triples can be distinguished from astrometric BH binaries with the radial velocity follow-up of the tertiary star. Our simulated samples statistically suggest that a few percents of astrometric BH binary candidates should exhibit detectable radial velocity modulations due to the inner BBHs. They preferentially have ``outer'' orbital periods of $\gtrsim 10^3$ days, and moderately high ``outer'' orbital eccentricity of $\gtrsim 0.7$. Our current result strongly motivates the search for astrometric BBH triples in the upcoming Gaia final data release.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Galactic Winds in M82 II: Development of Multiphase Outflows in Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09782v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We performed a suit of three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations with a resolution of $\sim10$ parsecs to investigate the development of multiphase galactic wind in M82. The star formation and related feedback processes are solved self-consistently using a sink particle method, rather than relying on various assumptions that were used in previous studies. Our simulations produce a starburst event lasting around 25 Myr, which has a total stellar mass of 1.62 - 3.34 $\times 10^8\, \rm{M_{\odot}}$, consistent with observational estimates. The total injected supernova energy is between $1.14\times 10^{57}$ and $2.4\times 10^{57} \rm{erg}$. Supernova (SN) feedback heats portions of the cool gas in the central disc to warm and hot phases, and then drives the gas in all three phases out, eventually forming multiphase outflows. These outflows can replicate key properties of the winds observed in M82, such as morphology, mass outflow rate, and X-ray emission flux, provided the gas return from star-forming clumps to the interstellar medium is implemented appropriately. The maximum mass outflow rate of all gas (hot) is about 6-12 (2-3)$\rm{M_{\odot}/yr}$ at $r\sim4.0\,$ kpc, corresponding to a mass loading factor of 2-4. However, the outflow velocities in our simulations are slower than observational estimates by $\sim 20\%-60\%$. The gas return process significantly influences the outflow properties, while the initial gas distribution in the nuclear region has a moderate effect. However, our results face some challenges in achieving convergence as the resolution increases. We discuss potential improvements to address these issues in future work.</description>

      <title>Linear response of rotating and flattened stellar clusters: the oblate Kuzmin-Kutuzov St\"ackel family</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15033v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the linear response of a series of spheroidal stellar clusters, the Kuzmin-Kutuzov St\"ackel family, which exhibit a continuous range of flattening and rotation, extending from an isochrone sphere to a Toomre disk. The method successfully replicates the growing modes previously identified in published $N$-body simulations. It relies on the efficiency of the matrix method to quantify systematically the effects of rotation and flattening on the eigenmodes of the galaxy. We identify two types of bi-symmetric instabilities for the flatter models - the so-called bending and bar-growing modes - the latter of which persists even for very round models. As anticipated, in its least unstable configurations, the system becomes flatter as its rotational speed increases. More realistic equilibria will be required to achieve a better match to the main sequence of fast-slow rotators. The corresponding code is made public.</description>

      <title>A Probabilistic Model to Estimate Number Densities from Column Densities in Molecular Clouds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16290v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Constraining the physical and chemical evolution of molecular clouds is essential to our understanding of star formation. These investigations often necessitate knowledge of some local representative number density of the gas along the line of sight. However, constraining the number density is a difficult endeavor. Robust constraints of the number density often require line observations of specific molecules along with radiation transfer modeling, which provides densities traced by that specific molecule. Column density maps of molecular clouds are more readily available, with many high-fidelity maps calculated from dust emission and extinction, in particular from surveys conducted with the Herschel Space Observatory. We introduce a new probabilistic model which is based on the assumption that the total hydrogen nuclei column density along a line of sight can be decomposed into a turbulent component and a gravitationally-dominated component. Therefore, for each pixel in a column density map, the line of sight is decomposed into characteristic diffuse (dubbed ``turbulent'') and dense (dubbed ``gravitational'') gas number densities from column density maps. The method thus exploits a physical model of turbulence to decouple the random turbulent column from gas in dense bound structures empirically using the observed column density maps. We find the model produces reasonable turbulent and gravitational densities in the Taurus L1495/B213 and Polaris Flare clouds. The model can also be used to infer an effective attenuating column density into the cloud, which is useful for astrochemical models of the clouds. We conclude by demonstrating an application of this method by predicting the emission of the [C II], [C I], and CO (J = 1-0) lines across the Taurus L1495/B213 region at the native resolution of the column density map utilizing a grid of photodissociation-region models.</description>

      <title>Joint inference of the Milky Way star formation history and IMF from Gaia all-sky $G &lt; 13$ data</title>

Abstract: Despite the fundamental importance of the Milky Way's star formation history (SFH) and initial mass function (IMF), their consistent derivation remains elusive. We aim to simultaneously infer the IMF and the SFH of the Galactic disc comparing Gaia data with the mock catalog resulting from the Besan\c{c}on population synthesis model (BGM). Our goal is also to estimate the impact of the systematics present in current stellar evolutionary models (SEMs) on this inference. We use a new implementation of the BGM Fast Approximate Simulations (BGM FASt) framework to fit the seven million star Gaia DR3 all-sky $G&lt;13$ color-magnitude diagram (CMD) to the most updated dynamically self-consistent BGM. Our derived SFH supports an abrupt decrease of the star formation approximately 1-1.5 Gyr ago followed by a significant enhancement with a wide plateau in the range 2-6 Gyr ago. A remarkable hiatus appears around 5-7 Gyr ago with a $\sim$1 Gyr shift depending on the set of stellar models. A complex evolution at ages older than 8 Gyr deserves further investigation. Precise but discrepant values using different SEMs are found for the power-law indices of the IMF. In our fiducial execution with PARSEC SEM, the slope takes a value of $\alpha_2 = 1.45^{+0.19}_{-0.12}$ for the range [0.5-1.53]$M_\odot$, while for masses larger than 1.53 $M_\odot$ we obtain $\alpha_3 = 1.98^{+0.13}_{-0.05}$. Using STAREVOL SEM, the inferred values are $\alpha_2 = 2.48^{+0.09}_{-0.11}$ and $\alpha_3 = 1.64^{+0.15}_{-0.02}$. We find the solution with PARSEC to have a significantly higher likelihood than that obtained with STAREVOL. The BGM FASt framework is now ready to address executions fitting all-sky Gaia data up to 14-17 apparent limiting magnitude. This will naturally allow us to derive both a reliable SFH for the early epochs of the Galactic disc evolution and a precise slope for the IMF at low masses.</description>

      <title>Connecting the dots: Tracing the evolutionary pathway of Polar Ring Galaxies in the cases of NGC 3718, NGC 2685, and NGC 4262</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03709v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Polar Ring Galaxies (PRGs) are a unique class of galaxies characterised by a ring of gas and stars orbiting nearly orthogonal to the main body. This study delves into the evolutionary trajectory of PRGs using the exemplary trio of NGC 3718, NGC 2685, and NGC 4262. We investigate the distinct features of PRGs by analysing their ring and host components to reveal their unique characteristics through Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) fitting. Using CIGALE, we performed SED fitting to independently analyse the ring and host spatially resolved regions, marking the first decomposed SED analysis for PRGs, which examines stellar populations using high-resolution observations from AstroSat UVIT at a resolved scale. The UV-optical surface profiles provide an initial idea that distinct patterns in the galaxies, with differences in FUV and NUV, suggest three distinct stages of ring evolution in the selected galaxies. The study of resolved-scale stellar regions reveals that the ring regions are generally younger than their host galaxies, with the age disparity progressively decreasing along the evolutionary sequence from NGC 3718 to NGC 4262. Star formation rates (SFR) also exhibit a consistent pattern, with higher SFR in the ring of NGC 3718 compared to the others, and a progressive decrease through NGC 2685 and NGC 4262. Finally, the representation of the galaxies in the HI gas fraction versus the NUV- r plane supports the idea that they are in three different evolutionary stages of PRG evolution, with NGC 3718 in the initial stage, NGC 2685 in the intermediate stage, and NGC 4262 representing the final stage. NGC 3718, NGC 2685, and NGC 4262 represent different stages of this evolution, highlighting the dynamic nature of PRGs and emphasising the importance of studying their evolutionary processes to gain insights into galactic formation and evolution.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Cosmic Variance on Inferences of Global Neutral Fraction Derived from Ly$\alpha$ Luminosity Functions During Reionization</title>

Abstract: We investigate the impact of field-to-field variation, deriving from cosmic variance, in measured Lyman-$\alpha$ emitter (LAE) luminosity functions (LFs) and this variation's impact on inferences of the neutral fraction of the intergalactic medium (IGM) during reionization. We post-process a z=7 IGM simulation to populate the dark matter halos with LAEs. These LAEs have realistic UV magnitudes, Ly$\alpha$ fluxes, and Ly$\alpha$ line profiles. We calculate the attenuation of Ly$\alpha$ emission in universes with varying IGM neutral fraction, $\bar{\rm{x}}_{\rm{HI}}$. In a $\bar{\rm{x}}_{\rm{HI}}=0.3$ simulation, we perform 100 realizations of a mock 2 square degree survey with a redshift window $\Delta z = 0.5$ and flux limit $\rm{f}_{Ly\alpha}&gt;1\times10^{-17}\:\rm{ergs}\:\: \rm{s}^{-1} \: \rm{cm}^{-2}$; such a survey is typical in depth and volume of the largest LAE surveys conducted today. For each realization, we compute the LAE LF and use it to recover the input $\bar{\rm{x}}_{\rm{HI}}$. Comparing the inferred values of $\bar{\rm{x}}_{\rm{HI}}$ across the ensemble of the surveys, we find that cosmic variance, deriving from large-scale structure and variation in the neutral gas along the sightline, imposes a floor in the uncertainty of $\Delta \bar{\rm{x}}_{\rm{HI}} \sim 0.2$ when $\bar{\rm{x}}_{\rm{HI}}$ $=0.3$. We explore mitigation strategies to decrease this uncertainty, such as increasing the volume, decreasing the flux limit, or probing the volume with many independent fields. Increasing the area and/or depth of the survey does not mitigate the uncertainty, but composing a survey with many independent fields is effective. This finding highlights the best strategy for LAE surveys aiming at constraining $\bar{\rm{x}}_{\rm{HI}}$ of the universe during reionization.</description>

      <title>HERACLES++: A multidimensional Eulerian code for exascale computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04428v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Numerical simulations of multidimensional astrophysical fluids present considerable challenges. However, the development of exascale computing has significantly enhanced computational capabilities, motivating the development of new codes that can take full advantage of these resources. In this article, we introduce HERACLES++, a new hydrodynamics code with high portability, optimized for exascale machines with different architectures and running efficiently both on CPUs and GPUs. The code is Eulerian and employs a Godunov finite-volume method to solve the hydrodynamics equations, which ensures accuracy in capturing shocks and discontinuities. It includes different Riemann solvers, equations of state, and gravity solvers. It works in Cartesian and spherical coordinates, either in 1D, 2D, or 3D, and uses passive scalars to handle gases with several species. The code accepts a user-supplied heating or cooling term to treat a variety of astrophysical contexts. In addition to the usual series of benchmarking tests, we use HERACLES++ to simulate the propagation of a supernova shock in a red-supergiant star envelope, from minutes after core collapse until shock emergence. In 1D, the results from HERACLES++ are in agreement with those of V1D for the same configuration. In 3D, the Rayleigh-Taylor instability develops and modifies the 1D picture by introducing density and composition fluctuations as well as turbulence. The focus on a wedge, rather than the full solid angle, and the ability to run HERACLES++ with a large number of GPUs allow for long-term simulations of 3D supernova ejecta with a sub-degree resolution. Future developments will extend HERACLES++ to a radiation-hydrodynamics code.</description>
