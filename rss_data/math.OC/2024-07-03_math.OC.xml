      <title>Subpath-Based Column Generation for the Electric Routing-Scheduling Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by widespread electrification targets, this paper studies an electric routing-scheduling problem (ERSP) that jointly optimizes routing-scheduling and charging decisions. The ERSP is formulated as a semi-infinite set-partitioning model, where continuous charging decisions result in infinitely-many path-based variables. To solve it, we develop a column generation algorithm with a bi-level label-setting algorithm to decompose the pricing problem into (i) a first-level procedure to generate subpaths between charging stations, and (ii) a second-level procedure to combine subpaths into paths. We formalize subpath-based domination properties to establish the finite convergence and exactness of the column generation algorithm. We prove that the methodology can handle modeling extensions with heterogeneous charging costs (via dynamic re-optimization of charging decisions) and algorithm extensions to tighten the relaxation using ng-routes and limited-memory subset-row inequalities (via augmented domination criteria). Computational results show that the methodology scales to large instances, outperforming state-of-the-art column generation algorithms. From a practical standpoint, the methodology achieves significant cost reductions by jointly optimizing routing-scheduling and charging decisions and by capturing heterogeneous charging costs.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Iterative Methods for Online Rank Aggregation from Pairwise Comparisons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider large-scale ranking problems where one is given a set of (possibly non-redundant) pairwise comparisons and the underlying ranking explained by those comparisons is desired. We show that stochastic gradient descent approaches can be leveraged to offer convergence to a solution that reveals the underlying ranking while requiring low-memory operations. We introduce several variations of this approach that offer a tradeoff in speed and convergence when the pairwise comparisons are noisy (i.e., some comparisons do not respect the underlying ranking). We prove theoretical results for convergence almost surely and study several regimes including those with full observations, partial observations, and noisy observations. Our empirical results give insights into the number of observations required as well as how much noise in those measurements can be tolerated.</description>

      <title>A novel shape optimization approach for source identification in elliptic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel shape optimization approach for the source identification of elliptic equations. This identification problem arises from two application backgrounds: actuator placement in PDE-constrained optimal controls and the regularized least-squares formulation of source identifications. The optimization problem seeks both the source strength and its support. By eliminating the variable associated with the source strength, we reduce the problem to a shape optimization problem for a coupled elliptic system, known as the first-order optimality system. As a model problem, we derive the shape derivative for the regularized least-squares formulation of the inverse source problem and propose a gradient descent shape optimization algorithm, implemented using the level-set method. Several numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed algorithms.</description>

      <title>Competing for the most profitable tour: The orienteering interdiction game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The orienteering problem is a well-studied and fundamental problem in transportation science. In the problem, we are given a graph with prizes on the nodes and lengths on the edges, together with a budget on the overall tour length. The goal is to find a tour that respects the length budget and maximizes the collected prizes. In this work, we introduce the orienteering interdiction game, in which a competitor (the leader) tries to minimize the total prize that the follower can collect within a feasible tour. To this end, the leader interdicts some of the nodes so that the follower cannot collect their prizes. The resulting interdiction game is formulated as a bilevel optimization problem, and a single-level reformulation is obtained based on interdiction cuts. A branch-and-cut algorithm with several enhancements, including the use of a solution pool, a cut pool and a heuristic method for the follower's problem, is proposed. In addition to this exact approach, a genetic algorithm is developed to obtain high-quality solutions in a short computing time. In a computational study based on instances from the literature for the orienteering problem, the usefulness of the proposed algorithmic components is assessed, and the branch-and-cut and genetic algorithms are compared in terms of solution time and quality.</description>

      <title>On finite termination of quasi-Newton methods on quadratic problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasi-Newton methods form an important class of methods for solving nonlinear optimization problems. In such methods, first order information is used to approximate the second derivative. The aim is to mimic the fast convergence that can be guaranteed by Newton-based methods. In the best case, quasi-Newton methods will far outperform steepest descent and other first order methods, without the computational cost of calculating the exact second derivative. These convergence guarantees hold locally, which follows closely from the fact that if the objective function is strongly convex it can be approximated well by a quadratic function close to the solution. Understanding the performance of quasi-Newton methods on quadratic problems with a symmetric positive definite Hessian is therefore of vital importance. In the classic case, an approximation of the Hessian is updated at every iteration and exact line search is used. It is well known that the algorithm terminates finitely, even when the Hessian approximation is memoryless, i.e. requires only the most recent information. In this paper, we explore the possibilities in which reliance on exact line search and dependence on conjugate search directions can be relaxed, while preserving finite termination properties of quasi-Newton methods on quadratic problems.</description>

      <title>Incremental Gauss--Newton Methods with Superlinear Convergence Rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of solving large-scale nonlinear equations with H\"older continuous Jacobians. We introduce a novel Incremental Gauss--Newton (IGN) method within explicit superlinear convergence rate, which outperforms existing methods that only achieve linear convergence rate. In particular, we formulate our problem by the nonlinear least squares with finite-sum structure, and our method incrementally iterates with the information of one component in each round. We also provide a mini-batch extension to our IGN method that obtains an even faster superlinear convergence rate. Furthermore, we conduct numerical experiments to show the advantages of the proposed methods.</description>

      <title>Conditions for singular optimal control of port-Hamiltonian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study singular optimal control problems of port-Hamiltonian systems. We study general control-affine cost functionals that include as a special case the energy supplied to the system. We derive optimality conditions for the case with and without control bounds by applying the general theory to the specially structured port-Hamiltonian case, and show that this leads to nice optimality conditions, in particular in the linear case.</description>

      <title>Asynchronous Parallel Policy Gradient Methods for the Linear Quadratic Regulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning policies in an asynchronous parallel way is essential to the numerous successes of RL for solving large-scale problems. However, their convergence performance is still not rigorously evaluated. To this end, we adopt the asynchronous parallel zero-order policy gradient (AZOPG) method to solve the continuous-time linear quadratic regulation problem. Specifically, as in the celebrated A3C algorithm, there are multiple parallel workers to asynchronously estimate PGs which are then sent to a central master for policy updates. Via quantifying its convergence rate of policy iterations, we show the linear speedup property of the AZOPG, both in theory and simulation, which clearly reveals the advantages of using parallel workers for learning policies.</description>

      <title>Nesterov's Accelerated Jacobi-Type Methods for Large-scale Symmetric Positive Semidefinite Linear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solving symmetric positive semidefinite linear systems is an essential task in many scientific computing problems. While Jacobi-type methods, including the classical Jacobi method and the weighted Jacobi method, exhibit simplicity in their forms and friendliness to parallelization, they are not attractive either because of the potential convergence failure or their slow convergence rate. This paper aims to showcase the possibility of improving classical Jacobi-type methods by employing Nesterov's acceleration technique that results in an accelerated Jacobi-type method with improved convergence properties. Simultaneously, it preserves the appealing features for parallel implementation. In particular, we show that the proposed method has an $O\left(\frac{1}{t^2}\right)$ convergence rate in terms of objective function values of the associated convex quadratic optimization problem, where $t\geq 1$ denotes the iteration counter. To further improve the practical performance of the proposed method, we also develop and analyze a restarted variant of the method, which is shown to have an $O\left(\frac{(\log_2(t))^2}{t^2}\right)$ convergence rate when the coefficient matrix is positive definite. Furthermore, we conduct appropriate numerical experiments to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed method. Our numerical results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the classical Jacobi-type methods and the conjugate gradient method and shows a comparable performance as the preconditioned conjugate gradient method with a diagonal preconditioner. Finally, we develop a parallel implementation and conduct speed-up tests on some large-scale systems. Our results indicate that the proposed framework is highly scalable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A vertex exchange method is proposed for solving the strongly convex quadratic program subject to the generalized simplex constraint. We conduct rigorous convergence analysis for the proposed algorithm and demonstrate its essential roles in solving some important classes of constrained convex optimization. To get a feasible initial point to execute the algorithm, we also present and analyze a highly efficient semismooth Newton method for computing the projection onto the generalized simplex. The excellent practical performance of the proposed algorithms is demonstrated by a set of extensive numerical experiments. Our theoretical and numerical results further motivate the potential applications of the considered model and the proposed algorithms.</description>

      <title>Optimized Receiver Design for Entanglement-Assisted Communication using BPSK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The use of pre-shared entanglement in entanglement-assisted communication offers a superior alternative to classical communication, especially in the photon-starved regime and highly noisy environments. In this paper, we analyze the performance of several low-complexity receivers that use optical parametric amplifiers. The simulations demonstrate that receivers employing an entanglement-assisted scheme with phase-shift-keying modulation can outperform classical capacities. We present a 2x2 optical hybrid receiver for entanglement-assisted communication and show that it has a roughly 10% lower error probability compared to previously proposed optical parametric amplifier-based receivers for more than 10 modes. However, the capacity of the optical parametric amplifier-based receiver exceeds the Holevo capacity and the capacities of the optical phase conjugate receiver and 2x2 optical hybrid receiver in the case of a single mode. The numerical findings indicate that surpassing the Holevo and Homodyne capacities does not require a large number of signal-idler modes. Furthermore, we find that using unequal priors for BPSK provides roughly three times the information rate advantage over equal priors.</description>

      <title>Uniform Transformation: Refining Latent Representation in Variational Autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Irregular distribution in latent space causes posterior collapse, misalignment between posterior and prior, and ill-sampling problem in Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). In this paper, we introduce a novel adaptable three-stage Uniform Transformation (UT) module -- Gaussian Kernel Density Estimation (G-KDE) clustering, non-parametric Gaussian Mixture (GM) Modeling, and Probability Integral Transform (PIT) -- to address irregular latent distributions. By reconfiguring irregular distributions into a uniform distribution in the latent space, our approach significantly enhances the disentanglement and interpretability of latent representations, overcoming the limitation of traditional VAE models in capturing complex data structures. Empirical evaluations demonstrated the efficacy of our proposed UT module in improving disentanglement metrics across benchmark datasets -- dSprites and MNIST. Our findings suggest a promising direction for advancing representation learning techniques, with implication for future research in extending this framework to more sophisticated datasets and downstream tasks.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Distributed Optimization: A Primal-Dual Perspective on Local Steps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In distributed machine learning, efficient training across multiple agents with different data distributions poses significant challenges. Even with a centralized coordinator, current algorithms that achieve optimal communication complexity typically require either large minibatches or compromise on gradient complexity. In this work, we tackle both centralized and decentralized settings across strongly convex, convex, and nonconvex objectives. We first demonstrate that a basic primal-dual method, (Accelerated) Gradient Ascent Multiple Stochastic Gradient Descent (GA-MSGD), applied to the Lagrangian of distributed optimization inherently incorporates local updates, because the inner loops of running Stochastic Gradient Descent on the primal variable require no inter-agent communication. Notably, for strongly convex objectives, we show (Accelerated) GA-MSGD achieves linear convergence in communication rounds despite the Lagrangian being only linear in the dual variables. This is due to a unique structural property where the dual variable is confined to the span of the coupling matrix, rendering the dual problem strongly concave. When integrated with the Catalyst framework, our approach achieves nearly optimal communication complexity across various settings without the need for minibatches. Moreover, in stochastic decentralized problems, it attains communication complexities comparable to those in deterministic settings, improving over existing algorithms.</description>

      <title>Graphon Particle Systems, Part II: Dynamics of Distributed Stochastic Continuum Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the distributed optimization problem over a graphon with a continuum of nodes, which is regarded as the limit of the distributed networked optimization as the number of nodes goes to infinity. Each node has a private local cost function. The global cost function, which all nodes cooperatively minimize, is the integral of the local cost functions on the node set. We propose stochastic gradient descent and gradient tracking algorithms over the graphon. We establish a general lemma for the upper bound estimation related to a class of time-varying differential inequalities with negative linear terms, based upon which, we prove that for both kinds of algorithms, the second moments of the nodes' states are uniformly bounded. Especially, for the stochastic gradient tracking algorithm, we transform the convergence analysis into the asymptotic property of coupled nonlinear differential inequalities with time-varying coefficients and develop a decoupling method. For both kinds of algorithms, we show that by choosing the time-varying algorithm gains properly, all nodes' states achieve $\mathcal{L}^{\infty}$-consensus for a connected graphon. Furthermore, if the local cost functions are strongly convex, then all nodes' states converge to the minimizer of the global cost function and the auxiliary states in the stochastic gradient tracking algorithm converge to the gradient value of the global cost function at the minimizer uniformly in mean square.</description>

      <title>Convergence of Implicit Gradient Descent for Training Two-Layer Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optimization algorithms is crucial in training physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), unsuitable methods may lead to poor solutions. Compared to the common gradient descent algorithm, implicit gradient descent (IGD) outperforms it in handling some multi-scale problems. In this paper, we provide convergence analysis for the implicit gradient descent for training over-parametrized two-layer PINNs. We first demonstrate the positive definiteness of Gram matrices for general smooth activation functions, like sigmoidal function, softplus function, tanh function and so on. Then the over-parameterization allows us to show that the randomly initialized IGD converges a globally optimal solution at a linear convergence rate. Moreover, due to the different training dynamics, the learning rate of IGD can be chosen independent of the sample size and the least eigenvalue of the Gram matrix.</description>

      <title>Robust optimal investment and consumption strategies with portfolio constraints and stochastic environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a continuous-time investment-consumption problem with model uncertainty in a general diffusion-based market with random model coefficients. We assume that a power utility investor is ambiguity-averse, with the preference to robustness captured by the homothetic multiplier robust specification, and the investor's investment and consumption strategies are constrained to closed convex sets. To solve this constrained robust control problem, we employ the stochastic Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman-Isaacs equations, backward stochastic differential equations, and bounded mean oscillation martingale theory. Furthermore, we show the investor incurs (non-negative) utility loss, i.e. the loss in welfare, if model uncertainty is ignored. When the model coefficients are deterministic, we establish formally the relationship between the investor's robustness preference and the robust optimal investment-consumption strategy and the value function, and the impact of investment and consumption constraints on the investor's robust optimal investment-consumption strategy and value function. Extensive numerical experiments highlight the significant impact of ambiguity aversion, consumption and investment constraints, on the investor's robust optimal investment-consumption strategy, utility loss, and value function. Key findings include: 1) short-selling restriction always reduces the investor's utility loss when model uncertainty is ignored; 2) the effect of consumption constraints on utility loss is more delicate and relies on the investor's risk aversion level.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel variational quantum approach for solving a class of nonlinear optimal control problems. Our approach integrates Dirac's canonical quantization of dynamical systems with the solution of the ground state of the resulting non-Hermitian Hamiltonian via a variational quantum eigensolver (VQE). We introduce a new perspective on the Dirac bracket formulation for generalized Hamiltonian dynamics in the presence of constraints, providing a clear motivation and illustrative examples. Additionally, we explore the structural properties of Dirac brackets within the context of multidimensional constrained optimization problems.
  Our approach for solving a class of nonlinear optimal control problems employs a VQE-based approach to determine the eigenstate and corresponding eigenvalue associated with the ground state energy of a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. Assuming access to an ideal VQE, our formulation demonstrates excellent results, as evidenced by selected computational examples. Furthermore, our method performs well when combined with a VQE-based approach for non-Hermitian Hamiltonian systems. Our VQE-based formulation effectively addresses challenges associated with a wide range of optimal control problems, particularly in high-dimensional scenarios. Compared to standard classical approaches, our quantum-based method shows significant promise and offers a compelling alternative for tackling complex, high-dimensional optimization challenges.</description>

      <title>Global propagation of analyticity and unique continuation for semilinear waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we develop a new method to prove both global propagation of analyticity and unique continuation in finite time for solutions of semilinear wave-type equations with analytic nonlinearity. It combines control theory techniques and Galerkin approximation, inspired by Hale-Raugel, to prove that analyticity in time can be propagated for the nonlinear equation from a zone where linear observability holds towards the full space.For semilinear wave equations with Dirichlet boundary condition on a bounded domain, this implies that analyticity can be propagated to the entire domain from a subset $\omega$ that satisfies the geometric control condition. It also implies the unique continuation when the solution is assumed to be zero on $\omega$. When the nonlinearity is assumed to be subcritical and defocusing, we also obtain observability estimates in the optimal time of the geometric control condition.For semilinear plate equations, similar propagation of analyticity is achieved by assuming the controllability of the linear Schr\''odinger equation.</description>

      <title>Homogenization of layered materials with rigid components in two-slip finite crystal plasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is an extension of the result by Christowiak and Kreisbeck (2017), which addresses the Gamma-convergence approach to a homogenization problem for composite materials consisting of two distinct types of parallel layers. In Christowiak et al. (2017), one of the layers of the material undergoes only local rotations while the other allows local rotation and plastic deformation along a single slip system. On the other hand, real materials show an interplay of multiple directions of slip. Here we obtain the Gamma-limit for the problem where the number of slip directions is increased to two. When the slip systems are orthogonal, we derive the full homogenized energy based on generalized convex envelopes of the original energy density. Since these envelopes are not completely known for angles between slip directions differing from the right angle, we present a partial, conditional homogenization result in this general case. The analysis is based on a modification of the classical construction of laminate microstructures but several nontrivial difficulties arise due to nonconvex constraints being present in the composite energy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.05825v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a squared smoothing Newton method via the Huber smoothing function for solving semidefinite programming problems (SDPs). We first study the fundamental properties of the matrix-valued mapping defined upon the Huber function. Using these results and existing ones in the literature, we then conduct rigorous convergence analysis and establish convergence properties for the proposed algorithm. In particular, we show that the proposed method is well-defined and admits global convergence. Moreover, under suitable regularity conditions, i.e., the primal and dual constraint nondegenerate conditions, the proposed method is shown to have a superlinear convergence rate. To evaluate the practical performance of the algorithm, we conduct extensive numerical experiments for solving various classes of SDPs. Comparison with the state-of-the-art SDP solvers demonstrates that our method is also efficient for computing accurate solutions of SDPs.</description>

      <title>Controlling a Vlasov-Poisson plasma by a Particle-In-Cell method based on a Monte Carlo framework</title>

Abstract: The Vlasov-Poisson system describes the time evolution of a plasma in the so-called collisionless regime. The investigation of a high-temperature plasma that is influenced by an exterior magnetic field is one of the most significant aspects of thermonuclear fusion research. In this paper, we formulate and analyze a kinetic optimal control problem for the Vlasov-Poisson system where the control is represented by an external magnetic field. The main goal of such optimal control problems is to confine the plasma in a certain region in phase space. We first investigate the optimal control problem in terms of mathematical analysis, i.e., we show the existence of at least one global minimizer and we rigorously derive a first-order necessary optimality condition for local minimizers by the adjoint approach. Then, we build a Monte Carlo framework to solve the state equations as well as the adjoint equations by means of a Particle-In-Cell method, and we apply a nonlinear conjugate gradient method to solve the optimization problem. Eventually, we present numerical experiments that successfully validate our optimization framework.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical distributed scenario-based model predictive control of interconnected microgrids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.10901v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Microgrids are autonomous clusters of generators, storage units and loads. Special requirements arise in interconnected operation: control schemes that do not require individual microgrids to disclose information about their internal structure and operating objectives are preferred for privacy reasons. Moreover, a safe and economically meaningful operation shall be achieved in presence of uncertain load and weather-dependent availability of renewable infeed. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical distributed model predictive control approach that satisfies these requirements. Specifically, we demonstrate that costs and safety of supply can be improved through a scenario-based stochastic control scheme. In a numerical case study, our approach is compared to a certainty equivalence and a prescient scheme. The results illustrate good performance as well as sufficiently fast convergence.</description>

      <title>Copositivity criteria of a class of fourth order 3-dimensional symmetric tensors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.01683v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we mainly dicuss the non-negativity conditions for quartic homogeneous polynomials with 3 variables, which is the analytic conditions of copositivity of a class of 4th order 3-dimensional symmetric tensors. For a 4th order 3-dimensional symmetric tensor with its entries $1$ or $-1$, an analytic necessary and sufficient condition is given for its strict copositivity with the help of the properties of strictly semi-positive tensors. And by means of usual maxi-min theory, a necessary and sufficient condition is established for copositivity of such a tensor also. Applying these conclusions to a general 4th order 3-dimensional symmetric tensor, the analytic conditions are successfully obtained for verifying the (strict) copositivity, and these conditions can be very easily parsed and validated. Moreover, several (strict) inequalities of ternary quartic homogeneous polynomial are established by means of these analytic conditions.</description>

      <title>Backstepping Neural Operators for $2\times 2$ Hyperbolic PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16762v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep neural network approximation of nonlinear operators, commonly referred to as DeepONet, has proven capable of approximating PDE backstepping designs in which a single Goursat-form PDE governs a single feedback gain function. In boundary control of coupled PDEs, coupled Goursat-form PDEs govern two or more gain kernels-a PDE structure unaddressed thus far with DeepONet. In this paper, we explore the subject of approximating systems of gain kernel PDEs for hyperbolic PDE plants by considering a simple counter-convecting $2\times 2$ coupled system in whose control a $2\times 2$ kernel PDE system in Goursat form arises. Engineering applications include oil drilling, the Saint-Venant model of shallow water waves, and the Aw-Rascle-Zhang model of stop-and-go instability in congested traffic flow. We establish the continuity of the mapping from a total of five plant PDE functional coefficients to the kernel PDE solutions, prove the existence of an arbitrarily close DeepONet approximation to the kernel PDEs, and ensure that the DeepONet-approximated gains guarantee stabilization when replacing the exact backstepping gain kernels. Taking into account anti-collocated boundary actuation and sensing, our $L^2$-Globally-exponentially stabilizing (GES) approximate gain kernel-based output feedback design implies the deep learning of both the controller's and the observer's gains. Moreover, the encoding of the output-feedback law into DeepONet ensures semi-global practical exponential stability (SG-PES). The DeepONet operator speeds up the computation of the controller gains by multiple orders of magnitude. Its theoretically proven stabilizing capability is demonstrated through simulations.</description>

      <title>A New Fast Adaptive Linearized Alternating Direction Multiplier Method for Convex Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11435v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work proposes a novel adaptive linearized alternating direction multiplier method (LADMM) to convex optimization, which improves the convergence rate of the LADMM-based algorithm by adjusting step-size iteratively.The innovation of this method is to utilize the information of the current iteration point to adaptively select the appropriate parameters, thus expanding the selection of the subproblem step size and improving the convergence rate of the algorithm while ensuring convergence.The advantage of this method is that it can improve the convergence rate of the algorithm as much as possible without compromising the convergence. This is very beneficial for the solution of optimization problems because the traditional linearized alternating direction multiplier method has a trade-off in the selection of the regular term coefficients: larger coefficients ensure convergence but tend to lead to small step sizes, while smaller coefficients allow for an increase in the iterative step size but tend to lead to the algorithm's non-convergence. This balance can be better handled by adaptively selecting the parameters, thus improving the efficiency of the algorithm.</description>

      <title>Minimax problems for ensembles of affine-control systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05782v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider ensembles of affine-control systems in $\mathbb{R}^d$, and we study simultaneous optimal control problems related to the worst-case minimization. After proving that such problems admit solutions, denoting with $(\Theta^N)_N$ a sequence of compact sets that parametrize the ensembles of systems, we first show that the corresponding minimax optimal control problems are $\Gamma$-convergent whenever $(\Theta^N)_N$ has a limit with respect to the Hausdorff distance. Besides its independent interest, the previous result is crucial role for establishing the Pontryagin Maximum Principle (PMP) when the ensemble is parametrized by a set $\Theta$ consisting of infinitely many points. Namely, we first approximate $\Theta$ by finite and increasing-in-size sets $(\Theta^N)_N$ for which the PMP is known, and then we derive the PMP for the $\Gamma$-limiting problem. The same strategy can be pursued in applications, where we can reduce infinite ensembles to finite ones to compute the minimizers numerically. We bring as a numerical example the Schr\"odinger equation for a qubit with uncertain resonance frequency.</description>

Abstract: We present a methodology for determining the relationship between the optimal control points of a power storage facility and a number of different factors including storage level and temperature. The interaction between different factors is considered to allow for the identification of a precise optimal control strategy to maximise the profits of a power storage facility under a variety of different conditions. The methodology is based upon traditional stochastic techniques, however by working directly with excess demand data is model independent and does not require identification of the underlying process.</description>

Abstract: This paper introduces and develops novel coderivative-based Newton methods with Wolfe linesearch conditions to solve various classes of problems in nonsmooth optimization. We first propose a generalized regularized Newton method with Wolfe linesearch (GRNM-W) for unconstrained $C^{1,1}$ minimization problems (which are second-order nonsmooth) and establish global as well as local superlinear convergence of their iterates. To deal with convex composite minimization problems (which are first-order nonsmooth and can be constrained), we combine the proposed GRNM-W with two algorithmic frameworks: the forward-backward envelope and the augmented Lagrangian method resulting in the two new algorithms called CNFB and CNAL, respectively. Finally, we present numerical results to solve Lasso and support vector machine problems appearing in, e.g., machine learning and statistics, which demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithms.</description>

      <title>Traffic State Estimation for Connected Vehicles using the Second-Order Aw-Rascle-Zhang Traffic Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.02848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.02848v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of traffic state estimation (TSE) in the presence of heterogeneous sensors which include both fixed and moving sensors. Traditional fixed sensors are expensive and cannot be installed throughout the highway. Moving sensors such as Connected Vehicles (CVs) offer a relatively cheap alternative to measure traffic states across the network. Moving forward it is thus important to develop such models that effectively use the data from CVs. One such model is the nonlinear second-order Aw-Rascle-Zhang (ARZ) model which is a realistic traffic model, reliable for TSE and control. A state-space formulation is presented for the ARZ model considering junctions in the formulation which is important to model real highways with ramps. A Moving Horizon Estimation (MHE) implementation is presented for TSE using a linearized ARZ model. Various state-estimation methods used for TSE in the literature along with the presented approach are compared with regard to accuracy and computational tractability with the help of a numerical study using the VISSIM traffic simulation software. The impact of various strategies for querying CV data on the estimation performance is also considered. Several research questions are posed and addressed with a thorough analysis of the results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.02755v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose and analyze a nonlinear dynamic model of continuous-time multi-dimensional belief formation over signed social networks. Our model accounts for the effects of a structured belief system, self-appraisal, internal biases, and various sources of cognitive dissonance posited by recent theories in social psychology. We prove that agents become opinionated as a consequence of a bifurcation. We analyze how the balance of social network effects in the model controls the nature of the bifurcation and, therefore, the belief-forming limit-set solutions. Our analysis provides constructive conditions on how multi-stable network belief equilibria and belief oscillations emerging at a belief-forming bifurcation depend on the communication network graph and belief system network graph. Our model and analysis provide new theoretical insights on the dynamics of social systems and a new principled framework for designing decentralized decision-making on engineered networks in the presence of structured relationships among alternatives.</description>

      <title>A Computational Framework for Solving Wasserstein Lagrangian Flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.10649v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dynamical formulation of the optimal transport can be extended through various choices of the underlying geometry (kinetic energy), and the regularization of density paths (potential energy). These combinations yield different variational problems (Lagrangians), encompassing many variations of the optimal transport problem such as the Schr\"odinger bridge, unbalanced optimal transport, and optimal transport with physical constraints, among others. In general, the optimal density path is unknown, and solving these variational problems can be computationally challenging. We propose a novel deep learning based framework approaching all of these problems from a unified perspective. Leveraging the dual formulation of the Lagrangians, our method does not require simulating or backpropagating through the trajectories of the learned dynamics, and does not need access to optimal couplings. We showcase the versatility of the proposed framework by outperforming previous approaches for the single-cell trajectory inference, where incorporating prior knowledge into the dynamics is crucial for correct predictions.</description>

      <title>Enhancing power grid resilience to cyber-physical attacks using distributed retail electricity markets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.05145v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose using a hierarchical retail market structure to alert and dispatch resources to mitigate cyber-physical attacks on a distribution grid. We simulate attacks where a number of generation nodes in a distribution grid are attacked. We show that the market is able to successfully meet the shortfall between demand and supply by utilizing the flexibility of remaining resources while minimizing any extra power that needs to be imported from the main transmission grid. This includes utilizing upward flexibility or reserves of remaining online generators and some curtailment or shifting of flexible loads, which results in higher costs. Using price signals and market-based coordination, the grid operator can achieve its objectives without direct control over distributed energy resources and is able to accurately compensate prosumers for the grid support they provide.</description>
