      <title>Graph signal aware decomposition of dynamic networks via latent graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamics on and of networks refer to changes in topology and node-associated signals, respectively and are pervasive in many socio-technological systems, including social, biological, and infrastructure networks. Due to practical constraints, privacy concerns, or malfunctions, we often observe only a fraction of the topological evolution and associated signal, which not only hinders downstream tasks but also restricts our analysis of network evolution. Such aspects could be mitigated by moving our attention at the underlying latent driving factors of the network evolution, which can be naturally uncovered via low-rank tensor decomposition. Tensor-based methods provide a powerful means of uncovering the underlying factors of network evolution through low-rank decompositions. However, the extracted embeddings typically lack a relational structure and are obtained independently from the node signals. This disconnect reduces the interpretability of the embeddings and overlooks the coupling between topology and signals. To address these limitations, we propose a novel two-way decomposition to represent a dynamic graph topology, where the structural evolution is captured by a linear combination of latent graph adjacency matrices reflecting the overall joint evolution of both the topology and the signal. Using spatio-temporal data, we estimate the latent adjacency matrices and their temporal scaling signatures via alternating minimization, and prove that our approach converges to a stationary point. Numerical results show that the proposed method recovers individually and collectively expressive latent graphs, outperforming both standard tensor-based decompositions and signal-based topology identification methods in reconstructing the missing network especially when observations are limited.</description>

      <title>Using co-sharing to identify use of mainstream news for promoting potentially misleading narratives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.06459v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Much of the research quantifying volume and spread of online misinformation measures the construct at the source level, identifying a set of specific unreliable domains that account for a relatively small share of news consumption. This source-level dichotomy obscures the potential for users to repurpose factually true information from reliable sources to advance misleading narratives. We demonstrate this potentially far more prevalent form of misinformation by identifying articles from reliable sources that are frequently co-shared with (shared by users who also shared) "fake" news on social media, and concurrently extracting narratives present in fake news content and claims fact-checked as false. Specifically in this study, we use Twitter/X data from May 2018 to November 2021 matched to a U.S. voter file. We find that narratives present in misinformation content are significantly more likely to occur in co-shared articles than in articles from the same reliable sources that are not co-shared, consistent with users using information from mainstream sources to enhance the credibility and reach of potentially misleading claims.</description>

      <title>Illusions of Intimacy: Emotional Attachment and Emerging Psychological Risks in Human-AI Relationships</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11649v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Emotionally responsive social chatbots, such as those produced by Replika and Character.AI, increasingly serve as companions that offer empathy, support, and entertainment. While these systems appear to meet fundamental human needs for connection, they raise concerns about how artificial intimacy affects emotional regulation, well-being, and social norms. Prior research has focused on user perceptions or clinical contexts but lacks large-scale, real-world analysis of how these interactions unfold. This paper addresses that gap by analyzing over 30K user-shared conversations with social chatbots to examine the emotional dynamics of human-AI relationships. Using computational methods, we identify patterns of emotional mirroring and synchrony that closely resemble how people build emotional connections. Our findings show that users-often young, male, and prone to maladaptive coping styles-engage in parasocial interactions that range from affectionate to abusive. Chatbots consistently respond in emotionally consistent and affirming ways. In some cases, these dynamics resemble toxic relationship patterns, including emotional manipulation and self-harm. These findings highlight the need for guardrails, ethical design, and public education to preserve the integrity of emotional connection in an age of artificial companionship.</description>

      <title>Filling in the Blanks? A Systematic Review and Theoretical Conceptualisation for Measuring WikiData Content Gaps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16383v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wikidata is a collaborative knowledge graph which provides machine-readable structured data for Wikimedia projects including Wikipedia. Managed by a community of volunteers, it has grown to become the most edited Wikimedia project. However, it features a long-tail of items with limited data and a number of systematic gaps within the available content. In this paper, we present the results of a systematic literature review aimed to understand the state of these content gaps within Wikidata. We propose a typology of gaps based on prior research and contribute a theoretical framework intended to conceptualise gaps and support their measurement. We also describe the methods and metrics present used within the literature and classify them according to our framework to identify overlooked gaps that might occur in Wikidata. We then discuss the implications for collaboration and editor activity within Wikidata as well as future research directions. Our results contribute to the understanding of quality, completeness and the impact of systematic biases within Wikidata and knowledge gaps more generally.</description>

      <title>BLUE: Bi-layer Heterogeneous Graph Fusion Network for Avian Influenza Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22692v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate forecasting of avian influenza outbreaks within wild bird populations requires models that account for complex, multi-scale transmission patterns driven by various factors. Spatio-temporal GNN-based models have recently gained traction for infection forecasting due to their ability to capture relations and flow between spatial regions, but most existing frameworks rely solely on spatial connections and their connections. This overlooks valuable genetic information at the case level, such as cases in one region being genetically descended from strains in another, which is essential for understanding how infectious diseases spread through epidemiological linkages beyond geography. We address this gap with BLUE, a B}i-Layer heterogeneous graph fUsion nEtwork designed to integrate genetic, spatial, and ecological data for accurate outbreak forecasting. The framework 1) builds heterogeneous graphs from multiple information sources and multiple layers, 2) smooths across relation types, 3) performs fusion while retaining structural patterns, and 4) predicts future outbreaks via an autoregressive graph sequence model that captures transmission dynamics over time. To facilitate further research, we introduce \textbf{Avian-US} dataset, the dataset for avian influenza outbreak forecasting in the United States, incorporating genetic, spatial, and ecological data across locations. BLUE achieves superior performance over existing baselines, highlighting the value of incorporating multi-layer information into infectious disease forecasting.</description>

      <title>The Face of Populism: Examining Differences in Facial Emotional Expressions of Political Leaders Using Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.09914v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Populist rhetoric employed on online media is characterized as deeply impassioned and often imbued with strong emotions. The aim of this paper is to empirically investigate the differences in affective nonverbal communication of political leaders. We use a deep-learning approach to process a sample of 220 YouTube videos of political leaders from 15 different countries, analyze their facial expressions of emotion and then examine differences in average emotion scores representing the relative presence of 6 emotional states (anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and surprise) and a neutral expression for each frame of the YouTube video. Based on a sample of manually coded images, we find that this deep-learning approach has 53-60\% agreement with human labels. We observe statistically significant differences in the average score of negative emotions between groups of leaders with varying degrees of populist rhetoric.</description>

      <title>Branch-and-cut algorithms for colorful components problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16508v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We tackle three optimization problems in which a colored graph, where each node is assigned a color, must be partitioned into colorful connected components. A component is defined as colorful if each color appears at most once. The problems differ in the objective function, which determines which partition is the best one. These problems have applications in community detection, cybersecurity, and bioinformatics. We present integer non-linear formulations, which are then linearized using standard techniques. To solve these formulations, we develop exact branch-and-cut algorithms, embedding various improving techniques, such as valid inequalities, bounds limiting the number of variables, and warm-start and preprocessing techniques. Extensive computational tests on benchmark instances demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed procedures. The branch-and-cut algorithms can solve reasonably sized instances efficiently. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose an exact algorithm for solving these problems.</description>

      <title>Emergence of network communities driven by local rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17042v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Natural systems are modeled by networks with nodes and links. Often the nodes are segregated into communities with different connectivity patterns. Node heterogeneity such as political affiliation in social networks or biological function in gene networks are highlighted as key factors driving the segregation of nodes into communities. Here, by means of numerical simulations, I show that node heterogeneity is not a necessary requirement. To this end I introduce the Ramsey community number, $r_ \kappa$, the minimum graph size that warranties the emergence of network communities with almost certainty. Using the stochastic block model and Infomap methods for community detection, I show that networks generated by local rules have finite $r_ \kappa$ values while their randomized versions do not have emergent communities. I conjecture that network communities are an emergent property of networks evolving with local rules.</description>
