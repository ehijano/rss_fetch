      <title>Zipf-Gramming: Scaling Byte N-Grams Up to Production Sized Malware Corpora</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A classifier using byte n-grams as features is the only approach we have found fast enough to meet requirements in size (sub 2 MB), speed (multiple GB/s), and latency (sub 10 ms) for deployment in numerous malware detection scenarios. However, we've consistently found that 6-8 grams achieve the best accuracy on our production deployments but have been unable to deploy regularly updated models due to the high cost of finding the top-k most frequent n-grams over terabytes of executable programs. Because the Zipfian distribution well models the distribution of n-grams, we exploit its properties to develop a new top-k n-gram extractor that is up to $35\times$ faster than the previous best alternative. Using our new Zipf-Gramming algorithm, we are able to scale up our production training set and obtain up to 30\% improvement in AUC at detecting new malware. We show theoretically and empirically that our approach will select the top-k items with little error and the interplay between theory and engineering required to achieve these results.</description>

      <title>Hessians in Birkhoff-Theoretic Trajectory Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper derives various Hessians associated with Birkhoff-theoretic methods for trajectory optimization. According to a theorem proved in this paper, approximately 80% of the eigenvalues are contained in the narrow interval [-2, 4] for all Birkhoff-discretized optimal control problems. A preliminary analysis of computational complexity is also presented with further discussions on the grand challenge of solving a million point trajectory optimization problem.</description>

      <title>Harnessing Batched BLAS/LAPACK Kernels on GPUs for Parallel Solutions of Block Tridiagonal Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03015v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a GPU implementation for the factorization and solution of block-tridiagonal symmetric positive definite linear systems, which commonly arise in time-dependent estimation and optimal control problems. Our method employs a recursive algorithm based on Schur complement reduction, transforming the system into a hierarchy of smaller, independent blocks that can be efficiently solved in parallel using batched BLAS/LAPACK routines. While batched routines have been used in sparse solvers, our approach applies these kernels in a tailored way by exploiting the block-tridiagonal structure known in advance. Performance benchmarks based on our open-source, cross-platform implementation, TBD-GPU, demonstrate the advantages of this tailored utilization: achieving substantial speed-ups compared to state-of-the-art CPU direct solvers, including CHOLMOD and HSL MA57, while remaining competitive with NVIDIA cuDSS. However, the current implementation still performs sequential calls of batched routines at each recursion level, and the block size must be sufficiently large to adequately amortize kernel launch overhead.</description>
