      <title>A simple LAD-LASSO coordinate descent algorithm for interactive browser-based GPU applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simultaneous variable selection and robust data fitting are important aspects of many mathematical modelling projects and a wide array of optimisation tools and techniques exist to support them. When the intention is to embed this capability in run-time interactive decision support tools running hundreds of such modelling tasks simultaneously on a GPU, the choices of implementation approach are more limited. Recently, simple and fast Coordinate Descent algorithms have been pro- posed which can implement the LASSO approach to variable selection in conjunction with ordinary least squares (OLS) data fitting. However extending this to use the more robust Least Absolute Deviation (LAD) data fitting has been hampered by the multiple axis wise local minima that occur in the objective function for this LAD-LASSO approach. This paper suggests that these multiple axis wise local minima form a locus which is monotonic in all the axes and that this locus has a convex objective function. Hence allowing the locus to be searched using a ternary chop algorithm that uses Coordinate Descent to identify multiple local minima (points on this locus) as required to find the global minimum. The resulting algorithm is very simple making it practical to implement it as a single thread on a GPU. This opens up the possibility of running many hundreds of such threads in parallel using coarse parallelisation [2]. These are early results in a wider project to explore the use of combi- natorial sub sets of data in interactive mathematical modelling support frameworks.</description>

      <title>CausalVerse: Benchmarking Causal Representation Learning with Configurable High-Fidelity Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14049v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Causal Representation Learning (CRL) aims to uncover the data-generating process and identify the underlying causal variables and relations, whose evaluation remains inherently challenging due to the requirement of known ground-truth causal variables and causal structure. Existing evaluations often rely on either simplistic synthetic datasets or downstream performance on real-world tasks, generally suffering a dilemma between realism and evaluative precision. In this paper, we introduce a new benchmark for CRL using high-fidelity simulated visual data that retains both realistic visual complexity and, more importantly, access to ground-truth causal generating processes. The dataset comprises around 200 thousand images and 3 million video frames across 24 sub-scenes in four domains: static image generation, dynamic physical simulations, robotic manipulations, and traffic situation analysis. These scenarios range from static to dynamic settings, simple to complex structures, and single to multi-agent interactions, offering a comprehensive testbed that hopefully bridges the gap between rigorous evaluation and real-world applicability. In addition, we provide flexible access to the underlying causal structures, allowing users to modify or configure them to align with the required assumptions in CRL, such as available domain labels, temporal dependencies, or intervention histories. Leveraging this benchmark, we evaluated representative CRL methods across diverse paradigms and offered empirical insights to assist practitioners and newcomers in choosing or extending appropriate CRL frameworks to properly address specific types of real problems that can benefit from the CRL perspective.
