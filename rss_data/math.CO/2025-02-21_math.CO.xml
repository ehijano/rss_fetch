      <title>Fractional revival on quasi-abelian Cayley graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fractional revival, a quantum transport phenomenon critical to entanglement generation in quantum spin networks, generalizes the notion of perfect state transfer on graphs. A Cayley graph $\mathrm{Cay}(G,S)$ is called quasi-abelian if its connection set $S$ is a union of conjugacy classes of the group $G$. In this paper, we establish a necessary and sufficient condition for quasi-abelian Cayley graphs to have fractional revival. This extends a result of Cao and Luo (2022) on the existence of fractional revival in Cayley graphs over abelian groups.</description>

      <title>Domination Parameters of Graph Covers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph $G$ is a \emph{cover} of a graph $F$ if there exists an onto mapping $\pi : V(G) \to V(F)$, called a (\emph{covering}) \emph{projection}, such that $\pi$ maps the neighbours of any vertex $v$ in $G$ bijectively onto the neighbours of $\pi(v)$ in $F$. This paper is the first attempt to study the connection between domination parameters and graph covers. We focus on the domination number, the total domination number, and the connected domination number. We prove tight upper bounds for the domination parameters of $G$. Moreover, we prove lower bounds for the domination parameters of $G$. Finally, we propose a conjecture on the lower bound for the domination number of $G$ and provide evidence to support the conjecture.</description>

      <title>Orientation-Reversing Crystallographic Rigidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides a combinatorial characterisation for generic forced symmetric rigidity of bar-joint frameworks in the Euclidean plane that are symmetric with respect to the orientation-reversing wallpaper group $\mathbb{Z}^2\rtimes\mathcal{C}_s$, also known as $pm$ in crystallography, under a fixed lattice representation. Corresponding results for the wallpaper groups $cm$ and $pg$ follow directly from this. The method used also provides an inductive construction for the corresponding gain graphs, in terms of Henneberg-type graph operations.</description>

      <title>Polycyclic Geometric Realizations of the Gray Configuration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Gray configuration is a (27_3) configuration which typically is realized as the points and lines of the 3 x 3 x 3 integer lattice. It occurs as a member of an infinite family of configurations defined by Bouwer in 1972. Since their discovery, both the Gray configuration and its Levi graph (i.e., its point-line incidence graph) have been the subject of intensive study. Its automorphism group contains cyclic subgroups isomorphic to Z_3 and Z_9, so it is natural to ask whether the Gray configuration can be realized in the plane with any of the corresponding rotational symmetry. In this paper, we show that there are two distinct polycyclic realizations with Z_3 symmetry. In contrast, the only geometric polycyclic realization with straight lines and Z_9 symmetry is only a "weak" realization, with extra unwanted incidences (in particular, the realization is actually a (27_4) configuration).</description>

      <title>Sharp thresholds for higher powers of Hamilton cycles in random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For $k \geq 4$, we establish that $p = (e/n)^{1/k}$ is a sharp threshold for the existence of the $k$-th power $H$ of a Hamilton cycle in the binomial random graph model. Our proof builds upon an approach by Riordan based on the second moment method, which previously established a weak threshold for $H$. This method expresses the second moment bound through contributions of subgraphs of $H$, with two key quantities: the number of copies of each subgraph in $H$ and the subgraphs' densities. We control these two quantities more precisely by carefully restructuring Riordan's proof and treating sparse and dense subgraphs of $H$ separately. This allows us to determine the exact constant in the threshold.</description>

      <title>On strong nodal domains for eigenfunctions of Hamming graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Laplacian matrix of the $n$-dimensional hypercube has $n+1$ distinct eigenvalues $2i$, where $0\leq i\leq n$. In 2004, B\i y\i ko\u{g}lu, Hordijk, Leydold, Pisanski and Stadler initiated the study of eigenfunctions of hypercubes with the minimum number of weak and strong nodal domains. In particular, they proved that for every $1\leq i\leq \frac{n}{2}$ there is an eigenfunction of the hypercube with eigenvalue $2i$ that have exactly two strong nodal domains. Based on computational experiments, they conjectured that the result also holds for all $1\leq i\leq n-2$. In this work, we confirm their conjecture for $i\leq \frac{2}{3}(n-\frac{1}{2})$ if $i$ is odd and for $i\leq \frac{2}{3}(n-1)$ if $i$ is even. We also consider this problem for the Hamming graph $H(n,q)$, $q\geq 3$ (for $q=2$, this graph coincides with the $n$-dimensional hypercube), and obtain even stronger results for all $q\geq 3$.</description>

      <title>A new measure of robustness of Erd\H{o}s--Ko--Rado Theorems on permutation groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce a new way of measuring the robustness of Erd\H{o}s--Ko--Rado (EKR) Theorems on permutation groups. EKR-type results can be viewed as results about the independence numbers of certain corresponding graphs, namely the derangement graphs, and random subgraphs of these graphs have been used to measure the robustness of these extremal results. In the context of permutation groups, the derangement graphs are Cayley graphs on the permutation group in question. We propose studying extremal properties of subgraphs of derangement graphs, that are themselves Cayley graphs of the group, to measure robustness.
  We present a variety of results about the robustness of the EKR property of various permutation groups using this new measure.</description>

      <title>Alternative set-theoretical algorithms for efficient computations of cliques in Vietoris-Rips complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying cliques in dense networks remains a formidable challenge, even with significant advances in computational power and methodologies. To tackle this, numerous algorithms have been developed to optimize time and memory usage, implemented across diverse programming languages. Yet, the inherent NP-completeness of the problem continues to hinder performance on large-scale networks, often resulting in memory leaks and slow computations. In the present study, we critically evaluate classic algorithms to pinpoint computational bottlenecks and introduce novel set-theoretical approaches tailored for network clique computation. Our proposed algorithms are rigorously implemented and benchmarked against existing Python-based solutions, demonstrating superior performance. These findings underscore the potential of set-theoretical techniques to drive substantial performance gains in network analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This note derives asymptotic upper and lower bounds for the number of planted plane trees on $n$ nodes assigned labels from the set $\{1,2,\ldots, k\}$ with the restriction that on any path from the root to a leaf, the labels must strictly decrease. We illustrate an application to calculating the largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix of a tree.</description>

      <title>Every Graph is Essential to Large Treewidth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that for every graph $H$, there is a hereditary weakly sparse graph class $\mathcal C_H$ of unbounded treewidth such that the $H$-free (i.e., excluding $H$ as an induced subgraph) graphs of $\mathcal C_H$ have bounded treewidth. This refutes several conjectures and critically thwarts the quest for the unavoidable induced subgraphs in classes of unbounded treewidth, a wished-for counterpart of the Grid Minor theorem. We actually show a stronger result: For every positive integer $t$, there is a hereditary graph class $\mathcal C_t$ of unbounded treewidth such that for any graph $H$ of treewidth at most $t$, the $H$-free graphs of $\mathcal C_t$ have bounded treewidth. Our construction is a variant of so-called layered wheels. We also introduce a framework of abstract layered wheels, based on their most salient properties. In particular, we streamline and extend key lemmas previously shown on individual layered wheels. We believe that this should greatly help develop this topic, which appears to be a very strong yet underexploited source of counterexamples.</description>

Abstract: We prove that $(1+o(1))\sqrt{e/n}$ is the sharp threshold for the appearance of the square of a Hamilton cycle in $G(n,p)$, confirming the conjecture of Kahn, Narayanan, and Park. We also find the exact asymptotics of the threshold for the emergence of a spanning subgraph isomorphic to a fixed graph $F$ for a wide family of $d$-regular graphs $F$. This family includes almost all $d$-regular graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X$ and $Y$ be upward closed set systems in the lattice of $\{0,1\}^n$. The celebrated Harris-Kleitman inequality implies that if $|X|=\alpha 2^n$, $|Y|=\beta 2^n$, the density of the set of points in exactly one of $X$ and $Y$ is maximal when $X$ and $Y$ are independent, meaning $|X\cap Y|=\alpha\beta 2^n$. Is the same true of three upward closed systems, $X$, $Y$, and $Z$? Suppose $|X|=|Y|=|Z|$. Kahn asked whether the set of points in exactly one of $X$, $Y$, $Z$ has density at most $\frac49$. We answer this question in the negative.</description>

      <title>Counting spinal phylogenetic networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phylogenetic networks are an important way to represent evolutionary histories that involve reticulations such as hybridization or horizontal gene transfer, yet fundamental questions such as how many networks there are that satisfy certain properties are very difficult. A new way to encode a large class of networks, using expanding covers, may provide a way to approach such problems. Expanding covers encode a large class of phylogenetic networks, called labellable networks. This class does not include all networks, but does include many familiar classes, including orchard, normal, tree-child and tree-sibling networks. As expanding covers are a combinatorial structure, it is possible that they can be used as a tool for counting such classes for a fixed number of leaves and reticulations, for which, in many cases, a closed formula has not yet been found. More recently, a new class of networks was introduced, called spinal networks, which are analogous to caterpillar trees for phylogenetic trees and can be fully described using covers. In the present article, we describe a method for counting networks that are both spinal and belong to some more familiar class, with the hope that these form a base case from which to attack the more general classes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we delve into the intricate relationship between the number of ring homomorphisms and surjective group homomorphisms between two finite cyclic structures, specifically $\mathbb{Z}_m$ and $\mathbb{Z}_n$. We demonstrate that the number of ring homomorphisms from $\mathbb{Z}_m$ to $\mathbb{Z}_n$ is a divisor of the number of surjective group homomorphisms from $\mathbb{Z}_m$ to $\mathbb{Z}_n$, provided that $n$ is not of the form $2 \cdot \alpha$, where each prime factor $p$ of $\alpha$ satisfies $p \equiv 3 \pmod{4}$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the interplay between different highest weight structures in the BGG category O of basic Lie superalgebras arising from distinct choices of Borel subalgebras-an aspect that has no analogous theory in the classical Lie algebra setting.
  We describe the compositions of homomorphisms between Verma supermodules arising from different highest weight structure but sharing the same character. This requires us to define a class of edge-colored graphs, defined purely graph theoretically, by extracting the exchange property of odd reflections. As an application of these homomorphisms, we generalize results of Coulembier-Serganova and Chen-Mazorchuk concerning the associated varieties and projective dimensions of Verma supermodules.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the last year, there have been some remarkable improvements in the combinatorial list-size bounds of Folded Reed Solomon codes and multiplicity codes. Starting from the work on Kopparty, Ron-Zewi, Saraf and Wootters (SIAM J. Comput. 2023) (and subsequent simplifications due to Tamo (IEEE Trans. Inform. Theory 2024), we have had dramatic improvements in the list-size bounds of FRS codes due to Srivastava (SODA 2025) and Chen &amp; Zhang (STOC 2025). In this note, we give a short exposition of these three results (Tamo, Srivastava and Chen-Zhang).</description>

      <title>Signless Laplacian State Transfer on Vertex Complemented Coronae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a graph $G$ with vertex set $V(G)=\{v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_{n_1}\}$ and a graph $H$ of order $n_2$, the vertex complemented corona, denoted by $G\tilde{\circ}{H}$, is the graph produced by copying $H$ $n_1$ times, with the $i$-th copy of $H$ corresponding to the vertex $v_i$, and then adding edges between any vertex in $V(G)\setminus\{v_{i}\}$ and any vertex of the $i$-th copy of $H$. The present article deals with quantum state transfer of vertex complemented coronae concerning signless Laplacian matrix. Our research investigates conditions in which signless Laplacian perfect state transfer exists or not on vertex complemented coronae. Additionally, we also provide some mild conditions for the class of graphs under consideration that allow signless Laplacian pretty good state transfer.</description>

      <title>Enumerating minimal dominating sets and variants in chordal bipartite graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Enumerating minimal dominating sets with polynomial delay in bipartite graphs is a long-standing open problem. To date, even the subcase of chordal bipartite graphs is open, with the best known algorithm due to Golovach, Heggernes, Kant\'e, Kratsch, Saether, and Villanger running in incremental-polynomial time. We improve on this result by providing a polynomial delay and space algorithm enumerating minimal dominating sets in chordal bipartite graphs. Additionally, we show that the total and connected variants admit polynomial and incremental-polynomial delay algorithms, respectively, within the same class. This provides an alternative proof of a result by Golovach et al. for total dominating sets, and answers an open question for the connected variant. Finally, we give evidence that the techniques used in this paper cannot be generalized to bipartite graphs for (total) minimal dominating sets, unless P = NP, and show that enumerating minimal connected dominating sets in bipartite graphs is harder than enumerating minimal transversals in general hypergraphs.</description>

      <title>Robust Information Selection for Hypothesis Testing with Misclassification Penalties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of robust information selection for a Bayesian hypothesis testing / classification task, where the goal is to identify the true state of the world from a finite set of hypotheses based on observations from the selected information sources. We introduce a novel misclassification penalty framework, which enables non-uniform treatment of different misclassification events. Extending the classical subset selection framework, we study the problem of selecting a subset of sources that minimize the maximum penalty of misclassification under a limited budget, despite deletions or failures of a subset of the selected sources. We characterize the curvature properties of the objective function and propose an efficient greedy algorithm with performance guarantees. Next, we highlight certain limitations of optimizing for the maximum penalty metric and propose a submodular surrogate metric to guide the selection of the information set. We propose a greedy algorithm with near-optimality guarantees for optimizing the surrogate metric. Finally, we empirically demonstrate the performance of our proposed algorithms in several instances of the information set selection problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a class of binary linear codes that generalizes the Reed-Muller family by replacing the group $\mathbb{Z}_2^m$ with an arbitrary finite Coxeter group. Similar to the Reed-Muller codes, this class is closed under duality and has rate determined by a Gaussian distribution. We also construct quantum CSS codes arising from the Coxeter codes, which admit transversal logical operators outside of the Clifford group.</description>

      <title>Polyhedral and Tropical Geometry of Flag Positroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.09131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.09131v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A flag positroid of ranks $\boldsymbol{r}:=(r_1&lt;\dots &lt;r_k)$ on $[n]$ is a flag matroid that can be realized by a real $r_k \times n$ matrix $A$ such that the $r_i \times r_i$ minors of $A$ involving rows $1,2,\dots,r_i$ are nonnegative for all $1\leq i \leq k$. In this paper we explore the polyhedral and tropical geometry of flag positroids, particularly when $\boldsymbol{r}:=(a, a+1,\dots,b)$ is a sequence of consecutive numbers. In this case we show that the nonnegative tropical flag variety TrFl$_{\boldsymbol{r},n}^{\geq 0}$ equals the nonnegative flag Dressian FlDr$_{\boldsymbol{r},n}^{\geq 0}$, and that the points $\boldsymbol{\mu} = (\mu_a,\ldots, \mu_b)$ of TrFl$_{\boldsymbol{r},n}^{\geq 0} =$ FlDr$_{\boldsymbol{r},n}^{\geq 0}$ give rise to coherent subdivisions of the flag positroid polytope $P(\underline{\boldsymbol{\mu}})$ into flag positroid polytopes. Our results have applications to Bruhat interval polytopes: for example, we show that a complete flag matroid polytope is a Bruhat interval polytope if and only if its $(\leq 2)$-dimensional faces are Bruhat interval polytopes. Our results also have applications to realizability questions. We define a positively oriented flag matroid to be a sequence of positively oriented matroids $(\chi_1,\dots,\chi_k)$ which is also an oriented flag matroid. We then prove that every positively oriented flag matroid of ranks $\boldsymbol{r}=(a,a+1,\dots,b)$ is realizable.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.07744v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\alpha(\mathbb{F}_q^d,p)$ denote the maximum size of a general position set in a $p$-random subset of $\mathbb{F}_q^d$. We determine the order of magnitude of $\alpha(\mathbb{F}_q^2,p)$ up to polylogarithmic factors for all possible values of $p$, improving the previous results obtained by Roche-Newton--Warren and Bhowmick--Roche-Newton. For $d \ge 3$ we prove upper bounds for $\alpha(\mathbb{F}_q^d,p)$ that are essentially tight within certain ranges for $p$.
  We establish the upper bound $2^{(1+o(1))q}$ for the number of general position sets in $\mathbb{F}_q^d$, which matches the trivial lower bound $2^{q}$ asymptotically in the exponent. We also refine this counting result by proving an asymptotically tight (in the exponent) upper bound for the number of general position sets with a fixed size. The latter result for $d=2$ improves a result of Roche-Newton--Warren.
  Our proofs are grounded in the hypergraph container method, and additionally, for $d=2$ we also leverage the pseudorandomness of the point-line incidence graph of $\mathbb{F}_{q}^2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.01750v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study Ramsey properties of randomly perturbed $3$-uniform hypergraphs. For~$t\geq 2$, write $\tilde K^{(3)}_t$ to denote the $3$-uniform {\it expanded} clique hypergraph obtained from the complete graph $K_t$ by expanding each of the edges of the latter with a new additional vertex. For an even integer $t\geq 4$, let~$M$ denote the asymmetric maximal density of the pair $(\tilde K^{(3)}_t,\tilde K^{(3)}_{t/2})$. We prove that adding a set~$F$ of random hyperedges satisfying $|F|\gg n^{3-1/M}$ to a given $n$-vertex $3$-uniform hypergraph~$H$ with non-vanishing edge density asymptotically almost surely results in a perturbed hypergraph enjoying the Ramsey property for $\tilde K^{(3)}_t$ and two colours. We conjecture that this result is asymptotically best possible with respect to the size of $F$ whenever $t\geq 6$ is even. The key tools of our proof are a new variant of the hypergraph regularity lemma accompanied with a \emph{tuple lemma} providing appropriate control over joint link graphs.
  Our variant combines the so called strong and the weak hypergraph regularity lemmata.</description>

      <title>Characterizing traces of processes defined by precedence and response constraints: an order theory approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12218v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we consider a general system of activities that can, but do not have to, occur. This system is governed by a set containing two types of constraints: precedence and response. A precedence constraint dictates that an activity can only occur if it has been preceded by some other specified activity. Response constraints are similarly defined. An execution of the system is a listing of activities in the order they occur and which satisfies all constraints. These listings are known as traces. Such systems naturally arise in areas of theoretical computer science and decision science. An outcome of the freedom with which activities can occur is that there are many different possible executions, and gaining a combinatorial insight into these is a non-trivial problem.
  We characterize all of the ways in which such a system can be executed. Our approach uses order theory to provide a classification in terms of the linear extensions of posets constructed from the constraint sets. This characterization is essential in calculating the stakeholder utility metrics that have been developed by the first author that allow for quantitative comparisons of such systems/processes. It also allows for a better understanding of the theoretical backbone to these processes.</description>

Abstract: We prove that an infinite block-Toeplitz matrix with finite diagonal support is totally nonnegative if and only if it is the weight matrix of a cylindrical network. This generalizes a well-known theorem of Brenti concerning finite totally nonnegative matrices and planar networks; in particular, our work gives an alternative, self-contained proof of the non-square case. Our argument employs Temperley-Lieb immanants, first introduced by Rhoades and Skandera, which are certain elements of Lusztig's dual canonical bases. As an application, we also obtain a new proof of a well-known theorem relating totally nonnegative block-Toeplitz matrices to interlacing polynomials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15929v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The chromatic symmetric function $X_G$ is a sum of monomials corresponding to proper vertex colorings of a graph $G$. Crew, Pechenik, and Spirkl (2023) recently introduced a $K$-theoretic analogue $\overline{X}_G$ called the Kromatic symmetric function, where each vertex is instead assigned a nonempty set of colors such that adjacent vertices have nonoverlapping color sets. $X_G$ does not distinguish all graphs, but a longstanding open question is whether it distinguishes all trees. We conjecture that $\overline{X}_G$ does distinguish all graphs. As evidence towards this conjecture, we show that $\overline{X}_G$ determines the number of copies in $G$ of certain induced subgraphs on 4 and 5 vertices as well as the number of induced subgraphs isomorphic to each graph consisting of a star plus some number of isolated vertices.</description>

Abstract: Supersolvable hyperplane arrangements and matroids are known to give rise to certain Koszul algebras, namely their Orlik-Solomon algebras and graded Varchenko-Gel'fand algebras. We explore how this interacts with group actions, particularly for the braid arrangement and the action of the symmetric group, where the Hilbert functions of the algebras and their Koszul duals are given by Stirling numbers of the first and second kinds, respectively. The corresponding symmetric group representations exhibit branching rules that interpret Stirling number recurrences, which are shown to apply to all supersolvable arrangements. They also enjoy representation stability properties that follow from Koszul duality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02792v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The weak degeneracy of a graph $G$ is a numerical parameter that was recently introduced by the first two authors with the aim of understanding the power of greedy algorithms for graph coloring. Every $d$-degenerate graph is weakly $d$-degenerate, but the converse is not true in general (for example, all connected $d$-regular graphs except cycles and cliques are weakly $(d-1)$-degenerate). If $G$ is weakly $d$-degenerate, then the list-chromatic number of $G$ is at most $d+1$, and the same upper bound holds for various other parameters such as the DP-chromatic number and the paint number. Here we rectify a mistake in a paper of the first two authors and give a correct proof that planar graphs are weakly $4$-degenerate, strengthening the famous result of Thomassen that planar graphs are $5$-list-colorable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19962v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study equivariant Kazhdan--Lusztig (KL) and $Z$-polynomials of matroids. We formulate an equivariant generalization of a result by Braden and Vysogorets that relates the equivariant KL and $Z$-polynomials of a matroid with those of a single-element deletion. We also discuss the failure of equivariant $\gamma$-positivity for the $Z$-polynomial. As an application of our main result, we obtain a formula for the equivariant KL polynomial of the graphic matroid gotten by gluing two cycles. Furthermore, we compute the equivariant KL polynomials of all matroids of corank~$2$ via valuations. This provides an application of the machinery of Elias, Miyata, Proudfoot, and Vecchi to corank $2$ matroids, and it extends results of Ferroni and Schr\"oter.</description>

      <title>Key-avoidance for alternating sign matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05311v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We initiate a systematic study of key-avoidance on alternating sign matrices (ASMs) defined via pattern-avoidance on an associated permutation called the \emph{key} of an ASM. We enumerate alternating sign matrices whose key avoids a given set of permutation patterns in several instances. We show that ASMs whose key avoids $231$ are permutations, thus any known enumeration for a set of permutation patterns including $231$ extends to ASMs. We furthermore enumerate by the Catalan numbers ASMs whose key avoids both $312$ and $321$. We also show ASMs whose key avoids $312$ are in bijection with the gapless monotone triangles of [Ayyer, Cori, Gouyou-Beauchamps 2011]. Thus key-avoidance generalizes the notion of $312$-avoidance studied there. Finally, we enumerate ASMs with a given key avoiding $312$ and $321$ using a connection to Schubert polynomials, thereby deriving an interesting Catalan identity.</description>

      <title>The difference between the chromatic and the cochromatic number of a random graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17614v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The cochromatic number $\zeta(G)$ of a graph $G$ is the minimum number of colours needed for a vertex colouring where every colour class is either an independent set or a clique. Let $\chi(G)$ denote the usual chromatic number. Around 1991 Erd\H{o}s and Gimbel asked: For the random graph $G \sim G_{n, 1/2}$, does $\chi(G)-\zeta(G) \rightarrow \infty$ whp? Erd\H{o}s offered \$100 for a positive and \$1,000 for a negative answer.
  We give a positive answer to this question for roughly 95% of all values $n$.</description>

      <title>Vanishing of Schubert Coefficients</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02064v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Schubert coefficients are nonnegative integers $c^w_{u,v}$ that arise in Algebraic Geometry and play a central role in Algebraic Combinatorics. It is a major open problem whether they have a combinatorial interpretation, i.e, whether $c^w_{u,v} \in \#{\sf P}$. We study the closely related vanishing problem of Schubert coefficients: $\{c^w_{u,v}=^? 0\}$. Until this work it was open whether this problem is in the polynomial hierarchy ${\sf PH}$. We prove that $\{c^w_{u,v}=^? 0\}$ in ${\sf coAM}$ assuming the GRH. In particular, the vanishing problem is in ${\Sigma_2^{{\text{p}}}}$. Our approach is based on constructions lifted formulations, which give polynomial systems of equations for the problem. The result follows from a reduction to Parametric Hilbert's Nullstellensatz, recently studied in arXiv:2408.13027. We extend our results to all classical types. Type $D$ is resolved in the appendix (joint with David Speyer).</description>

      <title>A signless Laplacian spectral Erd\"os-Stone-Simonovits theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11170v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The celebrated Erd\"os-Stone-Simonovites theorem states that $$ex(n,F)=\bigg(1-\frac{1}{\chi(F)-1}+o(1)\bigg)\frac{n^{2}}{2},$$ where $\chi(F)$ is the chromatic number of $F$. In $2009$, Nikiforov proved a spectral analogue of the Erd\"os-Stone-Simonovits theorem. However, some known counterexamples (even cycles of length at least four) indicate that Erd\"os-Stone-Simonovites type result do not hold generally for the signless Laplacian spectral radius. In this note, we present a signless Laplacian spectral version of the Erd\"os-Stone-Simonovits theorem. More precisely, we show that if $F$ is a graph with $\chi(F)\geq3$, then $$ex_{q}(n,F)=\bigg(1-\frac{1}{\chi(F)-1}+o(1)\bigg)2n,$$ where $ex_{q}(n,F):=\max \{q(G):|G|=n ~\mbox{and}~F\nsubseteq G\}$ and $q(G)$ is the signless Laplacian spectral radius of $G$.</description>

      <title>Root polytopes, tropical types, and toric edge ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.09851v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider arrangements of tropical hyperplanes where the apices of the hyperplanes are taken to infinity in certain directions. Such an arrangement defines a decomposition of Euclidean space where a cell is determined by its `type' data, analogous to the covectors of an oriented matroid. By work of Develin-Sturmfels and Fink-Rinc\'{o}n, these `tropical complexes' are dual to (regular) subdivisions of root polytopes, which in turn are in bijection with mixed subdivisions of certain generalized permutohedra. Extending previous work with Joswig-Sanyal, we show how a natural monomial labeling of these complexes describes polynomial relations (syzygies) among `type ideals' which arise naturally from the combinatorial data of the arrangement. In particular, we show that the cotype ideal is Alexander dual to a corresponding initial ideal of the lattice ideal of the underlying root polytope. This leads to novel ways of studying algebraic properties of various monomial and toric ideals, as well as relating them to combinatorial and geometric properties. In particular, our methods of studying the dimension of the tropical complex leads to new formulas for homological invariants of toric edge ideals of bipartite graphs, which have been extensively studied in the commutative algebra community.</description>

      <title>Lifted Inference beyond First-Order Logic</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.11738v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Weighted First Order Model Counting (WFOMC) is fundamental to probabilistic inference in statistical relational learning models. As WFOMC is known to be intractable in general ($\#$P-complete), logical fragments that admit polynomial time WFOMC are of significant interest. Such fragments are called domain liftable. Recent works have shown that the two-variable fragment of first order logic extended with counting quantifiers ($\mathrm{C^2}$) is domain-liftable. However, many properties of real-world data, like acyclicity in citation networks and connectivity in social networks, cannot be modeled in $\mathrm{C^2}$, or first order logic in general. In this work, we expand the domain liftability of $\mathrm{C^2}$ with multiple such properties. We show that any $\mathrm{C^2}$ sentence remains domain liftable when one of its relations is restricted to represent a directed acyclic graph, a connected graph, a tree (resp. a directed tree) or a forest (resp. a directed forest). All our results rely on a novel and general methodology of "counting by splitting". Besides their application to probabilistic inference, our results provide a general framework for counting combinatorial structures. We expand a vast array of previous results in discrete mathematics literature on directed acyclic graphs, phylogenetic networks, etc.</description>

Abstract: Sina\u{i} initiated the study of random walks with persistently positive area processes, motivated by shock waves in solutions to the inviscid Burgers' equation. We find the precise asymptotic probability that the area process of a random walk bridge is an excursion. A key ingredient is an analogue of Sparre Andersen's classical formula. The asymptotics are related to von Sterneck's subset counting formulas from additive number theory. Our results sharpen bounds by Aurzada, Dereich and Lifshits and respond to a question of Caravenna and Deuschel, which arose in their study of the wetting model. In this context, Sina\u{\i} excursions are a class of random polymer chains exhibiting entropic repulsion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13892v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Sackin index is an important measure for the balance of phylogenetic trees. We investigate two extensions of the Sackin index to the class of galled trees and two of its subclasses (simplex galled trees and normal galled trees) where we consider both labeled and unlabeled galled trees. In all cases, we show that the mean of the Sackin index for a network which is uniformly sampled from its class is asymptotic to $\mu n^{3/2}$ for an explicit constant $\mu$. In addition, we show that the scaled Sackin index convergences weakly and with all its moments to the Airy distribution.</description>

      <title>When invariance implies exchangeability (and applications to invariant Keisler measures)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08370v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of when, given a countable homogeneous structure $M$ and a space $S$ of expansions of $M$, every $\mathrm{Aut}(M)$-invariant probability measure on $S$ is exchangeable (i.e. invariant under all permutations of the domain). We show, for example, that if $M$ is a finitely bounded homogeneous $3$-hypergraph with free amalgamation (including the generic tetrahedron-free $3$-hypergraph), all $\mathrm{Aut}(M)$-invariant random expansions by graphs are exchangeable. Moreover, we extend and recover both the work of Angel, Kechris, and Lyons on invariant random orderings and some of the work of Crane and Towsner, and Ackerman on relative exchangeability.
  In the second part of the paper, we apply our results to the study of invariant Keisler measures, which we prove to be particular invariant random expansions. Thus, we describe the spaces of invariant Keisler measures of various homogeneous structures, obtaining the first results of this kind since the work of Albert and Ensley. We also show there are $2^{\aleph_0}$ supersimple homogeneous ternary structures for which there are non-forking formulas which are universally measure zero.</description>

      <title>Non-crossing $H$-graphs: a generalization of proper interval graphs admitting FPT algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11192v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove new parameterized complexity results for the FO Model Checking problem and in particular for Independent Set, for two recently introduced subclasses of $H$-graphs, namely proper $H$-graphs and non-crossing $H$-graphs. It is known that proper $H$-graphs, and thus $H$-graphs, may have unbounded twin-width. However, we prove that for every connected multigraph $H$ with no self-loops, non-crossing $H$-graphs have bounded proper mixed-thinness, and thus bounded twin-width. Consequently, we can apply a well-known result of Bonnet, Kim, Thomass\'e, and Watrigant (2021) to find that the FO Model Checking problem is in $\mathsf{FPT}$ for non-crossing $H$-graphs when parameterized by $\Vert H \Vert+\ell$, where $\Vert H \Vert$ is the size of $H$ and $\ell$ is the size of a formula. In particular, this implies that Independent Set is in $\mathsf{FPT}$ on non-crossing $H$-graphs when parameterized by $\Vert H \Vert+k$, where $k$ is the solution size. In contrast, Independent Set for general $H$-graphs is $\mathsf{W[1]}$-hard when parameterized by $\Vert H \Vert +k$. We strengthen the latter result by proving thatIndependent Set is $\mathsf{W[1]}$-hard even on proper $H$-graphs when parameterized by $\Vert H \Vert+k$. In this way, we solve, subject to $\mathsf{W[1]}\neq \mathsf{FPT}$, an open problem of Chaplick (2023), who asked whether there exist problems that can be solved faster for non-crossing $H$-graphs than for proper $H$-graphs.</description>

Abstract: Groupoid cardinality is an invariant of locally finite groupoids which has many of the properties of the cardinality of finite sets, but which takes values in all non-negative real numbers, and accounts for the morphisms of a groupoid. Several results on groupoid cardinality are proved, analogous to the relationship between cardinality of finite sets and i.e. injective or surjective functions. We also generalize to a broad class of (2,1)-categories a famous theorem of Lov\'asz which characterizes the isomorphism type of relational structures by counting the number of homomorphisms into them.</description>
