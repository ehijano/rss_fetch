      <title>Particle Hit Clustering and Identification Using Point Set Transformers in Liquid Argon Time Projection Chambers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Liquid argon time projection chambers are often used in neutrino physics and dark-matter searches because of their high spatial resolution. The images generated by these detectors are extremely sparse, as the energy values detected by most of the detector are equal to 0, meaning that despite their high resolution, most of the detector is unused in a particular interaction. Instead of representing all of the empty detections, the interaction is usually stored as a sparse matrix, a list of detection locations paired with their energy values. Traditional machine learning methods that have been applied to particle reconstruction such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), however, cannot operate over data stored in this way and therefore must have the matrix fully instantiated as a dense matrix. Operating on dense matrices requires a lot of memory and computation time, in contrast to directly operating on the sparse matrix. We propose a machine learning model using a point set neural network that operates over a sparse matrix, greatly improving both processing speed and accuracy over methods that instantiate the dense matrix, as well as over other methods that operate over sparse matrices. Compared to competing state-of-the-art methods, our method improves classification performance by 14%, segmentation performance by more than 22%, while taking 80% less time and using 66% less memory. Compared to state-of-the-art CNN methods, our method improves classification performance by more than 86%, segmentation performance by more than 71%, while reducing runtime by 91% and reducing memory usage by 61%.</description>

      <title>Search for charged-lepton flavour violation in top quark interactions with an up-type quark, a muon, and a $\tau$ lepton in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A search for charged-lepton flavour violation (CLFV) in top quark (t) production and decay is presented. The search uses proton-proton collision data corresponding to 138 fb$^{-1}$ collected with the CMS experiment at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV. The signal consists of the production of a single top quark via a CLFV interaction or top quark pair production followed by a CLFV decay. The analysis selects events containing a pair of oppositely charged muon and hadronically decaying $\tau$ lepton and at least three jets, where one has been identified to originate from the fragmentation of a bottom quark. Machine learning classification techniques are used to distinguish signal from standard model background events. The results of this search are consistent with the standard model expectations. The upper limits at 95% confidence level on the branching fraction $\mathcal{B}$ for CLFV top quark decays to a muon, a $\tau$ lepton, and an up or a charm quark are set at $\mathcal{B}$(t $\to \mu\tau$u) $\lt$ (0.040, 0.078, and 0.118) $\times$ 10$^{-6}$, and $\mathcal{B}$(t $\to\mu\tau$c) $\lt$ (0.810, 1.710, and 2.052) $\times$ 10$^{-6}$ for scalar, vector, and tensor-like operators, respectively.</description>

      <title>Multidimensional Measurements of Beam Single Spin Asymmetries in Semi-inclusive Deep-inelastic Charged Kaon Electroproduction off Protons in the Valence Region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measurements of beam single spin asymmetries in semi-inclusive deep inelastic electron scattering (SIDIS) with positively charged kaons off protons have been performed with 10.6 and 10.2 GeV incident electron beams using the CLAS12 spectrometer at Jefferson Lab. We report an analysis of the electroproduction of positively charged kaons over a large kinematic range of fractional energy, Bjorken $x$, transverse momentum, and photon virtualities $Q^2$ ranging from 1 GeV$^2$ up to 6 GeV$^2$. This is the first published multi-dimensionally binned CLAS12 measurement of a kaon SIDIS single spin asymmetry in the valence quark regime. The data provide constraints on the structure function ratio $F_{LU}^{\sin{\phi}}/F_{UU}$, where $F_{LU}^{\sin{\phi}}$ is a quantity with a leading twist of twist-3 that can reveal novel aspects of the quark-gluon correlations within the nucleon. The impact of the data on understanding the underlying reaction mechanisms and their kinematic variation is explored using theoretical models for the different contributing twist-3 parton distribution functions (PDFs) and fragmentation functions (FFs).</description>

      <title>Enhancing Neutrino Reconstruction in Water-Cherenkov Air Shower Arrays Using Multi-Photosensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, the potential of water Cherenkov detectors equipped with multi-PMT modules for precision neutrino direction reconstruction is demonstrated. By analyzing signal time traces with transformer-based models, significant improvements in angular resolution are achieved compared to previous designs with larger PMTs. These detectors enable the reconstruction of neutrino directions with resolutions of approximately $10$ degrees in azimuth and $7$ degrees in zenith for high-signal events. This design reduces saturation effects and enhances directional sensitivity, particularly for high-energy neutrinos. The results highlight the potential of WCD arrays as complementary tools for neutrino astronomy, particularly in the context of multimessenger observations of transient astrophysical sources. The nearly continuous operation and wide field of view of these detectors further enhance their suitability for real-time monitoring and alert generation.</description>

      <title>Kaon and Pion Fragmentation Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Drell-Levy-Yan relation is employed to obtain pion and kaon elementary fragmentation functions (EFFs) from the hadron-scale parton distribution functions (DFs) of these mesons. Two different DF sets are used: that calculated using a symmetry-preserving treatment of a vector $\times$ vector contact interaction (SCI) and the other expressing results obtained using continuum Schwinger function methods (CSMs). Thus determined, the EFFs serve as driving terms in a coupled set of hadron cascade equations, whose solution yields the complete array of hadron-scale fragmentation functions (FFs) for pion and kaon production in high energy reactions. After evolution to scales typical of experiments, the SCI and CSM FF predictions are seen to be in semiquantitative agreement. Importantly, they conform with a range of physical expectations for FF behaviour on the endpoint domains $z\simeq 0, 1$, e.g., nonsinglet FFs vanish at $z=0$ and singlet FFs diverge faster than $1/z$. Predictions for hadron multiplicities in jets are also delivered. They reveal SU$(3)$ symmetry breaking in the charged-kaon/neutral-kaon multiplicity ratio, whose size diminishes with increasing reaction energy, and show that, with increasing energy, the pion/kaon ratio in $e^+ e^- \to h X$ diminishes to a value that is independent of hadron masses.</description>

      <title>Search for jet quenching with dijets from high-multiplicity pPb collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}$ = 8.16 TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The first measurement of the dijet transverse momentum balance $x_j$ in proton-lead (pPb) collisions at a nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}$ = 8.16 TeV is presented. The $x_j$ observable, defined as the ratio of the subleading over leading jet transverse momentum in a dijet pair, is used to search for jet quenching effects. The data, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 174.6 nb$^{-1}$, were collected with the CMS detector in 2016. The $x_j$ distributions and their average values are studied as functions of the charged-particle multiplicity of the events and for various dijet rapidity selections. The latter enables probing hard scattering of partons carrying distinct nucleon momentum fractions \x in the proton- and lead-going directions. The former, aided by the high-multiplicity triggers, allows probing for potential jet quenching effects in high-multiplicity events (with up to 400 charged particles), for which collective phenomena consistent with quark-gluon plasma (QGP) droplet formation were previously observed. The ratios of $x_j$ distributions for high- to low-multiplicity events are used to quantify the possible medium effects. These ratios are consistent with simulations of the hard-scattering process that do not include QGP production. These measurements set an upper limit on medium-induced energy loss of the subleading jet of 1.26% of its transverse momentum at the 90% confidence level in high multiplicity pPb events.</description>

      <title>Can the strong interactions between hadrons be determined using femtoscopy?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the last decades, femtoscopic measurements from heavy-ion collisions have become a popular tool to investigate the strong interactions between hadrons. The key observables measured in such experiments are the two-hadron momentum correlations, which depend on the production mechanism of hadron pairs and the final-state interactions. Given the complexity of ultra-relativistic collision experiments, the source term describing the production mechanism can only be modeled phenomenologically based on numerous assumptions. The commonly employed approach for analyzing femtoscopic data relies on the Koonin-Pratt formula, which relates the measured correlation functions with the relative wave function of an outgoing hadron pair and a source term that is assumed to be universal. Here, we critically examine this universality assumption and show that for strongly interacting particles such as nucleons, the interpretation of femtoscopic measurements suffers from a potentially large intrinsic uncertainty. We also comment on the ongoing efforts to explore three-body interactions using this experimental technique.</description>

      <title>Possible bound states in the triple-$\eta_c$ and triple-$J/\psi$ systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The observations of fully-charm tetraquark states in the LHCb, CMS and ATLAS experiments suggested the existence of the hadron molecule of two-charmonium states, which may also imply the bound states in the three-charmonium systems. In this work, we study the possible bound states in the triple-$\eta_c$ and triple-$J/\psi$ systems with $J^{PC}=0^{-+}$ and $1^{--}$, respectively. In QCD sum rules, we calculate the two-point correlation functions and spectral functions up to the dimension four gluon condensate. We use the iterative dispersion relation approach to deal with the five-loop banana integrals, which significantly improves the computational efficiency. Our results show that the masses of triple-$\eta_c$ and triple-$J/\psi$ states below the corresponding mass thresholds, supporting the existence of such three-body bound states.</description>

      <title>Exploration at the high-energy frontier: ATLAS Run~2 searches investigating the exotic jungle beyond the Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09292v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This report presents a comprehensive collection of searches for new physics performed by the ATLAS Collaboration during the Run 2 period of data taking at the Large Hadron Collider, from 2015 to 2018, corresponding to about 140 fb$^{-1}$ of $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV proton-proton collision data. These searches cover a variety of beyond-the-standard model topics such as dark matter candidates, new vector bosons, hidden-sector particles, leptoquarks, or vector-like quarks, among others. Searches for supersymmetric particles or extended Higgs sectors are explicitly excluded as these are the subject of separate reports by the Collaboration. For each topic, the most relevant searches are described, focusing on their importance and sensitivity and, when appropriate, highlighting the experimental techniques employed. In addition to the description of each analysis, complementary searches are compared, and the overall sensitivity of the ATLAS experiment to each type of new physics is discussed. Summary plots and statistical combinations of multiple searches are included whenever possible.</description>

      <title>Enriching the physics program of the CMS experiment via data scouting and data parking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16134v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Specialized data-taking and data-processing techniques were introduced by the CMS experiment in Run 1 of the CERN LHC to enhance the sensitivity of searches for new physics and the precision of standard model measurements. These techniques, termed data scouting and data parking, extend the data-taking capabilities of CMS beyond the original design specifications. The novel data-scouting strategy trades complete event information for higher event rates, while keeping the data bandwidth within limits. Data parking involves storing a large amount of raw detector data collected by algorithms with low trigger thresholds to be processed when sufficient computational power is available to handle such data. The research program of the CMS Collaboration is greatly expanded with these techniques. The implementation, performance, and physics results obtained with data scouting and data parking in CMS over the last decade are discussed in this Report, along with new developments aimed at further improving low-mass physics sensitivity over the next years of data taking.</description>

      <title>Proton reconstruction with the TOTEM Roman pot detectors for high-$\beta^*$ LHC data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19749v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The TOTEM Roman pot detectors are used to reconstruct the transverse momentum of scattered protons and to estimate the transverse location of the primary interaction. This paper presents new methods of track reconstruction, measurements of strip-level detection efficiencies, cross-checks of the LHC beam optics, and detector alignment techniques, along with their application in the selection of signal collision events. The track reconstruction is performed by exploiting hit cluster information through a novel method using a common polygonal area in the intercept-slope plane. The technique is applied in the relative alignment of detector layers with $\mu$m precision. A tag-and-probe method is used to extract strip-level detection efficiencies. The alignment of the Roman pot system is performed through time-dependent adjustments, resulting in a position accuracy of 3 $\mu$m in the horizontal and 60 $\mu$m in the vertical directions. The goal is to provide an optimal reconstruction tool for central exclusive physics analyses based on the high-$\beta^*$ data-taking period at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV in 2018.</description>

      <title>An Automated Bandwidth Division for the LHCb Upgrade Trigger</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09557v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The upgraded Large Hadron Collider beauty (LHCb) experiment is the first detector based at a hadron collider using a fully software based trigger. The first `High Level Trigger' stage (HLT1) reduces the event rate from 30 MHz to approximately 1 MHz based on reconstruction criteria from the tracking system, and consists of $\mathcal{O}(100)$ trigger selections implemented on Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). These selections are further refined following the full offline-quality reconstruction at the second stage (HLT2) prior to saving for analysis. An automated bandwidth division has been performed to equitably divide this 1 MHz HLT1 Output Rate (OR) between the signals of interest to the LHCb physics programme. This was achieved by optimising a set of trigger selections that maximise efficiency for signals of interest to LHCb while keeping the total HLT1 readout capped to a maximum. The bandwidth division tool has been used to determine the optimal selection for 35 selection algorithms over 80 characteristic physics channels.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18992v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There have been many applications of deep neural networks to detector calibrations and a growing number of studies that propose deep generative models as automated fast detector simulators. We show that these two tasks can be unified by using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) from conditional generative models for energy regression. Unlike direct regression techniques, the MLE approach is prior-independent and non-Gaussian resolutions can be determined from the shape of the likelihood near the maximum. Using an ATLAS-like calorimeter simulation, we demonstrate this concept in the context of calorimeter energy calibration.</description>

      <title>Performance of plastic scintillator modules for top veto tracker at Taishan Antineutrino Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15973v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Taishan Antineutrino Observatory (TAO) experiment incorporates a top veto tracker (TVT) system comprising 160 modules, each composed of plastic scintillator (PS) strips, embedded wavelength shifting fibers (WLS-fibers), and silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs). This article highlights the performance of all produced modules following the production and readout/trigger design, providing insights for scintillation detectors with WLS-fibers. Three kinds of trigger modes and its efficiency have been defined to comprehensively evaluate the performance of this unique design, which has been verified for the batch production, along with comprehensive measurement strategies and quality inspection methods. In "module" mode, the detection(tagging) efficiency of the PS exceeds 99.67\% at a 30 photoelectron threshold, and even in "AND" mode, it surpasses 99.60\% at a 15 photoelectron threshold. The muon tagging efficiency meets TAO's requirements. The production and performance of the PS module set a benchmark for other experiments, with optimized optical fiber arrangements that enhance light yield and muon detection efficiency.</description>

      <title>Interference effects in resonant di-Higgs production at the LHC in the Higgs singlet extension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06651v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interference effects are well founded from the quantum mechanical viewpoint and in principle cannot be ignored in realistic studies of New Physics scenarios. In this work, we investigate the size of interference effects between resonant and non-resonant contributions to di-Higgs production in the singlet extension of the Standard Model, where the additional heavy scalar provides a resonant channel. We find these interference contributions to have a non-negligible effect on the cross-sections and differential distributions. In order to allow for a computationally efficient treatment of these effects via reweighting, we introduce a new tool utilising a matrix-element reweighting method: HHReweighter. In addition to the broadly used di-Higgs invariant mass $m_{hh}$, we analyse the sensitivity to the interference terms for other kinematic variables, such as the Higgs boson transverse momentum, and find that these also can be sensitive to interference effects. Furthermore, we provide updates on the latest experimental and theoretical limits on the parameter space of the real singlet extension of the Standard Model Higgs sector.</description>

      <title>General Signals for Charged Lepton Flavor Violating Decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10778v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the most general phenomenology of charged lepton flavor violating (CLFV) decays of muon and tau leptons to the three body final states $(\bar{e}ee, \bar{\mu}\mu\mu, \bar{e}\mu\mu, \bar{\mu}\mu e,\bar{\mu}ee, \bar{e}e\mu)$. By constructing a complete basis of operators at each dimension, we derive the most general amplitudes for these decay processes. By considering constraints from unitarity and LEP, we show that operators of mass dimension 6 and 7 are the most likely to be observed in next generation experiments. Focusing on these dimensions, we compute the results of unpolarized (spin-averaged) decays parameterized in terms of the invariant masses of the daughter particles. We also compute the differential decay rates for polarized decays, in anticipation of the experimental search Mu3e, which expects to have a muon beam with $\sim 90\%$ polarization, and the Chiral Belle proposal, which aims to have a $70\%$ polarized electron beam. To determine the extent to which the operators may be distinguished experimentally, we plot the differential distributions for each operator, showing that they leave only a few possible degenerate explanations. Through a statistical analysis, we estimate the number of events needed to break the degeneracies using the angular information. These results are adapted to treat $\ell\to \ell' \nu \bar{\nu}$, where the angular distribution of the outgoing charged lepton has enhanced distinguishing power. With many Standard Model extensions predicting these CLFV decays, these results will better enable upcoming searches to identify and/or constrain physics beyond the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Properties of the tensor state $bc\overline{b}\overline{c}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22439v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spectroscopic parameters and decays of the exotic tensor meson $T$ with content $bc \overline{b}\overline{c}$ are explored in the context of the diquark-antidiquark model. We treat it as a state built of axial-vector diquark $b^{T}C\gamma _{\mu }c$ and antidiquark $\overline{b}\gamma _{\nu }C \overline{c}^{T}$, where $C$ is the charge conjugation matrix. The mass $m$ and current coupling $\Lambda$ of this tetraquark are extracted from two-point sum rules. Our result for $m=(12.70 \pm 0.09)~\mathrm{GeV}$ proves that $T$ is unstable against strong dissociations to two-meson final states. Its dominant decay channels are processes $T \to J/\psi \Upsilon $, $ \eta_{b}\eta _{c}$, and $B_{c}^{(\ast) +}B_{c}^{(\ast) -}$. Kinematically allowed transformations of $T$ include also decays $T\rightarrow D^{(\ast )+}D^{(\ast )-}$ and $D^{(\ast )0}\overline{D}^{(\ast )0}$, which are generated by $b\overline{b}$ annihilation inside of $T$. The full width of $ T $ is estimated by considering all of these channels. Their partial widths are calculated by invoking methods of three-point sum rule approach which are required to evaluate strong couplings at corresponding tetraquark-meson-meson vertices. Our predictions for the mass and width $ \Gamma_{T}=(117.4 \pm 15.9)~ \mathrm{MeV} $ of the tensor state $T$ provide useful information for experimental studies of fully heavy four-quark exotic structures.</description>

      <title>Heavy Neutral Leptons without Prejudice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12271v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Heavy Neutral Leptons (HNLs) provide a compelling extension to the Standard Model, addressing the neutrino masses, baryogenesis, and dark matter problems. We perform a model-independent collider study, decoupling the active-sterile mixing angle ($V$) from the Yukawa coupling ($y$), and explore sensitivities at the HL-LHC for prompt and displaced decays. We also consider the possibility of HNLs being long-lived particles decaying in far detectors as FASER. In addition, we study the expected reach at FCC-ee for the prompt and displaced cases. For zero mixing, FCC-ee and HL-LHC sensitivities to $y$ are comparable, with Higgs width measurements imposing the strongest constraints. With non-zero mixing, sensitivities are dominated by $V$, significantly constraining parameter space. This work highlights the importance of precision Higgs studies and displaced searches in probing HNLs at current and future colliders.</description>

      <title>Constraining the $DDD^*$ three-body bound state via the $Z_c(3900)$ pole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12816v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we propose using the $Z_c(3900)$ pole position to constrain the existence of the $DDD^*$ three-body bound state within the one-boson-exchange (OBE) model. The existence of the $DDD^*$ bound state remains uncertain due to significant variations in the OBE interaction, particularly in the strength of scalar-meson-exchange interactions, which can differ by a factor about 20 between two commonly used OBE models. This discrepancy renders the $DDD^*$ system highly model-dependent. To address this issue, we constrain the scalar-meson-exchange interaction using the $Z_c(3900)$ pole position, where the pseudoscalar-meson coupling is well-determined, and the $\rho$- and $\omega$-exchange interactions nearly cancel each other out, leaving the coupling constant of the $\sigma$-exchange as the only unknown parameter. Our results indicate that the isospin-$\frac{1}{2}$ $DDD^*$ bound states exist when $Z_c(3900)$ is a virtual state of $D\bar{D}^*/\bar{D}D^*$ located within approximately $-15$ MeV of the threshold. However, the three-body bound state is gone when the $Z_c(3900)$ virtual state pole is more than $20$ MeV away from the threshold. Each experimental progress, either on the $DDD^*$ state or the $Z_c(3900)$, can shed light on the nature of the other state. Another significant outcome is a refined set of OBE model parameters calibrated using the pole positions of $X(3872)$, $T_{cc}(3875)$, and $Z_c(3900)$, rigorously addressing the cutoff dependence. These parameters provide a valuable resource for more accurate calculations of systems involving few-body $D$, $D^*$ and their antiparticles. Additionally, we find no evidence of the $DDD^*$ three-body resonances after extensive search using a combination of the Gaussian expansion method and the complex scaling method.</description>

      <title>Critical Unstable Qubits: an Application to $B^0\bar{B}^0$-Meson System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15625v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend our previous work on a novel class of unstable qubits which we have identified recently and called them Critical Unstable Qubits (CUQs). The characteristic property of CUQs is that the energy-level and decay-width vectors, ${\bf E}$ and ${\bf \Gamma}$, are orthogonal to one another, and the key parameter $r = |{\bf \Gamma}|/|2{\bf E}|$ is less than 1. Most remarkably, CUQs exhibit two atypical behaviours: (i) they display coherence-decoherence oscillations in a co-decaying frame of the system described by a unit Bloch vector ${\bf b}$, and (ii) the unit Bloch vector ${\bf b}$ describing a pure CUQ sweeps out unequal areas during equal intervals of time, while rotating about the vector ${\bf E}$. The latter anharmonic phenomenon emerges beyond the usual oscillatory pattern due to the energy-level difference of the two-level quantum system, which governs an ordinary qubit. By making use of a Fourier series decomposition, we define anharmonicity observables that quantify the degree of non-sinusoidal oscillation of a CUQ. We apply the results of our formalism to the $B^0\bar{B}^0$-meson system and derive, for the first time, generic upper limits on these new observables.</description>
