      <title>Nearly Tight Bounds on Testing of Metric Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a non-negative $n \times n$ matrix viewed as a set of distances between $n$ points, we consider the property testing problem of deciding if it is a metric. We also consider the same problem for two special classes of metrics, tree metrics and ultrametrics. For general metrics, our paper is the first to consider these questions. We prove an upper bound of $O(n^{2/3}/\epsilon^{4/3})$ on the query complexity for this problem. Our algorithm is simple, but the analysis requires great care in bounding the variance on the number of violating triangles in a sample. When $\epsilon$ is a slowly decreasing function of $n$ (rather than a constant, as is standard), we prove a lower bound of matching dependence on $n$ of $\Omega (n^{2/3})$, ruling out any property testers with $o(n^{2/3})$ query complexity unless their dependence on $1/\epsilon$ is super-polynomial.
  Next, we turn to tree metrics and ultrametrics. While there were known upper and lower bounds, we considerably improve these bounds showing essentially tight bounds of $\tilde{O}(1/\epsilon )$ on the sample complexity. We also show a lower bound of $\Omega ( 1/\epsilon^{4/3} )$ on the query complexity. Our upper bounds are derived by doing a more careful analysis of a natural, simple algorithm. For the lower bounds, we construct distributions on NO instances, where it is hard to find a witness showing that these are not ultrametrics.</description>

      <title>A characterization of positive spanning sets with ties to strongly connected digraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Positive spanning sets (PSSs) are families of vectors that span a given linear space through non-negative linear combinations. Despite certain classes of PSSs being well understood, a complete characterization of PSSs remains elusive. In this paper, we explore a relatively understudied relationship between positive spanning sets and strongly edge-connected digraphs, in that the former can be viewed as a generalization of the latter. We leverage this connection to define a decomposition structure for positive spanning sets inspired by the ear decomposition from digraph theory.</description>

      <title>Counting of Shortest Paths in Cubic Grid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.04190</link>
      <description>arXiv:1803.04190v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The enumeration of shortest paths in cubic grid is presented herein, which could have importance in image processing and also in the network sciences. The cubic grid considers three neighborhoods - namely, 6-, 18- and 26-neighborhood related to face connectivity, edge connectivity and vertex connectivity, respectively. The formulation for distance metrics is given. L1, D18, and L_$\infty$ are the three metrics for 6-neighborhood, 18-neighborhood and 26-neighborhood. The task is to count the number of minimal paths, based on given neighborhood relations, from any given point to any other, in the three-dimensional cubic grid. Based on the coordinate triplets describing the grid, the formulations for the three neighborhoods are presented in this work. The problem both of theoretical importance and has several practical aspects.</description>

      <title>Infinite chains in the tree of numerical semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.09500v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One major problem in the study of numerical semigroups is determining the growth of the semigroup tree. In the present work, infinite chains of numerical semigroups in the semigroup tree, firstly introduced by Bras-Amor\'os and Bulygin (Semigroup Forum, 79:561--574, 2009), are studied. Computational results show that these chains are rare, but without them the tree would not be infinite. It is proved that for each genus $g\geq 5$ there are more semigroups of that genus not belonging to infinite chains than semigroups belonging. Bras-Amor\'os and Bulygin (Semigroup Forum, 79:561--574, 2009) presented a characterization of the semigroups that belong to infinite chains in terms of the coprimality of the left elements of the semigroup as well as a result on the cardinality of the set of infinite chains to which a numerical semigroup belongs in terms of the primality of the greatest common divisor of these left elements. We revisit these results and fix an imprecision on the cardinality of the set of infinite chains to which a semigroup belongs in the case when the greatest common divisor of the left elements is a prime number. We then look at infinite chains in subtrees with fixed multiplicity. When the multiplicity is a prime number there is only one infinite chain in the tree of semigroups with such multiplicity. When the multiplicity is $4$ or $6$ we prove a self-replication behavior in the subtree and prove a formula for the number of semigroups in infinite chains of a given genus and multiplicity $4$ and $6$, respectively.</description>

      <title>Obstruction characterization of co-TT graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.12614v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Threshold tolerance graphs and their complement graphs, known as co-TT graphs, were introduced by Monma, Reed, and Trotter[24]. Building on this, Hell et al.[19] introduced the concept of negative interval. Then they proceeded to define signedinterval digraphs/ bigraphs, demonstrating their equivalence to several seemingly distinct classes of digraphs/ bigraphs. They also showed that co-TT graphs are equivalent to symmetric signed-interval digraphs, where some vertices of the digraphs have loops and others do not. We have showed that this actually solve the representation characterization problem of co-TT graphs posed by Monma, Reed and Trotter [24]. In this paper, we characterize signed-interval bigraphs and signed-interval graphs in terms of their biadjacency matrices and adjacency matrices, respectively. Moreover we emphasize on the geometric representation of signed-interval graphs, i.e. co-TT graphs. Finally, by utilizing the geometric representation of signed-interval graphs, we resolve the open problem of characterizing co-TT graphs in terms of minimal forbidden induced subgraphs, a problem initially posed by Monma, Reed, and Trotter in the same paper.</description>

      <title>Noisy Linear Group Testing: Exact Thresholds and Efficient Algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03839v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In group testing, the task is to identify defective items by testing groups of them together using as few tests as possible. We consider the setting where each item is defective with a constant probability $\alpha$, independent of all other items. In the (over-)idealized noiseless setting, tests are positive exactly if any of the tested items are defective. We study a more realistic model in which observed test results are subject to noise, i.e., tests can display false positive or false negative results with constant positive probabilities. We determine precise constants $c$ such that $cn\log n$ tests are required to recover the infection status of every individual for both adaptive and non-adaptive group testing: in the former, the selection of groups to test can depend on previously observed test results, whereas it cannot in the latter. Additionally, for both settings, we provide efficient algorithms that identify all defective items with the optimal amount of tests with high probability. Thus, we completely solve the problem of binary noisy group testing in the studied setting.</description>

      <title>Age of Information Diffusion on Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.13303v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To promote viral marketing, major social platforms (e.g., Facebook Marketplace and Pinduoduo) repeatedly select and invite different users (as seeds) in online social networks to share fresh information about a product or service with their friends. Thereby, we are motivated to optimize a multi-stage seeding process of viral marketing in social networks, and adopt the recent notions of the peak and the average age of information (AoI) to measure the timeliness of promotion information received by network users. Our problem is different from the literature on information diffusion in social networks, which limits to one-time seeding and overlooks AoI dynamics or information replacement over time. As a critical step, we manage to develop closed-form expressions that characterize and trace AoI dynamics over any social network. For the peak AoI problem, we first prove the NP-hardness of our multi-stage seeding problem by a highly non-straightforward reduction from the dominating set problem, and then present a new polynomial-time algorithm that achieves good approximation guarantees (e.g., less than 2 for linear network topology). To minimize the average AoI, we also prove that our problem is NP-hard by properly reducing it from the set cover problem. Benefiting from our two-sided bound analysis on the average AoI objective, we build up a new framework for approximation analysis and link our problem to a much simplified sum-distance minimization problem. This intriguing connection inspires us to develop another polynomial-time algorithm that achieves a good approximation guarantee. Additionally, our theoretical results are well corroborated by experiments on a real social network.</description>

      <title>Recoloring via modular decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06446v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The reconfiguration graph of the $k$-colorings of a graph $G$, denoted $R_{k}(G)$, is the graph whose vertices are the $k$-colorings of $G$ and two colorings are adjacent in $R_{k}(G)$ if they differ in color on exactly one vertex. A graph $G$ is said to be recolorable if $R_{\ell}(G)$ is connected for all $\ell \geq \chi(G)$+1. We demonstrate how to use the modular decomposition of a graph class to prove that the graphs in the class are recolorable. In particular, we prove that every ($P_5$, diamond)-free graph, every ($P_5$, house, bull)-free graph, and every ($P_5$, $C_5$, co-fork)-free graph is recolorable.
  A graph is prime if it cannot be decomposed by modular decomposition except into single vertices. For a prime graph $H$, we study the complexity of deciding if $H$ is $k$-colorable and the complexity of deciding if there exists a path between two given $k$-colorings in $R_{k}(H)$. Suppose $\mathcal{G}$ is a hereditary class of graphs. We prove that if every blowup of every prime graph in $\mathcal{G}$ is recolorable, then every graph in $\mathcal{G}$ is recolorable.</description>

      <title>Online Budgeted Matching with General Bids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04204v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Online Budgeted Matching (OBM) is a classic problem with important applications in online advertising, online service matching, revenue management, and beyond. Traditional online algorithms typically assume a small bid setting, where the maximum bid-to-budget ratio (\kappa) is infinitesimally small. While recent algorithms have tried to address scenarios with non-small or general bids, they often rely on the Fractional Last Matching (FLM) assumption, which allows for accepting partial bids when the remaining budget is insufficient. This assumption, however, does not hold for many applications with indivisible bids. In this paper, we remove the FLM assumption and tackle the open problem of OBM with general bids. We first establish an upper bound of 1-\kappa on the competitive ratio for any deterministic online algorithm. We then propose a novel meta algorithm, called MetaAd, which reduces to different algorithms with first known provable competitive ratios parameterized by the maximum bid-to-budget ratio \kappa \in [0, 1]. As a by-product, we extend MetaAd to the FLM setting and get provable competitive algorithms. Finally, we apply our competitive analysis to the design learning-augmented algorithms.</description>
