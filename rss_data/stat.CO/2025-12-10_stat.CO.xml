      <title>deepspat: An R package for modeling nonstationary spatial and spatio-temporal Gaussian and extremes data through deep deformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonstationarity in spatial and spatio-temporal processes is ubiquitous in environmental datasets, but is not often addressed in practice, due to a scarcity of statistical software packages that implement nonstationary models. In this article, we introduce the R software package deepspat, which allows for modeling, fitting and prediction with nonstationary spatial and spatio-temporal models applied to Gaussian and extremes data. The nonstationary models in our package are constructed using a deep multi-layered deformation of the original spatial or spatio-temporal domain, and are straightforward to implement. Model parameters are estimated using gradient-based optimization of customized loss functions with tensorflow, which implements automatic differentiation. The functionalities of the package are illustrated through simulation studies and an application to Nepal temperature data.</description>

      <title>State and Parameter Estimation for a Neural Model of Local Field Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of cortical dynamics during different states such as decision making, sleep and movement, is an important topic in Neuroscience. Modelling efforts aim to relate the neural rhythms present in cortical recordings to the underlying dynamics responsible for their emergence. We present an effort to characterize the neural activity from the cortex of a mouse during natural sleep, captured through local field potential measurements. Our approach relies on using a discretized Wilson--Cowan Amari neural field model for neural activity, along with a data assimilation method that allows the Bayesian joint estimation of the state and parameters. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach on synthetic measurements before applying it to a dataset available in literature. Our findings suggest the potential of our approach to characterize the stimulus received by the cortex from other brain regions, while simultaneously inferring a state that aligns with the observed signal.</description>

      <title>Functional Random Forest with Adaptive Cost-Sensitive Splitting for Imbalanced Functional Data Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classification of functional data where observations are curves or trajectories poses unique challenges, particularly under severe class imbalance. Traditional Random Forest algorithms, while robust for tabular data, often fail to capture the intrinsic structure of functional observations and struggle with minority class detection. This paper introduces Functional Random Forest with Adaptive Cost-Sensitive Splitting (FRF-ACS), a novel ensemble framework designed for imbalanced functional data classification. The proposed method leverages basis expansions and Functional Principal Component Analysis (FPCA) to represent curves efficiently, enabling trees to operate on low dimensional functional features. To address imbalance, we incorporate a dynamic cost sensitive splitting criterion that adjusts class weights locally at each node, combined with a hybrid sampling strategy integrating functional SMOTE and weighted bootstrapping. Additionally, curve specific similarity metrics replace traditional Euclidean measures to preserve functional characteristics during leaf assignment. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real world datasets including biomedical signals and sensor trajectories demonstrate that FRF-ACS significantly improves minority class recall and overall predictive performance compared to existing functional classifiers and imbalance handling techniques. This work provides a scalable, interpretable solution for high dimensional functional data analysis in domains where minority class detection is critical.</description>

      <title>Expectations in Expectation Propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Expectation Propagation (EP) is a widely used message-passing algorithm that decomposes a global inference problem into multiple local ones. It approximates marginal distributions (beliefs) using intermediate functions (messages). While beliefs must be proper probability distributions that integrate to one, messages may have infinite integral values. In Gaussian-projected EP, such messages take a Gaussian form and appear as if they have "negative" variances. Although allowed within the EP framework, these negative-variance messages can impede algorithmic progress.
  In this paper, we investigate EP in linear models and analyze the relationship between the corresponding beliefs. Based on the analysis, we propose both non-persistent and persistent approaches that prevent the algorithm from being blocked by messages with infinite integral values.
  Furthermore, by examining the relationship between the EP messages in linear models, we develop an additional approach that avoids the occurrence of messages with infinite integral values.</description>

      <title>Branching Fixed Effects: A Proposal for Communicating Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Economists often rely on estimates of linear fixed effects models developed by other teams of researchers. Assessing the uncertainty in these estimates can be challenging. I propose a form of sample splitting for network data that breaks two-way fixed effects estimates into statistically independent branches, each of which provides an unbiased estimate of the parameters of interest. These branches facilitate uncertainty quantification, moment estimation, and shrinkage. Algorithms are developed for efficiently extracting branches from large datasets. I illustrate these techniques using a benchmark dataset from Veneto, Italy that has been widely used to study firm wage effects.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty quantification for mixed membership in multilayer networks with degree heterogeneity using Gaussian variational inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Analyzing multilayer networks is central to understanding complex relational measurements collected across multiple conditions or over time. A pivotal task in this setting is to quantify uncertainty in community structure while appropriately pooling information across layers and accommodating layer-specific heterogeneity. Building on the multilayer degree-corrected mixed-membership (ML-DCMM) model, which captures both stable community membership profiles and layer-specific vertex activity levels, we propose a Bayesian inference framework based on a spectral-assisted likelihood. We then develop a computationally efficient Gaussian variational inference algorithm implemented via stochastic gradient descent. Our theoretical analysis establishes a variational Bernstein--von Mises theorem, which provides a frequentist guarantee for using the variational posterior to construct confidence sets for mixed memberships. We demonstrate the utility of the method on a U.S. airport longitudinal network, where the procedure yields robust estimates, natural uncertainty quantification, and competitive performance relative to state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Semiparametric Mixture Cure (Frailty) Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, mixture cure models have gained increasing popularity in survival analysis as an alternative to the Cox proportional hazards model, particularly in settings where a subset of patients is considered cured. The proportional hazards mixture cure model is especially advantageous when the presence of a cured fraction can be reasonably assumed, providing a more accurate representation of long-term survival dynamics. In this study, we propose a novel hierarchical Bayesian framework for the semiparametric mixture cure model, which accommodates both the inclusion and exclusion of a frailty component, allowing for greater flexibility in capturing unobserved heterogeneity among patients. Samples from the posterior distribution are obtained using a Markov chain Monte Carlo method, leveraging a hierarchical structure inspired by Bayesian Lasso. Comprehensive simulation studies are conducted across diverse scenarios to evaluate the performance and robustness of the proposed models. Bayesian model comparison and assessment are performed using various criteria. Finally, the proposed approaches are applied to two well-known datasets in the cure model literature: the E1690 melanoma trial and a colon cancer clinical trial.</description>

      <title>Solving the Poisson equation using coupled Markov chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.05691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.05691v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article shows how coupled Markov chains that meet exactly after a random number of iterations can be used to generate unbiased estimators of the solutions of the Poisson equation. Through this connection, we re-derive known unbiased estimators of expectations with respect to the stationary distribution of a Markov chain and provide conditions for the finiteness of their moments. We further construct unbiased estimators of the asymptotic variance of Markov chain ergodic averages, and provide conditions for the finiteness of the estimators' moments of any order. If their second moment is finite, the average of independent copies of such estimators converges to the asymptotic variance at the Monte Carlo rate, comparing favorably to known rates for batch means and spectral variance estimators. The results are illustrated with numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Hebbian Physics Networks: A Self-Organizing Computational Architecture Based on Local Physical Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00641v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physical transport processes organize through local interactions that redistribute imbalance while preserving conservation. Classical solvers enforce this organization by applying fixed discrete operators on rigid grids. We introduce the Hebbian Physics Network (HPN), a computational framework that replaces this rigid scaffolding with a plastic transport geometry. An HPN is a coupled dynamical system of physical states on nodes and constitutive weights on edges in a graph. Residuals--local violations of continuity, momentum balance, or energy conservation--act as thermodynamic forces that drive the joint evolution of both the state and the operator (i.e. the adaptive weights). The weights adapt through a three-factor Hebbian rule, which we prove constitutes a strictly local gradient descent on the residual energy. This mechanism ensures thermodynamic stability: near equilibrium, the learned operator naturally converges to a symmetric, positive-definite form, rigorously reproducing Onsager\'s reciprocal relations without explicit enforcement. Far from equilibrium, the system undergoes a self-organizing search for a transport topology that restores global coercivity. Unlike optimization-based approaches that impose physics through global loss functions, HPNs embed conservation intrinsically: transport is restored locally by the evolving operator itself, without a global Poisson solve or backpropagated objective. We demonstrate the framework on scalar diffusion and incompressible lid-driven cavity flow, showing that physically consistent transport geometries and flow structures emerge from random initial conditions solely through residual-driven local adaptation. HPNs thus reframe computation not as the solution of a fixed equation, but as a thermodynamic relaxation process where the constitutive geometry and physical state co-evolve.</description>
