      <title>Linear dynamics of random products of operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the linear dynamics of the random sequence $(T_n(.))_{n \geq 1}$ of the operators $T_n(\omega) = T(\tau^{n-1}\omega) \dotsm T(\tau \omega) T(\omega), n \geq 1$. These products depend on an ergodic measure-preserving transformation $\tau : \mathbb{T} \to \mathbb{T}$ on the probability space $(\mathbb{T}, m)$ and on a strongly measurable map $T : \mathbb{T} \to \mathcal{B}(X)$, where $X$ is a separable Fr\'echet space. We will be focusing on the case where $T(\omega)$ is equal to an operator $T_1$ on $X$ for every $\omega \in A_1$ and equal to an operator $T_2$ on $X$ for every $\omega \in A_2$, where $A_1, A_2$ are two disjoint Borel subsets of $[0,1)$ such that $A_1 \cup A_2 = [0,1)$ and $m(A_k) &gt; 0$ for $k = 1,2$. More precisely, we will be focusing on the case where the operators $T_1$ and $T_2$ are adjoints of multiplication operators on the Hardy space $H^2(\mathbb{D})$, as well as the case where $T_1$ and $T_2$ are entire functions of exponential type of the derivation operator on the space of entire functions. Finally, we will study the linear dynamics of a case of a random product $T_n(\omega)$ for which the operators $T(\tau^i \omega), i \geq 0$, do not commute.We will give particular importance to the case where the ergodic transformation is an irrational rotation or the doubling map on $\mathbb{T}$.</description>

      <title>Discretization of Continuous Frames by Quasi-Monte Carlo Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a discretization scheme for continuous localized frames using quasi-Monte Carlo integration and discrepancy theory. By generalizing classical concepts, we define a discrepancy measure on the entire phase space $\mathbb{R}^2$ and establish a corresponding Koksma-Hlawka inequality. This approach enables control over the density of the discretized frame and ensures the universality of the sampling set, relying only on the discrepancy of the sampling set and on the Sobolev-type seminorm of an iterated kernel rather than on specific frame properties.</description>

      <title>On $L$-$\omega$-nonexpansive maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider $L$-$\omega$-nonexpansive maps $T\colon K\to K$ on a convex subset $K$ of a Banach space $X$, i.e., maps in which $\omega_T(\delta)\leq L\delta +\omega(\delta)$ with $L\in [0,1]$, $\omega$ being a modulus of continuity and $\omega_T$ is the minimal modulus of continuity of $T$. Both AFPP and FPP are studied. For moduli $\omega$ with $\omega'(0)=\infty$, we show that if $X$ contains an isomorphic copy of $\co$ then it fails the FPP for $0$-$\omega$-nonexpansive maps with minimal displacement zero. In the affirmative direction, we prove for certain class of moduli $\omega$ that $0$-$\omega$-nonexpansive maps are constant on certain domains. Also, when $\omega'(0)\leq 1-L$ we show that AFPP works and FPP also works under a monotonicity condition on $\omega$. Further related results and examples are given.</description>

      <title>The Persson--Stepanov theorem revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a new proof of the result of L.-E.~Persson and V.D.~Stepanov \cite[Theorems 1 and 3]{Per:02}, which provides a characterization of a Hardy integral inequality involving two weights, and which can be applied to an effective treatment of the geometric mean operator. Our approach enables us to extend their result to the full range of parameters, in particular involving the critical case $p=1$, which was excluded in the original work. Our proof avoids all duality steps and discretization techniques and uses solely elementary means.</description>

Abstract: We completely characterize the topologizability and power boundedness of convolution and dual convolution operators on power series spaces. We determine necessary conditions for a Toeplitz operator to be m-topologizable, and power bounded on $\Lambda_{1}(n)$ and $\Lambda_{\infty}(n)$, and consequently on $H(\mathbb{C})$ and $H(\mathbb{D})$.</description>

      <title>A convex lifting approach for the Calder\'on problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Calder\'on problem consists in recovering an unknown coefficient of a partial differential equation from boundary measurements of its solution. These measurements give rise to a highly nonlinear forward operator. As a consequence, the development of reconstruction methods for this inverse problem is challenging, as they usually suffer from the problem of local convergence. To circumvent this issue, we propose an alternative approach based on lifting and convex relaxation techniques, that have been successfully developed for solving finite-dimensional quadratic inverse problems. This leads to a convex optimization problem whose solution coincides with the sought-after coefficient, provided that a non-degenerate source condition holds. We demonstrate the validity of our approach on a toy model where the solution of the partial differential equation is known everywhere in the domain. In this simplified setting, we verify that the non-degenerate source condition holds under certain assumptions on the unknown coefficient. We leave the investigation of its validity in the Calder\'on setting for future works.</description>

      <title>General Perturbation Resilient Dynamic String-Averaging for Inconsistent Problems with Superiorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce a General Dynamic String-Averaging (GDSA) iterative scheme and investigate its convergence properties in the inconsistent case, that is, when the input operators don't have a common fixed point. The Dynamic String-Averaging Projection (DSAP) algorithm itself was introduced in an 2013 paper, where its strong convergence and bounded perturbation resilience were studied in the consistent case (that is, when the sets under consideration had a nonempty intersection). Results involving combination of the DSAP method with superiorization, were presented in 2015. The proof of the weak convergence of our GDSA method is based on the notion of "strong coherence" of sequences of operators that was introduced in 2019. This is an improvement of the property of "coherence" of sequences of operators introduced in 2001 by Bauschke and Combettes. Strong coherence provides a more convenient sufficient convergence condition for methods that employ infinite sequences of operators and it turns out to be a useful general tool when applied to proving the convergence of many iterative methods. In this paper we combine the ideas of both dynamic string-averaging and strong coherence, in order to analyze our GDSA method for a general class of operators and its bounded perturbation resilience in the inconsistent case with weak and strong convergence. We then discuss an application of the GDSA method to the Superiorization Methodology, developing results on the behavior of its superiorized version.</description>

Abstract: Let $ G $ be a simple graph with the vertex cover number $ \tau $. The energy $ \mathcal{E}(G) $ of $ G $ is the sum of the absolute values of all the adjacency eigenvalues of $ G $. In this article, we establish $ \mathcal{E}(G)\geq 2\tau $ for several classes of graphs. The result significantly improves the known result $ \mathcal{E}(G)\geq 2\tau-2c$ for many classes of graphs, where $ c $ is the number of odd cycles.</description>

      <title>Typical properties of positive contractions and the invariant subspace problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14481v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we first study some elementary properties of a typical positive contraction on $\ell_q$ for the Strong Operator Topology and the Strong* Operator Topology. Using these properties, we prove that a typical positive contraction on $\ell_1$ (resp. on $\ell_2$) has a non-trivial invariant subspace for the Strong Operator Topology (resp. for the Strong Operator Topology and the Strong* Operator Topology). We then focus on the case where $X$ is a Banach space with a basis. We prove that a typical positive contraction on a Banach space with an unconditional basis has no non-trivial closed invariant ideals for the Strong Operator Topology and the Strong* Operator Topology. In particular, this shows that when $X = \ell_q$ with $1 \leq q &lt; \infty$, a typical positive contraction $T$ on $X$ for the Strong Operator Topology (resp. for the Strong* Operator Topology when $1 &lt; q &lt; \infty$) does not satisfy the Abramovich, Aliprantis and Burkinshaw criterion, that is, there is no non-zero positive operator in the commutant of $T$ which is quasinilpotent at a non-zero positive vector of $X$. Finally, we prove that, for the Strong* Operator Topology, a typical positive contraction on a reflexive Banach space with a monotone basis does not satisfy the Abramovich, Aliprantis and Burkinshaw criterion.</description>

      <title>On best approximation by multivariate ridge functions with applications to generalized translation networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08453v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove sharp upper and lower bounds for the approximation of Sobolev functions by sums of multivariate ridge functions, i.e., for approximation by functions of the form $\mathbb{R}^d \ni x \mapsto \sum_{k=1}^n \varrho_k(A_k x) \in \mathbb{R}$ with $\varrho_k : \mathbb{R}^\ell \to \mathbb{R}$ and $A_k \in \mathbb{R}^{\ell \times d}$. We show that the order of approximation asymptotically behaves as $n^{-r/(d-\ell)}$, where $r$ is the regularity (order of differentiability) of the Sobolev functions to be approximated. Our lower bound even holds when approximating $L^\infty$-Sobolev functions of regularity $r$ with error measured in $L^1$, while our upper bound applies to the approximation of $L^p$-Sobolev functions in $L^p$ for any $1 \leq p \leq \infty$. These bounds generalize well-known results regarding the approximation properties of univariate ridge functions to the multivariate case. We use our results to obtain sharp asymptotic bounds for the approximation of Sobolev functions using generalized translation networks and complex-valued neural networks.</description>

      <title>Similar operator topologies on the space of positive contractions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11587v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we study the similarity of the Polish operator topologies $\texttt{WOT}$, $\texttt{SOT}$, $\texttt{SOT}\mbox{$_{*}$}$ and $\texttt{SOT}\mbox{$^{*}$}$ on the set of the positive contractions on $\ell_p$ with $p &gt; 1$. Using the notion of norming vector for a positive operator, we prove that these topologies are similar on $\mathcal{P}_1(\ell_2)$, that is, they have the same dense sets in $\mathcal{P}_1(\ell_2)$. In particular, these topologies will share the same comeager sets in $\mathcal{P}_1(\ell_2)$. We then apply these results to the study of typical properties of positive contractions on $\ell_p$-spaces in the Baire category sense. In particular, we prove that a typical positive contraction $T \in (\mathcal{P}_1(\ell_2), \texttt{SOT})$ has no eigenvalue. This stands in strong contrast to a result of Eisner and M\'atrai, stating that the point spectrum of a typical contraction $T \in (\mathcal{B}_1(\ell_2), \texttt{SOT})$ contains the whole unit disk. As a consequence of our results, we obtain that a typical positive contraction $T \in (\mathcal{P}_1(\ell_2), \texttt{WOT})$ (resp. $T \in (\mathcal{P}_1(\ell_2), \texttt{SOT}\mbox{$_{*}$})$) has no eigenvalue.</description>

Abstract: In the work "Dealing with moment measures via entropy and optimal transport", Santambrogio provided an optimal transport approach to study existence of solutions for the moment measure equation, that is: given $\mu$, find $u$ such that $ (\nabla u)_{\sharp}e^{-u}=\mu$. In particular he proves that $u$ satisfies the previous equation if and only if $e^{-u}$ is the minimizer of an entropy and a transport cost. Here we study a modified minimization problem, in which we add a strongly convex regularization depending on a positive $\alpha$ and we link its solutions to a modified moment measure equation $(\nabla u)_{\sharp}e^{-u-\frac{\alpha}{2} \|x\|^2}= \mu$. Exploiting the regularization term, we study the stability of the minimizers.</description>

      <title>Definable Lipschitz selections for affine-set valued maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.09155v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Whitney's extension problem, i.e., how one can tell whether a function $f : X \to \mathbb R$, $X \subseteq \mathbb R^n$, is the restriction of a $C^m$-function on $\mathbb R^n$, was solved in full generality by Charles Fefferman in 2006. In this paper, we settle the $C^{1,\omega}$-case of a related conjecture: given that $f$ is semialgebraic and $\omega$ is a semialgebraic modulus of continuity, if $f$ is the restriction of a $C^{1,\omega}$-function then it is the restriction of a semialgebraic $C^{1,\omega}$-function. We work in the more general setting of sets that are definable in an o-minimial expansion of the real field. An ingenious argument of Brudnyi and Shvartsman relates the existence of $C^{1,\omega}$-extensions to the existence of Lipschitz selections of certain affine-set valued maps. We show that if a definable affine-set valued map has Lipschitz selections then it also has definable Lipschitz selections. In particular, we obtain a Lipschitz solution (more generally, $\omega$-H\"older solution, for any definable modulus of continuity $\omega$) of the definable Brenner-Epstein-Hochster-Koll\'ar problem. In most of our results we have control over the respective (semi)norms.</description>

      <title>Gradient Descent Algorithm in Hilbert Spaces under Stationary Markov Chains with $\phi$- and $\beta$-Mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03551v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a strictly stationary Markov chain gradient descent algorithm operating in general Hilbert spaces. Our analysis focuses on the mixing coefficients of the underlying process, specifically the $\phi$- and $\beta$-mixing coefficients. Under these assumptions, we derive probabilistic upper bounds on the convergence behavior of the algorithm based on the exponential as well as the polynomial decay of the mixing coefficients.</description>

      <title>Analytic diffeomorphisms of the circle and topological Riemann-Roch theorem for circle fibrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10517v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the group $\mathcal G$ which is the semidirect product of the group of analytic functions with values in ${\mathbb C}^*$ on the circle and the group of analytic diffeomorphisms of the circle that preserve the orientation. Then we construct the central extensions of the group $\mathcal G$ by the group ${\mathbb C}^*$. The first central extension, so-called the determinant central extension, is constructed by means of determinants of linear operators acting in infinite-dimensional locally convex topological $\mathbb C$-vector spaces. Other central extensions are constructed by $\cup$-products of group $1$-cocycles with the application to them the map related with algebraic $K$-theory. We prove in the second cohomology group, i.e. modulo of a group $2$-coboundary, the equality of the $12$th power of the $2$-cocycle constructed by the first central extension and the product of integer powers of the $2$-cocycles constructed above by means of $\cup$-products (in multiplicative notation). As an application of this result we obtain the new topological Riemann-Roch theorem for a complex line bundle $L$ on a smooth manifold $M$, where $\pi :M \to B$ is a fibration in oriented circles. More precisely, we prove that in the group $H^3(B, {\mathbb Z})$ the element $12 \, [ {\mathcal Det} (L)]$ is equal to the element $6 \, \pi_* ( c_1(L) \cup c_1(L))$, where $[{\mathcal Det} (L)]$ is the class of the determinant gerbe on $B$ constructed by $L$ and the determinant central extension.</description>
