      <title>Injection Optimization at Particle Accelerators via Reinforcement Learning: From Simulation to Real-World Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimizing the injection process in particle accelerators is crucial for enhancing beam quality and operational efficiency. This paper presents a framework for utilizing Reinforcement Learning (RL) to optimize the injection process at accelerator facilities. By framing the optimization challenge as an RL problem, we developed an agent capable of dynamically aligning the beam's transverse space with desired targets. Our methodology leverages the Soft Actor-Critic algorithm, enhanced with domain randomization and dense neural networks, to train the agent in simulated environments with varying dynamics promoting it to learn a generalized robust policy. The agent was evaluated in live runs at the Cooler Synchrotron COSY and it has successfully optimized the beam cross-section reaching human operator level but in notably less time. An empirical study further validated the importance of each architecture component in achieving a robust and generalized optimization strategy. The results demonstrate the potential of RL in automating and improving optimization tasks at particle acceleration facilities.</description>

      <title>Characterization of Additive Manufacturing Materials for String Assembly in Cleanroom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Beamline components, such as superconducting radio frequency cavities and focusing lenses, need to be assembled together in a string while in a cleanroom environment. The present contribution identifies and characterizes materials for additive manufacturing that can be used in a cleanroom. The well known advantages of additive manufacturing processes would highly benefit the design and development of tooling needed for the mechanical support and alignment of string components. Cleanliness, mechanical properties, and leak tightness of the chosen materials are the main focus of this contribution, which also paves the way for the integration of such materials in cryomodule assemblies. Results reported here were obtained in the framework of the PIP-II project at Fermilab.</description>
