      <title>Are Events Absolute?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Wigner's Friend thought experiment stands as one of the most intellectually provocative and challenging conceptual puzzles in quantum mechanics. It compels us to confront profound questions concerning the fundamental nature of reality, the very act of observation, and the possible role that consciousness might play within the quantum measurement process. This article gives a general presentation, beginning with Eugene Wigner's seminal proposal of the original thought experiment. In this paper, we explore its initial implications, which shook the foundations of classical physics, and then progress to an examination of the recent theoretical advancements and the ingenious extended versions of the experiment. The recent versions seem to imply that it is no more possible to consider events as absolute.</description>

      <title>'Setting Fire to the Last Forest': Project West Ford and the Mobilization of the Astronomical Community 1958-1965</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14714</link>

Abstract: The dawning of the Space Age marked the start of an ongoing relationship between the professional astronomical community and both state and non-state actors that launch and operate spacecraft in near-Earth orbital space. While the Cold War heated up in the late 1950s, military uses of outer space quickly came into conflict with the priorities of astronomers then building ever-bigger ground-based telescopes and envisioning the first generation of space telescopes. As the threat of global thermonuclear war loomed, the United States carried out Project West Ford, which tested an 'artificial ionosphere' for microwave radio propagation by placing several hundred million tiny copper dipoles into a belt orbiting the Earth. While the test was ultimately successful, it ignited a firestorm of concern and criticism among astronomers and ultimately influenced the framing of the United Nations Outer Space Treaty. Here we examine the history of Project West Ford as it prompted astronomers to react, comparing it with the ongoing problem of the potential impact of large satellite constellations on astronomical research.</description>

      <title>Taming Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In statistics and causal modeling it is common for a selection process to induce correlations in a subset of an uncorrelated ensemble. We propose that EPR and Bell correlations are selection artefacts of this kind. The selection process is preparation of the initial state of the relevant experiments. Choice of initial state amounts to preselection of a subensemble of a larger, uncorrelated, virtual ensemble of possble histories. Because it is preselection rather than postselection, the resulting correlations support the intuitive counterfactuals of the EPR argument and Bell nonlocality. In this respect, and in its temporal orientation, the case differs from familiar forms of selection bias. Given the ubiquity of quantum entanglement, the result may thus be of independent interest to students of causal modeling. The paper concludes with a discussion of its novel implications in that field.</description>

      <title>Maxwell's Demon Is Foiled by the Entropy Cost of Measurement, Not Erasure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18186v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I dispute the conventional claim that the second law of thermodynamics is saved from a "Maxwell's Demon" by the entropy cost of information erasure, and show that instead it is measurement that incurs the entropy cost. Thus Brillouin, who identified measurement as savior of the second law, was essentially correct, and putative refutations of his view, such as Bennett's claim to measure without entropy cost, are seen to fail when the applicable physics is taken into account. I argue that the tradition of attributing the defeat of Maxwell's Demon to erasure rather than to measurement arose from unphysical classical idealizations that do not hold for real gas molecules, as well as a physically ungrounded recasting of physical thermodynamical processes into computational and information-theoretic conceptualizations. I argue that the fundamental principle that saves the second law is the quantum uncertainty principle applying to the need to localize physical states to precise values of observables in order to effect the desired disequilibria aimed at violating the second law. I obtain the specific entropy cost for localizing a molecule in the Szilard engine and show that it coincides with the quantity attributed to Landauer's principle. I also note that an experiment characterized as upholding an entropy cost of erasure in a "quantum Maxwell's Demon" actually demonstrates an entropy cost of measurement.</description>
