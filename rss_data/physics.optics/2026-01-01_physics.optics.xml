      <title>Edge emission from 265~nm UV-C LEDs grown by MBE on bulk AlN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: UV-C LEDs pseudomorphically grown by MBE on bulk AlN substrates emitting at 265 nm are demonstrated. High current density up to 800 A/cm$^2$, 5 orders of on/off ratio, and low differential on-resistance of 2.6 m$\Omega\cdot$cm$^2$ at the highest current density is achieved. The LED heterostructure has a high refractive index waveguide core surrounded by n- and p-cladding layers similar to a laser diode designed for mode confinement at 270 nm to facilitate edge emission and collection of photons. Edge-emitting devices are made by cleaving the fabricated LEDs along the $m$-plane of the wurtzite crystal. Electrical injection results in emission of high energy 4.7 eV photons that are collected from the cleaved edge of the LEDs corresponding to the optical bandgap of the AlGaN active region. The contribution of power dissipation across the n- and p-regions of the diode is discussed. The n-contact resistance to n-AlGaN is identified as the largest contributor to the series resistance of the LED in the present generation of devices.</description>

      <title>A two-dimensional terahertz smart wristband for integrated sensing and communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of wearable devices for terahertz (THz) integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is pivotal for forthcoming 6G Internet of Things (IoT) and wearable optoelectronics. However, existing THz system suffers from bulkiness, narrow spectral response and limited flexibility constrained by their dependence on external antennas, complex coupling architectures and rigid components. Here, we present a 2D THz smart wristband based on a graphene plasmon polariton atomic cavity (PPAC) array, which integrates sensing and communication within a monolithic microdetector. Operating without any external antenna, the compact and flexible device enables self-powered, polarization-sensitive and frequency-selective THz detection across a broad response spectrum from 0.25 to 4.24 THz, with a responsivity of 6 V/W, a response time of 62 ms, and mechanical robustness maintained over 2000 bending cycles. Notably, we further exploit its multi-parameter THz responses for dual-purpose ISAC functionality. For sensing, the polarization- and strain-dependent THz responses are utilized as high-dimensional features for a convolutional neural network (CNN), enabling circuit fault diagnosis with 97% accuracy. For communication, the device implements secure encrypted communication under simulated on-body wearing condition through dual-channel encoding of THz polarization and on-off signals. This 2D ISAC platform paves the way for miniaturized, intelligent wearable systems for advanced human-machine interaction.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Meron Spin Textures in Generic Focused Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical spin textures with nontrivial topology hold promise for structured light and photonic information processing, yet their generation typically relies heavily on externally structured light with care. This raises questions about their universal existence and true robustness. Here, we uncover and experimentally verify a meron-like spin texture that emerges intrinsically in focused fields, without any wavefront engineering. This intrinsic meron spin texture, unlike their externally engineered counterparts, exhibits exceptional robustness against a wide range of inputs, including partially polarized and spatially disordered pupils corrupted by decoherence and depolarization. We attribute its resilience to topological protection from phase vortices in the focal field. Our findings reveal a naturally occurring spin structure that is intrinsic to the focused field with exceptional robustness against noise, which complements the existing externally engineered ones. It offers new ingredients into topological spin textures in optics and enriches their potentials for disorder-resilient photonic applications.</description>

      <title>Exceptional Points in the Scattering Resonances of a Sphere Dimer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate exceptional points of degeneracy (EPDs) in electromagnetic scattering of a sphere dimer from the electroquasistatic limit to the fully retarded regime. In the quasistatic limit, we prove that $\parity\trev$-symmetric configurations, realized by spheres with complex-conjugate susceptibilities, host EPDs. Beyond this limit, retardation breaks $\parity\trev$-symmetry; nevertheless, by jointly tuning the material dispersion of the two spheres, we derive analytic conditions for the existence of EPDs at \textit{real-frequencies}. Near an EPD, we show that single-parameter perturbations yield the characteristic square-root splitting of the eigenfrequencies, and we quantify its impact on scattering, extinction, and absorption, clarifying sensing implications.</description>

      <title>Entanglement dynamics driven by topology and non-Hermiticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay between topology and non-Hermiticity gives rise to exotic dynamic phenomena that challenge conventional wave-packet propagation and entanglement dynamics. While recent studies have established the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) as a key mechanism for anomalous wave dynamics, a unified framework for characterizing and controlling entanglement evolution in non-Hermitian topological systems remains underdeveloped. Here, by combining theory and experiments, we demonstrate that entanglement entropy (EE) and transport currents serve as robust dynamic probes to distinguish various non-Hermitian topological regimes. Using a generalized non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model implemented in an acoustic analog platform, we identify three dynamic phases, bulk-like, edge-like, and skin-like regimes, each exhibiting unique EE signatures and transport characteristics. In particular, skin-like dynamics exhibit periodic information shuttling with finite, oscillatory EE, while edge-like dynamics lead to complete EE suppression. We further map the dynamic phase diagram and show that EE scaling and temporal profiles directly reflect the competition between coherent delocalization and NHSE-driven localization. Our results establish a programmable approach to steering entanglement and transport via tailored non-Hermitian couplings, offering a pathway for engineering quantum information dynamics in synthetic phononic, photonic, and quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Unidirectional reflection lasing based on destructive interference and Bragg scattering modulation in defective atomic lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The novel and ingenious scheme we propose for achieving unidirectional reflection lasing (URL) involves integrating a one-dimensional (1D) defective atomic lattice with a coherent gain atomic system. Its physical essence lies in the fact that the right-side reflectivity is drastically reduced due to the destructive interference between primary and secondary reflections, whereas on the left-side primary reflection is effectively suppressed and the secondary reflection is efficiently enhanced, ultimately reaching the lasing threshold. Through numerical results and further analyses, we have elucidated how to precisely tailor the lattice parameters and coupling fields to control destructive interference point (DIP), thereby realizing URL and enabling its active modulation. Our scheme is experimentally feasible and not only effectively circumvents the stringent conditions faced in directly realizing URL, providing a new pathway, but also beneficial for integrating active photonic devices into compact quantum networks and may improve the efficiency of optical information transmission.</description>

      <title>Photon Echo in Uniaxially Stressed Germanium with Antimony Donors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photon echo is observed in n-type Ge uniaxially stressed along the [111] crystallographic direction, with a coherence relaxation time of 300 ps. The nonlinear polarization responsible for the effect originates from antimony donors. Uniaxial stress induces valley splitting of the donor states, substantially enhancing the coherence time and enabling the observation of photon echo.</description>

      <title>Robust Physical Encryption and Unclonable Object Identification in Classical Optical Networks using Standard Integrated Photonic Components</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spectral complexity is a useful resource in physical device identification, disorder-enhanced spectroscopy, and machine learning, but is often achieved in chip-scale devices at the expense of propagation loss, scalability, or reconfigurability. In this work, we demonstrate that device specific spectral complexity can be achieved using completely standardized photonic building blocks. Using a waveguide Mach-Zehnder interferometer internally loaded with two sets of non-concentric dual ring resonators, we demonstrate the generation of unclonable keys for one-time pad encryption which can be reconfigured on the fly by applying small voltages to on-chip thermo-optic elements. With this method, we access a keyspace larger than 12 Tb for a single device with simple, single-mode waveguide input and output coupling. Using two devices at either end of a communication channel, we show that an eavesdropper tapping the channel fibre link would be unable to recover the same spectrum measured at either end of the link, providing physical encryption for key distribution. Furthermore, being purely classical, this form of secure communications does not require quantum photonic sources or detectors, and can therefore be easily integrated into pre-existing telecommunication architectures.</description>

      <title>Configurational-entropy-driven structural and optical stability in high-entropy halide perovskites for broadband NIR photonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By injecting configurational entropy into soft ionic lattices, high-entropy halide perovskites offer a compelling route toward photonic materials that are both functionally rich and operationally robust; however, converting compositional complexity into predictable optical function remains challenging. Here we demonstrate device-relevant ultrabroadband near-infrared (NIR) photonics by integrating element-specific roles within an entropy-stabilized lattice. We establish high-entropy rare-earth halide double-perovskite single crystals, Cs2Na(Sb,Re)Cl6 (Re3+ = Sc3+, Er3+, Yb3+, Tm3+), where near-equiatomic B(III)-site alloying yields a single-phase cubic solid solution (S_config about 1.6R) with homogeneous multication incorporation. Sb3+ acts as a broadband sensitizer that unifies excitation and cooperatively activates multiple lanthanide emitters, transforming single-mode emission into wide-coverage NIR output (850-1600 nm) with three fingerprint bands at 996, 1220, and 1540 nm. This tri-peak, self-referenced signature enables redundancy-based ratiometric readout with reduced sensitivity to intensity drift, supporting reliable solvent identification and quantitative mixture sensing. Beyond functional expansion, accelerated aging tests show markedly improved tolerance to humidity and oxygen versus single-component analogues. The robustness is experimentally attributed to octahedral contraction-strengthened metal-halide bonding that increases the kinetic barrier for moisture-triggered bond cleavage, together with entropy-induced lattice distortion that impedes long-range halide migration and suppresses defect/impurity-phase formation. Finally, a UV-pumped phosphor-converted LED delivers spectrally stable, wide-coverage NIR illumination, highlighting configurational-entropy engineering as a practical strategy to couple ultrabroadband photonic function with environmental stability.</description>

      <title>Mid-Infrared Photothermal Relaxation Intensity Diffraction Tomography for Video-rate Volumetric Chemical Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three-dimensional molecular imaging of living cells is essential for unraveling cellular metabolism and response to therapies. However, existing volumetric methods, including fluorescence microscopy and quantitative phase imaging, either require fluorescent labels or lack chemical specificity. Mid-infrared (mid-IR) photothermal microscopy provides label-free spectroscopic contrast with sub-micrometer resolution but is limited by slow acquisition rates, precluding 3D live-cell studies. Here, we present a photothermal relaxation intensity diffraction tomography (PRIDT) system that encodes mid-IR absorption induced refractive index change via a photothermal relaxation scheme and recovers it through intensity diffraction tomography. PRIDT achieves video-rate volumetric chemical imaging with up to 15 Hz per wavelength and offers lateral and axial resolutions of 264 nm and 1.12 um over a volumetric field of view of 50x50x10 um3. We showcase high-speed PRIDT imaging of protein and lipid metabolism in ovarian cancer cells and lipid-droplet dynamics in live cells. PRIDT opens new avenues for rapid, quantitative, three-dimensional molecular imaging in living systems.</description>

      <title>Achieving high-performance polarization-independent nonreciprocal thermal radiation with pattern-free heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many advanced energy harvesting technologies rely on advanced control of thermal emission. Recently, it has been shown that the emissivity and absorptivity of thermal emitters can be controlled independently in nonreciprocal emitters. While significant progress has been made in engineering these nonreciprocal thermal emitters, realizing a highly efficient, pattern-free emitter capable of supporting dual-polarization nonreciprocal emission remains a challenging task. Existing solutions are largely based on metamaterials and exhibit polarization-dependent behavior. This work proposes pattern-free multilayer heterostructures combining magneto-optical and magnetic Weyl semimetal materials and systematically evaluates their nonreciprocal emission performance for p- and s-polarized waves. The findings show that omnidirectional polarization-independent nonreciprocity can be achieved utilizing multilayer structures with different magnetization directions that do not follow simple vector summation. To further enhance the performance, Pareto optimization is employed to tune the key design parameters, enabling the maximization of nonreciprocal thermal emission in a given wavelength range. This approach offers a versatile strategy for designing high-performance thermal emitters tailored for multi-objective optical functionalities.</description>

      <title>Mathematical Theory for Photonic Hall Effect in Honeycomb Photonic Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we develop a mathematical theory for the photonic Hall effect and prove the existence of guided electromagnetic waves at the interface of two honeycomb photonic crystals. The guided wave resembles the edge states in electronic systems: it is induced by the topological Hall effect, and the wave propagates along the interface but not in the bulk media. Starting from a symmetric honeycomb photonic crystal that attains Dirac points at the high-symmetry points of the Brillouin zone, $K$ and $K'$, we introduce two classes of perturbations for the periodic medium. The perturbations lift the Dirac degeneracy, forming a spectral band valley at the points $K$ and $K'$ with well-defined topological phase that depends on the sign of the perturbation parameters. By employing the layer potential techniques and spectral analysis, we investigate the existence of guided wave along an interface when two honeycomb photonic crystals are glued together. In particular, we elucidate the relationship between the existence of the interface mode and the nature of perturbations imposed on the two periodic media separated by the interface.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An analytic description of high harmonic generation (HHG) in solids induced by intense low-frequency pulses is presented within an adiabatic approach, which treats laser-matter interactions nonperturbatively. We derive the analytical expression for the laser-dressed state of an electron in an arbitrary spatially periodic potential, taking into account multiband structure of the solid target. Closed-form formulas for electron current and HHG spectra are presented. Based on the developed theory, we provide an analytic explanation for key features of HHG yield and show that the interband mechanism of HHG prevails over the intraband one.</description>

      <title>Polarization-Differential Loss Enabled High Polarization Extinction in Hollow-Core Fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Delivering a well defined state of polarization over hollow core fibres (HCFs) is pivotal for next generation ultra stable photonic systems. Yet in all existing HCFs, whether birefringent or not, their polarization extinction ratio (PER) rapidly deteriorates during propagation or under mechanical disturbance, leaving no practical high and stable PER solution. Here, we break this impasse by embedding a polarization differential loss (PDL) mechanism directly into the cladding architecture.</description>

      <title>Pathway to Optical-Cycle Dynamic Photonics: Extreme Electron Temperatures in Transparent Conducting Oxides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We find that transparent conducting oxides (TCOs) exhibit oscillatory (sign-reversing) dynamics on a few optical cycle timescale under extreme electron temperatures. We demonstrate a mechanism for such transient dynamics and present an inverse-designed multilayer cavity incorporating an ultrathin TCO layer that supports the oscillatory behavior. This approach yields transmittance oscillations with a period of ~20 fs, which corresponds to three optical cycles of the probe beam. To achieve a similar oscillatory modulation in the refractive index, we incorporate a TCO electron-acceptor layer on top of the inverse-designed cavity, enabling thermionic carrier injection at the TCO heterojunction. The resulting acceptor layer achieves a striking {\Delta}n response time as short as 9 fs, approaching a single optical cycle, and is further tunable to sub-cycle timescales. The findings not only clarify the elusive transient physics in TCOs but also demonstrate, for the first time, the critical role of electron temperatures in driving oscillatory dynamic responses. More broadly, we establish TCO-based thermionic carrier injection as a practical route to novel time-varying photonic media operating on the timescale of an optical cycle, enabling time-reflection, time-refraction, and related dynamic phenomena from the visible to the infrared.</description>

      <title>Scalable ultrafast random bit generation using wideband chaos-based entropy sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exponential growth of data transmission and processing speeds in modern digital infrastructure requires entropy sources capable of producing large volumes of true randomness for information security. Chaotic emissions from semiconductor lasers are attractive in this context because of their fast dynamics and nonrepetitive behavior. Their spectral bandwidth, however, is typically limited to several tens of gigahertz, which constrains the achievable entropy rate and makes ultrafast random bit generation difficult without substantial post-processing. Here, we demonstrate a chaos-based entropy source that employs optical heterodyning between the chaotic emission from a semiconductor laser and an optical frequency comb, yielding a bandwidth exceeding 100 GHz and an experimentally verified single-channel entropy rate of 1.86 Tb/s. By directly extracting multiple bits from the digitized output of the entropy source, we achieve a single-channel random bit generation rate of 1.536 Tb/s, while four-channel parallelization reaches 6.144 Tb/s with no observable interchannel correlation. This linear scalability suggests that aggregate throughput could reach hundreds of terabits per second with additional parallel channels. The broadband, low-overhead photonic architecture presented here provides a viable route to real-time, ultrafast random bit generation with broad implications for secure communications, high-performance AI computing, and large-scale data analytics.</description>

      <title>Generation of NIR and Visible Structured Light Beams with a Mechanical Long-Period Fiber Grating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents the tunable generation of vortex, vector, and flat-top 1060-nm NIR beams in a few-mode fiber with a mechanical long-period fiber grating. By the variation of applied force on the fiber grating, the core mode to higher-order mode excitation can be adjusted. The manipulation of the beam transformation is achieved through the polarization control of the fiber eigenmodes and mode coupling efficiency. By precisely tuning the intensity ratio between fundamental and doughnut modes, we arrive at the generation of propagation-invariant vector flat-top beams for more than 5 m. Transverse optical field of 532-nm green light from frequency-doubled Nd-doped yttrium vanadate laser is manipulated and coupled into various intensity distributions in a few-mode fiber by using a mechanically induced long-period fiber grating. We show that the doughnut beam, the Mexican-hat beam, and the crater-lake beam can be generated from the input Gaussian beam via the coupling of the fundamental core mode to a series of co-propagating higher-order modes with properly applied forces and polarizations.</description>

      <title>Optical Spiking Neural Networks via Rogue-Wave Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical computing could reduce the energy cost of artificial intelligence by leveraging the parallelism and propagation speed of light. However, implementing nonlinear activation, essential for machine learning, remains challenging in low-power optical systems dominated by linear wave physics. Here, we introduce an optical spiking neural network that uses optical rogue-wave statistics as a programmable firing mechanism. By establishing a homomorphism between free-space diffraction and neuronal integration, we demonstrate that phase-engineered caustics enable robust, passive thresholding: sparse spatial spikes emerge when the local intensity exceeds a significant-intensity rogue-wave criterion. Using a physics-informed digital twin, we optimize granular phase masks to deterministically concentrate energy into targeted detector regions, enabling end-to-end co-design of the optical transformation and a lightweight electronic readout. We experimentally validate the approach on BreastMNIST and Olivetti Faces, achieving accuracies of 82.45\% and 95.00\%, respectively, competitive with standard digital baselines. These results demonstrate that extreme-wave phenomena, often treated as deleterious fluctuations, can be harnessed as structural nonlinearity for scalable, energy-efficient neuromorphic photonic inference.</description>

      <title>Noise resilient real-time phase imaging via undetected light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum imaging with undetected light has recently emerged as a technique in which quantum correlations and nonlinear interferometry are combined to decouple illumination and detection paths. This approach has been more recently extended and combined with digital phase-shifting holography and off-axis holography to extract both the amplitude and phase information of a sample relying on single-photon interference. Despite these advantages, implementing the technique in real-world scenarios where the observed system is subject to environmental noise and dynamic variations remains challenging. The primary limitation lies in the inability of quantum imaging systems to retrieve object information in real time under high-noise conditions. Here, we experimentally demonstrate real-time amplitude and phase imaging in noisy environments, building upon our previous implementation of quantum off-axis holography. Our results demonstrate real-time imaging at acquisition rates up to 4~Hz, even when the noise level exceeds the signal by an order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Extreme nonlinear optics in optical fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.25046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper reviews the field of extreme nonlinear optics in optical fibers, highlighting key phenomena and advancements. It discusses multiple ionization effects caused by femtosecond laser pulses that generate plasma and induce permanent material modifications, as well as plasma luminescence and its dependence on material imperfections. The formation and dynamics of plasma filaments, including helical structures, are explored, along with the rainbow spiral emission pattern useful in communications and particle manipulation. The review covers the generation of spatial-temporal waves, supercontinuum broadening, and advanced modeling techniques, such as multimode unidirectional pulse propagation equations for describing optical pulse evolution. Experimental demonstrations involving discretized conical waves and supercontinuum generation optimization are detailed. The paper emphasizes the unique capabilities of photonic crystal fibers, especially hollow-core variants, in achieving broad supercontinua and Raman frequency combs, ultrashort pulse compression, high-harmonic generation, plasma formation, and nonclassical light production. Our outlook highlights ongoing research into spatiotemporal helicon waves, ultrashort pulse propagation, vacuum ultraviolet and mid-infrared supercontinuum generation, and innovative fiber technologies. Future directions focus on enhancing fiber performance, understanding multimodal wave dynamics, and expanding applications in telecommunications, sensing, and quantum science.</description>

      <title>All optical Lithography for Spatiotemporal Patterning of Azopolymer Microreliefs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.25048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microstructured surfaces are central to photonics, biointerfaces, and functional coatings, yet they are typically fabricated through multi-step lithographic workflows requiring masks or molds and post-processing. Azopolymers provide an alternative route by converting structured optical fields into surface reliefs via light-induced mass migration, but existing approaches have been limited to smooth, shallow, and engraving-like topographies produced from a flat film. Here we introduce an all-optical, maskless, fully digital lithography platform that exploits engineered darkness within computer-generated holograms to spatially localize inward mass transport and directly produce positive, protruding microreliefs. We show that isolated and array of micro-bumps can be generated from pristine flat azopolymer films in a single writing step, and we introduce spatiotemporal control through sequential tailored illumination to reshape microrelief profiles, enabling flattened-top micropillars, programmable array shapes and arrangements, and free-form continuous microrelief designs. Hierarchical microarchitectures are also demonstrated by extending the concept of multi-step illumination sequences. As functional demonstrations, we realize multi-focus microlenses and quasi-square diffraction gratings with enhanced 1st-order efficiencies. Finally, we leverage azopolymer reconfigurability to implement write-erase-rewrite cycles that reset and repurpose the same surface region for distinct micropatterns, enabling rewritable surfaces and reprogrammable master templates for replication. Overall, this work establishes a scalable spatiotemporal strategy for on-demand, all-optical microfabrication and reprogramming of structured surfaces, where spatial and temporal degrees of freedom of holographic patterns intermix to produce advanced patterning capabilities.</description>

      <title>Arithmetic with spatiotemporal optical vortex of integer and fractional topological charges</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.25049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatiotemporal optical vortices carry transverse orbital angular momentum (t-OAM), which give rise to spatiotemporal topological charge (ST-TC). To unleash the full potential of t-OAM in expanding the capacity of communication and computing, we demonstrate the first optical information-processing pipeline capable of performing addition and subtraction on ST-TC values, regardless of whether they are integer or fractional. Additionally, we established a readout method for those mathematical operations through imaging spectral analysis, providing a robust optical basis toward arithmetic operations and verification. These new capabilities mark crucial advancements toward full arithmetic operations on the ST-TC of light for bosonic state computation and information processing.</description>

      <title>Quantization of Physical Interaction Strengths via Singular Moduli</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since the 2019 redefinition of the SI units, precision metrology has sought to anchor all physical quantities to fundamental constants and integer invariants. While the optical frequency comb revolutionized timekeeping by discretizing the continuum of light into countable teeth, and the Quantum Hall Effect standardized resistance via topological invariants, a comparable standard for interaction strength remains elusive. Currently, measuring the coupling constant ($g$) between quantum systems is an estimation problem, inherently subject to drift, noise, and fabrication variance. Here, we introduce Interaction Metrology, a protocol that transforms the measurement of coupling strengths from an analog estimation into a topological counting problem. By engineering a specific class of algebraic catastrophe -- the Unimodal $X_9$ singularity -- in a driven-dissipative lattice, we prove that the system's interaction moduli are topologically forced to take discrete, quantized values, forming a "Geometric $k$-Comb." We derive the universality class of this quantization, showing that it arises from the discrepancy between the Milnor ($\mu$) and Tjurina ($\tau$) numbers of the effective potential, a strictly non-Hermitian effect forbidden in standard quantum mechanics. Finally, we provide an ab-initio blueprint for a silicon nitride implementation, demonstrating that this quantization is robust against disorder levels exceeding current foundry tolerances. This discovery establishes a universal standard for force sensing and quantum logic gates, enabling the calibration of interaction strengths with topological certainty.</description>

      <title>5-GHz chip-based quantum key distribution with 1Mbps secure key rate over 150 km</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) enables secure communication by harnessing the fundamental principles of quantum physics, which inherently guarantee information-theoretic security and intrinsic resistance to quantum computing attacks. However, the secure key rate of QKD typically decreases exponentially with increasing channel distance. In this work, by developing a novel polarization-state preparation method, an ultra-low time-jitter laser source and superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors, we demonstrate a 5-GHz integrated QKD system featuring ultra-low quantum bit error rates (QBERs). The system achieves secure key rates of 1.076 Mbps at 150 km and 105 kbps at 200 km over standard single-mode fiber channels, respectively. Our system substantially enhances the secure key rate, enabling high-resolution video calls with one-time-pad encryption over intercity backbone QKD links. This work represents a significant step forward in the development of high-performance practical QKD systems.</description>

      <title>High Space-bandwidth Product Label-free Examination of iPSC-derived Brain Organoids via Fourier Ptychographic Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fourier ptychographic microscopy (FPM) is a promising quantitative phase imaging technique that enables high-resolution, label-free imaging over a large field-of-view. Here, we present the first application of FPM for the quantitative analysis of human brain organoid slices, providing a powerful, cost-effective, and label-free enhancement to the current gold-standard fluorescence microscopy. Brain organoids, prepared as thin (5 micrometer) slices, were imaged with a custom-built FPM system consisting of a standard light microscope (4x, 0.2 NA objective) and a 7x7 LED array. This configuration achieved a synthetic numerical aperture of 0.54 and a spatial resolution of approximately 488 nm across an area of 2.077 x 3.65 mm. Fluorescence microscopy was used in parallel for neurons, astrocytes, and nuclei labeling, providing rich fluorescence imaging. Moreover, we designed an automated method to merge classical resolution fluorescence images to visualize the whole brain organoid and align it with the numerically increased space-bandwidth product FPM image. The provided alignment method enables rich phase-fluorescence correlative imaging. Based on the segmentation performed on the stitched fluorescence images, we devised a quantitative phase analysis revealing a higher mean optical thickness of the nuclei versus astrocytes and neurons. Notably, nuclei located in neurogenic regions consistently exhibited significantly higher phase values (optical path difference) compared to nuclei elsewhere, suggesting cell-type-specific biophysical signatures. The label-free, quantitative, and high-throughput capabilities of the FPM approach demonstrated here make it a powerful and accessible tool for future structural and functional studies of whole-section brain organoid development and disease modeling studies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a framework to investigate the collective properties of atomic lattices in one, two, and three dimensions. We analyze the single-photon band structure and associated atomic decay rates, revealing a fundamental dependence on dimensionality. One- and two-dimensional arrays are shown to be inherently radiative, exhibiting band gaps and decay rates that oscillate between superradiant and subradiant regimes, as a function of lattice spacing. In contrast, three-dimensional lattices are found to be fundamentally non-radiative due to the inhibition of spontaneous emission, with decay only at discrete Bragg resonances. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this structural difference dictates the system dynamics, which crosses over from dissipative decay in lower dimensions to coherent transport in three dimensions. Our results provide insight into cooperative effects in atomic arrays at the single-photon level.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continuous cardiovascular monitoring is essential for managing circulatory health and disease, yet most wearable sensors are constrained by reliance on electrical transduction and built-in electronics. We present a circuit-free, wholly optical approach using diffraction from a skin-interfaced nanostructured surface to detect minute skin strains from the arterial pulse. A smartphone camera records the shifting diffraction pattern in real time, removing the need for spectrometers or other optical hardware. In phantom and human studies, we recovered high-fidelity arterial pulse waves and detected benign arrhythmic events in close agreement with a clinical reference. Derived waveforms captured features linked to arterial stiffness, a key cardiovascular risk marker. Our approach uses battery-free, cost-effective, and disposable platforms enabling scalable monitoring for healthcare and broad consumer applications.</description>

Abstract: Pure-state manifestations of geometric phase are well established and have found applications across essentially all branches of physics, yet their generalization to mixed-state regimes remains largely unexplored experimentally. The Uhlmann geometric phase offers a natural extension of pure-state paradigms and can exhibit a topological character. However, observation of this invariant is impeded by the incompatibility between Uhlmann parallel transport and Hamiltonian dynamics, as well as the difficulty of preparing topologically nontrivial mixed states. To address this challenge, we report an experimentally accessible protocol for directly measuring the mixed-state topological invariant. By engineering controlled nonunitary dynamics in a photonic quantum walk, we prepare topologically nontrivial mixed states from a trivial initial state. Furthermore, by machine-learning the full density matrix in momentum space, we directly extract the quantized geometric phase of the nontrivial mixed states. These results highlight a geometric phase framework that naturally extends to open quantum systems both in and out of thermal equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Image-Plane Detection of Spatially Entangled Photon Pairs with a CMOS Camera</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatially entangled photon pairs (biphotons) generated by spontaneous parametric down-conversion offer unique opportunities for quantum imaging, but image-plane biphoton correlations are difficult to observe with camera-based detectors. Previous camera-based biphoton imaging experiments have relied on photon-counting detection, which necessitates operation deep in the photon-sparse regime and requires extremely low dark rates.
  Here, we demonstrate the detection of spatial biphoton joint probability distributions in both the image plane and the pupil plane (also termed "near-field plane" and "far-field plane" respectively) using a conventional scientific CMOS camera operated in linear mode. We work at mesoscopic intensity levels, corresponding to a photon flux approximately four orders of magnitude higher than typical photon-counting approaches. From the measured image- and pupil plane correlations, we observe position and momentum correlations consistent with an EPR-type entanglement witness.
  A tailored correlation analysis suited for image plane imaging suppresses detector artifacts and intensity fluctuations, enabling acquisition with significantly fewer frames. Our results demonstrate that spatially entangled-light imaging can be performed efficiently with standard imaging hardware, extending quantum imaging techniques beyond the photon-counting regime.</description>

Abstract: The mechanical action of various kinds of waves has been recognized for several centuries. The first tide of scientific interest in wave-induced forces and torques emerged at the turn of the 20th century, with the development of wave theories and the concepts of wave momentum and angular momentum. A second surge occurred in the past several decades, driven by technological breakthroughs: the invention of lasers and the controlled generation of structured wave fields. This resulted in major discoveries, including optical trapping and manipulation of small particles, from atomic to micro sizes, as well as acoustic manipulation of larger particles, including biological cells and samples. Nowadays, radiation forces and torques underpin numerous applications: optical and acoustic tweezers, acoustofluidic sorting of biological cells, optomechanical systems operating in both classical and quantum regimes, solar sails, quantum simulators, volumetric displays, etc. In this review, we present a unifying perspective on optical and acoustic forces and torques acting on various particles, addressing both their theoretical foundations and key applications. Our approach relies on the universal connection between the local energy, momentum, and spin densities of wave fields and the principal forces and torques exerted on small particles. Moreover, we describe important cases of nontrivial (e.g., lateral and pulling) forces and complex (e.g., chiral and anisotropic) particles. We also highlight significant experimental achievements involving optical and acoustic manipulation in structured wave fields. Our aim is to illuminate the common fundamental origins and close interconnections between the mechanical actions of optical and acoustic fields, thereby fostering a deeper understanding and advancing the development of optomechanical and acoustomechanical applications.</description>

      <title>Generalized Wigner-Smith theory for perturbations at exceptional and diabolic point degeneracies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05039v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spectral degeneracies, including diabolic (DP) and exceptional (EP) points, exhibit unique sensitivity to external perturbations, enabling powerful control and engineering of wave phenomena. We present a residue-based perturbation theory that quantifies complex resonance splitting of DP and EP type spectral degeneracies using generalized Wigner-Smith operators. We validate our theory using both analytic Hamiltonian models and numerical electromagnetic simulations, demonstrating excellent agreement across a range of cases. Our approach accurately predicts degenerate resonance splitting using only scattering data, offering a powerful framework for precision tuning, inverse design, and practical exploitation of non-Hermitian phenomena.</description>

      <title>Programmable Optical Filters Based on Feed-Forward Photonic Meshes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12059v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate an integrated photonic circuit based on feed forward photonic meshes that can be programmed and reconfigured to perform arbitrary spectral filter functions. We investigate a subset of the available filter functions, demonstrating that a N = 4 input triangular mesh with M = 3 layers may be operated via self-configuration algorithms to filter M arbitrary wavelengths from a given input spectrum. The tunable nature of the architecture enables preconfigured filter functions to be swept in the spectral domain continuously over the free spectral range of the device. This removes any strict requirements between the design parameters of the architecture and the center wavelength of a desired filter function. With this architecture, we experimentally demonstrate arbitrary wavelength rejection filters with contrasts as deep as 40 dB. Further, by intentionally selecting the center wavelengths of each filter function to lie along a wavelength grid we demonstrate deep wavelength division demultiplexing (DWDM) with inter-channel crosstalk between -25 dB and -40 dB. Unlike typical DWDM systems, in this architecture the center wavelength of each channel is not fixed at fabrication and instead may be swept or reordered arbitrarily. This device demonstrates advantages over typical methods for DWDM, Raman spectroscopy, and correlation spectroscopy as well as other applications.</description>

      <title>Time-diffracting 2D wave vortices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.10147v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wave vortices constitute a large family of wave entities, closely related to phase singularities and orbital angular momentum (OAM). So far, two main classes of localized wave vortices have been explored: (i) transversely-localized monochromatic vortex beams that carry well-defined longitudinal OAM and propagate/diffract along the longitudinal $z$-axis in space, and (ii) 2D-localized spatiotemporal vortex pulses that carry the more elusive transverse (or tilted) OAM and propagate/diffract along both the $z$-axis and time. Here we introduce another class of wave vortices which are localized in a 2D $(x,y)$ plane, do not propagate in space (apart from uniform radial deformations), and instead propagate/diffract solely along time. These vortices possess well-defined transverse OAM and can naturally appear in 2D wave systems, such as surface polaritons or water waves. We provide a general integral expression for time-diffracting 2D wave vortices, their underlying ray model, and examples of approximate and exact wave solutions. We also analyze the temporal Gouy phase closely related to the rotational evolution in such vortices. Finally, we show that time-diffracting 2D vortices can provide strong spatiotemporal concentration of energy and OAM at sub-wavelength and oscillation-period scales.</description>

      <title>Optical Response in Spintronic Poisson Bolometers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14968v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Analog bolometers based on temperature-dependent phase-transition materials such as vanadium oxide (VOx) and barium titanate (BTO) represent the state of the art in uncooled infrared detectors. Recently, the first room-temperature spintronic Poisson bolometer based on magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) was proposed and demonstrated as a promising infrared detector. Unlike conventional bolometers, the spintronic Poisson bolometer operates in a probabilistic regime dominated by Poissonian noise, where the response is governed by resistance fluctuations arising from thermally activated magnetization transitions. Spontaneous transitions between two metastable magnetic states occur even in the absence of incident light, and the transition probability increases under illumination. In this work, we experimentally study the statistical properties of the optical response of the spintronic Poisson bolometer under illumination. We demonstrate that transitions in spintronic Poisson bolometers, both in the absence and presence of light, exhibit Poissonian behavior, with transition rates and interarrival times modulated by incident radiation. Under illumination, we observe a 153% increase in the count rate accompanied by a 70% reduction in interarrival time. These results establish spintronic Poisson bolometers as a promising platform for probabilistic, high-speed, and high-sensitivity infrared detection at room temperature.</description>

      <title>Magneto-optical Skyrmion for manipulation of arbitrary light polarization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.21006v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dynamic manipulation of arbitrary light polarization is of fundamental importance for versatile optical functionalities, yet realizing such full-Poincar\'e-sphere control within compact nanophotonic architectures remains a formidable challenge. Here, we theoretically propose and numerically demonstrate a magneto-optical skyrmion platform enabling full polarization control of cavity eigenmodes. We reveal the correspondence between the near-field wavefunctions of degenerate dipoles and far-field polarization. By applying multidirectional magnetic fields to magneto-optical photonic crystals, we achieve any complex superposition of orthogonal eigenmodes, thereby realizing arbitrary far-field polarization. This mapping manifests as a skyrmion with a topological charge of 2, guaranteeing coverage of the entire Poincar\'e sphere. Our theoretical model shows excellent agreement with full-wave simulations. Furthermore, we realize bound states in the continuum (BICs) with dynamically tunable polarization textures and demonstrate high-performance polarization-selective emission and transmission. This work establishes a topological paradigm for precise polarization shaping, offering new avenues for advanced optical communication and sensing.</description>

      <title>Excitons: Energetics and spatio-temporal dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2111.06460v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The concept of an exciton as a quasiparticle that represents collective excited states was originally adapted from solid-state physics and has been successfully applied to molecular aggregates by relying on the well-established limits of the Wannier exciton and the Frenkel exciton. However, the study of excitons in more complex chemical systems and solid materials over the past two decades has made it clear that simple concepts based on Wannier or Frenkel excitons are not sufficient to describe detailed excitonic behavior, especially in nano-structured solid materials, multichromophoric macromolecules, and complex molecular aggregates. In addition, important effects such as vibronic coupling, the influence of charge-transfer (CT) components, spin-state interconversion, and electronic correlation, which had long been studied but not fully understood, have turned out to play a central role in many systems. This has motivated new experimental approaches and theoretical studies of increasing sophistication. This article provides an overview of works addressing these issues that were published for A Special Topic of the Journal of Chemical Physics on "Excitons: Energetics and spatio-temporal dynamics" and discusses their implications.</description>
