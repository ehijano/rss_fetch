      <title>Gravity Well Echo Chamber Modeling With An LLM-Based Confirmation Bias Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social media echo chambers play a central role in the spread of misinformation, yet existing models often overlook the influence of individual confirmation bias. An existing model of echo chambers is the "gravity well" model, which creates an analog between echo chambers and spatial gravity wells. We extend this established model by introducing a dynamic confirmation bias variable that adjusts the strength of pull based on a user's susceptibility to belief-reinforcing content. This variable is calculated for each user through comparisons between their posting history and their responses to posts of a wide range of viewpoints.
  Incorporating this factor produces a confirmation-bias-integrated gravity well model that more accurately identifies echo chambers and reveals community-level markers of information health. We validated the approach on nineteen Reddit communities, demonstrating improved detection of echo chambers.
  Our contribution is a framework for systematically capturing the role of confirmation bias in online group dynamics, enabling more effective identification of echo chambers. By flagging these high-risk environments, the model supports efforts to curb the spread of misinformation at its most common points of amplification.</description>

      <title>Strategic Analysis of Dissent and Self-Censorship</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Expressions of dissent against authority are an important feature of most societies, and efforts to suppress such expressions are common. Modern digital communications, social media, and Internet surveillance and censorship technologies are changing the landscape of public speech and dissent. Especially in authoritarian settings, individuals must assess the risk of voicing their true opinions or choose self-censorship, voluntarily moderating their behavior to comply with authority. We present a model in which individuals strategically manage the tradeoff between expressing dissent and avoiding punishment through self-censorship while an authority adapts its policies to minimize both total expressed dissent and punishment costs. We study the model analytically and in simulation to derive conditions separating defiant individuals who express their desired dissent in spite of punishment from self-censoring individuals who fully or partially limit their expression. We find that for any population, there exists an authority policy that leads to total self-censorship. However, the probability and time for an initially moderate, locally-adaptive authority to suppress dissent depend critically on the population's willingness to withstand punishment early on, which can deter the authority from adopting more extreme policies.</description>

      <title>"Low Frequency Tweeters Have More to Say!" A New Approach to Identify Importance of Tweets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Twitter is one of the most popular social media platforms.With a large number of tweets, the activity feed of users becomes noisy, challenging to read, and most importantly tweets often get lost. We present a new approach to personalise the ranking of the tweets toward solving the problem of information overload which is achieved by analysing the relationship between the importance of tweets to the frequency at which the author tweets. The hypothesis tested is that "low-frequency tweeters have more to say", i.e. if a user who tweets infrequently actually goes to the effort of tweeting, then it is more likely to be of more importance or contain more "meaning" than a tweet by a user who tweets continuously. We propose six new measures to evaluate the importance of tweets based on the ability of the tweet to drive interaction among its readers, which is measured through metrics such as retweets, favourites, and comments, and the extent of the author's network interacting with the tweet. Our study shows that users who tweeted less than ten tweets per week were more likely to be perceived as important by their followers and have the most important messages. This identified tweet-frequency band could be used to reorder the activity feed of users and such reordering would ensure the messages of low-frequency tweeters do not get lost in the stream of tweets. This could also serve as a scoring index for Twitter users to identify users frequently tweeting important messages.</description>

      <title>Explicit and Implicit Data Augmentation for Social Event Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social event detection involves identifying and categorizing important events from social media, which relies on labeled data, but annotation is costly and labor-intensive. To address this problem, we propose Augmentation framework for Social Event Detection (SED-Aug), a plug-and-play dual augmentation framework, which combines explicit text-based and implicit feature-space augmentation to enhance data diversity and model robustness. The explicit augmentation utilizes large language models to enhance textual information through five diverse generation strategies. For implicit augmentation, we design five novel perturbation techniques that operate in the feature space on structural fused embeddings. These perturbations are crafted to keep the semantic and relational properties of the embeddings and make them more diverse. Specifically, SED-Aug outperforms the best baseline model by approximately 17.67% on the Twitter2012 dataset and by about 15.57% on the Twitter2018 dataset in terms of the average F1 score. The code is available at GitHub: https://github.com/congboma/SED-Aug.</description>

      <title>Towards Robust Graph Structural Learning Beyond Homophily via Preserving Neighbor Similarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09754v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the tremendous success of graph-based learning systems in handling structural data, it has been widely investigated that they are fragile to adversarial attacks on homophilic graph data, where adversaries maliciously modify the semantic and topology information of the raw graph data to degrade the predictive performances. Motivated by this, a series of robust models are crafted to enhance the adversarial robustness of graph-based learning systems on homophilic graphs. However, the security of graph-based learning systems on heterophilic graphs remains a mystery to us. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we start to explore the vulnerability of graph-based learning systems regardless of the homophily degree, and theoretically prove that the update of the negative classification loss is negatively correlated with the pairwise similarities based on the powered aggregated neighbor features. The theoretical finding inspires us to craft a novel robust graph structural learning strategy that serves as a useful graph mining module in a robust model that incorporates a dual-kNN graph constructions pipeline to supervise the neighbor-similarity-preserved propagation, where the graph convolutional layer adaptively smooths or discriminates the features of node pairs according to their affluent local structures. In this way, the proposed methods can mine the ``better" topology of the raw graph data under diverse graph homophily and achieve more reliable data management on homophilic and heterophilic graphs.</description>

      <title>Short-video Propagation Influence Rating: A New Real-world Dataset and A New Large Graph Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23746v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Short-video platforms have gained immense popularity, captivating the interest of millions, if not billions, of users globally. Recently, researchers have highlighted the significance of analyzing the propagation of short-videos, which typically involves discovering commercial values, public opinions, user behaviors, etc. This paper proposes a new Short-video Propagation Influence Rating (SPIR) task and aims to promote SPIR from both the dataset and method perspectives. First, we propose a new Cross-platform Short-Video (XS-Video) dataset, which aims to provide a large-scale and real-world short-video propagation network across various platforms to facilitate the research on short-video propagation. Our XS-Video dataset includes 117,720 videos, 381,926 samples, and 535 topics across 5 biggest Chinese platforms, annotated with the propagation influence from level 0 to 9. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first large-scale short-video dataset that contains cross-platform data or provides all of the views, likes, shares, collects, fans, comments, and comment content. Second, we propose a Large Graph Model (LGM) named NetGPT, based on a novel three-stage training mechanism, to bridge heterogeneous graph-structured data with the powerful reasoning ability and knowledge of Large Language Models (LLMs). Our NetGPT can comprehend and analyze the short-video propagation graph, enabling it to predict the long-term propagation influence of short-videos. Comprehensive experimental results evaluated by both classification and regression metrics on our XS-Video dataset indicate the superiority of our method for SPIR.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Message Imbalance in Fraud Detection with Dual-View Graph Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06469v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph representation learning has become a mainstream method for fraud detection due to its strong expressive power, which focuses on enhancing node representations through improved neighborhood knowledge capture. However, the focus on local interactions leads to imbalanced transmission of global topological information and increased risk of node-specific information being overwhelmed during aggregation due to the imbalance between fraud and benign nodes. In this paper, we first summarize the impact of topology and class imbalance on downstream tasks in GNN-based fraud detection, as the problem of imbalanced supervisory messages is caused by fraudsters' topological behavior obfuscation and identity feature concealment. Based on statistical validation, we propose a novel dual-view graph representation learning method to mitigate Message imbalance in Fraud Detection (MimbFD). Specifically, we design a topological message reachability module for high-quality node representation learning to penetrate fraudsters' camouflage and alleviate insufficient propagation. Then, we introduce a local confounding debiasing module to adjust node representations, enhancing the stable association between node representations and labels to balance the influence of different classes. Finally, we conducted experiments on three public fraud datasets, and the results demonstrate that MimbFD exhibits outstanding performance in fraud detection.</description>
