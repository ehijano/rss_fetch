      <title>A posteriori closure of turbulence models: are symmetries preserved ?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Turbulence modeling remains a longstanding challenge in fluid dynamics. Recent advances in data-driven methods have led to a surge of novel approaches aimed at addressing this problem. This work builds upon our previous study (arXiv:2411.13194), where we introduced a new closure for a shell model of turbulence using an a posteriori (or solver-in-the-loop) approach. Unlike most deep learning-based models, our method explicitly incorporates physical equations into the neural network framework, ensuring that the closure remains constrained by the underlying physics benefiting from enhanced stability and generalizability. In this paper, we further analyze the learned closure, probing its capabilities and limitations. In particular, we look at joint probability density functions to assess whether cross-correlations are well preserved or if just the mean behavior is captured. Additionally, we investigate the scale invariance of multipliers - ratios between adjacent shells - within the inertial range. Although our model excels in reproducing high-order observables such as flatness, it breaks this known symmetry near the cutoff, indicating a fundamental limitation. We discuss the implications of these findings for subgrid-scale modeling in 3D turbulence and outline directions for future research.</description>

      <title>Dimensionless learning based on information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dimensional analysis is one of the most fundamental tools for understanding physical systems. However, the construction of dimensionless variables, as guided by the Buckingham-$\pi$ theorem, is not uniquely determined. Here, we introduce IT-$\pi$, a model-free method that combines dimensionless learning with the principles of information theory. Grounded in the irreducible error theorem, IT-$\pi$ identifies dimensionless variables with the highest predictive power by measuring their shared information content. The approach is able to rank variables by predictability, identify distinct physical regimes, uncover self-similar variables, determine the characteristic scales of the problem, and extract its dimensionless parameters. IT-$\pi$ also provides a bound of the minimum predictive error achievable across all possible models, from simple linear regression to advanced deep learning techniques, naturally enabling a definition of model efficiency. We benchmark IT-$\pi$ across different cases and demonstrate that it offers superior performance and capabilities compared to existing tools. The method is also applied to conduct dimensionless learning for supersonic turbulence, aerodynamic drag on both smooth and irregular surfaces, magnetohydrodynamic power generation, and laser-metal interaction.</description>

      <title>Vortex transition and thermal mixing by pitching a perforated flexible panel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effective transport of heat and mass is crucial to both industrial applications and physiological processes. Recent research has evaluated the benefit of using flexible reeds for triggering the vortex induced vibration to enhance mixing, as opposed to traditional techniques like rigid blender or static meshes. Inspired by the soft, porous, and moving fish gill lamellae, we proposed a new concept of thermal dispenser that prescribes active pitching motion to the leading edge of an otherwise passively flapping perforated panel. Experimental measurements revealed drastic differences between the steady leaky flow wake behind a statically deflected perforated panel and the periodic shedding wakes with complex vortex structure transitions behind an actuated perforated panel with or without chord-wise flexibility. A semi-empirical simulation of the thermal convection and diffusion takes the experimentally obtained velocity as input and yields the temperature results. Vortex dynamics, Lagrangian coherent structures, and thermal mixing behaviors were analyzed and compared to elucidate the effects of kinematics, perforation, and flexibility on the wake mode transitions, lateral entrainment mixing, and overall heating. Our work provides a foundational understanding of the fluid-structure interactions of perforated bendable panels under active control which has not been described before in the intermediate Reynolds number range. It provides insights for developing an innovative bio-inspired heat or mass dispenser potentially suitable for subtle and small scale applications.</description>

      <title>Physical significance of artificial numerical noise in direct numerical simulation of turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using clean numerical simulation (CNS) in which artificial numerical noise is negligible over a finite, sufficiently long interval of time, we provide evidence, for the first time, that artificial numerical noise in direct numerical simulation (DNS) of turbulence is approximately equivalent to thermal fluctuation and/or stochastic environmental noise. This confers physical significance on the artificial numerical noise of DNS of the Navier-Stokes equations. As a result, DNS on a fine mesh should correspond to turbulence under small internal/external physical disturbance, whereas DNS on a sparse mesh corresponds to turbulent flow under large physical disturbance, respectively. The key point is that: all of them have physical meanings and so are correct in terms of their deterministic physics, even if their statistics are quite different. This is illustrated herein. Our paper provides a positive viewpoint regarding the presence of artificial numerical noise in DNS.</description>

      <title>Experimental study of velocity statistics in wall-bounded turbulent emulsions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Turbulent emulsions are ubiquitous in chemical engineering, food processing, pharmaceuticals, and other fields. However, our experimental understanding of this area remains limited due to the multi-scale nature of turbulent flow and the presence of extensive interfaces, which pose significant challenges to optical measurements. In this study, we address these challenges by precisely matching the refractive indices of the continuous and dispersed phases, enabling us to measure local velocity information at high volume fractions. The emulsion is generated in a turbulent Taylor-Couette flow, with velocity measured at two radial locations: near the inner cylinder (boundary layer) and in the middle gap (bulk region). Near the inner cylinder, the presence of droplets suppresses the emission of angular velocity plumes, which reduces the mean azimuthal velocity and its root mean squared fluctuation. The former effect leads to a higher angular velocity gradient in the boundary layer, resulting in greater global drag on the system. In the bulk region, although droplets suppress turbulence fluctuations, they enhance the cross-correlation between azimuthal and radial velocities, leaving the angular velocity flux contributed by the turbulent flow nearly unchanged. In both locations, droplets suppress turbulence at scales larger than the average droplet diameter and increase the intermittency of velocity increments. However, the effects of the droplets are more pronounced near the inner cylinder than in the bulk, likely because droplets fragment in the boundary layer but are less prone to breakup in the bulk. Our study provides experimental insights into how dispersed droplets modulate global drag, coherent structures, and the multi-scale characteristics of turbulent flow.</description>

      <title>Structure and scaling of inclined gravity currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the fundamental flow structure of inclined gravity currents with direct numerical simulations. A velocity maximum naturally divides the current into inner and outer shear layers, which are weakly coupled by exchange of momentum and buoyancy on timescales that are much longer than the typical timescale characterizing either layer. The outer layer evolves to a self-similar regime with flow parameters taking constant characteristic values. The flow behaviour in the outer layer is consistent with that found in a current on a free-slip slope by van Reeuwijk et al. ($\textit{J. Fluid Mech.}$, vol. 873, 2019, pp. 786-815), and the integral buoyancy forcing in the layer is balanced solely by entrainment drag. The inner layer evolves to a quasi-steady state, in which the buoyancy forcing is approximately balanced by wall drag. The inner layer can be further decomposed into viscous and turbulent wall regions that have much in common with fully developed open channel flow. Using scaling laws within each layer and a matching condition at the velocity maximum, we solve the entire flow system as a function of slope angle $\alpha$, in good agreement with the simulation data. We further derive an entrainment law from the solution, which exhibits relatively high accuracy across a wide range of Richardson numbers and provides new insights into the long-runout of oceanographic gravity currents on mild slopes.</description>

      <title>The effects of temperature and viscosity on the metachronal swimming of crustaceans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temperature changes as small as $3 ^\circ$C have been observed to significantly impact how self-propelled organisms move through their environment, especially for those inhabiting the transitional flow regime in which both viscous and inertial effects are important. Nonetheless, many oceanic species can successfully migrate across temperature changes in the order of $20 ^\circ $C, corresponding to $40 \%$ differences in viscosity, via metachronal propulsion, suggesting that this propulsion mechanism is resilient to drastic changes in water column properties. We investigate marsh grass shrimp (\textit{Palaemon vulgaris}) as a model organism to explore the combined physical and physiological effects on their locomotion at natural seasonal temperature extremes ($6^\circ - 20^\circ$C). Experimentally, we manipulate temperature and viscosity independently to isolate physical and physiological effects. We then use the shrimp morphology and gait data to inform a computational fluid dynamics parametric study to estimate the force-to-power ratios of varying viscosity and beat frequencies through naturally occurring extremes. Our research demonstrates that shrimp do not modify their gait parameters to naturally occurring viscosity changes, and their swimming performance is impacted by less than $9 \% $. The robustness of the metachronal gait is evidence of the ecological success of shrimp-like organisms in all climates, from the tropics to pole waters and inland freshwater</description>

      <title>Analysis of inertial-range intermittency in forward and inverse cascade regions in isotropic turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to test the hypothesis that inverse cascade regions in turbulent flows might exhibit more Gaussian noise-like and less intermittent small-scale statistics compared to the overall statistics, in this work we measure degrees of small-scale intermittency separately in regions of forward and inverse cascade. The local energy cascade rate $(\Phi_\ell)$ at length scale $(\ell)$ is defined using the scale-integrated Kolmogorov-Hill (KH) equation. To characterize intermittency, we analyze the probability density functions (PDFs) of longitudinal and transverse velocity increments at scale $\ell$, conditioned on positive and negative $\Phi_\ell$ (local forward and inverse cascades). Our findings reveal that transverse velocity increments display approximately the same degree of non-Gaussianity and intermittency, in both forward or inverse cascade regions. The only noticeable difference is observed for longitudinal velocity increments that display strong negative skewness in regions of forward cascade compared to small positive skewness in regions of inverse cascade. We repeat the analysis for filtered velocity gradient tensor elements at scale $\ell$ and obtain similar results, except that the skewness of its longitudinal elements is slightly negative even in regions of inverse cascade. The analysis is based on isotropic turbulence data ($Re_\lambda \sim 1{,}250$) available from the public Johns Hopkins Turbulence Databases, JHTDB v2.0. This refactored system is based on the Zarr storage format, while data access is based on the ``virtual sensor'' approach, enabled by a Python backend package (Giverny) that replaces the legacy SQL storage and SOAP Web Services-based approaches. Information about the new system as well as sample Python notebooks are described and illustrated. (Matlab, C, and Fortran access methods are also provided).</description>

      <title>Effects of Surface Corrugation on Gas-Surface Scattering and Macroscopic Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gas-surface scattering exhibits a transition from thermal to structure scattering regime as incident energy increases, characterized by changes in angular and energy distributions. Capturing scattering behavior across different regimes is essential for modeling momentum and energy exchange at the gas-surface interface. This study presents a corrugated Cercignani-Lampis-Lord (CLL) model to account for surface corrugation in scattering. It extends the washboard-CLL hybrid approach by incorporating tangential momentum accommodation in local collisions. The model is validated against molecular beam scattering experiments, focusing on its ability to reproduce the variation in scattering behavior with increasing incident energy. Compared to the conventional CLL model, the proposed model qualitatively improves the representation of key features across the scattering regimes. In particular, it captures broader angular distributions and increasing reflected energy with reflected angle at higher incident energy. It is further applied to Direct Simulation Monte-Carlo (DSMC) analysis of rarefied flows over a cylinder and within an intake to examine the influence of surface corrugation on macroscopic flow behavior. The results show that surface corrugation has limited impact on total drag, while decreasing pressure drag and increasing friction drag. In the intake, enhanced tangential accommodation reduces capture efficiency and increases compression ratio. These findings highlight the importance of incorporating surface corrugation in rarefied flow simulations under VLEO conditions.</description>

      <title>Optimizing flow control with ensemble Kalman method for mitigating flow-induced vibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ensemble Kalman method is introduced for optimizing flow control strategies in order to mitigate the flow-induced vibration of structures. Different types of control strategies such as passive control, open-loop active control, and closed-loop active control are tested, showing the flexibility of the method in flow control optimization. The ensemble Kalman method is first tested to mitigate vortex shedding of flows around a circular cylinder by optimizing the placement of small cylinders downstream. Further, the method is assessed to suppress shock buffeting over the NACA 0012 airfoil by optimizing the movement of a compliant aileron. Our results for all test cases show that the ensemble-based method can effectively find optimal control strategies that significantly reduce the vibrations of aerodynamic force, and can be a useful alternative for flow control optimization, due to its merits in non-intrusiveness and ease of implementation.</description>

      <title>Morphological Effects on Bacterial Brownian Motion: Validation of a Chiral Two-Body Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During bacterial swimming, thermal noise inevitably affects their motion, while the flagellum not only propels the bacteria, but also plays a crucial role in enhancing the stability of their forward direction. In this study, we aim to validate the effectiveness of a previously established chiral two-body model for simulating bacterial Brownian motion, which simplifies the helical flagellum to a chiral body. We systematically investigate bacterial motion using the chiral two-body model, resistive force theory, and twin multipole moment. We validate the effectiveness of the model by comparing the standard deviations of the flagellar random velocities obtained from different methods. The analytical solutions for the velocities, the thrust, and torque exerted by the motor on the cell body are derived from the chiral two-body model during bacterial non-Brownian motion. We characterize the shape and symmetry of the trajectories through the eigenvalues of the radius of gyration tensor, describe their linearity employing the directionality ratio, and evaluate the stability of forward direction using the average orientation. We conclude that appropriately increasing the helix radius and the contour length of the flagellum can elongate trajectories and enhance linearity. In addition, the longer contour length increases the average orientation, thereby enhancing the stability of the bacterial forward direction. This study further validates the effectiveness of the chiral two-body model in simulating bacterial Brownian motion and indicates the importance of the flagellum in stabilizing bacterial Brownian motion.</description>

      <title>Universal scaling laws of boundary-driven turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Turbulence is a fundamental flow phenomenon, typically anisotropic at large scales and approximately isotropic at small scales. The classical Kolmogorov scaling laws (2/3, -5/3 and 4/5) have been well-established for turbulence without small-scale body forcing, describing second-order velocity structure functions, energy spectra, and third-order velocity structure functions in an intermediate small-scale range. However, their validity boundary remains unclear. Here, we identify new 1 and -2 scaling laws (replacing 2/3 and -5/3 laws) alongside the unchanged 4/5 law in the core region of boundary-driven turbulence, where energy is injected solely through viscous friction at moving boundaries. Local isotropy is recovered after high-pass filtering. Notably, odd-order velocity structure functions with and without absolute value exhibit distinct scaling exponents. A characteristic speed in the inertial range, derived from the constant ratio of third- to second-order structure functions, quantifies the time-averaged projectile speed at the bulk interface. Based on energy dissipation rate and the characteristic speed, a phenomenological framework for structure functions is developed together with a model for probability distributions of velocity increment at distinct small-scales. The universal scaling laws formulated can produce the full set of scaling exponents for low- and high-order velocity structure functions, including both the odd-orders' with and without absolute value, which are validated by direct numerical simulations and experimental datasets.</description>

      <title>Kinetic study of compressible Rayleigh-Taylor instability with time-varying acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) instability commonly arises in compressible systems with time-dependent acceleration in practical applications. To capture the complex dynamics of such systems, a two-component discrete Boltzmann method is developed to systematically investigate the compressible RT instability driven by variable acceleration. Specifically, the effects of different acceleration periods, amplitudes, and phases are systematically analyzed. The simulation results are interpreted from three key perspectives: the density gradient, which characterizes the spatial variation in density; the thermodynamic non-equilibrium strength, which quantifies the system's deviation from local thermodynamic equilibrium; and the fraction of non-equilibrium regions, which captures the spatial distribution of non-equilibrium behaviors. Notably, the fluid system exhibits rich and diverse dynamic patterns resulting from the interplay of multiple competing physical mechanisms, including time-dependent acceleration, RT instability, diffusion, and dissipation effects. These findings provide deeper insights into the evolution and regulation of compressible RT instability under complex driving conditions.</description>

      <title>Oscillatory flows in three-dimensional deformable microchannels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deformable microchannels emulate a key characteristic of soft biological systems and flexible engineering devices: the flow-induced deformation of the conduit due to slow viscous flow within. Elucidating the two-way coupling between oscillatory flow and deformation of a three-dimensional (3D) rectangular channel is crucial for designing lab- and organ-on-a-chip microsystems and eventually understanding flow-structure instabilities that can enhance mixing and transport. We determine the axial variations of the primary flow, pressure, and deformation for Newtonian fluids in the canonical geometry of a slender (long) and shallow (wide) 3D rectangular channel with a deformable top wall under the assumption of weak compliance and without restriction on the oscillation frequency (i.e., on the Womersley number). Unlike rigid conduits, the pressure distribution is not linear with the axial coordinate. To validate this prediction, we design a PDMS-based experimental platform with a speaker-based flow-generation apparatus and a pressure acquisition system with multiple ports along the axial length of the channel. The experimental measurements show good agreement with the predicted pressure profiles across a wide range of the key dimensionless quantities: the Womersley number, the compliance number, and the elastoviscous number. Finally, we explore how the nonlinear flow -- deformation coupling leads to self-induced streaming (rectification of the oscillatory flow). Following Zhang and Rallabandi (J. Fluid Mech., 996, 2024, A16), we develop a theory for the cycle-averaged pressure based on the primary problem's solution, and we validate the predictions for the axial distribution of the streaming pressure against high-precision experimental measurements.</description>

      <title>A thermodynamically consistent free-energy lattice Boltzmann model: Incorporating generalized equilibria derived from the color-gradient approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the chemical-potential-based free-energy lattice Boltzmann (LB) model of Li et al. [Phys. Rev. E 103, 013304 (2021)] by integrating generalized equilibria, originally formulated for the color-gradient LB model using sixth-order Hermite polynomials [Saito et al., Phys Rev E 108, 065305 (2023)], into a thermodynamically consistent framework. Our model is formulated on a three-dimensional D3Q27 lattice with a central-moment collision scheme, simplifying implementation and improving Galilean invariance. Numerical tests, including flat-interface equilibrium, stationary and moving droplets in free space, and wetting on solid surfaces, confirm the model's capability to accurately simulate multiphase phenomena while maintaining strict thermodynamic consistency.</description>

      <title>Improving the robustness of the immersed interface method through regularized velocity reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robust, broadly applicable fluid-structure interaction (FSI) algorithms remain a challenge for computational mechanics. In previous work, we introduced an immersed interface method (IIM) for discrete surfaces and an extension based on an immersed Lagrangia-Eulerian (ILE) coupling strategy for modeling FSI involving complex geometries. The ability of the method to sharply resolve stress discontinuities induced by singular immersed boundary forces in the presence of low-regularity geometrical representations makes it a compelling choice for three-dimensional modeling of complex geometries in diverse engineering applications. Although the IIM we previously introduced offers many desirable advantages, it also imposes a restrictive mesh factor ratio, requiring the surface mesh to be coarser than the fluid grid to ensure stability. This is because when the mesh factor ratio constraint is not satisfied, parts of the structure motion are not controlled by the discrete FSI system. This constraint can significantly increase computational costs, particularly in applications involving multiscale geometries with highly localized complexity or fine-scale features. To address this limitation, we devise a stabilization strategy for the velocity restriction operator inspired by Tikhonov regularization. This study demonstrates that using a stabilized velocity restriction operator in IIM enables a broader range of structure-to-fluid grid-size ratios without compromising accuracy or altering the flow dynamics. This advancement significantly broadens the applicability of the method to real-world FSI problems involving complex geometries and dynamic conditions, offering a robust and computationally efficient solution.</description>

      <title>On the influence of electrolytic gradient orientation on phoretic transport in dead-end pores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electrolytic diffusiophoresis refers to directional migration of colloids due to interfacial forces that develop in response to local electrolytic concentration ($c$) gradients. This physicochemical transport provides an efficient alternative in numerous microscale applications where advection-induced transport is infeasible. Phoretic withdrawal and injection in dead-end pores can be controlled by orienting salt gradients into or out of the pore; however, the extent to which this orientation influences spatiotemporal transport patterns is not thoroughly explored. In this study, we find that it has a significant influence: colloidal withdrawal in solute-out mode ($\beta=c_\infty/c_{\text{pore}}&lt;1$) is faster and shallower, whereas the solute-in mode enables deeper withdrawal. Similarly, solute-out injection features rapidly propagating wavefronts, whereas the solute-in mode ($\beta &gt;1$) promotes uniform and gradual injection. Each mode's transport is found to evolve and persist over different time scales. We characterize the performance of these modes and find that while persistence of the solute-out mode strengthens with a growing electrolytic gradient [$\sim \ln(\beta^{-0.4})$], solute-in mode diminishes and eventually its persistence is insensitive to $\beta$. We also incorporate the variable mobility model to examine the impact of large zeta potentials, which intensifies the transport of solute-out mode further and weakens the solute-in mode. Additionally, we investigate how osmotic flows of the two modes affect injection and withdrawal patterns. We find that osmosis-induced mixing can counterintuitively inhibit injection effectiveness in solute-out mode. These insights bring attention to the distinctions between different phoretic transport modes and contribute to the rational design and setup of electrolytic gradients in numerous microscale applications.</description>

      <title>X-ray particle tracking velocimetry for rheological characterization: Application to material extrusion additive manufacturing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce X-ray Particle Tracking Velocimetry (XPTV) as a promising method to quantitatively resolve the velocity field and associated rheological quantities of polymer melt flow within the nozzle of a fused filament fabrication (FFF) printer. Employing tungsten powder as tracer particles embedded within a polymer filament, we investigate melt flow dynamics through an aluminum nozzle in a custom-designed experimental setup, based on commercial designs. The velocity profiles obtained via XPTV reveal significant deviations from classical Newtonian flow, highlighting complex heterogeneous and non-isothermal behavior within the melt. From these measurements, we determine the local infinitesimal strain rate tensor and correlate flow-induced non-Newtonian effects to spatially varying temperature distributions, reflecting incomplete thermal homogenization within the nozzle. Our findings demonstrate the capability of XPTV to quantify both velocity fields and rheological properties, underscoring its potential as a future tool for investigating opaque polymer melt flows in additive manufacturing, industrial processing, and rheology. To our knowledge, this represents the first reported application of XPTV in polymer melt rheology, offering a new approach to address measurement challenges previously inaccessible to conventional optical methods.</description>

      <title>Parameter Estimation and Adaptive Solution of the Leray-Burgers Equation Using Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08874v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we employ the Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) to estimate the practical range of the characteristic wavelength parameter(referred to as the smoothing parameter) $\alpha$ in the Leray-Burgers equation. The Leray-Burgers equation, a regularization of the inviscid Burgers equation, incorporates a Helmholtz filter with a characteristic wavelength $\alpha$ to replace the usual convective velocity, inducing a regularized convective velocity. The filter bends the equation's characteristics slightly and makes them not intersect each other, leading to a global solution in time. By conducting computational experiments with various initial conditions, we determine the practical range of $\alpha &gt;0$ that closely approximates the solutions of the inviscid Burgers equation. Our findings indicate that the value of $\alpha$ depends on the initial data, with the practical range of $\alpha$ being between 0.01 and 0.05 for continuous initial profiles and between 0.01 and 0.03 for discontinuous initial profiles. The Leray-Burgers equation captures shock and rarefaction waves within the temporal domain for which training data exists. However, as the temporal domain extends beyond the training interval, data-driven forward computation demonstrates that the predictions generated by the PINN start to deviate from the exact solutions. This study also highlights the effectiveness and efficiency of the Leray-Burgers equation in real practical problems, specifically Traffic State Estimation.</description>

      <title>A molecular-kinetic hypothesis on pressure behavior in gas flows at low Mach numbers and its relation to the second viscosity and turbulent dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18914v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent works, we proposed a theory of turbulence creation via the second coefficient of the virial expansion (i.e. the van der Waals effect), which in part relies on the empirically observed "equilibrated" behavior of pressure in a low Mach number flow. At the same time, conventional kinetic theory does not offer satisfactory explanation for such a behavior of the pressure variable, leading instead to an adiabatic flow in the form of the usual compressible Euler or Navier-Stokes equations. For this reason, gas flows at low Mach numbers are modeled via the incompressible Euler or Navier-Stokes equations, which are derived empirically, and fail to capture some features of observed behavior in real-world gas flows (e.g. convection).
  In the current work, we introduce a novel correction term into the pair correlation function in the closure of the Bogoliubov-Born-Green-Kirkwood-Yvon hierarchy. This correction adjusts the joint density of pairs of particles based on the macroscopic compression or expansion rate of the gas. The novel correction has no effect on the equations of fluid mechanics for the stochastic, Boltzmann-type collision integral, yet affects the pressure transport equation for the deterministic, Vlasov-type collision integral. Remarkably, its effect on the pressure and turbulent dynamics matches the observed behavior; namely, the novel correction equilibrates the pressure variable and creates the second viscosity in the momentum equation. In turn, the second viscosity governs the linear instability which creates turbulent dynamics. The ratio of the second viscosity and shear viscosity, together with the critical value of the Reynolds number, are proportional to the reciprocal of the packing fraction.</description>

      <title>Discovery of Quasi-Integrable Equations from traveling-wave data using the Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19014v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful tool for analyzing nonlinear partial differential equations and identifying governing equations from observational data. In this study, we apply PINNs to investigate vortex-type solutions of quasi-integrable equations in two spatial dimensions, specifically the Zakharov-Kuznetsov (ZK) and the Regularized Long-Wave (RLW) equations. These equations are toy models for geostrophic shallow water dynamics in planetary atmospheres. We first demonstrate that PINNs can successfully solve these equations in the forward process using a mesh-free approach with automatic differentiation. However, in the inverse process, substantial misidentification occurs due to the structural similarities between the ZK and the RLW equations. To address this issue, we then introduce conservation law-enhanced PINNs, initial condition variations, and a friction-based perturbation approach to improve identification accuracy. Our results show that incorporating small perturbations while preserving conservation laws significantly enhances the resolution of equation identification. These findings may contribute to the broader goal of using deep learning techniques for discovering governing equations in complex fluid dynamical systems, such as Jupiter's Great Red Spot.</description>

      <title>Response of a turbulent boundary layer to steady, square-wave-type transverse wall-forcing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23017v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the spatial evolution of a zero pressure gradient turbulent boundary layer (TBL) imposed by a square-wave (SqW) of steady spanwise wall-forcing, which varies along the streamwise direction ($x$). The SqW wall-forcing is imposed experimentally via a series of streamwise periodic belts running in opposite spanwise directions, following the methodology of Knoop et al. (Exp. Fluids, vol 65, 2024), with the streamwise extent increased to beyond $\sim 11$ times the boundary layer thickness (${\delta}_o$) in the present study. This unique setup is leveraged to investigate the influence of viscous-scaled wavelength of SqW wall-forcing on the turbulent drag reduction (DR) efficacy for $\lambda^+_x = $ 471 (sub-optimal), 942 (near-optimal), and 1884 (post-optimal conditions), at fixed viscous-scaled wall-forcing amplitude, $A^+ = 12$, and friction Reynolds number, $Re_\tau = 960$. The TBL's response to this wall-forcing is elucidated by drawing inspiration from established knowledge on traditionally studied sinusoidal forcing (SinW), based on analysis of the streamwise-phase variation of the Stokes strain rate (SSR). The analysis reveals the SqW forcing to be characterized by a combination of two markedly different SSR regimes whose influence on the overlying turbulence is found to depend on the forcing waveform: sub-phase-I of local and strong impulses of SSR downstream of the half- ($\lambda_x$/2) and full-phase ($\lambda_x$) locations, associated with a reversal in spanwise forcing directions, leading to significant turbulence attenuation, and sub-phase-II of near-zero SSR over the remainder of forcing phase that enables turbulence recovery (when wall-forcing magnitudes and direction remain constant).</description>

      <title>Solver-in-the-loop approach to closure of shell models of turbulence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13194v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work studies an a posteriori data-driven approach (known as solver-in-the-loop) for sub-grid modeling of a shell model for turbulence. This approach takes advantage of the differentiable physics paradigm of deep learning, allowing a neural network model to interact with the differential equation solver over time during the training process. The closure model is, then, naturally exposed to equations-informed input distributions by accounting for prior corrections over the temporal evolution in training. Such a characteristic makes this approach depart from the conventional a priori instantaneous training paradigm and often leads to a more accurate and stable closure model. Our study demonstrates that the closure learned via this a posteriori approach is able to reproduce high-order statistical moments of interest also in closures of high Reynolds number turbulence. Moreover, we investigate the performance of the learned model by experimenting with the effect of unrolling in time, which has remained for the most part unexplored in the literature. Finally, we discuss potential extensions of this approach to Navier-Stokes equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16245v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations are essential for analyzing and optimizing fluid flows in a wide range of real-world applications. These simulations involve approximating the solutions of the Navier-Stokes differential equations using numerical methods, which are highly compute- and memory-intensive due to their need for high-precision iterations. In this work, we introduce a high-performance FPGA accelerator specifically designed for numerically solving the Navier-Stokes equations. We focus on the Finite Element Method (FEM) due to its ability to accurately model complex geometries and intricate setups typical of real-world applications. Our accelerator is implemented using High-Level Synthesis (HLS) on an AMD Alveo U200 FPGA, leveraging the reconfigurability of FPGAs to offer a flexible and adaptable solution. The proposed solution achieves 7.9x higher performance than optimized Vitis-HLS implementations and 45% lower latency with 3.64x less power compared to a software implementation on a high-end server CPU. This highlights the potential of our approach to solve Navier-Stokes equations more effectively, paving the way for tackling even more challenging CFD simulations in the future.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02417v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we perform numerical simulations of forced two-phase isotropic turbulence to study the stationary states of a two-phase mixture. We first formulate three different approaches to force a two-phase turbulent flow that maintains a constant (a) mixture kinetic energy, (b) mixture kinetic energy + surface energy, and (c) individual phase kinetic energy, and study their effect on the final stationary state of the system. We show that forcing the two-phase system eliminates the arbitrariness associated with the initialization of the second phase in two-phase turbulence simulations. Next, we study the global statistics of the two-phase mixture in the stationary state for varying density ratios ($10^{-3}$ to $10^3$) and viscosity ratios ($10^{-3}$ to $10^3$), void fraction (dilute to dense regimes), and Weber numbers (breakup and non-breakup regimes). We utilize a spatial filtering approach, that is applicable for the general case of incompressible/compressible two-phase flows, to compute the energy spectra of each of the phases and study the turbulent kinetic energy distribution across scales. We find that the interface behaves as a soft wall, inhibiting the accommodation of eddies inside the dispersed phase. Finally, we show that bubbles and drops exhibit different turbulent characteristics for the same global conditions of the carrier phase, with bubbles exhibiting higher turbulent intensities inside them and droplets behaving ballistically, similar to solid particles. This study acts as a foundational work on stationary two-phase turbulence, which can be used for further analysis and the development of subgrid-scale models for larger-scale simulations of two-phase turbulent flows.</description>

      <title>Plane-Symmetric Capillary Turbulence: Five-Wave Interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18970v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The theory of isotropic capillary turbulence was developed in the late 1960s by Zakharov and Filonenko. To date, the analytical solution of the kinetic equation describing the stationary transfer of energy to small scales due to three-wave resonant interactions, called the Zakharov-Filonenko spectrum, has been confirmed with high accuracy. However, in the case of strong anisotropy in wave propagation, where all waves are collinear, the situation changes significantly. In such a degenerate geometry, the conditions of resonant interaction cease to be fulfilled not only for three waves, but also for four interacting waves. In this work, we perform fully nonlinear simulations of plane-symmetric capillary turbulence. We demonstrate that the system of interacting waves evolves into a quasi-stationary state with a direct energy cascade, despite the absence of low-order resonances. The calculated spectra of surface elevations are accurately described by analytical estimates derived dimensionally under the assumption of the dominant influence of five-wave resonant interactions. A detailed study of the statistical characteristics of the weakly turbulent state does not reveal the influence of any coherent or strongly nonlinear structures. The performed high-order correlation analysis indicates a variety of non-trivial five-wave resonances. We show that the process of wave decay into two pairs of counter-propagating waves is responsible for the local energy transfer to small scales. Overall, the calculation results are in good agreement with both the weak turbulence theory and recent experiments made by Ricard and Falco</description>

      <title>Effects of Flagellar Morphology on Swimming Performance and Directional Control in Microswimmers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07224v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a fluid environment, flagellated microswimmers propel themselves by rotating their flagella. The morphology of these flagella significantly influences forward speed, swimming efficiency, and directional stability, which are critical for their survival. This study begins by simulating the three-dimensional motion trajectories of microswimmers to analyze their kinematic characteristics. The simulation results demonstrate that microswimmers can actively adjust their forward direction by modifying the orientation of their flagella. We subsequently perform numerical simulations to visualize the flow fields generated by a microswimmer and examine the hydrodynamic interactions between the cell body and the flagella, focusing on their impacts on forward speed and swimming efficiency. We conclude that forward speed and swimming efficiency are closely related to the filament radius, pitch angle, and contour length of the flagella, while the yaw angle of locomotion is determined by the helix radius and contour length of the flagella. We conclude that the pitch angle for maximum forward speed is slightly smaller than that for maximum swimming efficiency, which suggests that microswimmers can effectively alternate between states of maximum forward speed and maximum swimming efficiency by fine-tuning their pitch angle and adapting to varying ecological conditions. These morphological characteristics of microswimmers may result from species competition and natural selection. This research establishes an optimized model for microswimmers, providing valuable insights for the design of enhanced microrobots tailored to specific applications.</description>

      <title>Role of enthalpy transport in laminar premixed hydrogen flames at atmospheric and elevated pressures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19865v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work discusses the role of diffusive enthalpy transport in relation to the origin of thermodiffusive instability and the resulting enhanced reactivity. Thermodiffusive effects in premixed hydrogen flames are typically explained and modelled via local equivalence ratio fluctuations. However, it is reiterated here that the imbalance between species and thermal diffusion (differential diffusion), rather than local species-to-species diffusive imbalances (preferential diffusion) is the leading-order effect. Reactant (H$_2$), product (H$_2$O) and intermediate (H) species are demonstrated to all play a role in the transport of enthalpy through an analysis of enthalpy flux divergence terms in unstretched flames. Premixed counterflow flames at various strain rates and pressures are then analysed to demonstrate that enhanced reactivity originates from a combination of enthalpy transport and the broadness of the reaction zone relative to the thickness of the flame. Effects resulting from key pressure fall-off reactions are also discussed to determine the importance of detailed chemistry, and the usage of Zeldovich number. Finally, two-dimensional planar flames are simulated and analysed to demonstrate the role of curvature in addition to strain rate, and the implications of the findings in blends and turbulent flames are discussed.</description>

      <title>Analytical and Numerical Linear Analyses of Convection Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01528v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We conduct linear analyses of convection in domains larger than the temperature scale height. We employ both analytical and numerical methods in these analyses. In the case excluding all dissipation, the typical time scale of convection is determined by the free fall time over the temperature scale height. We quantitatively show the condition for the Boussinesq and Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) approximations to be applicable. We provide a reassessment of the critical Rayleigh number, a key indicator of convection, and show that WKB approximation tends to underestimate the critical Rayleigh number, particularly when the temperature scale height is comparable to or smaller than the domain height. We show clear explanation why both thermal conduction and viscosity are required for stabilizing negative entropy gradient medium.</description>

      <title>Improving turbulence control through explainable deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02354v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Turbulent-flow control aims to develop strategies that effectively manipulate fluid systems, such as the reduction of drag in transportation and enhancing energy efficiency, both critical steps towards reducing global CO$_2$ emissions. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) offers novel tools to discover flow-control strategies, which we combine with our knowledge of the physics of turbulence. We integrate explainable deep learning (XDL) to objectively identify the coherent structures containing the most informative regions in the flow, with a DRL model trained to reduce them. The trained model targets the most relevant regions in the flow to sustain turbulence and produces a drag reduction which is higher than that of a model specifically trained to reduce the drag, while using only half its power consumption. Moreover, the XDL model results in a better drag reduction than other models focusing on specific classically identified coherent structures. This demonstrates that combining DRL with XDL can produce causal control strategies that precisely target the most influential features of turbulence. By directly addressing the core mechanisms that sustain turbulence, our approach offers a powerful pathway towards its efficient control, which is a long-standing challenge in physics with profound implications for energy systems, climate modeling and aerodynamics.</description>

      <title>Griffin Plots of vortex-induced vibrations: revealing self-similarity for quick estimation from transient displacement responses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03564v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Griffin plot relates the peak amplitudes of vortex-induced vibration to structrual mass-damping parameter, known as the Scruton number. Griffin plot serves as a fundamental tool in many engineering fields. This study confirms a general self-similarity in Griffin plots, where plots derived from transient responses at any Scruton number converge to a single, consisten curve. This self-similarity arises from weak aeroelastic nonlinearity in vortex-induced vibration, manifasting as amplitude-dependent aerodynamic damping. Based on this self-similarity property, we propose a numerical method to estimate Griffin plots from transient displacement responses at any Scruton number. The resulting plots align closely with experimental data for both cross-flow and torsional vortex-induced vibrations, highlighting robust self-similar behavior across different Scruton numbers. Furthermore, we observe a consistent trend in Griffin plots for a rectangular cylinder, closed-box, and double-girder bridge deck: the reciprocal of peak amplitudes shows an approximately linear relationship with the Scruton number, especially in torsional vortex-induced vibration. To generate this linearity, we develop a simple empirical model of vortex-induced forces. This model accurately reproduces the Griffin plot for a rectangular cylinder using aeroelastic parameters derived from a single Scruton number, significantly reducing the need for extensive experimental measurements.</description>
