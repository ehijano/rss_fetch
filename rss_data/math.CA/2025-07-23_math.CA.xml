      <title>On the intersection of Cantor set with the unit circle and some sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For $\lambda\in(0,1/2)$ let $K_\lambda$ be the self-similar set in $\mathbb{R}$ generated by the iterated function system $\{f_0(x)=\lambda x, f_1(x)=\lambda x+1-\lambda \}$. In this paper, we investigate the intersection of the unit circle $\mathbb{S} \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ with the Cartesian product $K_{\lambda} \times K_{\lambda}$. We prove that for $\lambda \in(0, 2 - \sqrt{3}]$, the intersection is trivial, i.e., \[ \mathbb{S} \cap (K_{\lambda} \times K_{\lambda}) = \{(0,1), (1,0)\}. \] If $\lambda\in [0.330384,1/2)$, then the intersection $\mathbb{S} \cap (K_{\lambda} \times K_{\lambda})$ is non-trivial. In particular, if $\lambda\in [0.407493 , 1/2)$ the intersection $\mathbb{S} \cap (K_{\lambda} \times K_{\lambda})$ is of cardinality continuum. Furthermore, the bound $2 - \sqrt{3}$ is sharp: there exists a sequence $\{\lambda_n\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ with $\lambda_n \searrow 2 - \sqrt{3}$ such that $\mathbb{S} \cap (K_{\lambda_n} \times K_{\lambda_n})$ is non-trivial for all $n\in\mathbb{N}$. This result provides a negative answer to a problem posed by Yu (2023). Our methods extend beyond the unit circle and remain effective for many nonlinear curves. By employing tools from number theory, including the quadratic reciprocity law, we analyze the intersection of Cantor sets with some sequences. A dichotomy is established in terms of the Legendre symbol associated with the digit set, revealing a fundamental arithmetic constraint governing such intersections.</description>

      <title>Distribution of roots of Eulerian polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the empirical measures of roots of Eulerian polynomials converge to a certain log-Cauchy distribution. To do so, we show that the moments of the roots of a related family of polynomials not only converge, but are in fact ultimately constant. These asymptotic moments are expressed in terms of N\"orlund's numbers.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic consensus with transmission and reaction delay: an overview</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to provide a systematic overview of results on asymptotic consensus for the Hegselmann-Krause-type model with delay and discuss the corresponding analytical tools. We explain that two types (sources) of delay - transmission and reaction - are justifiable from the modeling point of view. We consider both classical and normalized communication weights. Studying a toy model with two agents only, we develop an intuitive insight into what type of dynamics we can expect from the systems. In particular, we stress that with transmission-type delay, asymptotic consensus can be reached with any length of the delay (i.e., without smallness assumptions). In contrast, the systems with reaction-type delay can only reach asymptotic consensus if the delay is sufficiently small.
  We formulate four theorems that establish asymptotic consensus in the following scenarios: (1) transmission-type delay with classical communication weights, (2) transmission-type delay with normalized communication weights, (3) reaction-type delay with symmetric communication weights, (4) reaction-type delay with non-symmetric communication weights.
  We explain how the methods of proof depend on the particular scenario: direct estimates for (1), convexity arguments for (2), Lyapunov functional for (3) and generalized Gronwall-Halanay inequality for (4).</description>

      <title>Hausdorff dimension of the graph of the error-sum function of continued fractions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the unweighted error-sum function $\mathcal{E}(x) \coloneqq \sum_{n \geq 0} ( x- p_n(x)/q_n(x) )$, where $p_n(x)/q_n(x)$ is the $n$th convergent of the continued fraction expansion of $x \in \mathbb{R}$. We prove that the Hausdorff dimension of the graph of $\mathcal{E}$ is exactly $1$. Our proof is number-theoretic in nature and involves M\"obius inversion, summation over coprime convergent denominators, and precise upper bounds derived via continued fraction recurrence relations. As a supplementary result, we rederive the known upper bound of $3/2$ for the Hausdorff dimension of the graph of the relative error-sum function $P(x) \coloneqq \sum_{n \geq 0} (q_n(x)x-p_n(x))$.</description>

      <title>Neumann series of Bessel functions in direct and inverse spherically symmetric transmission eigenvalue problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The transmission eigenvalue problem (TEP) plays a central role in inverse scattering theory. Despite substantial theoretical progress, the numerical solution of direct and inverse TEP in spherically symmetric domains with variable refractive index covering real and complex eigenvalues remains challenging. This study introduces a novel Neumann Series of Bessel Functions (NSBF) methodology to address this challenge. After reformulating the TEP as a Sturm-Liouville equation via a Liouville transformation, we expand its characteristic function in an NSBF whose coefficients are computed by simple recursive integration. In the direct problem, eigenvalues real or complex are found by root finding on a truncated NSBF partial sum, yielding high accuracy with a few coefficients, as demonstrated with various examples. For the inverse problem, we develop a two-step approach: first, recovering the transformed interval length $\delta$ from spectral data via a new NSBF-based algorithm, and second, reconstructing the refractive index $n(r)$ by solving a linear system for the first NSBF coefficients. A spectrum completion technique is also implemented to complete the spectrum and solve the corresponding inverse problem when eigenvalue data is limited. Numerical examples confirm the method's robustness and accuracy across a wide range of refractive indices, with no a priori assumptions on $\delta$ or the sign of the contrast $1-n(r)$.</description>

      <title>Trace and Observability Inequalities for Laplace Eigenfunctions on the Torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate trace and observability inequalities for Laplace eigenfunctions on the d-dimensional torus, with respect to arbitrary Borel measures $\mu$. Specifically, we characterize the measures $\mu$ for which the inequalities
  $$ \int |u|^2 d \mu \lesssim \int |u|^2 d x \quad \text{(trace)}, \qquad \int |u|^2 d \mu \gtrsim \int |u|^2 d x \quad \text{(observability)}$$
  hold uniformly for all eigenfunctions $u$ of the Laplacian. Sufficient conditions are derived based on the integrability and regularity of $\mu$, while necessary conditions are formulated in terms of the dimension of the support of the measure. These results generalize classical theorems of Zygmund and Bourgain--Rudnick to higher dimensions. Applications include results in the spirit of Cantor--Lebesgue theorems, constraints on quantum limits, and control theory for the Schr\"odinger equation. Our approach combines several tools: the cluster structure of lattice points on spheres; decoupling estimates; and the construction of eigenfunctions exhibiting strong concentration or vanishing behavior, tailored respectively to the trace and observability inequalities.</description>

      <title>On a specific family of orthogonal polynomials of Bernstein-Szeg\"o type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05545v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a class of weight functions on $[-1,1]$, which are special cases of the broader family studied by Bernstein and Szeg\"o, as well as their non-symmetric extentions to the interval $[-a,1]$ for a continuous parameter $a&gt;0$. These weights are parametrized by two positive integers. As these integers tend to infinity, these weights approximate certain weight functions on $\mathbb{R}$ considered in the earlier literature in connection with orthogonal polynomials related to elliptic functions. It turns out that an orthogonal polynomial of certain degree corresponding to these weights has a particularly simple form with known roots. This fact allows us to find explicit quadrature formulas for these weights and construct measures on $\mathbb{R}$ with identical moments. We also find finite analogs of some improper integrals first studied by Glaisher and Ramanujan, and show that some of the functions used in this work are in fact generating functions of certain finite trigonometric sums.</description>
