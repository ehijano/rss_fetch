      <title>Interaction energies in nematic liquid crystal suspensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish, as $\rho\to 0$, an asymptotic expansion for the minimal Dirichlet energy of $\mathbb S^2$-valued maps outside a finite number of three-dimensional particles of size $\rho$ with fixed centers $x_j\in\mathbb{R}^3$, under general anchoring conditions at the particle boundaries. Up to a scaling factor, this expansion is of the form \begin{align*} E_\rho = \sum_j \mu_j -4\pi\rho \sum_{i\neq j} \frac{\langle v_i,v_j\rangle}{|x_i-x_j|} +o(\rho)\,, \end{align*} where $\mu_j$ is the minimal energy after zooming in at scale $\rho$ around each particle, and $v_j\in\mathbb{R}^3$ is a torque determined by the far-field behavior of the corresponding single-particle minimizer. The above expansion highlights Coulomb-like interactions between the particle centers. This agrees with the \textit{electrostatics analogy} commonly used in the physics literature for colloid interactions in nematic liquid crystal. That analogy was pioneered by Brochard and de Gennes in 1970, based on a formal linearization argument. We obtain here for the first time a precise estimate of the energy error introduced by this linearization procedure.</description>

      <title>Well-Posedness of the R13 Equations Using Tensor-Valued Korn Inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we finally catch up with proving the well-posedness of the linearized R13 moment model, which describes, e.g., rarefied gas flows. As an extension of the classical fluid equations, moment models are robust and have been frequently used, yet they are challenging to analyze due to their additional equations. By effectively grouping variables, we identify a 2-by-2 block structure, allowing the analysis of the well-posedness within the abstract LBB framework of saddle point problems. Due to the unique tensorial structure of the equations, in addition to an interesting combination of tools from Stokes' and linear elasticity theory, we also need new coercivity estimates for tensor fields. These Korn-type inequalities are established by analyzing the symbol map of the symmetric and trace-free part of tensor derivative fields. Together with the corresponding right inverse of the tensorial divergence, we obtain the existence and uniqueness of weak solutions.</description>

      <title>Hypoelliptic Regularization in the Obstacle Problem for the Kolmogorov Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the obstacle problem associated with the Kolmogorov operator $\Delta_v - \partial_t - v\cdot\nabla_x$, which arises from the theory of optimal control in Asian-American options pricing models.
  First, we improve the known regularity of solutions. The existing interior estimate in the literature is from \cite{FRENTZPOLIDOROOPTIMAL1}, where it is proven that solutions are $C^{1,1}$ with respect to the kinetic distance and therefore $C^{0,2/3}_x$ H{\"o}lder regular in the spatial variable $x$. This result, which is claimed to be optimal, is the typical regularity obtained in obstacle problems. Our first result is rather unexpected then, for we manage to prove an even stronger hypoelliptic regularization effect: solutions enjoy a Lipschitz $C^{0,1}_x$ interior estimate in the spatial variable $x$. We prove $C^{0,1}_{t,x} \cap C^{1,1}_v$ interior estimates following an approach which is based on Bernstein's technique and draws on ideas from Evans-Kyrlov theory, and our method seems to be quite robust.
  We then use this improvement in regularity of the solution to prove the first known free boundary regularity result. We show that under a standard thickness condition, the free boundary is a $C^{0,1/2}_{t,x} \cap C^{0,1}_v$ regular surface. This result constitutes the first step in the program of free boundary regularity. Critically, our arguments rely on a new monotonicity formula and a commutator estimate that are only made possible by the solution's enhanced regularity in $x$.</description>

      <title>Linear enhanced dissipation for the 2D Taylor-Couette flow in the exterior region: A supplementary example for Gearhart-Pr\"uss type lemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From the perspective of asymptotic stability at high Reynolds numbers, Taylor-Couette flow, as a typical rotating shear flow, exhibits rich decay behaviors. Previously, for the extensively studied Couette flow or the Taylor-Couette flow in bounded annular domains, methods based on resolvent estimates could derive exponential decay asymptotic for the solutions of the linearized system. However, unlike the Couette flow or the Taylor-Couette flow in bounded annular domains, the Taylor-Couette flow in exterior regions exhibits degeneration of derivatives of any order at infinity. In this paper, we present in Theorem 1.1 that the linearized system of the 2D Taylor-Couette flow in the exterior region exhibits space-time coupled polynomial decay asymptotics. We also prove that the solution to this system, when it contains inhomogeneous terms, cannot be expected to exhibit space-time coupled exponential decay, as detailed in Theorem 1.2. The result of Theorem 1.2 indicates that, even if we can obtain sharp resolvent estimates in different weighted spaces, the Gearhart-Pr\"uss type lemma no longer applies. This suggests that resolvent estimates may not be very effective for handling degenerate shear flows. Furthermore, Theorem 1.2 also implies that, for the transition threshold problem of the 2D Taylor-Couette flow in exterior regions, we can at most expect the solution to exhibit long-time behavior with space-time coupled polynomial decay. Finally, we present a generalization of Theorem 1.2, as detailed in Theorem 1.3.</description>

      <title>Time-asymptotic stability of composite weak planar waves for a general $n\times n$ multi-D viscous system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the time-asymptotic stability of the superposition of a weak planar viscous 1-shock and either a weak planar n-rarefaction or a weak planar viscous n-shock for a general $n\times n$ multi-D viscous system. In 2023, Kang-Vasseur-Wang [11] showed the stability of the superposition of a viscous shock and a rarefaction for 1-D compressible barotropic Navier-Stokes equations and solved a long-standing open problem officially introduced by Matsumura-Nishihara [23] in 1992. Our work is an extension of [11], where a general $n\times n$ multi-D viscous system is studied. Same as in [11], we apply the $a$-contraction method with shifts, an energy based method invented by Kang and Vasseur in [9], for both viscous shock and rarefaction at the level of the solution. In such a way, we can work with general perturbations and compositions of waves. Finally, a technique to classify and control higher-order terms is developed to work in multi-D.</description>

      <title>Limiting shape of the $L_p$-Minkowski problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ben Andrews classified the limiting shape for isotropic curvature flow corresponding to the solutions of the $L_p$-Minkowski problem as $p\to-\infty$ in the planar case. In this paper, we use the group-invariant method to study the asymptotic shape of solutions to the $L_p$-Minkowski problem as $p\to-\infty$ in high dimensions. For any regular polytope $T$, we establish the existence of a solution ${\Omega^{(p)}}$ to the $L_p$-Minkowski problem that converges to $T$ as $p\to-\infty$, thereby revealing the intricate geometric structure underlying this limiting behavior. We also extend the result to the dual Minkowski problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the gravity-capillary water waves equations of a 2D fluid with constant vorticity. Using variational methods we prove the bifurcation of steady periodic traveling water waves for {\it all} the values of gravity, surface tension, constant vorticity, depth and wavelenght, extending previous results valid for restricted values of the parameters. We parametrize the bifurcating Stokes waves either with their speed or their momentum.</description>

      <title>Homoenergetic solutions for the Rayleigh-Boltzmann equation: existence of a stationary non-equilibrium solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider a particular class of solutions of the linear Boltzmann-Rayleigh equation, known in the nonlinear setting as Homoenergetic solutions. These solutions describe the dynamics of Boltzmann gases under the effect of different mechanical deformations. Therefore, the long-time behaviour of these solutions cannot be described by Maxwellian distributions and it strongly depends on the homogeneity of the collision kernel of the equation. Here we focus on the paradigmatic case of simple shear deformations and in the case of cut-off collision kernels with homogeneity $\gamma\geq 0$, in particular covering the case of Maxwell molecules (i.e. $\gamma=0$) and hard potentials with $0\leq \gamma &lt;1$. We first prove a well-posedness result for this class of solutions in the space of non-negative Radon measures and then we rigorously prove the existence of a stationary solution under the non-equilibrium condition which is induced by the presence of the shear deformation. In the case of Maxwell molecules we prove that there is a different behaviour of the solutions for small and large values of the shear parameter.</description>

      <title>Steady compressible Navier-Stokes-Fourier system with general temperature dependent viscosities I: density estimates based on Bogovskii operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to reconsider the existence theory for steady compressible Navier--Stokes--Fourier system assuming more general condition of the dependence of the viscosities on the temperature in the form $\mu(\vartheta)$, $\xi(\vartheta) \sim (1+\vartheta)^\alpha$ for $0\leq \alpha \leq 1$. This extends the known theory for $\alpha=1$ from and improves significantly the results for $\alpha =0$. This paper is the first of a series of two papers dealing with this problem and is connected with the Bogovskii-type estimates of the sequence of densities. This leads, among others, to the limitation $\gamma &gt;\frac 32$ for the pressure law $p(\varrho,\vartheta) \sim \varrho^\gamma + \varrho\vartheta$. The paper considers both the heat-flux (Robin) and Dirichlet boundary conditions for the temperature as well as both the homogeneous Dirichlet and zero inflow/outflow Navier boundary conditions for the velocity. Further extension for $\gamma &gt;1$ only is based on different type of pressure estimates and will be the content of the subsequent paper.</description>

      <title>Diffusive transport on the real line: semi-contractive gradient flows and their discretization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The diffusive transport distance, a novel pseudo-metric between probability measures on the real line, is introduced. It generalizes Martingale optimal transport, and forms a hierarchy with the Hellinger and the Wasserstein metrics. We observe that certain classes of parabolic PDEs, among them the porous medium equation of exponent two, are formally semi-contractive metric gradient flows in the new distance. This observation is made rigorous for a suitable spatial discretization of the considered PDEs: these are semi-contractive gradient flows with respect to an adapted diffusive transport distance for measures on the point lattice. The main result is that the modulus of convexity is uniform with respect to the lattice spacing. Particularly for the quadratic porous medium equation, this is in contrast to what has been observed for discretizations of the Wasserstein gradient flow structure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For $0&lt;s&lt;1$, we consider the nonlocal equation $(-\Delta)^s u = f$ over a Reifenberg flat domain $\Omega$ with $f \in C({\overline{\Omega}})$ and null Dirichlet exterior condition. Given $\alpha \in (0,s)$, we prove that weak solutions are $\alpha$-H\"older continuous up to the boundary when the flatness parameter is small enough. The main ingredients of the proof are an iterative argument and a nonlocal version of the ABP maximum principle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the existence of multiple sign-changing solutions of prescribed mass for a mass-supercritical nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation set on a compact metric graph. In particular, we obtain, in the supercritical mass regime, the first multiplicity result for prescribed mass solutions on compact metric graphs. Our approach relies on the introduction a new kind of link and on the use of gradient flow techniques on a constraint. It can be transposed to other problems posed on a bounded domain.</description>

      <title>A family of explicit minimizers for interaction energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the minimizers of the interaction energies with the power-law interaction potentials $W({\bf x}) = \frac{|{\bf x}|^a}{a} - \frac{|{\bf x}|^b}{b}$ in $d$ dimensions. For odd $d$ with $(a,b)=(3,2-d)$ and even $d$ with $(a,b)=(3,1-d)$, we give the explicit formula for the unique energy minimizer up to translation. For the odd dimensions, the key observation is that successive Laplacian of the Euler-Lagrange condition gives a local partial differential equation for the minimizer. For the even dimensions $d$, the minimizer is given as the projection and rescaling of the previously constructed minimizer in dimension $d+1$ via a new lemma on dimension reduction.</description>

We establish space-time bilinear estimates, and hence the unconditional uniqueness of solutions to the $\mathbb{R}^d$ and $\mathbb{T}^d$ Boltzmann equation for the Maxwellian particle and soft potential with an angular cutoff, adopting a unified hierarchy scheme originally developed for the nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation.</description>

      <title>Stroke classification using Virtual Hybrid Edge Detection from in silico electrical impedance tomography data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is a non-invasive imaging method for recovering the internal conductivity of a physical body from electric boundary measurements. EIT combined with machine learning has shown promise for the classification of strokes. However, most previous works have used raw EIT voltage data as network inputs. We build upon a recent development which suggested the use of special noise-robust Virtual Hybrid Edge Detection (VHED) functions as network inputs, although that work used only highly simplified and mathematically ideal models. In this work we strengthen the case for the use of EIT, and VHED functions especially, for stroke classification. We design models with high detail and mathematical realism to test the use of VHED functions as inputs. Virtual patients are created using a physically detailed 2D head model which includes features known to create challenges in real-world imaging scenarios. Conductivity values are drawn from statistically realistic distributions, and phantoms are afflicted with either hemorrhagic or ischemic strokes of various shapes and sizes. Simulated noisy EIT electrode data, generated using the realistic Complete Electrode Model (CEM) as opposed to the mathematically ideal continuum model, is processed to obtain VHED functions. We compare the use of VHED functions as inputs against the alternative paradigm of using raw EIT voltages. Our results show that (i) stroke classification can be performed with high accuracy using 2D EIT data from physically detailed and mathematically realistic models, and (ii) in the presence of noise, VHED functions outperform raw data as network inputs.</description>

      <title>The Funayama envelope as the $T_D$-hull of a frame</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce proximity morphisms between MT-algebras and show that the resulting category is equivalent to the category of frames. This is done by utilizing the Funayama envelope of a frame, which is viewed as the $T_D$-hull. Our results have some spatial ramifications, including a generalization of the $T_D$-duality of Banaschewski and Pultr.</description>

Abstract: We prove the removable singularity theorem for nonlocal minimal graphs. Specifically, we show that any nonlocal minimal graph in $\Omega \setminus K$, where $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ is an open set and $K \subset \Omega$ is a compact set of $(s, 1)$-capacity zero, is indeed a nonlocal minimal graph in all of $\Omega$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2111.14740v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A partial regularity theorem is presented for minimisers of $k$th-order functionals subject to a quasiconvexity and general growth condition. We will assume a natural growth condition governed by an $N$-function satisfying the $\Delta_2$ and $\nabla_2$ conditions, assuming no quantitative estimates on the second derivative of the integrand; this is new even in the $k = 1$ case. These results will also be extended to the case of strong local minimisers.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we establish an $\ell^2$ decoupling inequality for the hypersurface \[\Big\{(\xi_1,...,\xi_{n-1},\xi_1^m+...+\xi_{n-1}^m): (\xi_1,...,\xi_{n-1}) \in [0,1]^{n-1}\Big\}\]associated with the decomposition adapted to hypersufaces of finite type, where $n\geq 2$ and $m\geq 4$ is an even number. The key ingredients of the proof include an $\ell^2$ decoupling inequality for the hypersurfaces
  \[\Big\{(\xi_1,...,\xi_{n-1},\phi_1(\xi_1)+...+\phi_s(\xi_s)+\xi_{s+1}^m+...+\xi_{n-1}^m): (\xi_1,...,\xi_{n-1}) \in [0,1]^{n-1}\Big\},\] $0 \leq s \leq n-1$, with $\phi_1,...,\phi_s$ being $m$-nondegenerate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2202.13075v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The stationary Navier-Stokes equations for a non-Newtonian incompressible fluid are coupled with the stationary heat equation and subject to Dirichlet type boundary conditions. The viscosity is supposed to depend on the temperature and the stress depends on the strain through a suit-able power law depending on $p \in (1,2)$ (shear thinning case). For this problem we establish the existence of a weak solution as well as we prove some regularity results both for the Navier-Stokes and the Stokes cases. Then, the latter case with the Carreau power law is approximated through a FEM scheme and some error estimates are obtained. Such estimates are then validated through some two-dimensional numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Finite-time singularity formations for the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation in dimension two</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.05800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.05800v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct finite time blow-up solutions to the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation (LLG) from ${\mathbb R}^2$ into $S^2$ \begin{equation*} \begin{cases} u_t= a(\Delta u+|\nabla u|^2u) -b u\wedge \Delta u &amp;\ \mbox{ in }\ {\mathbb R}^2\times(0,T), u(\cdot,0) = u_0\in S^2 &amp;\ \mbox{ in }\ {\mathbb R}^2, \end{cases} \end{equation*} where $a^2+b^2=1,~a &gt; 0,~ b\in {\mathbb R}$. Given any prescribed $N$ points in $\mathbb{R}^2$ and small $T&gt;0$, we prove that there exists regular initial data such that the solution blows up precisely at these points at finite time $t=T$, taking around each point the profile of sharply scaled degree 1 harmonic map with the type II blow-up speed \begin{equation*} \| \nabla u\|_{L^\infty } \sim \frac{|\ln(T-t)|^2}{ T-t } \ \mbox{ as } \ t\to T. \end{equation*} The proof is based on the {\em parabolic inner-outer gluing method}, developed in \cite{17HMF} for Harmonic Map Flow (HMF). However, a direct consequence of the presence of dispersion is the {\em lack of maximum principle} for suitable quantities, which makes the analysis more delicate even at the linearized level. To overcome this difficulty, we make use of two key technical ingredients: first, for the inner problem we employ the tool of {\em distorted Fourier transform}, as developed by Krieger, Miao, Schlag and Tataru \cite{Krieger09Duke,KMS20WM}. Second, the linear theory for the outer problem is achieved by means of the sub-Gaussian estimate for the fundamental solution of parabolic system in non-divergence form with coefficients of Dini mean oscillation in space ($\mathsf{DMO_x}$), which was proved by Dong, Kim and Lee \cite{dong22-non-divergence} recently.</description>

      <title>The master equation for mean field game systems with fractional and nonlocal diffusions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.18867v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove existence and uniqueness of classical solutions of the master equation for mean field game (MFG) systems with fractional and nonlocal diffusions. We cover a large class of L\'evy diffusions of order greater than one, including purely nonlocal, local, and even mixed local-nonlocal operators. In the process we prove refined well-posedness results for the MFG systems, results that include the mixed local-nonlocal case. We also show various auxiliary results on viscous Hamilton-Jacobi equations, linear parabolic equations, and linear forward-backward systems that may be of independent interest. This includes a rigorous treatment of certain equations and systems with data and solutions in the duals of H\"older spaces $C^\gamma_b$ on the whole of $\mathbb{R}^d$. We do not assume existence of any moments for the initial distributions of players. In a future work we will use the results of this paper to prove the convergence of $N$-player games to mean field games as $N\to\infty$.</description>

      <title>Strong relaxation limit and uniform time asymptotics of the Jin-Xin model in the $L^{p}$ framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04105v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the time-asymptotic stability of the Jin-Xin model and its diffusive relaxation limit toward viscous conservation laws in $\mathbb{R}^d$ for $d\geq 1$. First, we establish a priori estimates that are uniform with respect to both the time and the relaxation parameter $\varepsilon&gt;0$, for initial data in hybrid Besov spaces based on $L^{p}$-norms. This uniformity enables us to derive $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon)$ bounds on the difference between solutions of the viscous conservation law and its associated Jin-Xin approximation, thus justifying the strong convergence of the relaxation process. Furthermore, under an additional condition on the initial data, for instance, that the low frequencies belong to $L^{p/2}(\mathbb{R}^{d})$, we show that the $L^{p}(\mathbb{R}^d)$-norm of the solution to the Jin-Xin model decays at the optimal rate $(1+t)^{-d/{2p}}$, and the $L^{p}(\mathbb{R}^d)$-norm of its difference with the solution of the associated viscous conservation law decays at the enhanced rate $\varepsilon(1+t)^{-d/{2p}-1/2}$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we identify the Fokker-Planck equation for (reflected) Sticky Brownian Motion as a Wasserstein gradient flow in the space of probability measures. The driving functional is the relative entropy with respect to a non-standard reference measure, the sum of an absolutely continuous interior part plus a singular part supported on the boundary. Taking the small time-step limit in a minimizing movement (JKO scheme) we prove existence of weak solutions for the coupled system of PDEs satisfying in addition an Energy Dissipation Inequality.</description>

Abstract: We prove the existence of viscosity solutions to complex Hessian equations on a compact Hermitian manifold that satisfy a determinant domination condition. This viscosity solution is shown to be unique when the right hand is strictly monotone increasing in terms of the solution. When the right hand side does not depend on the solution, we reduces it to the strict monotonicity of the solvability constant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10013v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the paper we investigate Trudinger-Moser type inequalities in presence of logarithmic kernels in dimension N. A sharp threshold, depending on N, is detected for the existence of estremal functions or blow-up, where the domain is the ball or the entire space. We also show that the extremal functions satisfy suitable Euler-Lagrange equations. When the domain is the entire space, such equation can be derived by N-Laplacian Schrodinger equation strongly coupled with a higher order fractional Poisson's equation. The results extends [16] to any dimension N bigger than 2.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we consider the spatially homogeneous Landau equation, which is a variation of the Boltzmann equation in the grazing collision limit. For the Landau equation for hard potentials in the style of Desvillettes-Villani (Comm. Partial Differential Equations, 2000), we provide the proof of the existence of axisymmetric measure-valued solution for any axisymmetric $\mathcal{P}_p(\mathbb{R}^3)$ initial profile for any $p\ge 2$. Moreover, we prove that if the initial data is not a single Dirac mass, then the solution instantaneously becomes analytic for any time $t&gt;0$ in the hard potential case. In the soft potential and the Maxwellian molecule cases, we show that there are no solutions whose support is contained in a fixed line even for any given line-concentrated data.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the following Kirchhoff-type biharmonic equation \begin{equation}\label{pr} \left\{ \begin{array}{ll} \Delta^2 u+ \left(a+b\int_{\mathbb{R}^N}|\nabla u|^2d x\right)(-\Delta u+V(x)u)=f(x,u),\quad x\in \mathbb{R}^N,\\ u\in H^{2}(\mathbb{R}^N), \end{array} \right. \end{equation} where $a&gt;0$, $b\geq 0$ and $V(x)$ and $f(x, u)$ are periodic or asymptotically periodic in $x$. We study the existence of Nehari-type ground state solutions of \eqref{pr} with $f(x,u)u-4F(x,u)$ sign-changing, where $F(x,u):=\int_0^uf(x,s)d s$. We significantly extend some results from the previous literature.</description>

      <title>Degree theory for 4-dimensional asymptotically conical gradient expanding solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.03154v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a new degree theory for 4-dimensional, asymptotically conical gradient expanding solitons. Our theory implies the existence of gradient expanding solitons that are asymptotic to any given cone over $S^3$ with non-negative scalar curvature. We also obtain a similar existence result for cones whose link is diffeomorphic to $S^3/\Gamma$ if we allow the expanding soliton to have orbifold singularities.
  Our theory reveals the existence of a new topological invariant, called the expander degree, applicable to a particular class of compact, smooth 4-orbifolds with boundary. This invariant is roughly equal to a signed count of all possible gradient expanding solitons that can be defined on the interior of the orbifold and are asymptotic to any fixed cone metric with non-negative scalar curvature. If the expander degree of an orbifold is non-zero, then gradient expanding solitons exist for any such cone metric. We show that the expander degree of the 4-disk $D^4$ and any orbifold of the form $D^4/\Gamma$ equals 1. Additionally, we demonstrate that the expander degree of certain orbifolds, including exotic 4-disks, vanishes.
  Our theory also sheds light on the relation between gradient and non-gradient expanding solitons with respect to their asymptotic model. More specifically, we show that among the set of asymptotically conical expanding solitons, the subset of those solitons that are gradient forms a union of connected components.</description>

Abstract: We present difference schemes for stochastic transport equations with low-regularity velocity fields. We establish $L^2$ stability and convergence of the difference approximations under conditions that are less strict than those required for deterministic transport equations. The $L^2$ estimate, crucial for the analysis, is obtained through a discrete duality argument and a comprehensive examination of a class of backward parabolic difference schemes.</description>

      <title>Positive-density ground states of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03495v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the nonlinear Gross-Pitaevskii equation at positive density, that is, for a bounded solution not tending to 0 at infinity. We focus on infinite ground states, which are by definition minimizers of the energy under local perturbations. When the Fourier transform of the interaction potential takes negative values we prove the existence of a phase transition at high density, where the constant solution ceases to be a ground state. The analysis requires mixing techniques from elliptic PDE theory and statistical mechanics, in order to deal with a large class of interaction potentials.</description>

      <title>A Logvinenko-Sereda theorem for vector-valued functions and application to control theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09159v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a Logvinenko-Sereda Theorem for vector valued functions. That is, for an arbitrary Banach space $X$, all $p \in [1,\infty]$, all $\lambda \in (0,\infty)^d$, all $f \in L^p (\mathbb{R}^d ; X)$ with $\operatorname{supp} \mathcal{F} f \in \times_{i=1}^d (-\lambda_i/2 , \lambda_i /2)$, and all thick sets $E \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$ we have \begin{equation*} \lVert \mathbf{1}_E f \rVert_{L^p (\mathbb{R}^d)} \geq C \lVert f \rVert_{L^p (\mathbb{R}^d)} . \end{equation*} The constant is explicitly known in dependence of the geometric parameters of the thick set and the parameter $\lambda$. As an application, we study control theory for normally elliptic operators on Banach spaces whose coefficients of their symbol are given by bounded linear operators. This includes systems of coupled parabolic equations or problems depending on a parameter.</description>

      <title>Spectral theory of infinite dimensional dissipative Hamiltonian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11634v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The spectral theory for operator pencils and operator differential-algebraic equations is studied. Special focus is laid on singular operator pencils and three different concepts of singularity of operator pencils are introduced. The concepts are analyzed in detail and examples are presented that illustrate the subtle differences. It is investigated how these concepts are related to uniqueness of the underlying algebraic-differential operator equation, showing that, in general, classical results known from the finite dimensional case of matrix pencils and differential-algebraic equations do not prevail. The results are then studied in the setting of structured operator pencils arising in dissipative differential-algebraic equations. Here, unlike to the general infinite-dimensional case, the uniqueness of solutions to dissipative differential-algebraic operator equations is closely related to the singularity of the pencil.</description>
