      <title>Dynamic scaling theory for a field quench near the Kasteleyn transition in spin ice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a dynamic scaling theory to describe relaxation dynamics following a magnetic-field quench near an unconventional phase transition in the magnetic material spin ice. Starting from a microscopic model, we derive an effective description for the critical dynamics in terms of the seeding and growth of string excitations, and use this to find scaling forms in terms of time, reduced temperature and monopole fugacity. We confirm the predictions of scaling theory using Monte Carlo simulations, which also show good quantitative agreement with analytical expressions valid in the limit of low monopole density. As well as being relevant for experiments in the spin ice materials, our results open the way for the study of dynamic critical properties in a family of unconventional classical phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Analog of the Carnot engine for fluctuating diffusivity in living cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, a formal analogy between the fluctuating diffusivity and thermodynamics has been proposed based on phenomena of heterogeneous diffusion observed in living cells. This not only offers the analogs of the quantity of heat and work as well as the internal energy but also achieves that of the Clausius inequality for the entropy concerning diffusivity fluctuations. Here, a discussion is developed about constructing a heat-like engine in terms of the fluctuating diffusivity. The engine constitutes two kinds of processes with the average diffusivity or the average local temperature being kept fixed, along which the fluctuation distribution obeys an exponential law. The efficiency of the engine in a cycle, which quantifies how much the diffusivity change as the analog of work can be extracted, is found to formally coincide with that of Carnot's. During the cycle, the total change of the entropy is also shown to vanish.</description>

      <title>A Novel Approach to Real-Time Short-Term Traffic Prediction based on Distributed Fiber-Optic Sensing and Data Assimilation with a Stochastic Cell-Automata Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper demonstrates real-time short-term traffic flow prediction through distributed fiber-optic sensing (DFOS) and data assimilation with a stochastic cell-automata-based traffic model. Traffic congestion on expressways is a severe issue. To alleviate its negative impacts, it is necessary to optimize traffic flow prior to becoming serious congestion. For this purpose, real-time short-term traffic flow prediction is promising. However, conventional traffic monitoring apparatus used in prediction methods faces a technical issue due to the sparsity in traffic flow data. To overcome the issue for realizing real-time traffic prediction, this paper employs DFOS, which enables to obtain spatially continuous and real-time traffic flow data along the road without dead zones. Using mean velocities derived from DFOS data as a feature extraction, this paper proposes a real-time data assimilation method for the short-term prediction. As the theoretical model, the stochastic Nishinari-Fukui-Schadschneider model is adopted. Future traffic flow is simulated with the optimal values of model parameters estimated from observed mean velocities and the initial condition estimated as the latest microscopic traffic state. This concept is validated using two congestion scenarios obtained in Japanese expressways. The results show that the mean absolute error of the predicted mean velocities is 10-15 km/h in the prediction horizon of 30 minutes. Furthermore, the prediction error in congestion length and travel time decreases by 40-84% depending on congestion scenarios when compared with conventional methods with traffic counters. This paper concludes that real-time data assimilation using DFOS enables an accurate short-term traffic prediction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Every many-body state can be constructed from the vacuum state by iteratively applying the creation operators, therefore the thermal expectation can be transformed into a sum of vacuum expectation where the vacuum Wick's theorem holds. Based on this observation this article gives an algebraic proof of thermal Wick's theorem.</description>

      <title>Extreme-temperature single-particle heat engine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Carnot famously showed that engine operation is chiefly characterised by the magnitude of the temperature ratio $T_\mathrm{h}/T_\mathrm{c}$ between its hot and cold reservoirs. While temperature ratios ranging between $1.3-2.8$ and $2-10$ are common in macroscopic commercial engines and engines operating in the microscopic regime, respectively, the quest is to test thermodynamics at its extremes. Here we present the hottest engine on earth, with temperature ratios as high as $110$. We achieve this by realising an underdamped single-particle engine using a charged microparticle that is electrically levitated under vacuum conditions. Noisy electric fields are used to synthesise reservoir temperatures in excess of $10^7$ K. As a result, giant fluctuations show up in all thermodynamic quantities of the engine, such as heat exchange and efficiency. Moreover, we find that the particle experiences an effective position dependent temperature, which gives rise to dynamics that drastically deviates from that of standard Brownian motion. We develop a theoretical model accounting for the effects of this multiplicative noise and find excellent agreement with the measured dynamics. The high level of control over the presented experimental platform opens the door to emulate the stochastic dynamics of cellular and biological processes, and provides thermodynamic insight required for the development of nanotechnologies.</description>

      <title>Correlation time in extremal self-organized critical models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate correlation time numerically in extremal self-organized critical models, namely, the Bak-Sneppen evolution and the Robin Hood dynamics. The (fitness) correlation time is the duration required for the extinction or mutation of species over the entire spatial region in the critical state. We apply the methods of finite-size scaling and extreme value theory to understand the statistics of the correlation time. We find power-law system size scaling behaviors for the mean, the variance, the mode, and the peak probability of the correlation time. We obtain data collapse for the correlation time cumulative probability distribution, and the scaling function follows the generalized extreme value density close to the Gumbel function.</description>

      <title>Patterns robust to Disorder in spatially-interacting Generalized Lotka-Volterra Ecosystems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How do interactions between species influence their spatial distribution in an ecosystem? To answer this question, we introduce a spatially-extended ecosystem of Generalized Lotka-Volterra type, where species can diffuse and interactions are nonlocal. We compute the criterion for the loss of stability of the spatially homogeneous ecosystem, and we show that the stability of the uniform state crucially depends on the most abundant species, and on the interplay between space exploration during one species generation and the interaction range. Focusing on the spectrum of the interaction matrix weighted by the species abundances, we identify a Baik-Ben Arous-P\'ech\'e transition that translates into a transition in the final patterns of the species repartition. Finally assuming that the disorder is small, we exhibit an explicit solution of the dynamical mean-field equation for the species density, obtained as the fixed point of a nonlocal Fisher-Kolmogorov-Petrovski-Piskounov equation. Our work paves the way of future combined approaches at the frontier of active matter and disordered systems, with the hope of better understanding complex ecosystems like bacterial communities.</description>

      <title>Concentration of Empirical First-Passage Times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: First-passage properties are central to the kinetics of target-search processes. Theoretical approaches so far primarily focused on predicting first-passage statistics for a given process or model. In practice, however, one faces the reverse problem of inferring first-passage statistics from, typically sub-sampled, experimental or simulation data. Obtaining trustworthy estimates from under-sampled data and unknown underlying dynamics remains a daunting task, and the assessment of the uncertainty is imperative. In this chapter, we highlight recent progress in understanding and controlling finite-sample effects in empirical first-passage times of reversible Markov processes. Precisely, we present concentration inequalities bounding from above the deviations of the sample mean for any sample size from the true mean first-passage time and construct non-asymptotic confidence intervals. Moreover, we present two-sided bounds on the range of fluctuations, i.e, deviations of the expected maximum and minimum from the mean in any given sample, which control uncertainty even in situations where the mean is a priori not a sufficient statistic.</description>

      <title>Optimal Estimation of Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past century, the Boltzmann entropy has been widely accepted as the standard definition of entropy for an isolated system. However, it coexists with controversial alternatives, such as the Gibbs entropy. These definitions, including the Boltzmann entropy, exhibit certain inconsistencies, both mathematically and thermodynamically. To address this challenge, we introduce the estimation theory in statistical inference into the study of thermodynamics and statistical physics for finite-sized systems. By regarding the finite-sized system as a thermometer used to measure the temperature of the heat reservoir, we show that optimal estimation of temperature yields the corresponding entropy formula for an isolated system. In the single-sample case, optimal estimation of inverse temperature (or temperature) corresponds to the Boltzmann entropy (or Gibbs entropy). These different definitions of entropy, rather than being contradictory, apply to optimal estimation of different parameters. Furthermore, via the Laplace transform, we identify a complementarity between estimation of temperature and system's energy, a concept suggested by Niels Bohr. We also correct the energy-temperature uncertainty relation, as expressed by the Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound, in the large-$N$ limit. In the multiple-sample case, we generalize the definitions of both Boltzmann entropy and Gibbs entropy to achieve optimal estimation of temperature, revealing the tight connection between statistical inference and Terrell Hill's nanothermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Kinetic theory of decentralized learning for smart active matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Smart active matter describes agents which can process information according to their individual policy to solve predefined tasks. We introduce a theoretical framework to study a decentralized learning process in which agents can locally exchange their policy to optimize their reward and thus attain target macroscopic states. We use our formalism to derive explicit hydrodynamic equations for the policy dynamics. We apply the theory to two different microscopic models where policies correspond either to fixed parameters similar to evolutionary dynamics, or to state-dependent controllers known from the field of robotics. We find good agreement between theoretical predictions and agent-based simulations. By deriving fundamental control parameters and uncertainty relations, our work lays the foundations for a statistical physics analysis of decentralized learning.</description>

      <title>Evolved Quantum Boltzmann Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce evolved quantum Boltzmann machines as a variational ansatz for quantum optimization and learning tasks. Given two parameterized Hamiltonians $G(\theta)$ and $H(\phi)$, an evolved quantum Boltzmann machine consists of preparing a thermal state of the first Hamiltonian $G(\theta)$ followed by unitary evolution according to the second Hamiltonian $H(\phi)$. Alternatively, one can think of it as first realizing imaginary time evolution according to $G(\theta)$ followed by real time evolution according to $H(\phi)$. After defining this ansatz, we provide analytical expressions for the gradient vector and illustrate their application in ground-state energy estimation and generative modeling, showing how the gradient for these tasks can be estimated by means of quantum algorithms that involve classical sampling, Hamiltonian simulation, and the Hadamard test. We also establish analytical expressions for the Fisher-Bures, Wigner-Yanase, and Kubo-Mori information matrix elements of evolved quantum Boltzmann machines, as well as quantum algorithms for estimating each of them, which leads to at least three different general natural gradient descent algorithms based on this ansatz. Along the way, we establish a broad generalization of the main result of [Luo, Proc. Am. Math. Soc. 132, 885 (2004)], proving that the Fisher-Bures and Wigner-Yanase information matrices of general parameterized families of states differ by no more than a factor of two in the matrix (Loewner) order, making them essentially interchangeable for training when using natural gradient descent.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Aleppo spin ice geometry, another variation of decimated square ice patterns, which in contrast to similar systems previously studied, does not exhibit vertex frustration. Using synchrotron-based photoemission electron microscopy, we directly visualize low-energy states achieved after thermal annealing, in addition to temperature-dependent moment fluctuations. The results reveal the observation of ground state patterns and the absence of ergodicity-breaking dynamics. Our observations further confirm vertex frustration to be an important criterion for the emergence of ergodicity transitions.</description>

      <title>Exact Decoding of Repetition Code under Circuit Level Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Repetition code forms a fundamental basis for quantum error correction experiments. To date, it stands as the sole code that has achieved large distances and extremely low error rates. Its applications span the spectrum of evaluating hardware limitations, pinpointing hardware defects, and detecting rare events. However, current methods for decoding repetition codes under circuit level noise are suboptimal, leading to inaccurate error correction thresholds and introducing additional errors in event detection. In this work, we establish that repetition code under circuit level noise has an exact solution, and we propose an optimal maximum likelihood decoding algorithm called planar. The algorithm is based on the exact solution of the spin glass partition function on planar graphs and has polynomial computational complexity. Through extensive numerical experiments, we demonstrate that our algorithm uncovers the exact threshold for depolarizing noise and realistic superconductor SI1000 noise. Furthermore, we apply our method to analyze data from recent quantum memory experiments conducted by Google Quantum AI, revealing that part of the error floor was attributed to the decoding algorithm used by Google. Finally, we implemented the repetition code quantum memory on superconducting systems with a 72-qubit quantum chip lacking reset gates, demonstrating that even with an unknown error model, the proposed algorithm achieves a significantly lower logical error rate than the matching-based algorithm.</description>

      <title>Critical properties in the non-Hermitian Aubry-Andre-Stark model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the critical properties of the localization transition in the non-Hermitian Aubry-Andre-Stark (AAS) model with quasiperiodic and Stark potentials, where the non-Hermiticity comes from the nonreciprocal hopping. The localization length, the inverse participation ratio and the energy gap are adopted as the characteristic quantities. We perform the scaling analysis to derive the scaling functions of the three quantities with critical exponents in several critical regions, with respect to the quasiperiodic and Stark potentials and the nonreciprocal strength. We numerically verify the finite-size scaling forms and extract the critical exponents in different situations. Two groups of new critical exponents for the non-Hermitian AAS model and its pure Stark limit are obtained, which are distinct to those for the non-Hermitian Aubry-Andre model and their Hermitian counterparts. Our results indicate that the Hermitian and non-Hermitian AAS, Aubry-Andre, and Stark models belong to different universality classes. We demonstrate that these critical exponents are independent of the nonreciprocal strength, and remain the same in different critical regions and boundary conditions. Furthermore, we establish a hybrid scaling function with a hybrid exponent in the overlap region between the critical regions for the non-Hermitian AAS and Stark models.</description>

      <title>Gapless Symmetry-Protected Topological States in Measurement-Only Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measurement-only quantum circuits offer a versatile platform for realizing intriguing quantum phases of matter. However, gapless symmetry-protected topological (gSPT) states remain insufficiently explored in these settings. In this Letter, we generalize the notion of gSPT to the critical steady state by investigating measurement-only circuits. Using large-scale Clifford circuit simulations, we investigate the steady-state phase diagram across several families of measurement-only circuits that exhibit topological nontrivial edge states at criticality. In the Ising cluster circuits, we uncover a symmetry-enriched non-unitary critical point, termed symmetry-enriched percolation, characterized by both topologically nontrivial edge states and string operator. Additionally, we demonstrate the realization of a steady-state gSPT phase in a $\mathbb Z_4$ circuit model. This phase features topological edge modes and persists within steady-state critical phases under symmetry-preserving perturbations. Furthermore, we provide a unified theoretical framework by mapping the system to the Majorana loop model, offering deeper insights into the underlying mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Shapiro Steps Observed in a Two-Dimensional Yukawa Solid Modulated by a One-Dimensional Vibrational Periodic Substrate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Depinning dynamics of a two-dimensional (2D) solid dusty plasma modulated by a one-dimensional (1D) vibrational periodic substrate are investigated using Langevin dynamical simulations. As the uniform driving force increases gradually, from the overall drift velocity varying with the driving force, four significant Shapiro steps are discovered. The data analysis indicate that, when the ratio of the frequency from the drift motion over potential wells to the external frequency from the modulation substrate is close to integers, dynamic mode locking occurs, corresponding to the discovered Shapiro steps. Around both termini of the first and fourth Shapiro steps, the transitions are found to be always continuous, however, the transition between the second and third Shapiro steps is discontinuous, probably due to the different arrangements of particles.</description>

      <title>Supervised and unsupervised learning the many-body critical phase, phase transitions and critical exponents in disordered quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we begin by questioning the existence of a new kind of nonergodic extended phase, namely, the many-body critical (MBC) phase in finite systems of an interacting quasiperiodic system. We find that this phase can be separately detected from the other phases such as the many-body ergodic (ME) and many-body localized (MBL) phases in the model through supervised neural networks made for both binary and multi-class classification tasks, utilizing, rather un-preprocessed, eigenvalue spacings and eigenvector probability densities as input features. Moreover, the output of our trained neural networks can also indicate the critical points separating ME, MBC and MBL phases, which are consistent with the same obtained from other conventional methods. We also employ unsupervised learning techniques, particularly principal component analysis (PCA) of eigenvector probability densities to investigate how this framework, without any training, captures the, rather unknown, many-body phases (ME, MBL and MBC) and single particle phases (delocalized, localized and critical) of the interacting and non-interacting systems, respectively. Our findings reveal that PCA entropy serves as an effective indicator (order parameter) for detecting phase transitions in the single-particle systems. Moreover, this method proves applicable to many-body systems when the data undergoes a suitable pre-processing. Interestingly, when it comes to extraction of critical (correlation length) exponents through a finite size-scaling, we find that for single-particle systems, scaling collapse of neural network outputs is obtained using components of inverse participation ratio (IPR) as input data. Remarkably, we observe identical critical exponents as obtained from scaling collapse of the IPR directly for different single-particle phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Reversibility and A New Theory of Causal Emergence based on SVD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15054v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The theory of causal emergence (CE) with effective information (EI) posits that complex systems can exhibit CE, where macro-dynamics show stronger causal effects than micro-dynamics. A key challenge of this theory is its dependence on coarse-graining method. In this paper, we introduce a fresh concept of approximate dynamical reversibility and establish a novel framework for CE based on this. By applying singular value decomposition(SVD) to Markov dynamics, we find that the essence of CE lies in the presence of redundancy, represented by the irreversible and correlated information pathways. Therefore, CE can be quantified as the potential maximal efficiency increase for dynamical reversibility or information transmission. We also demonstrate a strong correlation between the approximate dynamical reversibility and EI, establishing an equivalence between the SVD and EI maximization frameworks for quantifying CE, supported by theoretical insights and numerical examples from Boolean networks, cellular automata, and complex networks. Importantly, our SVD-based CE framework is independent of specific coarse-graining techniques and effectively captures the fundamental characteristics of the dynamics.</description>

      <title>Linear differential equation approach to the Loschmidt amplitude</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04921v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Loschmidt echo is a popular quantity that allows making predictions about the stability of quantum states under time evolution. In our work, we present an approach that allows us to find a differential equation that can be used to compute the Loschmidt echo. This approach, while in essence perturbative, has the advantage that it converges at finite order. We demonstrate that the approach for generically chosen matrix Hamiltonians often offers advantages over Taylor and cumulant expansions even when we truncate at finite order. We then apply the approach to two ordinary band Hamiltonians (multi-Weyl semimetals and AB bilayer graphene) to obtain the Loschmidt echo after a quench for an arbitrary starting state and find that the results readily generalize to find transmission amplitudes and specific contributions to the partition function, too. We then test our methods on many body spin and fermionic Hamiltonians and find that while the approach still offers advantages, more care has to be taken than in a generic case.</description>

      <title>Two transitions in complex eigenvalue statistics: Hermiticity and integrability breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10625v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Open quantum systems have complex energy eigenvalues which are expected to follow non-Hermitian random matrix statistics when chaotic, or 2-dimensional (2d) Poisson statistics when integrable. We investigate the spectral properties of a many-body quantum spin chain, the Hermitian XXZ Heisenberg model with imaginary disorder. Its rich complex eigenvalue statistics is found to separately break both Hermiticity and integrability at different scales of the disorder strength. With no disorder, the system is integrable and Hermitian, with spectral statistics corresponding to the 1d Poisson point process. At very small disorder, we find a transition from 1d Poisson statistics to an effective $D$-dimensional Poisson point process, showing Hermiticity breaking. At intermediate disorder we find integrability breaking, as inferred from the statistics matching that of non-Hermitian complex symmetric random matrices in class AI$^\dag$. For large disorder, as the spins align, we recover the expected integrability (now in the non-Hermitian setup), indicated by 2d Poisson statistics. These conclusions are based on fitting the spin chain data of numerically generated nearest and next-to-nearest neighbour spacing distributions to an effective 2d Coulomb gas description at inverse temperature $\beta$. We confirm such an effective description of random matrices also applies in class AI$^\dag$ and AII$^\dag$ up to next-to-nearest neighbour spacings.</description>

      <title>Spin-$S$ Ising Models with Multi-Spin Interactions on the One-Dimensional Chain and Two-Dimensional Square Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14360v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study spin-$S$ Ising models with $p$-spin interactions on the one-dimensional chain and the two-dimensional square lattice. Here, $S$ denotes the magnitude of the spin and $p$ represents the number of spins involved in each interaction. The analysis is performed for $S=1/2,1,3/2,2$ and $p=3,4,5$. For the one-dimensional model, we formulate transfer matrices, and numerically diagonalize them to analyze the temperature dependence of the free energy and spin-spin correlations. In the case of $S=1/2$, the free energy does not depend on $p$, and the spin-spin correlations are uniformly enhanced across all temperature scales as $p$ increases. In contrast, for $S \geq 1$, the free energy varies with $p$, and the spin-spin correlations are significantly enhanced at lower temperatures as $p$ increases. For the two-dimensional model, by using multicanonical simulations, we analyze physical quantities such as an order parameter, internal energy, and specific heat. In addition, we define and examine an order parameter to distinguish ordered and disordered phases. It is found that a first-order phase transition occurs at finite temperatures for all $S$ and $p\geq3$, and increasing $p$ strengthens its nature. We present $S$ and $p$ dependence of the transition temperature and latent heat, and discuss effects of higher-order interactions on the nature of phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Violation of Ferromagnetic Ordering of Energy Levels in Spin Rings for the Singlet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.12773v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a violation of the ``ferromagnetic ordering of energy levels'' conjecture (FOEL) for even length spin rings. The FOEL conjecture was a guess made by Nachtergaele, Spitzer and an author for the Heisenberg model on certain graphs: a family of inequalities, the first of which is the statement that the spectral gap of the Heisenberg model equals the gap of the random walk. That first guess was originally a conjecture of Aldous which was later proved by Caputo, Liggett and Richthammer. We claim that for spin rings of even length $L&gt;4$, the lowest spin $S=0$ energy is lower than the lowest spin $S=1$ energy. This violates the $(L/2)$-th inequality in the FOEL conjecture.
  Our methodology is largely numerical: we have applied exact diagonalization up to $L=20$. We also rigorously consider the Hamiltonian of the Heisenberg spin ring for even length $L$ projected to the spin $S=0$ sector. We prove that it has a unique ground state. Then, using the single mode approximation the uniqueness explains the energy turn-around. Important insight comes from reconsideration of previous work by Sutherland, using the Bethe ansatz. Especially important is a work of Dhar and Shastry that goes beyond the Bethe ansatz.</description>

Abstract: By the mechanical pressure we mean that the pressure in the fundamental thermodynamic equation with the naive form of the electromagnetic work used, while the thermodynamic one we mean that in the equation with proper thermodynamic form of the electromagnetic work instead. Both pressures differ from a magnetic mutual field pressure which results from the electromagnetic stress tensor for the linear and uniform media in static electromagnetic field. Both pressures are in essence tensors, but a quasi-scalar theory is sufficient for the simple media.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04836v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Open many-body quantum systems can exhibit intriguing nonequilibrium phases of matter, such as time crystals. In these phases, the state of the system spontaneously breaks the time-translation symmetry of the dynamical generator, which typically manifests through persistent oscillations of an order parameter. A paradigmatic model displaying such a symmetry breaking is the boundary time crystal, which has been extensively analyzed experimentally and theoretically. Despite the broad interest in these nonequilibrium phases, their thermodynamics and their fluctuating behavior remain largely unexplored, in particular for the case of coupled time crystals. In this work, we consider two interacting boundary time crystals and derive a consistent interpretation of their thermodynamic behavior. We fully characterize their average dynamics and the behavior of their quantum fluctuations, which allows us to demonstrate the presence of quantum and classical correlations in both the stationary and the time-crystal phases displayed by the system. We furthermore exploit our theoretical derivation to explore possible applications of time crystals as quantum batteries, demonstrating their ability to efficiently store energy.</description>

      <title>Strong and weak symmetries and their spontaneous symmetry breaking in mixed states emerging from the quantum Ising model under multiple decoherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12738v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Discovering and categorizing quantum orders in mixed many-body systems are currently one of the most important problems. Specific types of decoherence applied to typical quantum many-body states can induce a novel kind of mixed state accompanying characteristic symmetry orders, which has no counterparts in pure many-body states. We study phenomena generated by interplay between two types of decoherence applied to the one-dimensional transverse field Ising model (TFIM). We show that in the doubled Hilbert space formalism, the decoherence can be described by filtering operation applied to matrix product states (MPS) defined in the doubled Hilbert system. The filtering operation induces specific deformation of the MPS, which approximates the ground state of a certain parent Hamiltonian in the doubled Hilbert space. In the present case, such a parent Hamiltonian is the quantum Ashkin-Teller model, having a rich phase diagram with a critical lines and quantum phase transitions. By investigating the deformed MPS, we find various types of mixed states emergent from the ground states of the TFIM, and clarify phase transitions between them. In that study, strong and weak $Z_2$ symmetries play an important role, for which we introduce efficient order parameters, such as R\'{e}nyi-2 correlators, entanglement entropy, etc., in the doubled Hilbert space.</description>

      <title>Quantum many-body dynamics for fermionic t-J model simulated with atom arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00552v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The fermionic t-J model has been widely recognized as a canonical model in understanding various strongly correlated phases like cuprate high-Tc superconductivity. Simulating this model with controllable quantum platforms offers new possibilities to probe high-Tc physics, yet suffering challenges. Here we propose a novel scheme to realize the t-J model in a programmable Rydberg-dressed tweezer array. By properly engineering the Rydberg-dressed dipole-dipole interaction and inter-tweezer couplings, a highly tunable fermionic t-J model with next-nearest-neighbour hopping terms is achieved. We particularly explore quantum many-body dynamics in the large J/t limit, a regime far beyond the conventional optical lattices and cuprates. Notably, we predict a nontrivial self-pinning effect enforced by local quantum entanglement that characterizes a novel type of Hilbert space fragmentation. This effect leads to the breakdown of Krylov restricted thermalization. Our prediction opens a new horizon in exploring exotic quantum many-body dynamics with t-J model in tweezer arrays, and shall also make a step towards simulating the high-Tc physics in cold atom systems.</description>
