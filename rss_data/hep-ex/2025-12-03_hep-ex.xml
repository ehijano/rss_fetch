      <title>Rare Event Searches Using Cryogenic Detectors via Direct Detection Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cryogenic detectors are at the forefront of rare-event search experiments, including direct detection of dark matter, coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering, neutrinoless double-beta decay, and searches for fractionally charged particles. Their unique ability to achieve ultra-low energy thresholds, typically O(eV-100 eV), together with excellent energy resolution and effective background suppression, makes them sensitive to extremely faint signals from rare interactions. These rare particle interactions produce phonons, ionization, or scintillation, depending on the target medium, which are registered by specialized sensors and converted into measurable signals. This review summarizes the underlying detection principles, surveys major experiments and recent results, examines forthcoming initiatives, and outlines the evolving role of cryogenic detectors in advancing the frontiers of rare-event physics.</description>

      <title>A novel design of general-purpose spectrometer with nucleon polarimeter function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spin polarization of hadrons is a key observable for probing the details of particle and nuclear interactions, offering information not available from other measurements. Currently, general-purpose spectrometers lack the capability to access final-state polarization. A novel technique to measure nucleon polarization within such a spectrometer has been proposed. Using this technique, a new design based on the proposed hyperon-nucleon spectrometer is developed. Systematic optimization confirms that the nucleon polarimeter functions effectively without impairing the detector's conventional performance. This successful integration, the first attempt of the general-purpose spectrometer, sets a valuable benchmark for future experiments. Ultimately, correlating spin polarization with four-momentum data will lead to a more profound understanding of the underlying physics.</description>

      <title>Is the large uncertainty of $\delta_{CP}$ fundamentally encoded in the neutrino quantum state?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20148v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The precise measurement of the leptonic CP-violating phase $\delta_{CP}$ remains one of the major open challenges in neutrino physics, as current experiments achieve only very limited accuracy. We address this issue through the lens of quantum estimation theory. A distinctive feature of neutrino oscillation experiments is that they cannot freely optimize the probe or measurement, since both are constrained by the production and detection of flavor eigenstates. We therefore examine whether the large uncertainty in $\delta_{CP}$ originates from intrinsic reasons, either of the neutrino quantum state or of flavor measurements, or if it instead stems from experimental limitations. By comparing quantum and classical Fisher information, we demonstrate that the limited sensitivity to $\delta_{CP}$ originates primarily from the information content of flavor measurements. Furthermore, we show that targeting the second oscillation maximum, as in the ESS$\nu$SB proposal, substantially enhances $\delta_{CP}$ information compared to experiments centered on the first maximum.</description>

      <title>hls4ml: A Flexible, Open-Source Platform for Deep Learning Acceleration on Reconfigurable Hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present hls4ml, a free and open-source platform that translates machine learning (ML) models from modern deep learning frameworks into high-level synthesis (HLS) code that can be integrated into full designs for field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) or application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). With its flexible and modular design, hls4ml supports a large number of deep learning frameworks and can target HLS compilers from several vendors, including Vitis HLS, Intel oneAPI and Catapult HLS. Together with a wider eco-system for software-hardware co-design, hls4ml has enabled the acceleration of ML inference in a wide range of commercial and scientific applications where low latency, resource usage, and power consumption are critical. In this paper, we describe the structure and functionality of the hls4ml platform. The overarching design considerations for the generated HLS code are discussed, together with selected performance results.</description>

      <title>Momentum entanglement at colliders: the $H \to WW,ZZ$ case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address momentum entanglement in Higgs decays to weak boson pairs, $H \to WW,ZZ$, by discretising momentum space. The momenta of the two weak bosons are entangled, as well as the degrees of freedom in momentum and spin spaces. For $H \to ZZ$ in the four-lepton final state, we also estimate the statistical sensitivity of entanglement measures at the Large Hadron Collider and future upgrades. The discretisation method introduced here is broadly applicable, offering a framework for studies of momentum entanglement at the energy frontier.</description>

      <title>Muon magnetic anomaly: experimental status and prospects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.02209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The past five years have brought significant new results on the muon magnetic anomaly, $a_\mu = (g_\mu - 2)/2$, and on the hadronic vacuum polarization (HVP) contribution dominating the uncertainty $\Delta a_\mu$. Serious tension has emerged between the experimental and standard model(SM) values for $a_\mu$, as well as between the SM and the first precise lattice QCD values. We review the current experimental and theoretical status of $a_\mu$, along with the prospects for new results,focusing on MUonE,a new experiment at CERN, aiming to evaluate the leading order contribution to a(HVP) in a direct measurement of muonic Bhabha scattering.</description>

      <title>Impact of Higgs-boson measurements on SMEFT fits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present current bounds on SMEFT operators that are mainly constrained by Higgs-boson observables, under different assumptions for the flavour structure of the UV theory. We investigate how the accuracy reached through a dedicated Higgs-boson precision physics program is starting to have a major impact in setting a lower bound on the scale of new physics, and we discuss the relevance of considering the scale evolution of the SMEFT coefficients in this context. We compare our results with the literature, pointing out the consistency of the results in spite of the different assumptions adopted in each analysis, and we discuss future steps aimed at improving the accuracy of the fit.</description>

      <title>Relativistic correction to the binding energies of two-body hadronic molecular states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents a systematic estimation of the relativistic correction to the binding energies of two-body hadronic molecular states by comparing the numerical solutions of the three-dimensional (3D) Schr{\"o}dinger, 3D Salpeter, and fully relativistic four-dimensional (4D) Bethe-Salpeter (BS) equations derived from the same underlying interaction. The numerical results reveal a counter-intuitive property: for hadronic molecular states whose binding energies are in the MeV range, the relativistic correction is unexpectedly large. This finding contradicts the conventional expectation that a heavier exchanged mass in the interaction implies suppressed relativistic effects. Specifically, we first benchmark the results using the Wick-Cutkosky model with a one-boson-exchange (OBE) interaction of mass $m_{ex}$, and then extend the analysis to the physical $D\bar{D}$ system. We find within the $1\sim 50$ MeV binding energy region, the relativistic correction is substantial, amounting to $-90\% \sim -70\%$ of the non-relativistic result. Such a significant correction strongly suggests that analyses based solely on the 3D Schr{\"o}dinger or 3D Salpeter equations for hadronic molecular states should be treated with caution.</description>

      <title>Probing fully coherent radiation and parton densities using (virtual) photons at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Prompt photon production in pA collisions has long been suggested as a sensitive probe of the nuclear parton distribution functions (nPDFs). In this study, we present recent results on another cold nuclear matter effect, namely fully coherent radiation induced by parton multiple scattering, which may influence the nuclear dependence of prompt photon production. Medium-induced radiation effects, implemented in leading-order direct and fragmentation photon processes, are computed for pPb collisions at the LHC. At backward rapidity, photons are sensitive to fully coherent energy loss (FCEL), while at forward rapidity, fully coherent energy gain (FCEG) plays a crucial role due to the dominance of the $qg \to q\gamma$ scattering channel. In contrast, for virtual photon production, the impact of fully coherent radiation is marginal, making Drell-Yan (DY) one of the best ways to probe nuclear PDFs. The power of the DY process is demonstrated by reweighting nPDF sets at next-to-leading order using realistic pseudo-data for LHC Run 3.</description>

      <title>Chen Ning Yang Retrospective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chen-Ning Yang made important contributions to the theory of solvable models in statistical mechanics, including generalizations of the Bethe Ansatz, magnetization in the Ising model, the Lee-Yang circle theorem, and the Yang-Baxter equation. Most famously, Yang made transformative contributions to the current Standard Model of elementary particle interactions. The proposal of Yang and T. D. Lee, that left-right symetry (parity) is violated in weak particle decays, established that the primary currents involved in weak interactions are left handed. The work of Yang and R. L. Mills gave a framework for force carriers coupling to these currents that are non-Abelian generalizations of the electromagnetic photon, which unlike the electrically neutral photon, carry ``charges'' to which they self-couple . Two decades of work by others on quantization and mass-generation mechanisms then culminated in the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Position-Sensitive Silicon Photomultiplier Array with Enhanced Position Reconstruction by means of a Deep Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single-photon sensitive detectors like Silicon Photomultipliers are widely used in many medical imaging applications. By using detectors with position resolutions, it is possible to build compact photodetector readouts with reduced number of channels, but still preserving position resolution and gamma-rays imaging capabilities. In this work, we present the advantage of using a Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) light position reconstruction applied to a 2x2 array of linearly-graded SiPMs (LG-SiPMs), to minimize the distortions on the reconstructed event maps. Our approach significantly enhances both the resolution and linearity of position detection compared to the nominal reconstruction formula based on the device architecture. Remarkably, the DNN-based reconstruction boosts the number of resolved areas (pixels) by a factor of at least 5.7, allowing a higher level of precision and performance in light detection.</description>

      <title>Evidence of Spin-Interference Effects in Exclusive $J/\psi \to e^+e^-$ Photoproduction in Ultraperipheral Heavy-Ion Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the first evidence of spin interference in exclusive $J/\psi \to e^+e^-$ photoproduction in ultraperipheral Au+Au and isobar (Ru+Ru, Zr+Zr) collisions ($\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200$~GeV) at STAR. A negative $\cos(2\phi)$ modulation is observed for $p_T &lt; 100$ MeV/$c$, opposite in sign to that in $\rho^{0}\!\to\!\pi^+\pi^-$ photoproduction. This establishes for the first time that the interference sign is controlled by the spin structure of the final-state daughters, resolving the ambiguity present in the all-boson $\rho^0$ channel. The compact $J/\psi$ probes gluon distributions at perturbative scales, resulting in a weaker modulation and providing stringent constraints on Color Glass Condensate calculations. These findings demonstrate that spin-dependent interference in heavy vector mesons provides a new, experimentally accessible handle on gluon structure beyond traditional cross-section measurements.</description>

      <title>IOTA Experiment for Proton Pulse Compression at Extreme Space-Charge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The longitudinal compression of high-intensity, space-charge-dominated proton bunches is a critical requirement for future proton-driven muon colliders. We propose a proton bunch compression experiment at the Integrable Optics Test Accelerator (IOTA) storage ring at Fermilab to investigate optimal radio-frequency (RF) cavity parameters and lattice configurations. IOTA is a compact, fixed-energy storage ring dedicated to beam physics Research and Development and capable of circulating a 2.5 MeV proton beam under extreme space-charge conditions. Using the ImpactX code with its 3D space-charge solver, simulations indicate that the bunch length can be rapidly reduced by at least a factor of two without appreciable degradation of transverse beam quality--even in the strong space-charge regime. However, longitudinal defocusing due to the space-charge remains a significant challenge in short-pulsed intense proton bunches, and the optimization of compression under these conditions is discussed.</description>

Abstract: Anomaly detection - identifying deviations from Standard Model predictions - is a key challenge at the Large Hadron Collider due to the size and complexity of its datasets. This is typically addressed by transforming high-dimensional detector data into lower-dimensional, physically meaningful features. We tackle feature extraction for anomaly detection by learning powerful low-dimensional representations via contrastive neural embeddings. This approach preserves potential anomalies indicative of new physics and enables rare signal extraction using novel machine learning-based statistical methods for signal-independent hypothesis testing. We compare supervised and self-supervised contrastive learning methods, for both MLP- and Transformer-based neural embeddings, trained on the kinematic observables of physics objects in LHC collision events. The learned embeddings serve as input representations for signal-agnostic statistical detection methods in inclusive final states. We achieve significant improvement in discovery power for both rare new physics signals and rare Standard Model processes across diverse final states, demonstrating its applicability for efficiently searching for diverse signals simultaneously. We study the impact of architectural choices, contrastive loss formulations, supervision levels, and embedding dimensionality on anomaly detection performance. We show that the optimal representation for background classification does not always maximize sensitivity to new physics signals, revealing an inherent trade-off between background structure preservation and anomaly enhancement. We demonstrate that combining compression with domain knowledge for label encoding produces the most effective data representation for statistical discovery of anomalies.</description>

      <title>Julia in HEP</title>

Abstract: Julia is a mature general-purpose programming language, with a large ecosystem of libraries and more than 12000 third-party packages, which specifically targets scientific computing. As a language, Julia is as dynamic, interactive, and accessible as Python with NumPy, but achieves run-time performance on par with C/C++. In this paper, we describe the state of adoption of Julia in HEP, where momentum has been gathering over a number of years.
  HEP-oriented Julia packages can already, via UnROOT.jl, read HEP's major file formats, including TTree and RNTuple. Interfaces to some of HEP's major software packages, such as through Geant4.jl, are available too. Jet reconstruction algorithms in Julia show excellent performance. A number of full HEP analyses have been performed in Julia.
  We show how, as the support for HEP has matured, developments have benefited from Julia's core design choices, which makes reuse from and integration with other packages easy. In particular, libraries developed outside HEP for plotting, statistics, fitting, and scientific machine learning are extremely useful.
  We believe that the powerful combination of flexibility and speed, the wide selection of scientific programming tools, and support for all modern programming paradigms and tools, make Julia the ideal choice for a future language in HEP.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Data Generation with Lorenzetti for Time Series Anomaly Detection in High-Energy Physics Calorimeters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07451v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Anomaly detection in multivariate time series is crucial to ensure the quality of data coming from a physics experiment. Accurately identifying the moments when unexpected errors or defects occur is essential, yet challenging due to scarce labels, unknown anomaly types, and complex correlations across dimensions. To address the scarcity and unreliability of labelled data, we use the Lorenzetti Simulator to generate synthetic events with injected calorimeter anomalies. We then assess the sensitivity of several time series anomaly detection methods, including transformer-based and other deep learning models. The approach employed here is generic and applicable to different detector designs and defects.</description>

      <title>Global analysis of $\mu \to e$ interactions in the SMEFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13497v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study current experimental bounds on charged lepton flavor violating (CLFV) $\mu$-$e$ interactions in the model-independent framework of the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Assuming a generic flavor structure in the quark sector, we consider the contributions of CLFV operators to low-energy observables, including $\mu\to e\gamma$ and $\mu\to e$ conversion for quark-flavor conserving operators and CLFV meson decays for quark-flavor violating operators. At high energy, we consider limits on CLFV decays of the Higgs and Z bosons and of the top quark, and obtain bounds on operators with light quarks by recasting searches for production of $e\mu$ pairs in $pp$ collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). We connect observables at low- and high-energy by taking into account renormalization group running and matching between CLFV operators. We also discuss the sensitivity of the future Electron-Ion Collider, where the prospective bounds are derived by imposing simple cuts on final state particles. We find that, in a single operator scenario, bounds on purely leptonic operators are dominated by $\mu \rightarrow e \gamma$ and $\mu \rightarrow e$ conversion. Semileptonic operators with down-type quarks are also dominantly constrained by low-energy observables, while LHC searches lead the bounds on up-type quark-flavor violating operators. Taking simplified multiple-coupling scenarios, we show that it is easy to evade the strongest low-energy bounds from spin-independent $\mu \rightarrow e$ conversion, and that collider searches are competitive and complementary to constraints from spin-dependent $\mu \rightarrow e$ conversion and other low-energy probes.</description>

      <title>Increasing Information Extraction in Low-Signal Regimes via Multiple Instance Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07114v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a new information-theoretic perspective on Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) for parameter estimation with i.i.d. data, and show that MIL can outperform single-instance learners in low-signal regimes. Prior work [Nachman and Thaler, 2021] argued that single-instance methods are often sufficient, but this conclusion presumes enough single-instance signal to train near-optimal classifiers. We demonstrate that even state-of-the-art single-instance models can fail to reach optimal classifier performance in challenging low-signal regimes, whereas MIL can mitigate this sub-optimality. As a concrete application, we constrain Wilson coefficients of the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) using kinematic information from subatomic particle collision events at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). In experiments, we observe that under specific modeling and weak signal conditions, pooling instances can increase the effective Fisher information compared to single-instance approaches.</description>

      <title>Event Generator Tuning as a Robustness Test</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22526v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutrino oscillation experiments use Monte Carlo event generators to predict neutrino-nucleus interactions. Cross section uncertainties are typically implemented by varying the parameters of the model(s) used in the generator. We study the performance of two commonly-used model configurations of the GENIE generator (G18_10a_02_11a and AR23_0i_00_000) and their uncertainties by tuning parameters to cross section data, and then comparing the resulting tuned prediction to a suite of other measurements from T2K, MicroBooNE, and MINERvA. This reveals whether the model can simultaneously describe several datasets, as well as whether the uncertainties are adequately robust. We find that G18 and especially AR23 are reasonable in predicting lower-energy measurements from T2K and MicroBooNE, but unable to describe MINERvA data, and discuss the implications for short-baseline oscillation searches. We attempt to replicate a tuning procedure developed by MicroBooNE using several different measurements, and find substantially different results depending on which measurement is used, and that the MicroBooNE tune does not agree with other measurements. We conclude that the SBN experiment should not tune its generator to external data.</description>

      <title>Background Suppression in Quantum Sensing of Dark Matter via $W$ State Projection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01816v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that measuring dark matter signal by projecting quantum sensors in the collective excited state can highly suppress the non-collective noise background, hence improving the sensitivity significantly. We trace the evolution of the sensors' state in the presence of both dark matter effect and sensors' decoherence effects, optimizing the protocol execution time, and show that the suppression of background by a factor equal to the number of sensors is possible. This method does not require the entanglement of sensors during the signal accumulation time, hence circumventing the difficulty of maintaining the lifetime of the entangled state that is present in other enhancement proposals. This protocol is also general regarding the type of qubit sensors.</description>

      <title>Two Shades of Quark Color: Parallel Canons across the Cold War Divide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23909v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The introduction of the color quantum number is conventionally narrated as a linear progression from the quark-model statistics paradox to quantum chromodynamics (QCD). This paper challenges that teleology by arguing that "color" emerged as two conceptually distinct constructs during the Cold War. The first, originating with Han and Nambu and culminating in QCD, conceived of color as a local gauge charge, the source of a fundamental force mediated by gluons. The second, developed at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) in Dubna, treated color as a hidden, three-valued label--a statistical and structural property within a composite, S-matrix-inflected hadron model. We trace these parallel narratives, linking the Dubna approach to a holist epistemology that prioritizes observable amplitudes and global constraints, and the QCD approach to a reductionist program grounded in micro-dynamics. A case study of Fermilab's E-36 experimental chain (1970--78) shows how an observables-first design-tuned to S-matrix and Regge constraints on forward elastic scattering--performed robustly within its natural domain but was ultimately discontinued amid declining theoretical interest and involvement. The subsequent hegemony of QCD retroactively projected its gauge-theoretic conception of color onto history, erasing this epistemic diversity. We conclude that the marginalization of Dubna's structural color was not merely a political outcome of the Cold War but a result of deep ontological and philosophical divergences, advocating for a domain-sensitive pluralism in the historiography of particle physics.</description>

      <title>The Intrinsic Dimension of Collider Events and Model-Independent Searches in 100 Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20760v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The phase space of hadron collider events spans hundreds of dimensions, generating an intricate geometry that we are just starting to explore. The number of possible new physics signals is exponential in the number of dimensions and detecting all of them is currently impossible for any human or artificial intelligence. In this work we introduce a method to search for new physics model-independently in this high-dimensional space. It is based on the measurement of the most basic property of the manifold of collider events, its dimensionality. Our proposed technique does not suffer from a look-elsewhere effect that grows exponentially with the number of dimensions of the dataset, and by construction is insensitive to energy scale uncertainties. We illustrate its potential by finding new physics in simulated events with hundreds of phase space dimensions, taking as input single particles rather than jets. This study sets the stage for new model-independent search strategies based on global properties of collider data manifolds.</description>
