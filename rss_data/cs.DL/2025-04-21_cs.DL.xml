      <title>Bibliometric Analysis of Scientific Publications on Blockchain Research and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the introduction of Bitcoin in 2008, blockchain technology has garnered widespread attention. Scholars from various research fields, countries, and institutions have published a significant number of papers on this subject. However, there is currently a lack of comprehensive analysis specifically focusing on the scientific publications in the field of blockchain.
  To conduct a comprehensive analysis, we compiled a corpus of 41,497 publications in blockchain research from 2008 to 2023 using the Clarivate databases. Through bibliometric and citation analyses, we gained valuable insights into the field. Our study offers an overview of the blockchain research landscape, including country, institution, authorship, and subject categories. Additionally, we identified Emerging Research Areas (ERA) using the co-citation clustering approach, examining factors such as recency, growth, and contributions from different countries/regions. Furthermore, we identified influential publications based on citation velocity and analyzed five representative Research Fronts in detail. This analysis provides a fine-grained examination of specific areas within blockchain research. Our findings contribute to understanding evolving trends, emerging applications, and potential directions for future research in the multidisciplinary field of blockchain.</description>

      <title>Design Priorities in Digital Gateways: A Comparative Study of Authentication and Usability in Academic Library Alliances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Purpose: This study examines the design and functionality of university library login pages across academic alliances (IVY Plus, BTAA, JULAC, JVU) to identify how these interfaces align with institutional priorities and user needs. It explores consensus features, design variations, and emerging trends in authentication, usability, and security.
  Methodology: A multi-method approach was employed: screenshots and HTML files from 46 institutions were analyzed through categorization, statistical analysis, and comparative evaluation. Features were grouped into authentication mechanisms, usability, security/compliance, and library-specific elements.
  Findings: Core functionalities (e.g., ID/password, privacy policies) were consistent across alliances. Divergences emerged in feature emphasis: mature alliances (e.g., BTAA) prioritized resource accessibility with streamlined interfaces, while emerging consortia (e.g., JVU) emphasized cybersecurity (IP restrictions, third-party integrations). Usability features, particularly multilingual support, drove cross-alliance differences. The results highlighted regional and institutional influences, with older alliances favoring simplicity and newer ones adopting security-centric designs.
  Originality/Value: This is the first systematic comparison of login page designs across academic alliances, offering insights into how regional, technological, and institutional factors shape digital resource access. Findings inform best practices for balancing security, usability, and accessibility in library interfaces. **Keywords**: Academic library consortia, Login page design, User authentication, User experience, Security compliance.</description>
