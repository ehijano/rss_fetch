      <title>Cubic Oscillator: Geometric Approach and Zeros of Eigenfunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we give a geometric approach to the cubic oscillator with three distinct turning points based on the $\mathcal{D\diagup SG}$\emph{\ correspondence }introduced in \cite{Thabet+al}. The existence of quantization conditions, depending on extra data for the potential, is related to some particular critical graphs of the quadratic differential $\lambda ^{2}\left(z-a\right) \left( z^{2}-1\right) dz^{2}$ where $\lambda$ is a non vanishing complex number, $a\in \mathbb{C}\diagdown \left\{ -1,1\right\}$. We investigate this geometric approach in two level: the first level is studying an inverse spectral problem related to cubic oscillator. The second level describes the zeros locations of eigenfunctions related to this oscillator. Our results may provide a geometric proof of some questions related to cubic potential case.</description>

      <title>A complex Lie algebra of rotationally symmetric operators and their harmonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe the solutions to a family of rotationally symmetric second order partial differential equations in the complex plane that arises from a four-dimensional complex Lie algebra whose spanning set generates the algebra from which such generalised harmonic functions derive. We show that every one of these solutions have a canonical series representation and retrieve those obtained in the case of Laplace and Helmholtz equation. These sums are given in confluent hypergeometric terms that asymptotically correspond to the complex exponential function.</description>

      <title>Generalized mKdV Equation and Genus Two Jacobi Type Hyperelliptic Differential Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalized the mKdV equation in order that the static equations include ${\rm sn}$ differential equation. As a result, a good correspondence was obtained between the KdV equation and the mKdV equation.For general genus two hyperelliptic curves, we obtained differential equations for Weierstrass type and Jacobi type hyperelliptic functions. Considering the special case of $\lambda_6=0, \lambda_0=0$, Weierstrass type and Jacobi type hyperelliptic functions are different solutions to the same hyperelliptic differential equations. Then these solutions are connected by the special ${\rm Sp(4, {\bf R})}$ Lie group transformation.</description>

      <title>Signal recovery using Gabor frames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel probabilistic framework for the recovery of discrete signals with missing data, extending classical Fourier-based methods. While prior results, such as those of Donoho and Stark; see also Logan's method, guarantee exact recovery under strict deterministic sparsity constraints, they do not account for stochastic patterns of data loss. Our approach combines a row-wise Gabor transform with a probabilistic model for missing frequencies, establishing near-certain recovery when losses occur randomly.
  The key innovation is a maximal row-support criterion that allows unique reconstruction with high probability, even when the overall signal support significantly exceeds classical bounds. Specifically, we show that if missing frequencies are independently distributed according to a binomial law, the probability of exact recovery converges to $1$ as the signal size grows. This provides, to our knowledge, the first rigorous probabilistic recovery guarantee exploiting row-wise signal structure.
  Our framework offers new insights into the interplay between sparsity, transform structure, and stochastic loss, with immediate implications for communications, imaging, and data compression. It also opens avenues for future research, including extensions to higher-dimensional signals, adaptive transforms, and more general probabilistic loss models, potentially enabling even more robust recovery guarantees.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, an approach to the one sided maximal function in the spirit of the Christ-Fefferman proof for the strong type weighted estimates of the maximal function is provided. As applications of that approach, we provide an alternative proof of the sharp weighted estimate for the one sided maximal function that was settled by one of us and de la Torre, a one sided two weight bumps counterpart of a result of P\'erez and Rela, and also one sided counterparts of some very recent mixed weak type results due to Sweeting.</description>

      <title>The discontinuous limit case of an archetypal oscillator with constant excitation and van der Pol damping: A single equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the global dynamics of the discontinuous limit case of an archetypal oscillator with constant excitation that exhibits a single equilibrium. For parameter regions in which this oscillator possesses two or three equilibria, the global bifurcation diagram and the corresponding phase portraits on the Poincare disc have been presented in [Phys. D, 438 (2022) 133362]. The present work completes the global structure of the discontinuous limit case of an archetypal oscillator with constant excitation. Although the dynamical phenomena are less rich compared to systems with more than one equilibrium, the presence of a single equilibrium gives rise to additional limit cycles surrounding it, thereby enriching the overall dynamics and making the analysis substantially more intricate than in the previously studied cases.</description>

      <title>H\"{o}lder classifications of finite-dimensional linear flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02001v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two flows on a finite-dimensional normed space $X$ are equivalent if some homeomorphism $h$ of $X$ preserves all orbits, i.e., $h$ maps each orbit onto an orbit. Under the assumption that $h$, $h^{-1}$ both are $\beta$-H\"{o}lder continuous near the origin for some (or all) $0&lt;\beta&lt; 1$, a complete classification with respect to some-H\"{o}lder (or all-H\"{o}lder) equivalence is established for linear flows on $X$, in terms of basic linear algebra properties of their generators. Consistently utilizing equivalence instead of the more restrictive conjugacy, the classification theorems extend and unify known results. Though entirely elementary, the analysis is somewhat intricate and highlights, more clearly than does the existing literature, the fundamental roles played by linearity and the finite-dimensionality of $X$.</description>

      <title>Kneading the Lorenz attractor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Lorenz map $f:[0,1]\to[0,1]$ is a piecewise continuous map, modeled after an idealized version of the Lorenz attractor. In this paper we settle the following question - how much of the dynamics of the Lorenz attractor can be modeled by such one-dimensional model? In this paper we will prove there exist open regions in the parameter space of the Lorenz system where one can canonically reduce the dynamics of the Lorenz attractor into those of a symmetric Lorenz map $F_\beta$ with a constant slope $\beta\in(1,2]$. As we will show, not only the map $F_\beta$ encodes many of the essential features of the Lorenz attractor, it also governs many of its bifurcations. As such, our results correlate closely with the results of numerical studies, and possibly explain the bifurcation phenomena observed in the Lorenz attractor.</description>

      <title>Schatten properties of commutators of fractional integrals on spaces of homogeneous type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extending classical results of Janson and Peetre (1988) on the Schatten class $S^p$ membership of commutators of Riesz potentials on the Euclidean space, we obtain analogous results for commutators $[b,T]$, where $T\in\{T_\varepsilon,\widetilde T_\alpha\}$ belongs to either one of two natural classes of fractional integral operators on a space of homogeneous type. Our approach is based on recent related work of Hyt\"{o}nen and Korte on singular (instead of fractional) integrals; working directly with the kernels, it differs from the Fourier analytic considerations of Janson and Peetre, covering new operators even when specialised to $\mathbb R^d$.
  The cleanest case of our characterization in spaces of lower dimension $d&gt; 2$ and satisfying a $(1,2)$-Poincar\'e inequality is as follows. For a parameter $\varepsilon \in (0,\frac{1}{2}-\frac{1}{d})$ describing the order of the fractional integral $T_\varepsilon $, we have a dichotomy: If $\frac{d}{1+d\varepsilon }&lt;p&lt;\frac{1}{\varepsilon}$, then $[b,T_{\varepsilon}]\in S^p$ if and only if $b$ belongs to a suitable Besov (or fractional Sobolev) space. If $0&lt;p\leq \frac{d}{1+d\varepsilon }$, then $[b,T_{\varepsilon}]\in S^p$ if and only if $b$ is constant. This is analogous to the result for singular integrals, where a similar cut-off happens at $p=d$, formally corresponding to fractional order $\varepsilon =0$. We also obtain results for other parameter values, including dimensions $0&lt;d\leq 2$.
  As an application, these results are used to show Schatten properties of commutators of fractional Bessel operators, complementing recent related results of Fan, Lacey, Li, and Xiong (2025) on commutators of singular integrals in the Bessel setting.</description>

Abstract: We provide a new proof of ``most" cases of the polynomial Wiener-Wintner theorem for $\sigma$-finite spaces, using hard-analytic methods. Specifically, we prove that whenever $(X,\mu,T)$ is a $\sigma$-finite measure-preserving system, and $f \in L^p(X), \ 1 \leq p &lt; \infty$, there exists a co-null set $X_f \subset X$ so that for all $\omega \in X_f$ \[ \frac{1}{N} \sum_{n \leq N} e^{2 \pi i P(n)} f(T^n \omega) \] converges for all polynomials $P$ which are either linear, or vanish to degree $2$ at the origin.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of scalar functions and vector fields from weighted V-line transforms with swinging branches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00922v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Weighted V-line transforms map a symmetric tensor field of order $m\ge0$ to a linear combination of certain integrals of those fields along two rays emanating from the same vertex. A significant focus of current research in integral geometry centers on the inversion of V-line transforms in formally determined setups. Of particular interest are the restrictions of these operators in which the vertices of integration trajectories can be anywhere inside the support of the field, while the directions of the pair of rays, often called branches of the V-line, are determined by the vertex location. Such transforms have been thoroughly investigated when the branch directions are either constant or radial. In addition to that, in most of the prior research on this subject, it was assumed that the weights of integration along each branch are the same. In this paper we analyze the transforms defined on scalar functions and vector fields, satisfying a much weaker assumption on the branch directions. The weights restriction is also lifted in all but one setup. Consequently, we extend multiple previously known results on the kernel description, injectivity, and inversion of the transforms with simplifying assumptions and prove pertinent statements for more general setups not studied before.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2112.07182v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study one-parameter deformations of Calabi-Yau type Fermat polynomial singularities along degree-one directions. We show that twisted sectors in the vanishing cohomology are components of automorphic forms for certain triangular groups. We prove consequentially that genus zero Gromov-Witten generating series of the corresponding Fermat Calabi-Yau varieties are components of automorphic forms. The main tools we use are mixed Hodge structures for quasi-homogeneous polynomial singularities, Riemann-Hilbert correspondence, and genus zero mirror symmetry.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Approach to Integration of Ordinary Differential Equations with Retarded Argument</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25391v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We review studies on the application of Lie group methods to delay ordinary differential equations (DODEs). For first- and second-order DODEs with a single delay parameter that depends on independent and dependent variables, the group classifications are performed. Classes of invariant DODEs for each Lie subgroup are written out. The symmetries allow us to construct invariant solutions to such equations. The application of variational methods to functionals with one delay yields DODEs with two delays. The Lagrangian and Hamiltonian approaches are reviewed. The delay analog of the Legendre transformation, which relates the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian approaches, is also analysed. Noether-type operator identities relate the invariance of delay functionals with the appropriate variational equations and their conserved quantities. These identities are used to formulate Noether-type theorems that give first integrals of second-order DODEs with symmetries. Finally, several open problems are formulated in the Conclusion.</description>
