      <title>A Versatile Hong-Ou-Mandel Interference Experiment in Optical Fiber for the Undergraduate Laboratory</title>

Abstract: Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interference is a quantum optics laboratory experiment that has recently become more accessible to undergraduate students. The experiment consists of two identical photons simultaneously entering a non-polarizing beam splitter. The wavefunctions destructively interfere and the photon pairs bunch (both exit the same output) at the outputs whereas classically they are equally likely to exit different outputs. Due to the precision needed to achieve indistinguishability, setup and alignment of this experiment is often considered to be too difficult and time consuming to be appropriate for an undergraduate lab, with an end goal of merely demonstrating the HOM interference dip. Here, we present an alternative optical fiber-based apparatus that gives a consistently reproducible experiment with interference occurring in a fused-fiber coupler instead of a traditional beam splitter. We use a commercially available fiber coupled biphoton source that requires minimal alignment and increases coherence length of the interference. In addition, our biphoton source provides direct temperature based control of the frequency degeneracy of the photon pairs produced, allowing for students to investigate physical properties of HOM interference such as coherence length and interference visibility. Through use of standard opto-mechanical parts combined with the commercially available fiber integrated biphoton source and laser, our apparatus is a middle ground between built-from-scratch and pre-aligned setups.</description>
