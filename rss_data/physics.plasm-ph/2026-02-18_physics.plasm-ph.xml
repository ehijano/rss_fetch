      <title>TokaMind: A Multi-Modal Transformer Foundation Model for Tokamak Plasma Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present TokaMind, an open-source foundation model framework for fusion plasma modeling, based on a Multi-Modal Transformer (MMT) and trained on heterogeneous tokamak diagnostics from the publicly available MAST dataset. TokaMind supports multiple data modalities (time-series, 2D profiles, and videos) with different sampling rates, robust missing-signal handling, and efficient task adaptation via selectively loading and freezing four model components. To represent multi-modal signals, we use a training-free Discrete Cosine Transform embedding (DCT3D) and provide a clean interface for alternative embeddings (e.g., Variational Autoencoders - VAEs). We evaluate TokaMind on the recently introduced MAST benchmark TokaMark, comparing training and embedding strategies. Our results show that fine-tuned TokaMind outperforms the benchmark baseline on all but one task, and that, for several tasks, lightweight fine-tuning yields better performance than training the same architecture from scratch under a matched epoch budget. These findings highlight the benefits of multi-modal pretraining for tokamak plasma dynamics and provide a practical, extensible foundation for future fusion modeling tasks. Training code and model weights will be made publicly available.</description>

      <title>Flux pumping and bifurcated relaxations of helical core in 3D magnetohydrodynamic modelling of ASDEX Upgrade plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flux pumping was achieved in recent hybrid scenario experiments in the ASDEX Upgrade (AUG) tokamak, which is characterized by a sawtooth-free helical quiescent state and the anomalous radial redistribution of toroidal current density and poloidal magnetic flux. In this article, the self-regulation mechanism of the AUG core plasma during flux pumping is investigated at realistic parameters using the JOREK code based on the two-temperature, nonlinear, full magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model. A key milestone in AUG flux pumping modelling is achieved by quantitatively reproducing the clamped current density and safety factor profiles in the plasma core, demonstrating the effectiveness of the dynamo effect in sustaining the flux pumping state. The dynamo term, that is of particular interest, is primarily generated by the pressure-gradient driven m/n = 1/1 quasi-interchange-like MHD instability. The work systematically extrapolates the parameter regimes of flux pumping from the above AUG base case by scanning dissipation coefficients and plasma beta. The simulation results reveal bifurcated plasma behaviours at different Hartmann numbers, including distinct states such as flux pumping (helical core with a flat current density), sawteeth (periodic kink-cycling), single crash (without subsequent cycle), and quasi-stationary magnetic island (peaked current density). Transitions from marginal flux pumping state to sawteeth are observed in long-term simulations. The relationships between system dissipation, plasma beta, and different plasma states are carefully analyzed. For practical purposes, the potential operational window for flux pumping, as determined by plasma density and temperature, is estimated. The modelling efforts advance the understanding of flux pumping and facilitate the development of a fast surrogate model for efficient evaluation of flux pumping.</description>

      <title>From Coils to Surface Recession: Fully Coupled Simulation of Ablation in ICP Wind Tunnels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a fully coupled, multiphysics computational framework for predicting the thermo-chemical material response of thermal protection systems in inductively coupled plasma (ICP) wind tunnels. The framework integrates a high-fidelity Navier-Stokes plasma solver, an electromagnetic field solver, and a discontinuous-Galerkin material response solver using a partitioned coupling strategy. This enables an ab initio, end-to-end simulation of the 350 kW Plasmatron X facility at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), including plasma generation, electromagnetic heating, near-wall thermochemistry, and time-accurate material ablation. The model captures key ICP physics such as vortex-mode recirculation, Joule-heating-driven plasma formation, and Lorentz-force-induced flow confinement, and accurately predicts the transition from subsonic to supersonic jet behavior at low pressures. Validation against cold-wall calorimetry and graphite ablation experiments shows that predicted stagnation-point heat fluxes fall well within experimental uncertainty, while fully coupled simulations accurately reproduce measured stagnation temperature histories and recession rates with errors below 12% and 10%, respectively. Remaining discrepancies during early transient heating are attributed to uncertainties in power-coupling efficiency, equilibrium ablation modeling, and material property datasets. Overall, the framework demonstrates strong predictive capability for ICP wind tunnel environments and provides a foundation for improved design, interpretation, and planning of hypersonic material testing campaigns.</description>

      <title>VR-PIC: An entropic variance-reduction method for particle-in-cell solutions of the Vlasov-Poisson equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the recently developed entropic and conservative variance reduction framework [M. Sadr, N. G. Hadjiconstantinou, A variance-reduced direct Monte Carlo simulation method for solving the Boltzmann equation over a wide range of rarefaction, Journal of Computational Physics 472 (2023) 111677.] to the particle-in-cell (PIC) method of solving Vlasov-Poisson equation. We show that a zeroth-order approximation that freezes the importance weights during the velocity-space kick is stable at the expense of introducing bias. Then, we propose a correction for the weight distribution using maximum cross-entropy formulation to ensure conservation laws while minimizing the introduced bias. In several test cases including Sod's shock tube and Landau damping we show that the proposed method maintains the substantial speed-up of variance reduction method compared to the PIC simulations in the low signal regime with minimal changes to the simulation code.</description>

      <title>Code-Verification Techniques for Particle-in-Cell Simulations with Direct Simulation Monte Carlo Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Particle-in-cell methods with stochastic collision models are commonly used to simulate collisional plasma dynamics, with applications ranging from hypersonic flight to semiconductor manufacturing. Code verification of such methods is challenging due to the interaction between the spatial- and temporal-discretization errors, the statistical sampling noise, and the stochastic nature of the collision algorithm. In this paper, we introduce our code-verification approaches to apply the method of manufactured solutions to plasma dynamics, and we derive expected convergence rates for the different sources of discretization and statistical error. For the particles, we incorporate the method of manufactured solutions into the equations of motion. We manufacture the particle distribution function and inversely query the cumulative distribution function to obtain known particle positions and velocities at each time step. In doing so, we avoid modifying the particle weights, eliminating risks from potentially negative weights or modifications to weight-dependent collision algorithms. For the collision algorithm, we average independent outcomes at each time step and we derive a corresponding manufactured source term for the velocity change for each particle. By having known solutions for the particle positions and velocities, we are able to compute the error in these quantities directly instead of attempting to compute differences in distribution functions. These approaches are equally valid for particle-in-cell simulations with Monte Carlo collisions and direct simulation Monte Carlo simulations of neutral gas flows. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaches in three dimensions for different couplings between the particles and field, with and without binary elastic collisions, and with and without coding errors.</description>

      <title>The Numerics of VMEC++</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04374v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: VMEC++ is a Python-friendly, from-scratch reimplementation in C++ of the Variational Moments Equilibrium Code (VMEC), a fixed- and free-boundary ideal-MHD equilibrium solver for stellarators and tokamaks. The first VMEC implementation was written by Steven P. Hirshman and colleagues in the 1980s and 1990s and its latest Fortran incarnation (PARVMEC, https://github.com/ORNL-Fusion/PARVMEC) is widely used in stellarator optimization systems. Our work improves on previous implementations with regard to various critical aspects: special care has been put in providing an idiomatic Python experience, from installation to actual usage; VMEC++ has a zero-crash policy; it supports inputs in the classic INDATA format as well as friendlier JSON files. VMEC++ execution times are typically less than or equal to previous implementations, and time to convergence can be decreased dramatically by leveraging its hot-restart feature: by providing the output of a VMEC++ run as initial state for a subsequent one, VMEC++ is initialized using the previously converged equilibrium. This can dramatically decrease runtimes when running on many similar magnetic configurations as it typically happens in stellarator optimization pipelines. On the flip side, some features of the original Fortran VMEC implementation are not yet available in VMEC++, such as support for non-stellarator-symmetric configurations. This contribution presents the internal numerics of the open-source VMEC++ package publicly for the first time.</description>

      <title>A Doppler backscattering diagnostic for the EXL-50U spherical tokamak: plasma considerations and preliminary quasioptical design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18532v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The EXL-50U spherical tokamak was built by Energy iNNovation to develop technologies for proton-boron fusion in spherical tokamaks (Liu et al., Phys. Plasmas 2024). We present a conceptual design of the Doppler backscattering (DBS) diagnostic for the EXL-50U spherical tokamak. DBS is a diagnostic capable of measuring plasma turbulence, which is especially important for transport in tokamaks. Starting from a set of physical design constraints, such as port window availability and in-vessel space, we used SCOTTY (Hall-Chen et al., PPCF 2022), an in-house beam tracing code, to predict the location of the cutoffs and the corresponding scattering wavenumbers for several EXL-50U plasma scenarios. We find that we are able to measure scattering locations of 0.15 $&lt;$ $\rho$ $&lt;$ 1, with corresponding turbulent wavenumbers of 2.47 cm$^{-1}$$&lt;$ $k_{\perp}$ $&lt;$ 9.49 cm$^{-1}$. Here, $\rho$ is the normalised radial coordinate of the scattering location, and $k_{\perp}$ is the corresponding turbulent wavenumber. We then determine the optimal toroidal launch angles to ensure that the probe beam's wavevector is perpendicular to the magnetic field at the cutoff location, thereby maximising the backscattered signal. This matching is crucial due to the EXL-50U's high magnetic pitch angle, $\sim35^{\circ}$ at the outboard midplane. Given our results, we propose the use of toroidal steering and tunable frequency channels to ensure beams are well-matched with the magnetic pitch angle. We propose a quasioptical system that covers the U-band range (40--60 GHz).</description>

      <title>Investigating Solid-Fluid Phase Coexistence in DC Plasma Bilayer Crystals: The Role of Particle Pairing and Mode Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09491v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article presents a detailed investigation of solid-fluid phase coexistence in a bilayer dusty plasma crystal subjected to varying confinement ring bias voltages in a DC glow discharge argon plasma. Melamine formaldehyde particles were employed to form a stable, hexagonally ordered bilayer crystal within a confinement ring electrically isolated from the grounded cathode. By systematically adjusting the confinement ring bias, a distinct phase coexistence emerged characterized by a fluid-like melted core surrounded by a solid crystalline periphery. Crucially, analysis of the phonon spectra revealed frequency shifts that deviate significantly from the predictions of classical monolayer Mode-Coupling Instability (MCI) theory. Stability analysis further demonstrated that dynamic interlayer particle pairing and the associated increase in non-reciprocal interaction strength are strongly correlated with the onset of structural destabilization. These findings highlight previously underappreciated mechanisms driving the melting transition in bilayer dusty plasmas, offering a more comprehensive understanding of phase behavior in complex plasma systems. The results underscore the importance of interlayer coupling and confinement effects in tuning structural transitions.</description>

      <title>Coherent-state boundary conditions as the first-principles origin of background fields in QED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21122v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: QED formulated in prescribed classical background electromagnetic fields is a standard framework for strong-field and laser\textendash matter interactions. It is usually treated as a theory modified by externally imposed fields, obscuring its precise relation to full QED and, in particular, the role of asymptotic boundary conditions for the gauge field. Starting from an operator-based formulation, we show that QED with background fields is not a distinct theory but arises as a well-defined boundary-condition limit of full QED, in which the classical background field emerges from coherent-state boundary conditions on the quantized electromagnetic field. In this limit, the conventional generating functional used in calculations with prescribed background fields is recovered naturally, while relaxing the boundary conditions allows depletion and backreaction effects to be incorporated within the same framework. The central new result is a rigorous operator-level proof of the equivalence between the fixed background-field approximation and coherent-state asymptotic boundary conditions\textemdash a formulation that, to our knowledge, has not been made explicit in previous approaches. We further demonstrate that the apparent time dependence of background fields does not originate from an explicitly time-dependent Hamiltonian, but instead reflects the choice of picture\textemdash Schr\"{o}dinger versus Heisenberg\textemdash in the underlying quantum theory. Rather than introducing new properties of coherent states, our analysis provides a first-principles reinterpretation of the fixed background-field approximation as a controlled and picture-dependent limit of full QED.</description>
