      <title>Stochastic Dynamics and Probability Analysis for a Generalized Epidemic Model with Environmental Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider a stochastic SEIQR (susceptible-exposed-infected-quarantined-recovered) epidemic model with a generalized incidence function. Using the Lyapunov method, we establish the existence and uniqueness of a global positive solution to the model, ensuring that it remains well-defined over time. Through the application of Young's inequality and Chebyshev's inequality, we demonstrate the concepts of stochastic ultimate boundedness and stochastic permanence, providing insights into the long-term behavior of the epidemic dynamics under random perturbations. Furthermore, we derive conditions for stochastic extinction, which describe scenarios where the epidemic may eventually die out, and V-geometric ergodicity, which indicates the rate at which the system's state converges to its equilibrium. Finally, we perform numerical simulations to verify our theoretical results and assess the model's behavior under different parameters.</description>

      <title>The influence of chromosomal inversions on genetic variation and clinal patterns in genomic data of Drosophila melanogaster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01352v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chromosomal inversions are structural mutations resulting in the reversal of the gene order along the corresponding genomic region. Due to their influence on recombination patterns, they can have a major influence on genetic variation and the evolutionary process. Accordingly, inversions can act as supergenes that keep together co-adapted gene complexes that form the genetic basis of many complex phenotypes in diverse organisms. In this book chapter, I will present an analysis pipeline to investigate the influence of two common cosmopolitan inversion, In(2L)t and In(3R)Payne, on genome-wide genetic variation and differentiation in world-wide populations of the vinegar fly Drosophila melanogaster. We will use single-individual and pooled resequencing data in combination with population genomics analysis tools to explore the impact of these two inversions on genetic variation, population structure, and clinal variation in natural populations.</description>

      <title>The ecological forecast horizon revisited: Potential, actual and relative system predictability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ecological forecasts are model-based statements about currently unknown ecosystem states in time or space. For a model forecast to be useful to inform decision-makers, model validation and verification determine adequateness. The measure of forecast goodness that can be translated into a limit up to which a forecast is acceptable is known as the `forecast horizon'. While verification of meteorological models follows strict criteria with established metrics and forecast horizons, assessments of ecological forecasting models still remain experiment-specific and forecast horizons are rarely reported. As such, users of ecological forecasts remain uninformed of how far into the future statements can be trusted. In this work, we synthesise existing approaches, define empirical forecast horizons in a unified framework for assessing ecological predictability and offer recipes on their computation. We distinguish upper and lower boundary estimates of predictability limits, reflecting the model's potential and actual forecast horizon, and show how a benchmark model can help determine its relative forecast horizon. The approaches are demonstrated with four case studies from population, ecosystem, and earth system research.</description>

      <title>Toric Multivariate Gaussian Models from Symmetries in a Tree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a rooted tree $T$ on $n$ non-root leaves with colored and zeroed nodes, we construct a linear space $L_T$ of $n\times n$ symmetric matrices with constraints determined by the combinatorics of the tree. When $L_T$ represents the covariance matrices of a Gaussian model, it provides natural generalizations of Brownian motion tree (BMT) models in phylogenetics. When $L_T$ represents a space of concentration matrices of a Gaussian model, it gives certain colored Gaussian graphical models, which we refer to as BMT derived models. We investigate conditions under which the reciprocal variety $L_T^{-1}$ is toric. Relying on the birational isomorphism of the inverse matrix map, we show that if the BMT derived graph of $T$ is vertex-regular and a block graph, under the derived Laplacian transformation, $L_T^{-1}$ is the vanishing locus of a toric ideal. This ideal is given by the sum of the toric ideal of the Gaussian graphical model on the block graph, the toric ideal of the original BMT model, and binomial linear conditions coming from vertex-regularity. To this end, we provide monomial parametrizations for these toric models realized through paths among leaves in $T$.</description>

      <title>Microbial Mat Metagenomes from Waikite Valley, Aotearoa New Zealand</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rise of complex multicellular ecosystems Neoproterozoic time was preceded by a microbial Proterozoic biosphere, where productivity may have been largely restricted to microbial mats made up of bacteria including oxygenic photosynthetic Cyanobacteria, anoxygenic phototrophs, and heterotrophs. In modern environments, analogous microbial mats can be found in restricted environments such as carbonate tidal flats and terrestrial hot springs. Here, we report metagenomic sequence data from an analog in the hot springs of Waikite Valley, Aotearoa New Zealand, where carbon-rich, slightly-alkaline geothermal waters support diverse phototrophic microbial mats.
  The Waikite Valley hot spring in the Taupo Volcanic Zone of Aotearoa New Zealand was sampled in duplicate at 8 points along a temperature gradient transect of the outflow, from ~62 C (near the source) to ~37 C (~100 meters downstream). ~686 Gb of shotgun metagenomic sequence data was generated by Illumina Novaseq. Each sample was assembled using SPAdes, followed by binning of metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) by MetaBAT. These data are useful for the genomic analysis of novel phototrophic bacteria, as well as for ecological comparisons between thermophilic communities with varying temperatures but otherwise similar conditions.</description>

      <title>Dynamical stability of evolutionarily stable strategy in asymmetric games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19320v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) is the defining concept of evolutionary game theory. It has a fairly unanimously accepted definition for the case of symmetric games which are played in a homogeneous population where all individuals are in same role. However, in asymmetric games, which are played in a population with multiple subpopulations (each of which has individuals in one particular role), situation is not as clear. Various generalizations of ESS defined for such cases differ in how they correspond to fixed points of replicator equation which models evolutionary dynamics of frequencies of strategies in the population. Moreover, some of the definitions may even be equivalent, and hence, redundant in the scheme of things. Along with reporting some new results, this paper is partly indented as a contextual mini-review of some of the most important definitions of ESS in asymmetric games. We present the definitions coherently and scrutinize them closely while establishing equivalences -- some of them hitherto unreported -- between them wherever possible. Since it is desirable that a definition of ESS should correspond to asymptotically stable fixed points of replicator dynamics, we bring forward the connections between various definitions and their dynamical stabilities. Furthermore, we find the use of principle of relative entropy to gain information-theoretic insights into the concept of ESS in asymmetric games, thereby establishing a three-fold connection between game theory, dynamical system theory, and information theory in this context. We discuss our conclusions also in the backdrop of asymmetric hypermatrix games where more than two individuals interact simultaneously in the course of getting payoffs.</description>

      <title>Cherry picking in forests: A new characterization for the unrooted hybrid number of two phylogenetic trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.08145v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Phylogenetic networks are a special type of graph which generalize phylogenetic trees and that are used to model non-treelike evolutionary processes such as recombination and hybridization. In this paper, we consider {\em unrooted} phylogenetic networks, i.e. simple, connected graphs $\mathcal{N}=(V,E)$ with leaf set $X$, for $X$ some set of species, in which every internal vertex in $\mathcal{N}$ has degree three. One approach used to construct such phylogenetic networks is to take as input a collection $\mathcal{P}$ of phylogenetic trees and to look for a network $\mathcal{N}$ that contains each tree in $\mathcal{P}$ and that minimizes the quantity $r(\mathcal{N}) = |E|-(|V|-1)$ over all such networks. Such a network always exists, and the quantity $r(\mathcal{N})$ for an optimal network $\mathcal{N}$ is called the hybrid number of $\mathcal{P}$. In this paper, we give a new characterization for the hybrid number in case $\mathcal{P}$ consists of two trees. This characterization is given in terms of a cherry picking sequence for the two trees, although to prove that our characterization holds we need to define the sequence more generally for two forests. Cherry picking sequences have been intensively studied for collections of rooted phylogenetic trees, but our new sequences are the first variant of this concept that can be applied in the unrooted setting. Since the hybrid number of two trees is equal to the well-known tree bisection and reconnection distance between the two trees, our new characterization also provides an alternative way to understand this important tree distance.</description>

      <title>Efficient weighted-ensemble network simulations of the SIS model of epidemics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03084v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The presence of erratic or unstable paths in standard kinetic Monte Carlo simulations significantly undermines the accurate simulation and sampling of transition pathways. While typically reliable methods, such as the Gillespie algorithm, are employed to simulate such paths, they encounter challenges in efficiently identifying rare events due to their sequential nature and reliance on exact Monte Carlo sampling. In contrast, the weighted ensemble method effectively samples rare events and accelerates the exploration of complex reaction pathways by distributing computational resources among multiple replicas, where each replica is assigned a weight reflecting its importance, and evolves independently from the others. Here, we implement the highly efficient and robust weighted ensemble method to model susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) dynamics on large heterogeneous population networks, and explore the interplay between stochasticity and contact heterogeneity which ultimately gives rise to disease clearance. Studying a wide variety of networks characterized by fat-tailed asymmetric degree distributions, we are able to compute the mean time to extinction and quasi-stationary distribution around it in previously-inaccessible parameter regimes.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning for Optimal Control of Adaptive Cell Populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08439v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many organisms and cell types, from bacteria to cancer cells, exhibit a remarkable ability to adapt to fluctuating environments. Additionally, cells can leverage memory of past environments to better survive previously-encountered stressors. From a control perspective, this adaptability poses significant challenges in driving cell populations toward extinction, and is thus an open question with great clinical significance. In this work, we focus on drug dosing in cell populations exhibiting phenotypic plasticity. For specific dynamical models switching between resistant and susceptible states, exact solutions are known. However, when the underlying system parameters are unknown, and for complex memory-based systems, obtaining the optimal solution is currently intractable. To address this challenge, we apply reinforcement learning (RL) to identify informed dosing strategies to control cell populations evolving under novel non-Markovian dynamics. We find that model-free deep RL is able to recover exact solutions and control cell populations even in the presence of long-range temporal dynamics.</description>
