      <title>Quantum Monte Carlo calculations of magnetic form factors in light nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Quantum Monte Carlo calculations of magnetic form factors in $A=6-10$ nuclei, based on Norfolk two- and three-nucleon interactions, and associated one- and two-body electromagnetic currents. Agreement with the available experimental data for $^6$Li, $^7$Li, $^9$Be and $^{10}$B up to values of momentum transfer $q\sim 3$ fm$^{-1}$ is achieved when two-nucleon currents are accounted for. We present a set of predictions for the magnetic form factors of $^7$Be, $^8$Li, $^9$Li, and $^9$C. In these systems, two-body currents account for $\sim40-60\%$ of the total magnetic strength. Measurements in any of these radioactive systems would provide valuable insights on the nuclear magnetic structure emerging from the underlying many-nucleon dynamics. A particularly interesting case is that of $^7$Be, as it would enable investigations of the magnetic structure of mirror nuclei.</description>

      <title>On the existence of a proton halo in $^{22}$Al</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: More and more halo nuclei or candidates have been identified or suggested in experiments in recent years. It was declared that the halo structure of $^{22}$Al is revealed by the large isospin asymmetry in $^{22}$Si/$^{22}$O mirror Gamow-Teller transitions [Phys. Rev. Lett. 125, 192503 (2020)]. We highlight that a significant mirror asymmetry already exists between wave functions of the likely unbound nucleus $^{22}$Si and the doubly-magic nucleus $^{22}$O, which largely explains the observed asymmetry in the transitions. Furthermore, these transitions involve only the $1^+$ excited states of the daughter nuclei $^{22}$Al and $^{22}$F. The $1^+$ state of $^{22}$Al cannot be considered a halo state due to its proton-unbound nature. An analysis of the spin-parity suggests that a weakly bound $2s_{1/2}$ valence proton in the ground-state $^{22}$Al is improbable. To investigate the shell structure for the ground state of $^{22}$Al, we employ the state-of-the-art deformed and triaxial relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov theories in continuum. We find that a small $s$-wave component of $5\%$ appears for the weakly bound valence proton in $^{22}$Al only when triaxial deformation is considered. While the examination of densities and rms radii indicates that this small $s$-wave component is insufficient to form a discernible proton halo in $^{22}$Al, slightly larger $2s_{1/2}$ occupations have been reported in other recent theoretical results. The question of how many low-$\ell$ components are sufficient to form a proton halo in the presence of the Coulomb barrier remains open. Thus, future measurements of reaction or interaction cross sections and momentum distributions of breakup fragments are highly desirable to verify whether $^{22}$Al is a halo nucleus.</description>

      <title>Interplay of single-particle and collective modes in the $^{12}$C(p,2p) reaction near 100 MeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $^{12}$C(p,2p)$^{11}$B reaction at $E_p =98.7$ MeV proton beam energy is analyzed using a rigorous three-particle scattering formalism extended to include the internal excitation of the nuclear core or residual nucleus. The excitation proceeds via the core interaction with any of the external nucleons. We assume the $^{11}$B ground and low-lying excited states [$\frac32^-$ (0.0 MeV), $\frac52^-$ (4.45 MeV), $\frac72^-$ (6.74 MeV)] and the excited states [$\frac12^-$ (2.12 MeV), $\frac32^-$ (5.02 MeV)] to be members of $K=\frac32^-$ and $K=\frac12^-$ rotational bands, respectively. The dynamical core excitation results in a significant cross section for the reaction leading to the $\frac52^-$ (4.45 MeV) excited state of $^{11}$B that cannot be populated through the single-particle excitation mechanism. The detailed agreement between the theoretical calculations and data depends on the used optical model parametrizations and the kinematical configuration of the detected nucleons.</description>

      <title>Role of clustered nuclear geometry in particle production through p-C and p-O collisions at the Large Hadron Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-range multi-particle correlations in heavy-ion collisions have shown conclusive evidence of the hydrodynamic behavior of strongly interacting matter, and are associated with the final-state azimuthal momentum anisotropy. In small collision systems, azimuthal anisotropy can be influenced by the hadronization mechanism and residual jet-like correlations. Thus, one of the motives of the planned p--O and O--O collisions at the LHC and RHIC is to understand the origin of small system collectivity. As the anisotropic flow coefficients ($v_n$) are sensitive to the initial-state effects including nuclear shape, deformation, and charge density profiles, studies involving $^{12}$C and $^{16}$O nuclei are transpiring due to the presence of exotic $\alpha$ ($^{4}$He) clusters in such nuclei. In this study, for the first time, we investigate the effects of nuclear $\alpha$--clusters on the azimuthal anisotropy of the final-state hadrons in p--C and p--O collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}= 9.9$ TeV within a multi-phase transport model framework. We report the transverse momentum ($p_{\rm T}$) and pseudorapidity ($\eta$) spectra, participant eccentricity ($\epsilon_2$) and triangularity ($\epsilon_3$), and estimate the elliptic flow ($v_2$) and triangular flow ($v_3$) of the final-state hadrons using the two-particle cumulant method. These results are compared with a model-independent Sum of Gaussians (SOG) type nuclear density profile for $^{12}$C and $^{16}$O nuclei.</description>

      <title>Probing the equilibration of the QCD matter created in heavy-ion collisions with dileptons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A systematic study of intermediate invariant mass dilepton production in Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 5.02$ TeV is performed, using next-to-leading-order (NLO) thermal QCD dilepton emission rates with a multistage dynamical approach which includes event-by-event IP-Glasma initial conditions, relativistic viscous fluid dynamics, and a hadronic afterburner. Considering dilepton yield and anisotropic flow, special attention is paid to the out-of-equilibrium aspects, both thermal and chemical, and to the contribution of the Drell-Yan process. The relative contribution of each of those different channels to dilepton observables is calculated and discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the previous work, we discussed the cross section and the detection of 4.4-MeV $\gamma$ rays produced in the neutrino neutral-current (NC) reaction $^{16}$O($\nu, \nu^{\prime}$)$^{16}$O(12.97 MeV and 12.53 MeV, $2^-$) in a water Cherenkov detector at the low energy below 100 MeV. In this report, we further investigated both the charged-current (CC) reaction $^{16}$O($\bar\nu_e, e^+$)$^{16}$N(0 MeV, $2^-$) and the NC reaction$^{16}$O($\nu, \nu^{\prime}$)$^{16}$O(12.97 MeV and 12.53 MeV, $2^-$), producing high-energy $\gamma$ rays, in which the more solid identification of the reactions can be applied via the coincidence method.</description>

      <title>Constraining the high-density behavior of nuclear symmetry energy with direct Urca processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The density dependence of the symmetry energy in relativistic mean-field models with density dependent couplings is discussed in terms of the possible opening of nucleonic direct Urca processes inside neutron stars, which induce a very rapid cooling of the star. The modification of the parametrization of the isospin channel of two models, DD2 and DDMEX, keeping the same isoscalar properties is considered and the implications are discussed. Within the models discussed it is not possible the onset of nucleonic direct Urca processes in stars with a mass below $\sim1.6-1.8\, M_\odot$. The lowest masses that allow direct Urca processes are associated to a slope of the symmetry energy $\sim60$ MeV and a symmetry energy incompressibility close to zero. It is shown that the parametrization of the isospin channel proposed destroys the correlation between symmetry energy slope and incompressibility previously identified in several works.</description>

      <title>Backward DVCS on the pion in Sullivan processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this work is to do a systematic feasibility study of measuring in backward region deeply virtual Compton scattering on the pion in Sullivan processes in the framework of collinear QCD factorization where pion to photon transition distribution amplitudes (TDAs) describe the photon content of the $\pi$ meson. Our approach employs TDAs based on the overlap of light front wave functions, using a previously developed pion light-front wave function and deriving a consistent model for the light front wave functions of the photon. This work is expected to lead us to an estimate of the cross-sections that could be measured in the future U.S. and China's electron-ion colliders. It will also provide a comparison with the forward Sullivan DVCS case, which gives access to pion GPDs and for which a strong signal is expected.</description>

      <title>$B_c, B^{*}_c, B_s, B^{*}_s, D_s$ and $D^{*}_s$ mass shift in a nuclear medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For the first time, we estimate the in-medium mass shift of the two-flavored heavy mesons $B_c, B_c^*, B_s, B_s^*, D_s$ and $D_s^*$ in symmetric nuclear matter. The estimates are made by evaluating the lowest order one-loop self-energies. The enhanced excitations of intermediate state heavy-light quark mesons in symmetric nuclear matter are the origin of their negative mass shift. Our results show that the magnitude of the mass shift for the $B_c$ meson ($\bar{b} c$ or $b \bar{c}$) is larger than those of the $\eta_c (\bar{c} c)$ and $\eta_b (\bar{b} b)$, different from a naive expectation that it would be in-between of them. While, that of the $B_c^*$ shows the in-between of the $J/\psi$ and $\Upsilon$. We observe that the lighter vector meson excitation in each meson self-energy gives a dominant contribution for the corresponding meson mass shift, $B_c, B_s,$ and $D_s$.</description>

      <title>Suppressed Electric Quadrupole Collectivity in $^{49}$Ti</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single-step Coulomb excitation of $^{46,48,49,50}$Ti is presented. A complete set of $E2$ matrix elements for the quintuplet of states in $^{49}$Ti, centered on the $2^+$ core excitation, was measured for the first time. A total of nine $E2$ matrix elements are reported, four of which were previously unknown. $^{49}_{22}$Ti$_{27}$ shows a $20\%$ quenching in electric quadrupole transition strength as compared to its semi-magic $^{50}_{22}$Ti$_{28}$ neighbour. This $20\%$ quenching, while empirically unprecedented, can be explained with a remarkably simple two-state mixing model, which is also consistent with other ground-state properties such as the magnetic dipole moment and electric quadrupole moment. A connection to nucleon transfer data and the quenching of single-particle strength is also demonstrated. The simplicity of the $^{49}$Ti-$^{50}$Ti pair (i.e., approximate single-$j$ $0f_{7/2}$ valence space and isolation of yrast states from non-yrast states) provides a unique opportunity to disentangle otherwise competing effects in the ground-state properties of atomic nuclei, the emergence of collectivity, and the role of proton-neutron interactions.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional Imaging of Pion using Lattice QCD: Generalized Parton Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we report a lattice calculation of $x$-dependent valence pion generalized parton distributions (GPDs) at zero skewness with multiple values of the momentum transfer $-t$. The calculations are based on an $N_f=2+1$ gauge ensemble of highly improved staggered quarks with Wilson-Clover valence fermion. The lattice spacing is 0.04 fm, and the pion valence mass is tuned to be 300 MeV. We determine the Lorentz-invariant amplitudes of the quasi-GPD matrix elements for both symmetric and asymmetric momenta transfers with similar values and show the equivalence of both frames. Then, focusing on the asymmetric frame, we utilize a hybrid scheme to renormalize the quasi-GPD matrix elements obtained from the lattice calculations. After the Fourier transforms, the quasi-GPDs are then matched to the light-cone GPDs within the framework of large momentum effective theory with improved matching, including the next-to-next-to-leading order perturbative corrections, and leading renormalon and renormalization group resummations. We also present the 3-dimensional image of the pion in impact-parameter space through the Fourier transform of the momentum transfer $-t$.</description>

Abstract: We study the systematic uncertainty and biases introduced by theoretical assumptions needed to include large-$x$ DIS data in a global QCD analysis. Working in the CTEQ-JLab framework, we focus on different implementations of higher-twist corrections to the nucleon structure functions and of offshell PDF deformations in deuteron targets and discuss how their interplay impacts the extraction of the $d$-quark PDF and the calculation of the neutron structure function at large $x$.</description>

      <title>Moment of inertia and compactness of quark stars within the context of $f(R,T,L_m)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Within the metric formalism of $f(R,T,L_m)$ gravity theories, we investigate the hydrostatic equilibrium structure of compact stars taking into account both isotropic and anisotropic pressure. For this purpose, we focus on the $f(R,T,L_m)= R+ \alpha TL_m$ model, where $\alpha$ is a free parameter. We derive the modified TOV equations and the relativistic moment of inertia in the slowly rotating approximation. Using an equation of state (EoS) for color-superconducting quark stars, we examine the effects of the $\alpha TL_m$ term on the different macroscopic properties of these stars. Our results reveal that the decrease of the parameter $\alpha$ leads to a noticeable increase in the maximum-mass values. For negative $\alpha$ with sufficiently small $\vert\alpha\vert$, we obtain a qualitative behavior similar to the general relativistic (GR) context, namely, it is possible to obtain a critical stellar configuration such that the mass reaches its maximum. However, for sufficiently large values of $\vert\alpha\vert$ keeping negative $\alpha$, the critical point cannot be found on the mass-radius diagram. We also find that the inclusion of anisotropic pressure can provide masses and radii quite consistent with the current observational measurements, which opens an outstanding window onto the physics of anisotropic quark stars. By comparing the $I-C$ relations of isotropic quark stars in modified gravity, we show that such a correlation remains almost unchanged as the parameter $\alpha$ varies from GR counterpart. On the other hand, given a fixed $\alpha$, the $I-C$ relation is insensitive to variations of the anisotropy parameter $\beta$ to $\mathcal{O}(4\%)$.</description>

      <title>On the nature of yrast states in neutron-rich polonium isotopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polonium isotopes having two protons above the shell closure at $Z=82$ show a wide variety of low-lying high-spin isomeric states across the whole chain. The structure of neutron-deficient isotopes up to $^{210}$Po ($N=126$) is well established as they are easily produced through various methods. However, there is not much information available for the neutron-rich counterparts for which only selective techniques can be used for their production. We report on the first fast-timing measurements of yrast states up to the 8$^+$ level in $^{214,216,218}$Po isotopes produced in the $\beta^-$ decay of $^{214,216,218}$Bi at ISOLDE, CERN. In particular, our new half-life value of 607(14) ps for the 8$_1^+$ state in $^{214}$Po is nearly 20 times shorter than the one available in literature and comparable with the newly measured half-lives of 409(16) and 628(25) ps for the corresponding 8$_1^+$ states in $^{216,218}$Po, respectively. The measured $B(E2;8_1^+ \to 6_1^+)$ transition probability values follow an increasing trend relative to isotope mass, reaching a maximum for $^{216}$Po. The increase contradicts the previous claims of isomerism for the $8^+$ yrast states in neutron-rich $^{214}$Po and beyond. Together with the other measured yrast transitions, the $B(E2)$ values provide a crucial test of the different theoretical approaches describing the underlying configurations of the yrast band. The new experimental results are compared to shell-model calculations using the KHPE and H208 effective interactions and their pairing modified versions, showing an increase in configuration mixing when moving towards the heavier isotopes.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of phase shifts for non-relativistic elastic scattering using quantum computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulations of scattering processes are essential in understanding the physics of our universe. Computing relevant scattering quantities from ab initio methods is extremely difficult on classical devices because of the substantial computational resources needed. This work reports the development of an algorithm that makes it possible to obtain phase shifts for generic non-relativistic elastic scattering processes on a quantum computer. This algorithm is based on extracting phase shifts from the direct implementation of the real-time evolution. The algorithm is improved by a variational procedure, making it more accurate and resistant to the quantum noise. The reliability of the algorithm is first demonstrated by means of classical numerical simulations for different potentials, and later tested on existing quantum hardware, specifically on IBM quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Schwinger mechanism in QCD, and Fredholm alternatives theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel implementation of the Schwinger mechanism in QCD, which fixes uniquely the scale of the effective gluon mass and streamlines considerably the procedure of multiplicative renormalization. The key advantage of this method stems from the nonlinear nature of the dynamical equation that generates massless poles in the longitudinal sector of the three-gluon vertex. An exceptional feature of this approach is an extensive cancellation involving the components of the integral expression that determines the gluon mass; it is triggered once the Schwinger-Dyson equation of the pole-free part of the three-gluon vertex has been appropriately exploited. It turns out that this cancellation is driven by the so-called Fredholm alternatives theorem, which operates among the set of integral equations describing this system. Quite remarkably, in the linearized approximation this theorem enforces the exact masslessness of the gluon. Instead, the nonlinearity induced by the full treatment of the relevant kernel evades this theorem, allowing for the emergence of a nonvanishing mass. The numerical results obtained from the resulting equations are compatible with the lattice findings, and may be further refined through the inclusion of the remaining fundamental vertices of the theory.</description>

      <title>Global analysis of fragmentation functions to charged hadrons with high-precision data from the LHC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fragmentation functions (FFs) are essential non-perturbative QCD inputs for predicting hadron production cross sections in high energy scatterings. In this study, we present a joint determination of FFs for light charged hadrons through a global analysis at next-to-leading order (NLO) in QCD. Our analysis incorporates a wide range of precision measurements from the LHC, as well as data from electron-positron collisions and semi-inclusive deep inelastic scatterings. By including measurements of jet fragmentation at the LHC in our global analysis, we are able to impose strong constraints on the gluon FFs. A careful selection of hadron kinematics is applied to ensure the validity of factorization and perturbative calculations of QCD. In addition, we introduce several methodological advances in fitting, resulting in a flexible parametrization form and the inclusion of theoretical uncertainties from perturbative calculations. Our best-fit predictions show very good agreement with the global data, with $\chi^2/N_{pt}\sim 0.90$. We also generate a large number of Hessian error sets to estimate uncertainties and correlations of the extracted FFs. FFs to charged pions (kaons and protons) are well constrained for momentum fractions down to 0.01 (0.1). Total momentum of partons carried by light charged hadrons are determined precisely. Their values for $u$, $d$ quarks and gluon saturate at about 50\% for a lower cut of the momentum fraction of 0.01. Pulls from individual datasets and impact of various choices of the analysis are also studied in details. Additionally, we present an update of the FMNLO program used for calculating hadron production cross sections. Our FFs, including the error sets (denoted as NPC23), are publicly available in the form of LHAPDF6 grids.</description>

      <title>Observation of ternary proton emission in heavy-ion induced fission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Proton and $\alpha$-particle energy spectra were measured in coincidence with fission fragments in $^{16}$O (96 MeV) + $^{232}$Th reaction. The multiplicity spectra were analyzed within the framework of a Moving Source Disentangling Analysis (MSDA) to determine contributions from different emission stages. The MSDA conclusively shows "ternary proton emission" as an essential component in the proton multiplicity spectra akin to ternary $\alpha$ particles. It is the first time that "ternary proton emission" has been disentangled unambiguously from pre-scission emission in heavy-ion induced fission. Inverse trajectory calculations were performed, showing that experimentally observed Total Kinetic Energy (TKE) and kinetic energies of both ternary $\alpha$ particles and protons are well reproduced simultaneously by a common scission configuration. Thus, the scission stage parameters of a fissioning nucleus have been obtained, showing quantitatively that the scission configuration is significantly stretched in ternary- than the binary-fission.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopy of deeply bound orbitals in neutron-rich Ca isotopes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The calcium isotopes are an ideal system to investigate the evolution of shell structure and magic numbers. Although the properties of surface nucleons in calcium have been well studied, probing the structure of deeply bound nucleons remains a challenge. Here, we report on the first measurement of unbound states in $^{53}$Ca and $^{55}$Ca, populated from \ts{54,56}Ca($p,pn$) reactions at a beam energy of around 216 MeV/nucleon at the RIKEN Radioactive Isotopes Beam Factory. The resonance properties, partial cross sections, and momentum distributions of these unbound states were analyzed. Orbital angular momentum $l$ assignments were extracted from momentum distributions based on calculations using the distorted wave impulse approximation (DWIA) reaction model. The resonances at excitation energies of 5516(41)\,keV in $^{53}$Ca and 6000(250)\,keV in $^{55}$Ca indicate a significant $l$\, =\,3 component, providing the first experimental evidence for the $\nu 0f_{7/2}$ single-particle strength of unbound hole states in the neutron-rich Ca isotopes. The observed excitation energies and cross-sections point towards extremely localized and well separated strength distributions, with some fragmentation for the $\nu 0f_{7/2}$ orbital in $^{55}$Ca. These results are in good agreement with predictions from shell-model calculations using the effective GXPF1Bs interaction and \textit{ab initio} calculations and diverge markedly from the experimental distributions in the nickel isotones at $Z=28$.</description>

Abstract: We employ a chiral effective field theory-based approach to connect $DD^*$ scattering observables at the physical and variable pion masses accessible in lattice QCD simulations. We incorporate all relevant scales associated with three-body $DD\pi$ dynamics and the left-hand cut induced by the one-pion exchange for pion masses higher than the physical one, as required by analyticity and unitarity. By adjusting the contact interactions to match experimental data at the physical pion mass and lattice finite-volume energy levels at $m_{\pi} = 280$ MeV, we predict the trajectory of the $T_{cc}$ pole as a function of the pion mass, finding it consistent with the hadronic-molecule scenario. In particular, we find that the explicit treatment of the one-pion exchange has a pronounced effect on the pole trajectory for $m_\pi \gtrsim 230$ MeV by pushing it into the complex energy plane.</description>

Abstract: We present a detailed study of kinematical and dynamical conditions necessary for probing highly elusive three-nucleon short range correlations~(3N-SRCs) in nuclei through inclusive electron scattering. The kinematic requirements that should be satisfied in order to isolate 3N-SRCs in inclusive processes are derived. We demonstrate that a sequence of two short-range NN interactions represents the main mechanism for 3N-SRCs in inclusive processes. Within this mechanism we predict a quadratic dependence of the inclusive cross section ratios of nuclei to $^3$He in the 3N-SRC region to the same ratio measured in 2N-SRC domain. The extended analysis of the available data satisfying the necessary 3N-SRC kinematical conditions is presented. This analysis provides tantalizing signatures of scaling associated with the onset of 3N-SRC dominance. The same data are also consistent with the prediction of the quadratic relation between the ratios measured in the 3N and 2N-SRC regions for nuclei ranging $4 \le A \le 197$. This agreement made it possible to extract $a_3(A)$, the probability of 3N-SRCs relative to the A=3 nucleus. We find $a_3(A)$ to be significantly larger in magnitude than the analogous parameter, $a_2(A)$, for 2N-SRCs.</description>

Abstract: Relativistic isobar ($^{96}_{44}$Ru+$^{96}_{44}$Ru and $^{96}_{40}$Zr+$^{96}_{40}$Zr) collisions have revealed intricate differences in their nuclear size and shape, inspiring unconventional studies of nuclear structure using relativistic heavy ion collisions. In this study, we investigate the relative differences in the mean multiplicity ($R_{\langle N_{\rm ch}\rangle}$) and the second- ($R_{\epsilon_{2}}$) and third-order eccentricity ($R_{\epsilon_{3}}$) between isobar collisions using initial state models. It is found that initial fluctuations and nuclear deformations have negligible effects on $R_{\langle N_{\rm ch}\rangle}$ in most central collisions, while both are important for the $R_{\epsilon_{2}}$ and $R_{\epsilon_{3}}$, the degree of which is sensitive to the underlying nucleonic or sub-nucleonic degree of freedom. These features, compared to real data, may probe the particle production mechanism and the physics underlying nuclear structure.</description>

      <title>Difference in peripherality of the inclusive (p, p'x) and (d, d'x) reactions and its implications for phenomenological reaction model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02502v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Previous studies have revealed the importance of introducing surface correction into a phenomenological model for inclusive (n, n'x) and (p, p'x) reactions. These findings have contributed significantly to the improvement of nuclear data evaluation. However, the necessity for the surface correction in an inclusive (d, d'x) reaction has hardly been investigated. The purpose of this study is to investigate the difference in the peripherality of the (p, p'x) and (d, d'x) reactions by a theoretical analysis using a quantum mechanical model, and to obtain a theoretical basis on the surface correction in the (d, d'x) reaction. The energy spectra and their radial distributions for the (p, p'x) and (d, d'x) reactions are calculated by the one-step semiclassical distorted wave model. The radial distribution of the energy spectra for the (d, d'x) reaction is shifted toward the outer region of the nucleus compared to the (p, p'x) reaction. Based on this finding, we consider a larger surface correction into a phenomenological model for the (d, d'x) reaction than that for the (p, p'x) reaction, and calculated values reproduce the experimental (d, d'x) spectra well. The peripherality of the (d, d'x) reaction is more prominent than that of the (p, p'x) reaction. The stronger surface correction thus should be introduced for the (d, d'x) reaction than for the (p, p'x) reaction.</description>

Abstract: We examine the $\Lambda$-${}^4\mathrm{He}$ ($\alpha$) momentum correlation in high-energy collisions to elucidate the interaction between Lambdas ($\Lambda$) and nucleons ($N$). We compare phenomenological $\Lambda\alpha$ potentials with different strengths at short range. In addition to the conventional Gaussian-type potentials, we construct the $\Lambda\alpha$ potentials by substituting the nucleon density distribution in $\alpha$ into the Skyrme-type $\Lambda$ potentials. We find that the dependence on the employed potential models is visible in the correlation functions from a small-size source. This indicates that the $\Lambda\alpha$ momentum correlation could constrain the property of the $\Lambda N$ interaction at high densities, which is expected to play an essential role in dense nuclear matter. Also, we verify that the Lednicky-Lyuboshits formula can yield erroneous results for a small-size source with a potential which has a large interaction range, like the $\Lambda\alpha$ system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02610v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In non-central heavy-ion collisions, the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) encounters the most intense magnetic field ever produced in nature, with a strength of approximately 10$^{19 - 20}$ Gauss. Recent lattice-QCD calculations reveal that the QGP exhibits paramagnetic properties at high temperatures. When an external strong magnetic field is applied, it generates an anisotropic squeezing force density that competes with pressure gradients resulting from the purely QGP geometric expansion. In this study, we employ (3+1)-dimensional ideal hydrodynamics simulations to estimate the paramagnetic squeezing effect of this force density on the anisotropic expansion of QGP in non-central Pb+Pb collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). We consider both up-to-date magnetic susceptibility and various magnetic field profiles in this work. We find that the impact of rapidly decaying magnetic fields is insignificant, while enduring magnetic fields produce a strong force density that diminishes the momentum anisotropy of the QGP by up to 10% at the intial stage, leaving a visible imprint on the elliptic flow $v_{2}$ of final charged particles. Our results provide insights into the interplay between magnetic fields and the dynamics of QGP expansion in non-central heavy-ion collisions.</description>

Abstract: Recent measurements of high-momentum correlated neutron-proton pairs at JLab suggest that the dense nucleonic component of the compact stars contain a fraction of high-momentum neutron-proton pairs that is not accounted in the familiar Fermi-liquid theory of the neutron-proton fluid mixture. We compute the rate of the Urca process in compact stars taking into the non-Fermi liquid contributions to the proton's spectral widths induced by short-range correlations. The Urca rate differs strongly from the Fermi-liquid prediction at low temperatures, in particular, the high threshold on the proton fraction precluding the Urca process in neutron stars is lifted. This observation may have a profound impact on the theories of cooling of compact stars.</description>

Abstract: The Riccati-type nonlinear differential equation, also known as the Variable Phase Approach or Phase Function Method, is used to construct local inverse potentials for the \( ^3S_1 \) and \( ^1S_0 \) states of the deuteron. The Morse potential has been optimized by adjusting parameters using the Variational Monte Carlo (VMC) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) type Neural Networks (NN). The inverse potentials obtained from VMC and NN show almost identical parameters. In VMC, all three parameters of the Morse potential are varied to obtain the phase shifts, while in NN, the 3D-parameter optimization problem is converted to a 1D-parameter optimization problem, thus reducing optimization parameters, time, and computational cost.
  Recently, the GRANADA group published a comprehensive partial wave analysis of scattering data, which includes 6713 \( np \) phase shift data points from 1950 to 2013. Using the final experimental data points from GRANADA, we obtained the parameters for the Morse potential by minimizing the mean square error (MSE) as the cost function. The MSE using VMC (NN) is found to be 0.65 (2.5) for the \( ^1S_0 \) state and 0.16 (0.22) for the \( ^3S_1 \) state. Various quantum functions, such as phase \( \delta(r) \), amplitude \( A(r) \), and wave function \( u(r) \), are described up to 5 fm with energies \( E_{\ell ab} = [1-350 \text{ MeV}] \).</description>

      <title>Exciting Ions: a Systematic Treatment of Ultraperipheral Heavy Ion Collisions with Nuclear Breakup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.04826v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an updated theoretical treatment of ultraperipheral collisions (UPCs) of heavy ions, within the SuperChic Monte Carlo generator. This in particular accounts for mutual ion excitation through additional photon exchanges between the colliding ions. This effect occurs frequently in UPCs, and indeed can be (and has been) measured in data through the use of zero degree calorimeter (ZDC) detectors installed in the far forward region. The theoretical approach presented here accounts for the non-trivial and non-negligible impact such ion dissociation has on the measured cross sections and distributions of the produced particles in the central detectors. This builds on previous work, whereby the survival factor probability of no additional inelastic ion-ion scattering due to the strong interaction, and its kinematic impact, are also accounted for within the same overall framework. We compare to data from ATLAS and CMS at the LHC, and STAR at RHIC, and find in general encouraging agreement for a range of observables and ZDC neutron tags, with some room for further improvement, suggesting the inclusion of higher order QED effects and/or tuning of the the $\gamma A \to A^*$ cross section may be desirable. Overall, this gives confidence in the approach considered here and for applications to new phenomena within and beyond the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Conformal duality of the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation: Theory and applications to parameter estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.17720v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (NLSE) is a rich and versatile model, which in one spatial dimension has stationary solutions similar to those of the linear Schr\"odinger equation as well as more exotic solutions such as solitary waves and quantum droplets. Here we present the unified theory of the NLSE, showing that all stationary solutions of the local one-dimensional cubic-quintic NLSE can be classified according to a single number called the cross-ratio. Any two solutions with the same cross-ratio can be converted into one another using a conformal transformation, and the same also holds true for traveling wave solutions. Further, we introduce an optimization afterburner that relies on this conformal symmetry to substantially improve NLSE parameter estimation from noisy empirical data. The new method therefore should have far reaching practical applications for nonlinear physical systems.</description>

      <title>On the QCD critical point, Lee-Yang edge singularities and Pade resummations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06952v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the trajectory of the Lee-Yang edge singularities of the QCD equation of state in the complex baryon chemical potential ($\mu_B$) plane for different values of the temperature by using the recent lattice results for the Taylor expansion coefficients up to eighth order in $\mu_B$ and various resummation techniques that blend in Pade expansions and conformal maps. By extrapolating from this information, we estimate for the location of the QCD critical point, $ T_c \approx 100$ MeV, $\mu_c \approx 580$ MeV. We also estimate the crossover slope at the critical point to be $\alpha_1 \approx 9^\circ$ and further constrain the non-universal mapping parameters between the three dimensional Ising model and QCD equations of state.</description>

      <title>Steady electric currents in magnetized QCD and their use for the equation of state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06557v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the emergence of steady electric currents in QCD as a response to a non-uniform magnetic background using lattice simulations with 2 + 1 quark flavors at the physical point, as well as leading-order chiral perturbation theory. Using these currents, we develop a novel method to determine the leading-order coefficient of the equation of state in a magnetic field expansion: the magnetic susceptibility of the QCD medium. We decompose the current expectation value into valence- and sea-quark contributions and demonstrate that the dominant contribution to the electric current is captured by the valence term alone, allowing for a comparably cheap determination of the susceptibility. Our continuum extrapolated lattice results for the equation of state confirm the findings of some of the existing studies in the literature, namely that the QCD medium behaves diamagnetically at low and paramagnetically at high temperatures.</description>

      <title>Revisiting $O(N)$ $\sigma$ model at unphysical pion masses and high temperatures. II. The vacuum structure and thermal $\sigma$ pole trajectory with cross-channel improvements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11313v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The effective potential of the $O(N)$ model at large $N$ limit is reinvestigated with varying pion mass and temperature. For large pion masses and high temperatures, we find the phenomenologically favored vacuum, located on the upper branch of the double-branched effective potential for physical $m_\pi$, moves to the lower branch and becomes no longer a local minimum but a saddle point. The existence and running of the tachyon pole are also discussed. These phenomena indicate that the applicable energy range of $O(N)$ model is more and more limited as $m_\pi$ becoming larger and temperature going higher. With the effective coupling constant defined from the effective potential, the possible correspondence between the two branches of the effective potential and the two phases of the theory (distinguished by positive or negative coupling) is verified even with nonzero explicit symmetry breaking and at finite temperature. Also, we generalize the $N/D$ modified $O(N)$ model to study the thermal trajectory of the $\sigma$ pole with the cross-channel contributions considered and find the thermal $\sigma$ pole trajectory resembles its counterpart with varying pion mass at zero temperature.</description>

      <title>Scale setting and hadronic properties in light quark sector with $(2+1)$-flavor Wilson fermions at the physical point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16665v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report scale setting and hadronic properties for our new lattice QCD gauge configuration set (HAL-conf-2023). We employ $(2+1)$-flavor nonperturbatively improved Wilson fermions with stout smearing and the Iwasaki gauge action on a $96^4$ lattice, and generate configurations of 8,000 trajectories at the physical point. We show the basic properties of the configurations such as the plaquette value, topological charge distribution and their auto-correlation times. The scale setting is performed by detailed analyses of the $\Omega$ baryon mass. We calculate the physical results of quark masses, decay constants of pseudoscalar mesons and single hadron spectra in light quark sector. The masses of the stable hadrons are found to agree with the experimental values within a sub-percent level.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Polarisability of Octet Baryons via Lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01064v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Drawing on recent advances in lattice-QCD background-field techniques, the magnetic polarisability of octet baryons is calculated from the first principles of QCD. The results are presented in the context of new constituent quark-model calculations providing a framework for understanding the lattice results and a direct comparison with simulation results at unphysical quark masses. Using smeared quark sources, low-lying Laplacian eigenmode projection and final-state Landau mode projection, considerable attention is devoted to ensuring single-state isolation in the lattice correlation functions. We also introduce new weighting methods to reduce the sensitivity to correlation-function fits, averaging over many fits based on merit drawn from the full correlated $\chi^2$ of the fits. The techniques are implemented on the $32^3 \times 64$, 2+1-flavour dynamical-fermion lattices provided by the PACS-CS collaboration following the introduction of uniform magnetic fields quantised to the lowest nontrivial values available. After some fine tuning of the constituent quark model parameters, we find the model captures the patterns observed in the lattice QCD results very well, providing important insights into the physics underpinning the magnetic polarisabilities. Finally, comparison with the most recent results from experiment proceeds through an effective field theory formalism which incorporates estimates of finite-volume corrections and small electro-quenching corrections as the results are brought to the physical point. We find excellent agreement with experiment where available, including the proton and neutron polarisabilities.</description>

      <title>Precise determination of the $\eta \Lambda$ scattering length and effective range and relationship to the $\Lambda(1670)$ resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01410v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use the Belle data on the $K^- p$ mass distribution of the $\Lambda_c^+ \to p K^- \pi^+$ reaction near the $\eta \Lambda$ threshold to determine the $\eta \Lambda $ scattering length and effective range. We show that from these data alone we can determine the value of $a$ with better precision than so far determined, and the value of $r_0$ for the first time. The addition of the $K^- p \to \eta \Lambda$ data allows us to improve the precision of these magnitudes, with errors smaller than $15\%$. We also determine with high precision the pole position of the $\Lambda(1670)$.</description>
