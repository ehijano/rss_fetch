      <title>Fractional Statistics and Electron Transfer at Topological Defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a theoretical framework for electron transfer (ET) at graphene defects, treating the surface as a Dirac cone with a localized defect state coupled to a vibrational environment. Using a polaron transformation combined with a modified density of states, we derive an explicit expression for the ET rate that incorporates both vibrational reorganization and fractionalized quasiparticle statistics. We show that fractional statistics, modeled through a power-law density of states, suppress low-energy ET near resonance and introduce tunable deviations from conventional Marcus-like kinetics. Our results suggest that strain, defect engineering, or chemical modification could stabilize fractional excitations in graphene-based catalysts, offering new strategies for controlling surface reactivity. These findings provide a foundation for future experimental and computational investigations into the role of topology and fractional statistics in chemical electron transfer.</description>

      <title>A Mechanism-Guided Inverse Engineering Framework to Unlock Design Principles of H-Bonded Organic Frameworks for Gas Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The diverse combinations of novel building blocks offer a vast design space for hydrogen-boned frameworks (HOFs), rendering it a great promise for gas separation and purification. However, the underlying separation mechanism facilitated by their unique hydrogen-bond networks has not yet been fully understood. In this work, a comprehensive understanding of the separation mechanisms was achieved through an iterative data-driven inverse engineering approach established upon a hypothetical HOF database possessing nearly 110,000 structures created by a material genomics method. Leveraging a simple yet universal feature extracted from hydrogen bonding information with unambiguous physical meanings, the entire design space was exploited to rapidly identify the optimization route towards novel HOF structures with superior Xe/Kr separation performance (selectivity &gt;103). This work not only provides the first large-scale HOF database, but also demonstrates the enhanced machine learning interpretability of our model-driven iterative inverse design framework, offering new insights into the rational design of nanoporous materials for gas separation.</description>

      <title>How Salt Solvation Slows Water Dynamics While Blue-Shifting Its Dielectric Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Water inherently contains trace amounts of various salts, yet the microscopic processes by which salts influence some of its physical properties remain elusive. Notably, the mechanisms that reduce the dielectric constant of water upon salt addition are still debated. The primary absorption peak for electromagnetic radiation -- commonly used in microwave heating -- shifts towards higher frequencies in saline solutions, suggesting faster water molecular dynamics. This observation, however, contrasts with the simultaneous increase in viscosity and experimental reports that ionic solutes would slow down water molecular motion. In this work, we use molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with deep-neural-network models trained on high-quality quantum mechanical data to mimic interatomic forces and molecular dipoles, to compute the dielectric spectra of perchlorate water saline solution, which may be relevant to the recent discovery of liquid water beneath the thick ice crust at Mars's south pole. Our results reveal that both the reduction in the dielectric constant and the absorption peak shift can be attributed to ion-induced changes in the orientational ordering of water molecules. Additionally, we demonstrate that the self-part of the molecular dipole-dipole correlation function reveals clear signatures of the slowing dynamics within the first cationic solvation shell, consistent with the experimentally observed increase in viscosity.</description>

      <title>Linear Analysis of Stochastic Verlet-Type Integrators for Langevin Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide an analytical framework for analyzing the quality of stochastic Verlet-type integrators for simulating the Langevin equation. Focusing only on basic objective measures, we consider the ability of an integrator to correctly simulate characteristic configurational quantities of transport, a) diffusion on a flat surface and b) drift velocity on a tilted planar surface, as well as c) statistical sampling of a harmonic potential. For any stochastic Verlet-type integrator expressed in its configurational form, we develop closed form expressions to directly assess these three most basic quantities as a function of the applied time step. The applicability of the analysis is exemplified through twelve representative integrators developed over the past five decades, and algorithm performance is conveniently visualized through the three characteristic measures for each integrator. The GJ set of integrators stands out as the only option for correctly simulating diffusion, drift, and Boltzmann distribution in linear systems, and we therefore suggest that this general method is best suited for high quality thermodynamic simulations of nonlinear and complex systems, including for relatively high time steps compared to simulations with other integrators.</description>

      <title>Noble Gas Fractionation Predictions for High Speed Sampling in the Upper Atmosphere of Venus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Venus, our neighboring planet, is an open-air laboratory that can be used to study why Earth and Venus evolved in such different ways. Noble gases in planetary atmospheres are tracers of their geophysical evolution, and measuring the elemental and isotopic composition of noble gases in the Venus atmosphere informs us about the origin and evolution of the entire planet. In this work we describe a new SmallSat mission concept, Venus ATMOSpheric - Sample Return (VATMOS-SR), that would return gas samples from the upper atmosphere of Venus to Earth for scientific analysis. To ensure it is possible to relate the composition of the sampled gases (acquired when the spacecraft is traveling &gt;10 km/s) to the free stream atmospheric composition, large-scale numerical simulations are employed to model the flow into and through the sampling system. An emphasis is placed on quantifying noble gas elemental and isotopic fractionation that occurs during the sample acquisition and transfer process, to determine how measured isotopic ratios of noble gases in the sample would compare to the actual isotopic ratios in the Venusian atmosphere. We find that lighter noble gases are depleted after they are sampled compared to the freestream conditions, and heavier ones are enriched, due to the high pressure gradients present in the flowfield. Finally, we observe that, in general, the numerical parameters do not have a major impact on the observed fractionation. However, the freestream velocity and density have a major impact on fractionation and need to be precisely known to properly reconstruct the fractionation in the sampling system. We demonstrate that the sample fractionation can be predicted with numerical simulations, and believe that VATMOS-SR, which could be the first mission to bring back samples from another planet, could answer key scientific questions related to understanding the evolution of Venus.</description>

      <title>Core-Ionized States and X-ray Photoelectron Spectra of Solids From Periodic Algebraic Diagrammatic Construction Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first-ever implementation and benchmark of periodic algebraic diagrammatic construction theory (ADC) for core-ionized states and X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) in crystalline materials. Using a triple-zeta Gaussian basis set and accounting for finite-size and scalar relativistic effects, the strict and extended second-order ADC approximations (ADC(2) and ADC(2)-X) predict the core ionization energies of weakly correlated solids within ~ 1.5 and 0.5 eV of experimental measurements, respectively. We further demonstrate that the ADC(2)-X method can capture the satellite features in XPS spectra of graphite, cubic and hexagonal boron nitride, and TiO2, albeit significantly overestimating their energies. The ADC(2)-X calculations reveal that the satellite transitions display strong configuration interaction with excitations involving several frontier orbitals delocalized in phase space. Our work demonstrates that ADC is a promising first-principles approach for simulating the core-excited states and X-ray spectra of materials, highlighting its potential and motivating further development.</description>

      <title>A 3D pocket-aware and evolutionary conserved interaction guided diffusion model for molecular optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generating molecules that bind to specific protein targets via diffusion models has shown good promise for structure-based drug design and molecule optimization. Especially, the diffusion models with binding interaction guidance enables molecule generation with high affinity through forming favorable interaction within protein pocket. However, the generated molecules may not form interactions with the highly conserved residues, which are important for protein functions and bioactivities of the ligands. Herein, we developed a new 3D target-aware diffusion model DiffDecip, which explicitly incorporates the protein-ligand binding interactions and evolutionary conservation information of protein residues into both diffusion and sampling process, for molecule optimization through scaffold decoration. The model performance revealed that DiffDecip outperforms baseline model DiffDec on molecule optimization towards higher affinity through forming more non-covalent interactions with highly conserved residues in the protein pocket.</description>

      <title>Periodic implementation of the random phase approximation with numerical atomic orbitals and dual reciprocal space grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The random phase approximation (RPA) has emerged as a prominent first-principles method in material science, particularly to study the adsorption and chemisorption of small molecules on surfaces. However, its widespread application is hampered by its relatively high computational cost. Here, we present a well-parallelised implementation of the RPA with localised atomic orbitals and pair-atomic density fitting, which is especially suitable for studying two-dimensional systems. Through a dual $\textbf{k}$-grid scheme, we achieve fast and reliable convergence of RPA correlation energies to the thermodynamic limit. We demonstrate the efficacy of our implementation through an application to the adsorption of CO on MgO(001) using PBE input orbitals (RPA@PBE) Our calculated adsorption energy in in good agreement with previously published RPA@PBE studies, but, as expected, overestimates the experimentally available adsorption energies as well as recent CCSD(T) results.</description>

      <title>Role of defects in atom probe analysis of sol-gel silica</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Silica is a suitable material to encapsulate proteins at room temperature, enabling their analysis at the atomic level using laser-assisted atom probe tomography (La- APT). In this study, we show that UV and deep-UV lasers can achieve a high success rate in La-APT of silica in terms of chemical resolution and three-dimensional image volume, with both lasers providing comparable results. Since the La-APT analyses are driven by photon absorption, in order to understand the mechanisms behind the enhanced absorption of UV light, we performed density functional theory calculations to model the electronic and optical properties of amorphous silica matrices generated using a Monte Carlo approach to structural optimisation. In particular, we have investigated the role of various defects introduced during sample preparation, such as substitutional and interstitial carbon, sodium and gallium ions, and hydrogen. Our results show that the presence of defects increases the absorption of silica in the UV and deep-UV range and thus improves the La-APT capabilities of the material. However, due to the low density of free charge carriers resulting from the absorption of laser energy by defects, deviations from the nominal chemical composition and suboptimal chemical resolution may occur, potentially limiting the optimal acquisition of APT mass spectra.</description>

      <title>MachMachine Learning Accelerated Descriptor Design for Catalyst Discovery in CO$_2$ to Methanol Conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13838v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transforming CO$_2$ into methanol represents a crucial step towards closing the carbon cycle, with thermoreduction technology nearing industrial application. However, obtaining high methanol yields and ensuring the stability of heterocatalysts remain significant challenges. Herein, we present a sophisticated computational framework to accelerate the discovery of thermal heterogeneous catalysts, using machine-learned force fields. We propose a new catalytic descriptor, termed adsorption energy distribution, that aggregates the binding energies for different catalyst facets, binding sites, and adsorbates. The descriptor is versatile and can be adjusted to a specific reaction through careful choice of the key-step reactants and reaction intermediates. By applying unsupervised machine learning and statistical analysis to a dataset comprising nearly 160 metallic alloys, we offer a powerful tool for catalyst discovery. We propose new promising candidates such as ZnRh and ZnPt$_3$, which to our knowledge, have not yet been tested, and discuss their possible advantage in terms of stability.</description>

      <title>Identifying Split Vacancy Defects with Machine-Learned Foundation Models and Electrostatics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19330v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Point defects are ubiquitous in solid-state compounds, dictating many functional properties such as conductivity, catalytic activity and carrier recombination. Over the past decade, the prevalence of metastable defect geometries and their importance to relevant properties has been increasingly recognised. A striking example is split vacancies, where an isolated atomic vacancy transforms to a stoichiometry-conserving complex of two vacancies and an interstitial ($V_X \rightarrow [V_X + X_i + V_X]$), which can be accompanied by a dramatic energy lowering and change in behaviour. These species are particularly challenging to identify from computation, due to the `non-local' nature of this reconstruction. Here, I present an approach for the efficient identification of these defects, through tiered screening which combines geometric analysis, electrostatic energies and foundation machine learning (ML) models. This approach allows the screening of all solid-state compounds in the Materials Project database (including all entries in the ICSD, along with several thousand predicted metastable materials), identifying thousands of low energy split vacancy configurations, hitherto unknown. This study highlights both the potential utility of (foundation) machine-learning potentials, with important caveats, the significant prevalence of split vacancy defects in inorganic solids, and the importance of global optimisation approaches for defect modelling.</description>
