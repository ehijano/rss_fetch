      <title>Asset Pricing in the Presence of Market Microstructure Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present two models for incorporating the total effect of market microstructure noise into dynamic pricing of assets and European options. The first model is developed under a Black-Scholes-Merton, continuous-time framework. The second model is a discrete, binomial tree model developed as an extension of the static Grossman-Stiglitz model. Both models are market complete, providing a unique equivalent martingale measure that establishes a unique map between parameters governing the risk-neutral and real-world price dynamics. We provide empirical examples to extract the coefficients in the model, in particular those coefficients characterizing the influence of the microstructure noise on prices. In addition to isolating the impact of noise on the volatility, the discrete model enables us to extract the noise impact on the drift coefficient. We provide evidence for the primary microstructure noise we believe our empirical examples capture.</description>

      <title>High-Dimensional Spatial Arbitrage Pricing Theory with Heterogeneous Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates estimation and inference of a Spatial Arbitrage Pricing Theory (SAPT) model that integrates spatial interactions with multi-factor analysis, accommodating both observable and latent factors. Building on the classical mean-variance analysis, we introduce a class of Spatial Capital Asset Pricing Models (SCAPM) that account for spatial effects in high-dimensional assets, where we define {\it spatial rho} as a counterpart to market beta in CAPM. We then extend SCAPM to a general SAPT framework under a {\it complete} market setting by incorporating multiple factors. For SAPT with observable factors, we propose a generalized shrinkage Yule-Walker (SYW) estimation method that integrates ridge regression to estimate spatial and factor coefficients. When factors are latent, we first apply an autocovariance-based eigenanalysis to extract factors, then employ the SYW method using the estimated factors. We establish asymptotic properties for these estimators under high-dimensional settings where both the dimension and sample size diverge. Finally, we use simulated and real data examples to demonstrate the efficacy and usefulness of the proposed model and method.</description>

      <title>Automate Strategy Finding with LLM in Quant Investment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06289v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel three-stage framework leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) within a risk-aware multi-agent system for automate strategy finding in quantitative finance. Our approach addresses the brittleness of traditional deep learning models in financial applications by: employing prompt-engineered LLMs to generate executable alpha factor candidates across diverse financial data, implementing multimodal agent-based evaluation that filters factors based on market status, predictive quality while maintaining category balance, and deploying dynamic weight optimization that adapts to market conditions. Experimental results demonstrate the robust performance of the strategy in Chinese &amp; US market regimes compared to established benchmarks. Our work extends LLMs capabilities to quantitative trading, providing a scalable architecture for financial signal extraction and portfolio construction. The overall framework significantly outperforms all benchmarks with 53.17% cumulative return on SSE50 (Jan 2023 to Jan 2024), demonstrating superior risk-adjusted performance and downside protection on the market.</description>
