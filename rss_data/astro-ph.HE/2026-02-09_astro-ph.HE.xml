      <title>Searching for dark matter signals with high energy astrophysical neutrinos in IceCube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-energy neutrinos provide a potentially powerful and distinctive probe for dark matter (DM) - neutrino interactions, particularly in environments with enhanced DM densities, such as the DM spikes predicted to form around supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at the center of active galactic nuclei (AGN). Recent observations by the IceCube Neutrino Observatory, which identified four AGN, namely TXS 0506+056, NGC 1068, PKS 1424+240, and NGC 4151 as neutrino sources, provide a unique opportunity to search for signatures of these interactions. In this study, we use IceCube data to derive the most stringent constraints to date on both the energy-dependent and energy-independent DM-neutrino scattering cross-sections. We perform a statistical analysis using data from individual sources as well as a combined (stacked) analysis of all four sources. Our strongest limits arise from the stacking analysis, yielding an upper bound of $\sigma_{0} \le 8\times 10^{-39}$ cm$^2$ for an energy-independent cross-section and $\sigma_{0} \le 10^{-39}$ cm$^2$ for a linearly energy-dependent cross-section, both at 90\% confidence level, particularly in scenarios involving the adiabatic growth of black holes.</description>

      <title>Ne and Fe abundances in the ISM: Archival Study of Fe-L and Ne-K edges in Chandra and XMM-Newton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The abundance of elements in the interstellar medium (ISM) is a key facet for many fields of astrophysical study. In the soft X-ray spectra, absorption by interstellar gas can result in deep absorption features that affect continuum measurements. In this paper, we focus on measuring the abundance of interstellar iron and neon from the column densities observed in soft spectra from XMM-Newton and Chandra for various low mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs), which allows for a direct probe of elemental abundances. As a noble gas, neon will not deplete into solid form, thus providing a benchmark with abundances determined via UV spectroscopy. We find that, when assuming Fe is 90\% depleted into grains, [Fe/Ne]$ = -0.523\pm0.025$, [Fe/H]$ + 12 = 7.482\pm0.016$, and [Ne/H]$ + 12 = 8.012\pm0.022$, which are the tightest observational constraints on these abundances to date, while being consistent with literature which uses protosolar abundances. We also test how depletion into solid grains and scattering affect the results. The choice of depletion fraction can affect the abundance measurement by roughly $5\%$, and that the inclusion of a scattering component can affect abundance measurements by $\sim1-7\%$.</description>

      <title>How Neutron Star Observations Point Towards Exotic Matter: Existing Explanations and a Prospective Proposal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-messenger astronomical observations of neutron stars, together with more precise calculations and constraints coming from dense matter microphysics, are generating tension with regard to equations of state models used to describe neutron star cores. Assuming an abrupt first-order phase transition with a slow conversion speed between phases, we propose different slow stable hybrid star configurations aiming to reconcile all current constraints simultaneously; within this framework, we also introduce a novel non-CSS parametrization to the quark matter equation of state and discuss its strengths and limitations. We analyze our model results in conjunction with a review of other relevant theoretical possibilities existing in the literature. We found that modern neutron star observations seem to favor the existence of some type of exotic matter in the neutron star cores; in particular, our slow stable hybrid star scenario remains a proposal capable of satisfying these constraints. However, due both to the existing skepticism regarding some of the adopted hypotheses in most extreme neutron star measurements and to the precise adjustment needed for the equation-of-state parameters, significant tension and open questions remain.</description>

      <title>Hypersoft X-ray Sources: A New Class of Luminous Cosmic Emitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray binaries, powered by black holes, neutron stars, or white dwarfs accreting matter from a companion star, are among the brightest beacons in galaxies, outshining the Sun by a factor of millions. Most emit primarily above 0.3 keV in X-rays, but cooler thermal sources peaking in the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) would be much more difficult to detect due to astronomy's critical blind spot in EUV. Here, we report the discovery of a remarkable new class of luminous, point-like, non-nuclear X-ray objects in galaxies-hypersoft X-ray sources -- that have been missed by all previous surveys to date. Detected primarily or exclusively below 0.3 keV, with 0.15-0.3 keV to 0.3-1.0 keV photon ratios &gt;8, the most luminous examples radiate &gt;1E38 erg/s in the narrow X-ray band, with spectral models indicating even greater bolometric luminosities, largely emitted in the EUV. They rank among the most energetic sources in galaxies, yet their EUV-peaking spectra evaded earlier detections. We propose that hypersoft sources are X-ray binaries spanning multiple physical classes, including accreting white dwarfs or post-nova systems-potential Type Ia supernova progenitors-and systems hosting accreting black holes. Beyond their elusive nature, they may play crucial role in ionizing gas within galaxies.</description>

      <title>An Archival Optical Counterpart Search for Extragalactic Fast X-Ray Transients Discovered by Einstein Probe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extragalactic fast X-ray transients (eFXTs) represent a rapidly growing class of high-energy phenomena, whose physical origins remain poorly understood. With its wide-field, sensitive all-sky monitoring, the Einstein Probe (EP) has greatly increased the discovery rate of eFXTs. The search and identification of the optical counterparts of eFXT are vital for understanding their classification and constraining their physical origin. Yet, a considerable fraction of eFXTs still lack secure classifications due to the absence of timely follow-up observations. We carry out a systematic search of publicly available optical survey data and transient databases (including the Zwicky Transient Facility, ZTF, and the Transient Name Server, TNS) for optical counterparts to eFXT candidates detected by EP. In this paper, we describe our ongoing program and report the first results. Specifically, we identified the eFXT EP240506a to be associated with a UV/optical counterpart, AT 2024ofs. Spectroscopy of its host galaxy with VLT yields a redshift of $z = 0.120 \pm 0.002$. By combining archival survey data with early-time multiwavelength observations, we find that the luminosity and light-curve evolution of AT~2024ofs are consistent with a core-collapse supernova origin. From detectability simulations, we estimate a local event rate density $\rho_{0}=8.8^{+21.2}_{-3.9}\ \mathrm{yr^{-1}\, Gpc^{-3}}$ for EP240506a-like events, and completeness-corrected rate of about $36$--$78\ \mathrm{yr^{-1}\ Gpc^{-3}}$ for EP-detected X-ray transients associated with supernovae. Our results demonstrate the potential of EP to uncover prompt high-energy emission from core-collapse supernovae and underscore the critical importance of timely follow-up of future eFXT events.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Hole signatures from femtolensing and spectral fringe of Gamma Ray Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Femtolensing of gamma ray bursts (GRBs) are vastly studied to constrain the primordial black hole (PBHs) lighter than $10^{-13}$ solar mass and may close the window for PBH dark matter. In this case, wave optics formalism is required and carefully implemented in our analysis. Incorporating the GRB observational data from Swift XRT, we perform the statistic analysis of PBH lensing, comparing with null hypothesis where BAND model is used to parametrize the GRB spectrum. We found few GRB data manifest the spectral fringe which characterize the feature of femtolensing by PBHs, and the analysis shows moderate statistical preference in terms of goodness of fit. Conversely, since most of the fitting to GRB spectral data do not improved with PBH lensing, we utilize to obtain upper bound on the PBH fractional abundance with respect to dark matter. However, the robust constraint cannot be achieved, unless the size of GRBs are smaller than $5\times10^{7}$ m for PBH mass around $5\times10^{-15}$ solar mass.</description>

      <title>Super-knee cosmic rays from interacting supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is increasing evidence that, in the very late phase of stellar evolution before core collapse, massive stars have winds with large mass loss rates that give rise to a dense circumstellar medium (CSM) surrounding the progenitor star. After core collapse, a shock wave forms when the supernova ejecta interacts with this CSM. In such an interaction, the nuclei in the CSM can undergo diffusive shock acceleration and reach very high energies. We consider such a model, which includes magnetic field amplification from the non-resonant streaming instability, enhancement to the abundance of heavy-ions, and composition-dependent acceleration. Applying this to several supernova subclasses, we find that IIn supernovae can supply a dominant fraction of the observed super-knee cosmic-ray (CR) flux from $\sim{\rm few}\times10^{15}\,{\rm eV}$ to $\sim{\rm few}\times10^{17}\,{\rm eV}$ and is consistent with recent LHAASO measurements above the CR knee. This systematic model also explains the increasingly heavy nuclear composition in this energy range.</description>

      <title>Studies on the spin and magnetic inclination evolution of magnetars Swift J1834.9-0846 under wind braking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetar Swift J1834.9-0846 presents a significant challenge to neutron star spin-down models. It exhibits two key anomalies: an insufficient rotational energy loss rate to power its observed X-ray luminosity, and a braking index of $ = 1.08\pm 0.04$, which starkly contradicts the canonical magnetic dipole value of $n=3$. To explain these anomalies, we develop a unified spin-evolution model that self-consistently integrates magnetic dipole radiation, gravitational wave emission, and wind braking. Within this framework, we constrain the wind braking parameter to $\kappa \in [13, 37]$ from the nebular properties, finding it contributes substantially (17%-51%) to the current spin-down torque. Bayesian inference reveals that the birth period is poorly constrained by present data and is prior-dependent, indicating a millisecond birth is allowed but not required. Furthermore, we constrain the number of precession cycles to $\xi \sim 10^{4}$--$10^{5}$, and our analysis favors a toroidally-dominated internal magnetic field configuration as the most self-consistent explanation for the low braking index. Finally, we assess the continuous gravitational-wave detectability. The present-day signal is undetectable. However, the early-time signal might have reached the projected sensitivity of next-generation gravitational-wave observatories, such as the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (aLIGO) and the Einstein Telescope (ET), although a confident detection would require exceptionally stable rotation, an assumption considered highly optimistic for a young magnetar. This work establishes a unified framework that links magnetar spin-down with their interior physics and multi-messenger observables, providing a physically consistent interpretation for Swift J1834.9-0846 and a new tool for understanding similar extreme neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Rotational Behaviour of Exotic Compact Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct exotic compact objects composed entirely of self-interacting asymmetric fermionic dark matter governed by a repulsive Yukawa potential with massive dark interaction boson. By considering the structural, tidal, and rotational properties of solar mass self-gravitating dark matter systems, and contrasting them against purely baryonic neutron stars, described by the well understood SLy4 equation of state, we hope to shed some light on the place of dark compact systems in the context of gravitational wave astronomy, specifically due to the difficulty parsing mass and radius data from events with no electromagnetic counterpart. Here we consider systems composed of 1 GeV and 10 GeV dark matter. Relevant compact objects are then analysed and simulated as both static bodies, and rotating systems governed by the Hartle-Thorne formalism to second order. Here within we highlight the differences in key tidal and rotational properties encoded in gravitational wave signals, and analyse how dark objects may mimic or distinguish themselves to current and future gravitational wave observatories.</description>

      <title>Sensipy: simulate gamma-ray observations of transient astrophysical sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present sensipy, an open-source Python toolkit for simulating observations of transient astrophysical sources, particularly in the high-energy (HE, keV-GeV) and very-high-energy (VHE, GeV-TeV) gamma-ray ranges. The most explosive events in our universe are often short-lived, emitting the bulk of their energy in a relatively narrow time window. Due to often rapidly fading emission profiles, understanding how and when to observe these sources is crucial both to test theoretical predictions and efficiently optimize available telescope time. The information extracted from the tools included in sensipy can be used to help astronomers investigate the detectability of sources considering various theoretical assumptions about their emission processes and mechanisms. This information can further help to justify the feasibility of proposed observations, estimate detection rates (events/year) for various classes of sources, and provide scheduling insight in realtime during gamma-ray and multi-messenger observational campaigns.</description>

      <title>Forecasting Supermassive Black Hole Binary Gravitational Wave Probes: Prospects for Future Pulsar Timing Array and Space-Borne Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive framework for predicting the detection prospects of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) by future gravitational wave (GW) observatories, examining both space-borne detectors (LISA, Taiji, TianQin) and next-generation pulsar timing array (PTA) combined with the Square Kilometre Array (SKA-PTA). Leveraging dual active galactic nucleus (AGN) fractions and AGN X-ray luminosity functions, we systematically evaluate the detectable SMBHB populations with a detection threshold of signal-to-noise ratio $\geq 5$ for each GW observatory. Our analysis reveals that space-borne detectors are expected to identify approximately $\sim 1 \text{--} 2$ to $\sim 20$ events per year, depending on the SMBHB orbital evolution prescriptions. On the other hand, SKA-PTA demonstrates the potential to reach the first GW detection from individual SMBHBs within a few years of observation and achieve detectable GW source counts of $10^2 \text{--} 10^3$ after about 10 years, depending on PTA configurations. These facilities will significantly improve SMBHB detectability and enable characterization of their properties across different frequency bands.</description>

      <title>Merger Driven or Internal Evolution? A New Morphological Study of Tidal Disruption Event Host Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Host galaxies of tidal disruption events (TDEs) show enhanced central stellar concentration and are preferentially found in post-starburst and green valley populations. This connection has led to the proposal that TDE host galaxies likely have gone through recent mergers. We conduct a new morphological study of 14 TDE host galaxies, using the r-band images from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey (DECaLS), and Ultraviolet Near-Infrared Optical Northern Survey (UNIONS), with the images from the latter two surveys having much higher depth and resolution than SDSS. We examine galaxy structures using conventional methods and also apply diagnostics of merger activity from machine learning models. Consistent with previous studies, our results show that TDE host galaxies are ~16% more centrally concentrated when compared to non-TDE-host controls. However, surprisingly, TDE hosts lack any indication of recent merger activity from both morphological analysis and our machine learning merger classifier. Instead, our results reveal that TDE host galaxies are approximately 1.5 to 2.5 times more likely to have bar-like or ring-like structures than their controls. This enhancement is even more prominent for TDEs in the green valley, with the factor reaching almost 3. Based on these results, we propose that bar-driven secular evolution, instead of merger, likely dominates the recent evolution of TDE hosts found in the green valley, which can simultaneously explain their distinctive nuclear properties and enhanced TDE rates.</description>

      <title>Optical spectral characterization of OP 313. Constraining the contribution of thermal and non-thermal optical emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quasar OP 313 was discovered in December 2023 in very-high-energy $\gamma$ rays above 100 GeV, enabling for the first time a complete characterization of its emission. However, the lack of updated measurements of its accretion disk, broad line region and dusty torus hampers a detailed interpretation of the role of accretion in the observed $\gamma$-ray production. We intend to characterize, during high-activity states, the external photon fields contributing to the IR-to-UV emission$-$namely dusty torus, broad line region and accretion disk$-$and investigate potential variability and blurring effects on the broad emission lines. We present new spectroscopic observations of OP 313 with the NOT and TNG telescopes to characterize its optical spectrum and variability with respect to archival observations from SDSS. We measure the luminosity of different broad emission lines, characterizing the broad line region, accretion disk and dusty torus. We measure the Mg II emission line, with an average flux of $F_{\mathrm{Mg \ II}} = (0.85 \pm 0.11)\times 10^{-14}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. Its equivalent width and luminosity are consistent with a constant line with a variable non-thermal continuum. From the stable Mg II line we derive a constant luminosity of the thermal components, $\log(L_{\mathrm{BLR}} \ \mathrm{[erg \ s^{-1}]}) = 44.91 \pm 0.19$, $\log(L_{\mathrm{disk}} \ \mathrm{[erg \ s^{-1}]}) = 45.91 \pm 0.19$ and $\log(L_{\mathrm{torus}} \ \mathrm{[erg \ s^{-1}]}) = 44.70 \pm 0.16$, and estimated a BH mass of $\log(M_{BH}/M_{\odot})=8.36 \pm 0.18$, in line with with that derived from the C III] line. These characteristics and the indicator of the accretion rate from the disk/Eddington luminosity ratio $\lambda =L_{AD}/L_{Edd} = 0.23 \pm 0.10$, along with a high Compton dominance, favour a FSRQ-like nature, contrary to the argued changing-look nature.</description>

      <title>Mapping plasma properties of Cassiopeia A with XRISM/Resolve: a Bayesian analysis via UltraSPEX</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mapping the physical conditions of the shocked plasma of young supernova remnants (SNR) is crucial for understanding their explosion mechanisms, ejecta structure, and large-scale asymmetries. Using $&gt;350$ ks of XRISM/Resolve high spectral resolution observations of Cassiopeia A (Cas A), the youngest known Galactic core-collapse SNR, we present the first microcalorimeter-based plasma parameter maps of any SNR. We tessellate Cas A into $1'\times1'$ regions and fit the broadband spectra as thermal emission from two pure-metal ejecta components -- corresponding to intermediate-mass elements (IMEs) and iron-group elements (IGEs) -- plus nonthermal synchrotron radiation. For robust inference, we introduce UltraSPEX, a Bayesian framework that couples the SPEX plasma code with the UltraNest nested-sampling algorithm, yielding full posterior distributions and exploration of parameter degeneracies. Key findings include enhanced Ar/Si and Ca/Si abundance ratios near the base of the Si-rich jets, and a high Ni/Fe mass ratio ($0.08\pm0.015$) in the base of NE jet. IGEs ejecta exhibit systematically higher Doppler velocities and broadenings than IMEs ejecta in most regions, with maximum differences of $\sim800$ km/s and $\sim1200$ km/s, respectively; Ca shows distinct (faster) kinematics from other IMEs in several SE regions. The ionization timescale and electron temperature show a robust anti-correlation, particularly for IGEs. This relation and measured parameter values could be explained by semi-analytical models with significant ejecta clumping (overdensities of $\sim10$ for IGEs and up to $\sim100$ for IMEs) and reduced historical reverse-shock velocities. Nonthermal emission accounts for a substantial fraction, with at least 47% of the 4--6 keV continuum and dominates in the western regions, where the spectrum hardens.</description>

      <title>Spectral Appearance of Self-gravitating AGN Disks Powered by Stellar Objects: Universal Effective Temperature in the Optical Continuum and Application to Little Red Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the spectral appearance of extended self-gravitating accretion disks around supermassive black holes. Using dust-poor opacity tables, we show that all optically thick disk solutions possess a universal outer effective temperature of $T_{\rm eff}\sim 4000-4500$K, closely resembling compact, high-redshift sources known as Little Red Dots (LRDs). Assuming the extended disk is primarily heated by stellar sources, this ``disk Hayashi limit" fixes the dominant optical continuum temperature of the disk spectrum independent of accretion rate $\dot{M}$, black hole mass $M_\bullet$, and disk viscosity $\alpha$, and removes the parameter-tuning required in previous disk interpretations of LRDs. We construct global self-gravitating accretion disk models with radially varying accretion rates, suggesting that burning of embedded stellar objects can both efficiently power the emission of the outer disk and hollow out the inner disk, strongly suppressing variable UV/X-ray associated with a standard quasar. The resulting disk emission is dominated by a luminous optical continuum while a separate, non-variable UV component arises from stellar populations on the nuclear to galaxy scale. We map the optimal region of parameter space for such systems and show that LRD-like appearances are guaranteed for $\dot{M}/\alpha \gtrsim 0.1 M_\odot /{\rm yr}$, a threshold insensitive to $M_\bullet$, below which the system may transition into classical non-self-gravitating AGN disks, potentially a later evolution stage. We expect this transition to be accompanied by the enhancement of metallicity and production of dust, giving rise to far infrared emission. This picture offers a physically motivated and quantitative framework connecting LRDs with AGNs and their associated nuclear stellar population.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter Heating of Compact Stars Beyond Capture: A Relativistic Framework for Energy Deposition by Particle Beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Compact astrophysical objects, such as neutron stars and white dwarfs, can act as detectors of energetic particle fluxes originating from astrophysical accelerators. While most existing capture and heating calculations assume isotropic very low energetic incident fluxes from the halo dark matter, many realistic sources produce highly directional beams or jets, for which gravitational focusing, trajectory multiplicity, and local energy deposition must be treated consistently. In this work, we develop a general relativistic formalism to compute the local density, capture probability, and energy deposition of particles arriving as directed beams onto compact objects. The framework is based on the mapping of an asymptotic particle flux to local densities through geodesic congruences, allowing for gravitational focusing, multi-stream regions, and optical depth effects to be incorporated in a unified way. The formalism applies to arbitrary particle species and interaction models, and separates capture from through-going energy deposition in a frame-consistent manner. As an explicit application, we consider relativistic particle beams generated in astrophysical jets and evaluate their interaction with two compact objects samples: a white dwarf and a neutron star. In particular, we illustrate the framework using boosted dark matter produced in a list of 324 blazars as a representative case study, computing the resulting fluxes and the associated heating in the selected stars. Additional regimes such as the interaction roof and geometric limit are discussed, highlighting the conditions under which compact objects can efficiently convert incident beam energy into observable heating.</description>

Abstract: Stellar high-energy radiation is a key driver of atmospheric erosion and evolution in exoplanets, directly affecting their long-term habitability. We present a comprehensive study on stellar high-energy radiation and its impact on exoplanetary atmospheres, leveraging data from the \textit{SRG/eROSITA} all-sky survey. Our sample consists of 3750 main-sequence stars identified by cross-matching with \textit{Gaia} DR3. Utilizing X-ray spectral fits from the \textit{eROSITA} catalog, we computed X-ray ($L_X$) and combined extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) luminosities ($L_{\mathrm{EUV}}$), which we used to derive XUV fluxes at the habitable zone ($F_{\mathrm{XUV,HZ}}$). We find that the majority of stars in our sample are significantly more XUV-active than the Sun, with habitable zone fluxes ranging from $10^0$ to $10^5$ erg~cm$^{-2}$~s$^{-1}$. The ratio of $L_{\mathrm{XUV}}/L_{\mathrm{bol}}$ is found to be higher for cooler, magnetically active stars, highlighting their potentially hazardous nature for planetary atmospheres. Applying the energy-limited escape model, we computed atmospheric mass-loss rates for hypothetical earth-like planets located at the habitable zone of each star. We also present local maps for distances up to $500$~pc of the average XUV flux, revealing ``hazard zones'' where stellar radiation could significantly influence planetary atmospheric evolution. This work demonstrates the power of X-ray surveys in constraining the high-energy environments of exoplanets and underscores the critical role of stellar activity in planetary habitability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.06589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutron monitors are a standard tool for high-precision continuous monitoring of galactic cosmic ray flux variations arising from variations in heliospheric conditions and solar activity for space weather applications. These measurements form the basis for solving the inverse problem of determining the cosmic ray anisotropy vector beyond the magnetosphere. To support such studies, periodic latitude measurements are necessary to determine the coupling functions of primary and secondary cosmic rays variations. The aim of this work is to develop and characterize a modernized standard neutron monitor based on a CHM-15 boron thermal neutron counter and a data acquisition system designed for marine expeditionary studies of cosmic ray variations. Modern nuclear physics experimental methods and the principles of microprocessor-based data acquisition systems were used to solve this problem. The results of test trials and of continuous monitoring showed that the characteristics of the upgraded and standard neutron monitor are similar, and the ease of use, compactness, and stability allow us to conclude that the mobile neutron detector can be used in expeditionary conditions with limited access for maintenance personnel.</description>

      <title>Chiral phase transition with primordial black holes: Distinct phase structure and catalysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the impact of primordial black holes (PBHs) on the chiral phase transition and its associated stochastic gravitational-wave (GW) signals. Using the three-flavor Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model, we construct the chiral effective potential in a Schwarzschild spacetime background. We find that PBHs promote chiral symmetry restoration and induce a nontrivial local phase structure in the vicinity of the event horizon simultaneously. In particular, this structure exhibits a novel chiral symmetry breaking pattern involving both second- and first-order phase transitions, a feature absent in flat spacetime. We further demonstrate that PBHs act as genuine catalysts for the chiral phase transition by analyzing the bounce solution in curved spacetime. The presence of PBHs substantially enhances the inverse duration parameter $\beta/H$ while leaving the overall transition strength comparable to that in flat spacetime. As a consequence, even a small population of PBHs can induce $\mathcal{O}(1)$ shifts in both the peak frequency and the peak amplitude of the GW spectrum generated by the first-order dark chiral phase transition.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Constraints on the Neutron Star Equation of State with a Smooth Hadron-Quark Crossover</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform a Bayesian inference of the dense-matter equation of state (EOS) within a unified framework that incorporates hadronic matter, quark matter, and a smooth hadron--quark crossover. The EOS is constrained using physical consistency filters, gravitational-wave data from GW170817, NICER mass--radius measurements, and hypothetical future high-precision radius data. We find that current observations strongly constrain the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy, particularly its slope and curvature, while the highest-density hadronic parameters and quark-matter parameters remain only weakly constrained. The posterior distributions favor a crossover centered at an energy density $\overline{\varepsilon}\sim(4$--$6)\varepsilon_0$ with a width $\Gamma\sim(0.5$--$1.0)\varepsilon_0$, where $\varepsilon_0$ is the energy density of symmetric nuclear matter at saturation. The most probable radius of a canonical neutron star is $R_{1.4}\simeq 11.5-13.0$ km, and the maximum mass is $M_{\rm TOV}\simeq 2.2\,M_\odot$. Overall, present data primarily probe the low-to-intermediate density EOS and provide limited direct sensitivity to quark matter and genuinely high-density physics, highlighting the need for next-generation precision radius measurements.</description>

      <title>Spin Light of neutrino in polarized matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Spin Light of neutrino ($SL\nu$) is an electromagnetic radiation of the neutrino magnetic moment emitted when neutrino moves in external conditions (fields or matter). The effect can be of significance in the extremely dense matter of compact astrophysical objects such as neutron stars (NS). If detected, this radiation could provide a fair opportunity to study the properties of neutrinos and the medium through which they move, since the properties of the radiation depend on both. Motivated by the possibility of the nuclear matter spin-polarization, in this paper, we study the new properties to $SL\nu$ obtained under the influence of net matter polarization. We demonstrate that the polarization can enhance or completely suppress the radiation. Also, it introduces a characteristic asymmetry into the total radiation from the compact object, which could be an observable feature dependent on the matter polarization and the magnetic field inside the stellar (if the field is connected to the stellar matter polarization). The research may have implications for the physics of NS and magnetars, bringing us closer to the possibility of studying their internal structure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.06815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present the first extension of the Many-Body Forces (MBF) Model to finite temperature. The MBF Model describes nuclear matter in a relativistic quantum hadrodynamics formalism that takes many-body forces into account through a field dependence of the nuclear interaction coupling constants. Assuming nuclear matter to be charge neutral, beta-equilibrated, and populated by the baryon octet, electrons, and muons, we explore the parameters of the model, three different hyperon coupling schemes (also introduced here for the first time in MBF), and temperature effects to describe basic properties of nuclear matter, including the speed of sound, compressibility, and adiabatic index. We also investigate the mass-radius relation of compact stars by solving the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations at zero and finite temperature, including scenarios with fixed entropy per baryon. Our original results at finite temperature open the path to a new description of proto-neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Raman Scattering: a Systematic Toolkit for Tidal Effects in General Relativity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.06951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a framework for systematic computations of scattering amplitudes for gravitational Raman scattering, -- the inelastic scattering of massless fields off compact relativistic objects. We focus on the small-frequency (post-Minkowskian, PM) regime relevant for the study of tidal effects, which can be mapped onto gravitational wave observables during the inspiraling phase of a merger. We demonstrate that this setup is ideal for systematic studies of tidal effects, in a way that is free from coordinate, gauge, and field redefinition ambiguities. We use a combination of worldline effective field theory, the background field method, and advanced scattering amplitude techniques to derive phase shifts for scattering of spin-$0,1,2$ fields off generic compact objects at third PM order. We demonstrate that the inclusion of the recoil of the object is crucial for consistency of this calculation. Focusing on a particular case of black holes, we extract the leading static and dynamical Love numbers of the spin-0 field and the static Love number of the spin-1 field in four dimensions by matching our EFT amplitudes and calculations in General Relativity. We show, fully on-shell, that the leading static Love numbers vanish identically, while the dynamical Love numbers are not zero and run logarithmically. The latter resolves the ambiguities of previous off-shell matching calculations. We also extend our results to seven dimensions, where spin-2 Love numbers undergo a renormalization group running at 2PM, which we compute explicitly. In addition, we extract the leading static Love numbers of spin-0 and spin-1 fields in five dimensions, which also run.</description>

      <title>Investigating the role of nuclear parameters in Neutron Star oscillations: a model comparison</title>

Abstract: Recent studies based on the relativistic mean field (RMF) model found certain nuclear empirical parameters, in particular the nucleon effective mass, to be strongly correlated with observable properties of Neutron Stars (NSs), such as the frequencies of $f-$mode oscillations. This shows the potential to constrain the values of effective mass from future observations of $f-$modes. One of our primary goals of this work is to investigate whether such correlations are physical or an artifact of the underlying nuclear model. To test this, we perform a comparative study of the correlations between NS astrophysical observables and nuclear physics parameters using two different equation of state models based on RMF theory and non-relativistic Meta-Modelling (MM) scheme. The nuclear meta-model does not assume any underlying nuclear model and therefore allows us to test the model dependence of the results. The calculations of the $f-$mode characteristics are performed within the relativistic Cowling approximation. We use state-of-the-art nuclear microscopic calculations at low density and multi-messenger astrophysical data at high-density within a Bayesian-inspired scheme to constrain the parameter space of the nuclear models. From the posterior distribution, we probe the underlying correlations among nuclear parameters and with NS observables. We find that the correlation between the symmetry energy and its slope is physical, while that of the nucleon effective mass with NS observables is model-dependent. The study shows that the effective mass governs the high density behaviour in RMF models, while in the MM it is controlled by the higher order saturation parameters, and hence probes the possibility of constraining them from future $f$-mode observations. The findings of this investigation are interesting both for astrophysics as well as nuclear physics communities.</description>

      <title>The spin-orbit alignment hypothesis in millisecond pulsars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13893v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Millisecond pulsars (MSPs) are spun up during their accretion phase in a binary system. The exchange of angular momentum between the accretion disk and the star tends to align the spin and orbital angular momenta on a very short time scale compared to the accretion stage. In this work, we study a subset of $\gamma$-ray MSPs in binaries for which the orbital inclination angle $i$ has been accurately constrained thanks to the Shapiro delay measurements. Our goal is to constrain the observer viewing angle $\zeta$ and to check whether it agrees with the orbital inclination angle $i$, in other words if $\zeta \approx i$. We use a Bayesian inference technique to fit the MSP $\gamma$-ray light curves based on the third $\gamma$-ray pulsar catalogue (3PC). The emission model relies on the striped wind model deduced from force-free neutron star magnetosphere simulations. We found good agreement between the two angles $i$ and $\zeta$ for a significant fraction of our sample, about four fifth, confirming the spin-orbit alignment scenario during the accretion stage. However about one fifth of our sample deviates significantly from this alignment. The reasons are manifold: either the $\gamma$-ray fit is not reliable or some precession and external torque avoid an almost perfect alignment.</description>

Abstract: In recent years, multiple Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) have been observed with ''bumps'' in their rising light curves shortly after explosion. Here, we present SN 2021qvo: a SN Ia that exhibits a clear early bump in photometry obtained by the Young Supernova Experiment. Photometric and spectroscopic observations of SN 2021qvo show that it has a broader light curve, higher peak luminosity, shallower Si II $\lambda$5972 pseudo-equivalent width, and lower ejecta velocities than normal SNe Ia, which are all consistent with the characteristics of the 2003fg-like (often called ''super-Chandrasekhar") SN subtype. Including SN 2021qvo, just four known 2003fg-like SNe Ia have sufficient pre-peak data to reveal a rising light-curve bump, and all four have bump detections. Host-galaxy analysis reveals that SN 2021qvo exploded in a low-mass galaxy ${\rm log}(M_{\ast}/M_{\odot}) = 7.83^{+0.17}_{-0.24}$, also consistent with other members of this class. The current leading early-bump 2003fg-like SN Ia progenitor model involves an interaction between the circumstellar material (CSM) and the SN ejecta. We test the validity of this theory by modeling the early bump and subsequent light-curve evolution of SN 2021qvo with the Modular Open Source Fitter for Transients. We find that the bump can be modeled with a best-fit CSM mass in the range $M_\mathrm{CSM}=3.31-8.51 \times 10^{-3} M_\odot$. SN 2021qvo adds to the small but growing number of 2003fg-like SNe Ia with rising light-curve bumps; as the number of these SNe Ia with CSM estimates continues to grow, population-level inferences about the CSM distribution will be able to constrain the progenitor scenario for these SNe Ia.</description>

      <title>Revisiting electron-capture decay for Galactic cosmic-ray data</title>

Abstract: Electron-capture (EC) unstable species in Galactic cosmic rays constrain the time elapsed between nucleosynthesis and acceleration. They have also been advocated as tracers of reacceleration or gas inhomogeneities during their transport. The number of EC-unstable species grows with mass, with an expected EC-decay impact more important for larger atomic number and lower energy. We revisit the modelling of EC decay and its detectability in the context of recent unmodulated low-energy (Voyager) and high-precision data for heavy (AMS-02) and very-heavy nuclei (ACE-CRIS, CALET and Super-TIGER). We solve the transport equation for a multi-level configuration (up to any number of electrons attached) in the diffusion and leaky-box models. Their decayed fractions are found to be qualitatively similar but with very different absolute fluxes. We check that the standard two-level approximation, wherein the cosmic-ray nucleus is fully ionised or with one electron attached, is sufficient for most situations. We find that the impact of EC-decay is negligible in current data, except possibly for fluxes or ratios involving $^{51}$Cr, $^{55}$Fe, and Co. These conclusions are robust against significant uncertainties in the attachment and stripping cross-sections. This first analysis calls for further investigation, as several forthcoming projects (e.g., TIGERISS) are targeting $Z&gt;30$ cosmic rays.</description>

      <title>Probing AGN-ISM Feedback through Extended X-ray Emission in ESO 137-G034</title>

Abstract: We present a detailed analysis of the X-ray emission of the Compton-thick (CT) AGN ESO\,137-G034 based on deep ($\sim230$\,ks) Chandra observations. As in other CT AGNs, the morphology of the emission is elongated, approximately following the [O III] ionization bicone. With spatially resolved spectral modeling, we show that the extended emission within the bi-cone regions { is most readily explained} as from a mixture of photo-ionized gas and shock-heated plasma, reflecting the combined effects of radiative and kinematic AGN feedback. By comparing the morphology of the { X-ray emission in narrow spectral bands and that of the 3\,cm radio jet, we find suggestive evidence of thermal, possibly shocked emission associated with the SE termination of the radio jet. This interpretation is also supported by the lack of [O~III] relative to the $0.3-3.0$ keV flux in the inner $3^{\prime\prime}$ ($\sim600$\,pc) of the SE cone, which would be consistent with an additional thermal X-ray component on top of the photonized emission of an outflowing wind. A similar effect is only seen within the inner $1^{\prime\prime}$ ($200$\,pc) of the NW cone. In the radial profile of the [OIII]/X-ray flux ratio and the X-ray hardness ratio within the inner $\sim3^{\prime\prime}$ ($\sim600$\,pc) of the SE cone we see an asymmetry, with no counterpart in the NW cone. We detect soft extended X-ray emission in the cross-cones which may originate from the interaction of an embedded radio jet with a clumpy interstellar medium (ISM). }These results highlight the { importance of both} radiative and mechanical feedback in shaping the circumnuclear environment of ESO\,137-G034.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Field Amplification and Particle Acceleration in Weakly Magnetized Trans-relativistic Electron-ion Shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03169v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the physics of quasi-parallel trans-relativistic shocks propagating in weakly magnetized plasmas by means of long-duration two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations. The structure of the shock precursor is shaped by a competition between the Bell instability and the Weibel (filamentation) instability. The Bell instability is dominant at relatively high magnetizations $(\sigma\gtrsim10^{-3})$, whereas the Weibel instability prevails at lower magnetizations $(\sigma\lesssim10^{-4})$. Shocks with precursors shaped by Bell modes efficiently accelerate ions, converting a fraction $\varepsilon_{\mathrm{i}}\sim0.2$ of the upstream flow energy into downstream nonthermal ion energy. The maximum energy of nonthermal ions exhibits a Bohm scaling in time, as $E_{\max}\propto t$. A much smaller fraction $\varepsilon_{\mathrm{e}}\ll0.1$ of the upstream flow energy goes into downstream nonthermal electrons in the Bell regime. On the other hand, when the precursor is dominated by Weibel modes, the shock efficiently generates both nonthermal ions and electrons with $\varepsilon_{\mathrm{i}}\sim\varepsilon_{\mathrm{e}}\sim0.1$, albeit with a slower scaling for the maximum energy, $E_{\mathrm{max}}\propto t^{1/2}$. Our results are applicable to a wide range of trans-relativistic shocks, including the termination shocks of extragalactic jets, the late stages of gamma-ray burst afterglows, and shocks in fast blue optical transients.</description>

      <title>The Double-Burst Nature and Early Afterglow Evolution of Long GRB 110801A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05404v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive temporal and spectral analysis of the long-duration gamma-ray burst GRB 110801A, utilizing multi-band data from the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory and ground-based telescopes. The $\gamma$-ray emission exhibits a distinct two-episode (``double-burst'') structure. Rapid follow-up observations in the optical and X-ray bands provide full coverage of the second burst. The optical light curve begins to rise approximately 135 s after the trigger, significantly preceding the second emission episode observed in X-rays and $\gamma$-rays at $\sim 320$ s. This chromatic behavior suggests different physical origins for the optical and high-energy emissions. Joint broadband spectral fitting (optical to $\gamma$-rays) during the second episode reveals that a two-component model, consisting of a power-law plus a Band function, provides a superior fit compared to single-component models. We interpret the power-law component as the afterglow of the first burst (dominating the optical band), while the Band component is attributed to the prompt emission of the second burst (dominating the high-energy bands). A physical synchrotron model is also found to be a viable candidate to explain the high-energy emission. Regarding the afterglow, the early optical light curve displays a sharp transition from a rise of $\sim t^{2.5}$ to $\sim t^{6.5}$, which is well-explained by a scenario involving both reverse shock (RS) and forward shock (FS) components. We constrain the key physical parameters of the burst, deriving an initial Lorentz factor $\Gamma_0 \sim 60$, a jet half-opening angle $\theta_j \sim 0.09$, and an isotropic kinetic energy $E_{\rm k,iso} \sim 10^{54.8}$ erg.</description>

      <title>Fundamental oscillations as a tool to distinguish boson stars from neutron stars and black holes</title>

Abstract: Massive boson stars are self-gravitating configurations of self-interacting scalar fields and can be modeled by a massive scalar field with a quartic self-interaction potential. It has been shown that the equation of state and static structure properties, such as mass and radius, follow scaling relations independent of microscopic dark matter properties. In this work, we demonstrate for the first time that non-radial fundamental ($f$-)mode characteristics also follow a scaling in the strong interaction limit, opening up the outstanding prospect of evaluating the mode properties for boson stars for arbitrary masses spanning the scalar dark matter parameter space allowed by current observations. We provide the scaling relations within full general relativity and obtain the mode characteristics corresponding to the maximum boson star mass configuration. We apply these to determine the $f$-mode properties for boson stars solely as a function of their mass and compactness, which allows distinguishing them from those of neutron stars and black hole quasinormal modes in comparable mass range. In particular, we show that the frequencies are always lower than those of corresponding black holes of the same mass by a factor of 4.5. This provides a smoking gun for the distinguishability of boson stars from other compact objects using gravitational wave observations.</description>

      <title>Probing Boson Clouds with Supermassive Black Hole Binaries</title>

Abstract: Rotating black holes can generate boson clouds via superradiance when the boson's Compton wavelength is comparable to the black hole's size. In binary systems, these clouds can produce distinctive observational imprints. Recent studies accounting for nonlinearities induced by orbital backreaction suggest that if the binary forms at a large separation, resonance transitions can significantly deplete the cloud, minimizing later observational consequences except for very specific orbital inclinations. In this paper, we extend this framework to supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs), considering the influence of their astrophysical evolutionary histories. We find that, before entering the gravitational wave (GW) radiation stage, the additional energy loss channels can accelerate orbital evolution. This acceleration makes hyperfine resonant transitions inefficient, allowing a sufficient portion of the cloud to remain for later direct observations. We further discuss the ionization effects and cloud depletion occurring at this stage. Based on these theoretical insights, we explore how multi-messenger observations for SMBHBs can be utilized to detect the ionization effects of boson clouds by examining changes in the orbital period decay rate via electromagnetic measurements and variations in GW strain over a wide frequency band. Our findings reveal a complex dependence on the binary's total mass, mass ratio, and boson mass, emphasizing the significant role of astrophysical evolution histories in detecting boson clouds within binaries.</description>

      <title>The WINTER Observatory: A One-Degree InGaAs Survey Camera to study the Transient Infrared Sky</title>

Abstract: The Wide-field Infrared Transient Explorer (WINTER) is a near-infrared time-domain survey instrument operating on a dedicated 1-meter robotic telescope at Palomar Observatory. The project takes advantage of recent technology advances in time-domain astronomy, robotic telescopes, large-format sensors, and rapid data reduction and alert software for timely follow up of events. Since June of 2023, WINTER robotically surveys the sky each night to a median depth of J_AB = 18.5 mag, balancing a variety of science programs including searching for kilonovae from gravitational-wave alerts, blind surveys to study galactic and extragalactic transients and variables, and building up reference images of the near-infrared sky. The project also serves as a technology demonstration for new large-format Indium Gallium Arsenide (InGaAs) sensors for wide-field science in the near infrared without cryogenically cooled optics or detectors. WINTER's custom camera combines six InGaAs sensors with a novel tiled fly's-eye optical design to cover a &gt;1 deg^2 field of view with 1 arcsecond pixels in the Y-, J-, and shortened-H-band filters (0.9 - 1.7 micron). This paper presents the design, performance, and early on-sky science of the WINTER observatory.</description>

      <title>New Multi-messenger Probe of Dark Matter-Nucleon Interactions from Ultra-high Energy Cosmic Ray Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18093v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been suggested that the density of dark matter (DM) halo can be highly enhanced around supermassive black holes at the centers of massive galaxies. If real, these DM \emph{spikes} would offer new opportunities to probe the properties of DM. In this work, we point out that DM spikes can significantly impact the composition and survivability of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays accelerated near supermassive black holes. A large DM-nucleon cross section would fragment heavy nuclei into lighter elements and prevent them from attaining the energies observed at Earth. While the origin of cosmic rays remains a mystery, we show that if the highest-energy cosmic rays on Earth come from sources like NGC 1068, then cross sections of size $\sigma_{\chi p} \leq 10^{-33} \left( \frac{m_\chi}{\mathrm{GeV}}\right)\;\mathrm{cm^{2}}$ would be excluded by cosmic ray data. These bounds can be competitive with other existing probes and rule out new parameter space in the DM mass region $m_\chi\in [3\;\mathrm{MeV}, 30\;\mathrm{MeV}]$. While the uncertainties on the acceleration mechanism of cosmic rays prevent us from setting robust limits, our study highlights an important connection between DM spikes and cosmic ray physics that is complementary to existing cosmological and direct detection constraints.</description>

      <title>Exact black holes and black branes with bumpy horizons supported by superfluid pions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.22914v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present exact solutions of the Einstein-$SU(2)$ non-linear sigma model in $3+1$ spacetime dimensions, describing bumpy black holes and black branes. Using an Ansatz for superfluid pion multi-vortices, the matter sector reduces to a first-order BPS system, while the Einstein equations reduce to a Liouville equation with a smooth source governing the horizon deformation. These solutions describe horizons of different constant curvatures, with nontrivial bumpy geometries protected by an integer topological invariant, namely the vorticity, which also controls the number of bumps and the black hole thermodynamics. Remarkably, such horizons arise in a minimal and physically motivated matter model, without invoking exotic fields or modified gravity. The physical implications of these results in holography and astrophysics are briefly described.</description>
