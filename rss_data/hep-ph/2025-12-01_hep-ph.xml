      <title>Nuclear Detonations as Probes of Hidden Superluminal Sectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a highly speculative phenomenological framework in which nuclear detonations and high-energy collisions serve as probes for hidden sectors with effective superluminal propagation. Motivated by analogies between acoustic and electromagnetic phenomena, we stratify the physical description into three layers: a fundamental ``substrate'' layer, hidden-sector fields with extended causal cones, and the emergent Standard Model. We posit that the extreme, macroscopic stress-energy gradients generated by nuclear explosions might excite substrate or hidden modes that remain kinematically inaccessible to standard laboratory probes. This work unifies various exotic proposals -- including extra-dimensional shortcuts and trans-metric shockwaves -- into a single formalism, discussing the constraints imposed by causality and observation while outlining how such distinct high-energy regimes could complement one another in searching for physics beyond the emergent metric.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Study of WIMP Models Explaining the Fermi-LAT Galactic Center Excess</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Galactic Center excess (GCE) of GeV $\gamma$ rays may hint at dark matter (DM), yet its origin remains debated. Motivated by this, we survey weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) models that can fit the GCE while satisfying relic-density, direct-detection (DD), and indirect-detection (ID) bounds. We group candidates into hadronic (Higgs portals; simplified scalar/vector mediators), leptonic ($U(1)_{L_i-L_j}$), and mixed ($U(1)_{B-L}$, $Z$-portal) classes. Across all cases, present DD and dwarf-spheroidal $\gamma$-ray limits exclude wide regions, leaving mainly narrow resonant funnels with $m_{\rm DM}\!\simeq\! m_{\rm med}/2$ and portal couplings $\ll 1$. In hadronic setups, scalar and vector Higgs portals survive only in a thin strip near $m_h/2\simeq62.5$ GeV with portal couplings $\sim 10^{-4}$, while the Dirac Higgs and $Z$ portals are essentially excluded. The UV-complete vector Higgs portal retains resonant bands whose viable portal strength depends on the mixing angle. Simplified scalars allow small windows for complex-scalar or vector DM; Dirac DM is strongly disfavored, whereas a pseudoscalar with Dirac DM remains viable over a broader parameter range. For a simplified $Z'$ mediator, a pure vector coupling leaves only a marginal region, while pure axial is excluded by DD/ID bounds. In leptonic scenarios, inverse-Compton emission is essential: $L_\mu-L_e$ (and, to a lesser extent, $B\!-\!L$) fits the GCE with near-thermal cross sections, while $L_\mu-L_\tau$ is disfavored. Overall, viable WIMP explanations are constrained to finely tuned resonant regime, with leptophilic vectors and pseudoscalar portals emerging as the most robust options.</description>

      <title>$B\rightarrow K + invisible$ in a model with axion-like particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The localized excess of $B\rightarrow K + \textit{invisible}$ events reported by Belle-II is commonly interpreted as a signal for $B\to Ka$, where $a$ is an axion-like particle (ALP). In these proceedings, we summarize two theoretical updates regarding the $b\to sa$ decay amplitude within a minimal UV-complete model for invisible ALPs, namely the DFSZ model. (i) Contributions from certain two-loop diagrams can dominate the one-loop ones and are thus relevant for phenomenology. (ii) Although not unique, a rare feature -- which we refer to as apparent non-decoupling -- emerges in the light effective theory. The renormalizable ALP interactions fail to capture this behavior and therefore are incomplete as low-energy effective descriptions.</description>

      <title>Bubble Nucleation from Boson Star Collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new classical mechanism for nucleation of bubbles of true vacuum. The mechanism arises when dense boson stars form in the false vacuum. As the boson stars collapse due to attractive self-interactions, the field inside the stars core is enhanced beyond the potential barrier. Subsequently the stars explode as true vacuum bubbles, and induce a cosmological phase transition. The mechanism raises the possibility that a vacuum that is stable against quantum tunneling can be vulnerable to ``astrophysical'' processes.</description>

      <title>Chasing the muon EDM to constrain the SMEFT and UV models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following a proposal for an experiment with sensitivity to an electric dipole moment (EDM) of the muon $d_\mu$ of order $6\times10^{-23}\ e$ cm, three to four orders of magnitude below the current bound, but still seven orders of magnitude above the current bound on the EDM of the electron $d_e$, we explore the discovery potential of such an experiment. Within the dimension-six CP violating operators of the Standard Model effective field theory (SMEFT), we identify two dipole operators where $d_\mu$ has the strongest sensitivity, and four classes of four-fermion operators where it has the best sensitivity for regions of parameter space that are far from minimal flavor violation. We further consider three UV completions: vector-like leptons (VLLs), heavy vector boson with off-diagonal leptonic couplings, and two Higgs doublet model. For each, we identify the region in parameter space that will be uniquely explored by the proposed $d_\mu$ experiment. In case of VLLs, we also find measurements of $\Gamma (h \rightarrow \mu \mu)$ offer competitive sensitivity, highlighting the complementary role of collider observables. Generically, the potential reach is to ${\cal O}(10\ {\rm TeV})$ scale of new physics.</description>

      <title>Axion couplings in Orbifold GUTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the coupling of axions to gauge bosons in higher-dimensional Grand Unified Theories (GUT) inspired by string theory constructions with D-branes on orbifold singularities, the so-called orbifold GUTs. Due to their topological properties, axion couplings to gauge bosons are independent of the gauge symmetry reduction mechanism and the background geometry -- they only depend on the embedding of the SM into the UV gauge group. There are two kinds of axions in this class of theories: axions coming from gauge fields in the bulk and axions localised on the boundaries. The axion-photon coupling for the bulk axions coincide with the results from 4-dimensional GUTs, where axions which couple to photons necessarily couple also to QCD. The brane-localised axions can couple to photons independently of the QCD coupling, but if gauge couplings are approximately unified, the axions get large masses from unsuppressed instantons on the boundaries. This means that the ratio $g_{a\gamma\gamma}/m_a$ is below (or equal to) the QCD axion value for all axions in orbifold GUTs, as is the case for unified theories in 4d.</description>

      <title>Di-Higgs to 4b with Bayesian inference: improving simulation estimates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measuring di-Higgs production in the four-bottom channel is challenged by overwhelming QCD backgrounds and imperfect simulations. We develop a Bayesian mixture model that simultaneously infers signal and background fractions and their individual shapes directly in the signal region. The likelihood is a nuanced combination of a one-dimensional kinematic discriminator and per-jet flavour scores; with their correlations incorporated via kinematic bins. Monte Carlo informs weak Dirichlet priors, while the posterior adjusts to the interplay of the model, priors and observed data. Using pseudo-data simulated with standard tools and with controlled mismatches, we show that the method corrects biased priors, delivers calibrated 68-95% credible intervals for the signal count, and improves dataset-level ROC/AUC relative to simple cut-and-count baselines. This study highlights how Bayesian inference can harvest information present in the signal region and self-calibrate model parameters, providing a robust route to increased sensitivity in di-Higgs searches.</description>

      <title>High Mass Dark Matter Searches With the High Speed Flux From the Large Magellanic Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the hunt for dark matter progresses, recently there have been advances in the search for heavy dark matter with a mass well above a TeV. We show the importance of properly modeling the local dark matter velocity distribution, beyond the standard Maxwellian halo model, and in particular how the dynamics of the Large Magellanic Cloud and Milky Way may impact heavy dark matter searches. We introduce some new computational techniques for accurately computing the dark matter flux and the associated detector response. As a specific example, we examine the effect of the Large Magellanic Cloud on heavy dark matter bounds obtained from experiments searching for cosmic rays and magnetic monopoles using plastic etch detectors at the Ohya Mine and aboard the Skylab Space Station.</description>

      <title>New Physics Searches at the LHC through Event-based Anomaly Detection and Development of ADFilter Web-tool</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents advancements in model-agnostic searches for new physics at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) through the application of event-based anomaly detection techniques utilizing unsupervised machine learning. We discuss the advantages of the anomaly detection approach, as demonstrated in a recent ATLAS analysis, and introduce ADFilter, a web-based tool designed to process collision events using autoencoders based on deep unsupervised neural networks. ADFilter calculates loss distributions for input events, aiding in determining the degree to which events can be considered anomalous. Real-life examples are provided to demonstrate how the tool can be used to reinterpret existing LHC results, with the goal of significantly improving exclusion limits. Furthermore, we present a comparative study between anomaly detection and supervised machine learning techniques, using the search for heavy resonances decaying into two or more Higgs bosons as a representative case to demonstrate the application and effectiveness of these methods.</description>

      <title>Model-independent probes of CP violation in the heavy scalar sector at muon colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a model-independent test of CP violation in the scalar sector. We consider a heavy neutral scalar $h_2$ with tree-level couplings at the $h_2 V V$ and $h_2 h_1 Z$ vertices (with $V=W^{\pm},Z$), alongside the 125~GeV SM-like Higgs boson $h_1$. At future muon colliders (MuC), we exploit vector-boson-fusion (VBF) production of $h_2$ followed by the decay $h_2 \to Z h_1$. In our framework, observing the single process $V V \to h_2 \to Z h_1$ implies both relevant couplings are nonzero, which is sufficient to establish CP violation in the scalar sector. We simulate signal and backgrounds at $\sqrt{s}=3~(10)$ TeV with integrated luminosity $L=0.9~(10)~\mathrm{ab}^{-1}$. We then present the expected discovery sensitivites across the $(c_2,c_{12})$ parameter space (with the coupling parameters $c_{2}$ and $c_{12}$ defined in the text) for multiple $m_{h_2}$ hypotheses.</description>

      <title>Energy-momentum tensor form factor D(t) of proton and neutron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The energy-momentum tensor (EMT) form factor $D(t)$ is
  finite and negative in hadronic models and lattice QCD when only
  strong forces are included. However, when electromagnetic forces are
  considered, the $D(t)$ of charged hadrons undergoes a dramatic change:
  at small $t$, it changes sign and diverges like $1/\sqrt{-t}$ as shown
  for the proton in the classical model by Bia{\l}ynicki-Birula based on
  residual nuclear forces which can be understood as a mean field approach.
  We construct an analogous neutron model and show that this framework
  accurately explains the electromagnetic proton-neutron mass difference.
  We demonstrate that, after appropriately rescaling the residual nuclear
  forces, the model can reproduce lattice data on the nucleon $D(t)$ up to
  $(-t)\lesssim 1\,$GeV$^2$ as well as QED effects.
  Based on this realistic model description, we show that the proton and
  neutron $D(t)$ form factors are practically indistinguishable down to
  $(-t) \approx 10^{-4}\rm GeV^2$ far below what can currently be accessed
  experimentally. We conclude that in the foreseeable future the $D(t)$
  form factors of proton and neutron will practically
  look the same in experiments and phenomenology.</description>

      <title>QCD axions and domain walls in dense matter under compact stellar conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In compact stellar environments, the stability of dense QCD matter requires the simultaneous fulfillment of charge neutrality and beta equilibrium. In this work, we study how temperature and finite chemical potential affect QCD topology and axion properties within this medium, analyzing both cases with and without the charge neutrality condition. Our results show that the topological susceptibility and axion properties are highly sensitive to the critical behavior of the chiral phase transition in both cases. In particular, the axion mass is strongly suppressed near the transition, while the axion self-coupling constant develops a pronounced peak whose magnitude depends on the temperature and density of the medium. Remarkably, around the critical point at $T\simeq70$ MeV and $\mu\simeq346$ MeV, the self-coupling constant is enhanced by more than a factor of seven compared to its vacuum value, a feature that to the best of our knowledge has not been reported in previous studies. Such a strong amplification at the phase boundary indicates that axion-mediated interactions could play an important role in shaping the structure and stability of compact stars, with potential implications for their evolution and observable astrophysical signatures.</description>

      <title>Systematical study of exotic $1^{-+}$ tetraquark spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The masses of exotic quantum-number $1^{-+}$ compact tetraquark states are calculated in a constituent quark model (CQM), where Cornell-like potentials are employed as the central potentials, spin-spin and spin-orbit coupling derived from Breit-Fermi interaction are treated as hyperfine corrections, and model parameters are taken from previous works. The ground state $1^{-+}$ P-wave tetraquarks are predicted at 1.9, 4.2, and 6.6~GeV for the light, charmonium-like, and fully-charm sectors, respectively.
  The decay width ratios of $1^{-+}$ tetraquark states are calculated for possible strong two-body decay channels within the rearrangement mechanism, including $\omega h_1$ and $\eta f_1$ for isospin $I=0$ light tetraquarks; $\rho h_1$ and $\pi f_1$ for isospin $I=1$ light tetraquarks; $\pi/\eta+\chi_{c1}$ and $\rho/\omega + h_c$ for charmonium-like tetraquarks; and $\eta_c \chi_{c1}$ and $J/\psi h_c$ for fully-charm tetraquarks. The theoretical results are compared with the observed exotic $1^{-+}$ states, and possible channels for observing $1^{-+}$ tetraquark states are also discussed. The work suggests that $\eta_1(1855)$ is unlikely to be a compact tetraquark state.</description>

      <title>Topological production of charmonia with event-shape engineering in $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV using PYTHIA8</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The production of heavy quarks (charm and beauty) in high-energy hadronic and nuclear collisions provides an excellent testing ground for the theory of strong interaction and validates models based on quantum chromodynamics. In this work, prompt and nonprompt production of $\rm{J/}\psi$ in $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV are studied as a function of transverse spherocity using PYTHIA8. $\rm{J/}\psi$ is reconstructed via its electromagnetic decay to dielectrons and dimuons, in mid- and forward-rapidity, respectively. Transverse spherocity, an event shape observable, is used to distinguish hard QCD events from the softer, isotropic ones. In PYTHIA8, the production of $\rm{J/}\psi$ can be influenced by the average number of multiple parton interactions ($\langle N_{\rm mpi} \rangle$), owing to the underlying events (UE), which have a dominant contribution to particle production at lower transverse momentum. Since transverse spherocity is correlated to $\langle N_{\rm mpi} \rangle$, this can serve as an experimentally available tool for event selection to study the underlying QCD processes influencing the prompt and nonprompt $\rm{J/}\psi$ production. This study reveals the correlation between heavy-flavor production dynamics and topological event selection in $pp$ collisions using PYTHIA8, whose relevance awaits experimental validation.</description>

Abstract: Recently, a violation of the CKM unitarity condition has been reported in the latest charm-meson data, and the latest lattice results once the universal electroweak correction is taken into account. In this article, we analytically derive for the first time the complete one-loop electroweak (EW) and QED corrections to the $D_{s}^+ \to \ell^+ \nu_\ell$ decays for $\ell = \mu, \tau$. Our analysis incorporates both short-distance EW-QED corrections, which are beyond the leading-logarithmic approximation (the so-called Sirlin factor), and long-distance soft-photon corrections depending on the maximum total energy of undetected photons with their resummation. Although the inclusive photon QED corrections to the meson leptonic decays are well known, they do not match the actual measurement circumstances in $D_s^+ \to \mu^+ \nu_\mu$. We show that properly including these radiative corrections is essential to bring the second-column CKM unitarity tests into agreement with the Standard Model expectation. The study emphasizes that the current limiting factor in confirming CKM unitarity is the precision of QED corrections, and it points out that improving lattice simulations, taking the QED corrections into account, would be desired for a more robust confirmation.</description>

      <title>Lesser Green's Function and Chirality Entanglement Entropy via the In-Medium NJL Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study chiral symmetry restoration in hot-and-dense quark matter using the von Neumann chirality entropy within the in-medium Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model. Starting from the lesser Green function $G^{&lt;}(k)$, the reduced correlator $C_L=P_LG^{&lt;}P_L$ is constructed, and the associated entropy $S_\chi=-\mathrm{Tr}[C_L\ln C_L+(1-C_L)\ln(1-C_L)]$ is introduced to quantify the entanglement between left- and right-handed quark sectors. The dynamical quark mass $M_q(T,\mu_q)$ obtained from the gap equation exhibits the expected QCD-like phase structure: A second-order transition in the chiral limit and a smooth crossover for finite $m_q$. The chirality entropy $S_\chi$ increases monotonically with temperature and chemical potential, approaching a maximal value as $M_q\to0$. We also explore the critical exponents and scaling behavior of those quantities, yielding $\beta_{S_\chi}\simeq1$. This demonstrates that $S_\chi$ serves as an information-theoretic probe for chiral symmetry restoration, linking dynamical mass generation to quantum entanglement in strongly interacting matter.</description>

      <title>Inclusive quarkonium photoproduction selection and the effect of pileup at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measurements of inclusive quarkonium photoproduction provide strong constraints on the quarkonium production mechanism; however, this process has not yet been measured at the LHC. We summarise our previously developed selection strategy for isolating inclusive quarkonium photoproduction in pPb collisions at the LHC, which offer an optimal balance of photon flux, luminosity, and low pileup. We further examine the applicability of our selection criteria in different collision systems. While our method can be readily extended to PbPb collisions, pp collisions require additional care due to the significantly higher pileup. We discuss how pileup affects the selection criteria, highlighting that it substantially degrades forward-detector-based selections and reduces the efficiency of rapidity-gap requirements.</description>

      <title>Misalignment dynamics of Scalar Condensates with Yukawa coupling: Particle and Entropy Production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Misalignment dynamics, the non-equilibrium evolution of a scalar (or pseudoscalar) condensate in a potential landscape, broadly describes a solution to the strong CP problem, a mechanism for cold dark matter production and (pre) reheating post inflation. Often, radiative corrections are included phenomenologically by replacing the potential by the effective potential which is a \emph{static quantity}, its usefulness is restricted to (near) equilibrium situations. We study the misalignment dynamics of a scalar condensate Yukawa coupled to $N_f$ fermions in a manifestly energy conserving, fully renormalized Hamiltonian framework. A large $N_f$ limit allows us to focus on the fermion degrees of freedom, which yield a negative contribution to the effective potential, a radiatively induced instability and ultraviolet divergent field renormalization. We introduce an adiabatic basis and an adiabatic expansion that embodies the derivative expansion in the effective action, the zeroth order is identified with the effective potential, higher orders account for the derivative expansion including field renormalization and describe profuse particle production. Energy conserving dynamics leads to the conjecture of emergent asymptotic highly excited stationary states with a distribution function $n_k(\infty)\propto 1/k^6$ and an extensive entropy which is identified with an entanglement entropy. Subtle aspects of renormalization associated with the initial value problem are analyzed and resolved. Possible new manifestations of asymptotic spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) as a consequence of the dynamics even in absence of tree level (SSB), and cosmological inferences are discussed.</description>

      <title>Pion photoproduction of nucleon excited states with Hamiltonian effective field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past few years, Hamiltonian effective field theory has been successfully applied to studies of nucleon and hyperon excited states. By discretizing the Hamiltonian in a finite volume, one can obtain the energy spectrum and compare it with the results calculated from lattice QCD. Through the analysis of experimental data, Hamiltonian effective field theory provides a framework that connects the finite-volume spectra from lattice QCD to infinite-volume scattering observables. The model independence of the approach is well preserved under the combined constraints from lattice QCD and experimental data. Building on these developments, recent works have attempted to extend HEFT to electromagnetic processes. Meanwhile, lattice QCD has also gradually advanced into the study of electromagnetic interactions. The combination of these analyses will undoubtedly deepen our understanding of light resonances.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an explicit demonstration that a determination of the strong coupling constant $\alpha_s(m_Z)$ from deep-inelastic scattering and hadron collider data without a simultaneous determination of the parton distribution functions (PDFs) leads to a biased result for both the central value and the uncertainty, even in the ideal scenario (closure test) where there are no internal tensions between datasets and where theoretical calculations describe perfectly the experimental measurements. Specifically, we show that a determination of $\alpha_s(m_Z)$ from a single process leads in general to a result that differs from the global best fit more than the value of $\alpha_s(m_Z)$ that is actually favoured by this process.</description>

      <title>New Physics Searches via Beam Normal Spin Asymmetry in Bhabha Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the sensitivity of the beam normal spin asymmetry in Bhabha scattering to beyond the Standard Model (BSM) mediators, in the context of the JLab polarized positron program. A key property of this observable is that the Standard Model contribution exhibits a zero crossing at a fixed scattering angle, providing a clean, effectively background-free point for these searches. We consider scalar, vector and axial-vector mediators and present projected bounds, finding scalar and vector scenarios allowing to extend their search ranges significantly beyond existing constraints.</description>

      <title>Short-range production of three bottom mesons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous investigations of the three-body dynamics of $B$ mesons have shown that no Efimov effect arises in systems composed of three $B$ and $B^*$ mesons. This implies that the properties of such three-body systems can be described reliably in nonrelativistic effective field theory (NREFT) with two-body input alone, as three-body forces are strongly suppressed. In this work, we present leading-order predictions for the three-body point production rates of systems consisting of three $B$ and $B^*$ mesons. These predictions provide a novel way to experimentally probe the $B^{(*)}$-$\bar{B}^{(*)}$ interactions, which play a crucial role in the hadronic-molecule interpretation of the $T_{b\bar{b}1}(10610)$ and $T_{b\bar{b}1}(10650)$ states. Moreover, they provide a way to test the approximate conformal symmetry predicted for such systems at low energies experimentally.</description>

      <title>Less structure on $8$ Mpc scales from decaying sterile neutrino dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Late decays of dark matter to a lighter, warm dark matter component are a known way to reduce the amplitude of the matter power spectrum on scales of $8$ Mpc. However, only very few particle physics models have been put forward that exhibit the required properties and allow to relate them to other observables. In this work, we investigate a model based on two interacting sterile neutrinos and a scalar singlet. The heavier of the neutrinos is produced in the early Universe by the interplay of oscillations and the new interactions in the dark sector and constitutes the dominant component of dark matter. If the Yukawa matrix that describes the interactions of the steriles with the scalar is not diagonal, the heavier state can decay to three light sterile neutrinos. In contrast to the usual scenario, this leads to an all massive final state without radiation-like particles. We identify the part of the parameter space where these decays can lead to a reduction of S$_8$ at a level that matches observations. We then confront this region with the requirements of reproducing the observed relic density, as well as existing constraints from X-ray searches and Lyman-$\alpha$ forest data.</description>

Abstract: The leptonic mixing matrix is examined within bi-large mixing patterns and confronted with the latest results announced by the Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO). We analyze the viability of bi large mixing schemes and assess JUNO's ability to test neutrino mixing and discriminate among different bi-large mixing patterns, some of which are strongly disfavored when compared with neutrino oscillation global-fit results. Specific octant and CP predictions emerge. Finally, we comment on the implications of JUNO's findings for neutrinoless double beta decay.</description>

      <title>Bubble velocities in local equilibrium from a pseudopotential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new method to estimate terminal bubble velocities during first-order phase transitions in a plasma in local equilibrium. The method relies on calculating the extrema of a modified potential function for the scalar field undergoing the transition. The shape of this function, which we refer to as the ``pseudopotential'', changes with the wall velocity, and if the dependence of the fluid temperature on scalar gradients is weak -- which is confirmed to hold with high accuracy in concrete examples -- the difference in pseudopotential between two appropriate extrema gives the net outward pressure acting on the bubble wall. It then follows that the correct terminal bubble velocities are those that lead to degenerate minima in the pseudopotential. This allows to compute bubble velocities without having to solve the equation of motion of the scalar field, and in contrast to other methods this can be done without relying on simplified equations of state for the plasma or without choosing a specific ansatz for the scalar field profile. We illustrate the method in a singlet extension of the Standard Model, computing the net outward pressure as a function of the wall velocity. We confirm the dip in outward pressure found in the literature for hybrid bubbles, which implies that stationary deflagrations are stable, while their detonation counterparts are unstable.</description>

Abstract: In these proceedings, we report on our progress in developing the $\texttt{history}$ framework, which aims to implement the fully-local Nested Soft-Collinear infrared subtraction scheme for the automated phase-space integration of color-singlet production processes in hadronic collisions at NNLO accuracy. We validate our implementation for quark-antiquark-initiated processes and demonstrate a first application of the tool by predicting a novel observable for the inclusive process $pp \to ZH+X$, which may offer sensitivity to potential effects of new physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate saturation effects in exclusive vector meson production in deep inelastic scattering (DIS), where we model fluctuations within the target protons as localized color-charge hotspots. Based on the Color Glass Condensate (CGC) framework and the dipole picture for vector meson production, we examine the dependencies of coherent and incoherent scattering cross sections on the momentum transfer. We draw conclusions on the effectiveness of our hot spot model and the strength of the suppression of the scattering cross sections caused by saturation effects. We find that saturation has mild effects in the given energy and charge-density ranges, but can also show that suppression becomes more prominent as the color-charge density inside the proton increases.</description>

      <title>Complexity Growth in Flavor-Dependent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate holographic complexity growth in a flavor-dependent Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton (EMD) model, where the parameters are determined through machine learning algorithms fitted to lattice QCD equation of state (EoS) and baryon number susceptibility data. Within the Complexity=Action (CA) conjecture, we introduce a probe string into the bulk geometry and evaluate the time derivative of its Nambu-Goto (NG) action on the Wheeler-DeWitt (WDW) patch as the holographic dual of complexity growth. Our analysis explores the dependence of complexity growth on string velocity, chemical potential, temperature, and the number of flavors. Results show maximum complexity growth for stationary strings, decreasing with string velocity. At zero chemical potential, complexity growth is largest in the pure gluon system and reduces with the addition of quark flavors. Increasing temperature and chemical potential consistently enhance complexity growth. Furthermore, complexity growth exhibits multi-valued behavior in regions corresponding to first-order transitions and single-valued behavior in crossover regimes, indicating that complexity can serve as a probe for phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Pion generalized parton distributions at zero skewness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we systematically study the generalized parton distributions (GPDs) of the pion Goldstone Boson at zero skewness ($\xi =0$) in the framework of the covariant Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model with the help of the proper time regularization scheme to cure the divergence simultaneously to simulate the confinement. To this end, we evaluate the generalized form factors and parton distribution functions derived, respectively, from the first Mellin moments and the forward limit pion GPDs, in comparison to existing experimental data, recent lattice QCD simulations, and JAM global QCD analyses. We find that the pion parton distribution functions derived from the pion GPDs have excellent agreement with the experimental data and JAM analysis at renormalization scale $\mu^2 =$ 4 and 27 GeV$^2$. In addition, our results for the pion generalized form factors involving the scalar, vector, and tensor dressed form factors are consistent with recent lattice data and existing data. We then compute the charge radii for those dressed generalized form factors, and we obtain $r_{S}^{\pi} =$ 0.56 fm, $ r_V^{\pi} =$ 0.63 fm, and $r_{T}^{\pi} =$ 0.83 fm for the pion scalar, vector, and tensor form factors, respectively.</description>

Abstract: We compute the kaon gravitational form factor (GFF) using a bottom-up holographic QCD approach that incorporates SU(3) flavor symmetry breaking through the strange quark mass. We present the resulting Q^2 dependence of the kaon GFF and compare it with that of the pion. In the high-energy limit, the kaon GFF exhibits a 1/Q^2 falloff, in agreement with perturbative QCD. Furthermore, we extract the gravitational radius of the kaon and find it to be almost the same as that of the pion, with a slightly smaller value.</description>

      <title>An Experimental Framework for QCD studies of Event Shapes and Inclusive Hadron Spectra at FCC-ee energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of hadronic final states produced in $e^+e^-$ annihilations at the planned FCC-ee center-of-mass energies of 91.2, 160, 240, and 365 GeV using Monte Carlo simulations with PYTHIA. The distortions on event shape variables at high center-of-mass-energies is investigated considering initial state photon radiation and backgrounds from hadronic decays of Z pairs, W pairs, top-quark pairs, and Higgs. An extraction of the strong coupling constant $\alpha_{\text{s}}$ is performed through fits of the Thrust and C-parameter distributions to perturbative QCD predictions at next-to-next-to-leading-order (NNLO) precision. The study further probes soft gluon dynamics through charged particle multiplicities and momentum distributions, comparing the energy evolution of their mean values with previous experiments. The learning from this phenomenological work provide a reference for future experimental QCD studies at high-energy electron-positron colliders.</description>

      <title>Constraining the Inert Doublet Model at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we analyze experimental exclusion bounds that have been derived within a specific new physics realization, the two Higgs-doublet model with a pseudoscalar singlet (2HDMa), and their application to a different model, the Inert Doublet Model (IDM), that features the same final state. In this context, we discuss the sensitivity of the ATLAS search for the 2HDMa in final states with leptons and missing energy. We demonstrate that, with cuts optimized for a specific model topology, other new physics scenarios with larger rates might yet escape detection. We also give an update on constraints from vector boson fusion production of the Standard Model-like scalar and subsequent invisible decay from full Run 2 data on the parameter space of the IDM, with a special emphasis on the off-shell region, as well as a search that specifically concentrates on soft lepton final states.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Dipole Portal Vector Dark Matter at Fixed-Targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a model featuring a sub-GeV vector dark matter by augmenting the Standard Model with a new non-Abelian dark $SU(2)_D$, spontaneously broken by the vacuum expectation values of a scalar doublet and a triplet. Interactions between the dark and visible sectors arise through a dimension-5 non-Abelian avatar of kinetic mixing portal, inducing effective magnetic dipole couplings of the dark matter, with the photon and Z boson. The resulting spectrum of the dark gauge bosons naturally exhibits an inverse mass hierarchy between the dark matter and the $Z^\prime$, leading to interesting phenomenology at fixed-target experiments such as LDMX through dark off-shell bremsstrahlung, dark Higgs-strahlung, invisible vector meson decay, and visible decays. We compute the thermal relic abundance across sub-GeV dark matter masses, with regions of freeze-out proceeding via forbidden annihilation into dark sector states or direct annihilation into Standard Model states. Bounds from a broad set of laboratory probes, along with cosmological and astrophysical observations, are incorporated in our analysis. Among them, the most restrictive bounds originate from direct detection experiments, Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, collider searches, and the CMB. Our results demonstrate that a sizeable region of the parameter space remains consistent with the observed relic abundance and the existing experimental results.</description>

      <title>Analytical Soft Functions for Heavy-Quark Final States at Hadron Colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first computation of the complete two-loop, fully-differential soft function describing the production of a heavy-quark pair in association with a color-singlet system at hadron colliders. This result constitutes one of the most complex soft functions known to date and it is obtained in closed analytic form for generic multi-dimensional kinematics. This allows us to obtain novel analytic results for the transverse-momentum-dependent and threshold soft functions in this class of processes. We further obtain a decomposition of the soft function into dipole and tripole color correlators, thereby supplying essential building blocks for processes involving a heavy-quark pair produced together with additional light jets at both hadron and lepton colliders. These results represent a key ingredient for advancing precision predictions for heavy-quark physics at the LHC.</description>

      <title>Quark mixing from muon collider neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A high energy muon collider naturally produces a collimated beam of neutrinos for a fixed-target experiment at a dedicated far-forward facility. The high intensity and energy of the beam makes it ideally suited for astonishingly precise measurements of neutrino scattering on nucleons in the deeply inelastic regime, enabling the determination of the Cabibbo--Kobayashi--Maskawa~(CKM) quark mixing matrix. We assess the floor to the attainable sensitivity set by irreducible sources of uncertainties from the imperfect knowledge of the parton distribution (PDF) and fragmentation functions, showing that a strong improvement is possible well above current standards. As a by-product, our analysis also outlines extraordinary perspectives for a combined determination of the PDF. The results demonstrate the potential of a parasitic neutrino experiment at the muon collider, motivating detailed future studies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.23291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Experimental measurements of the transverse momentum of Drell-Yan lepton pairs are sensitive to non-perturbative physics associated with the intrinsic parton transverse momentum $k_T$. We discuss recent determinations of intrinsic $k_T$ in the context of transverse momentum dependent (TMD) parton branching calculations and collinear parton-shower Monte Carlo generators. We illustrate the influence of the soft-gluon resolution scale and the non-perturbative Sudakov region on the intrinsic $k_T$ extraction. We emphasize the relevance of the correct treatment of correlated uncertainties between different transverse momentum bins in TMD fits and present an application to the determination of the intrinsic $k_T$ in the forward rapidity region.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.23337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The production of a dark photon $A^{\prime}$ at the proposed CERN FCC-ee collider is investigated. The study addresses the associated production $e^+e^-\rightarrow\gamma A^{\prime}$ followed by the decay $A^{\prime}\rightarrow\mu^+\mu^-$. The 95% CL sensitivity on the mixing between the photon and the dark photon is evaluated in the $m_{A^{\prime}}$ mass range 0.4-360 GeV, based on a parametrised simulation of the IDEA detector. The study is performed both for prompt and long-lived decays of the $A^{\prime}$.</description>

      <title>Vector-field spontaneous baryogenesis with Lorentz invariance violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend spontaneous baryogenesis by considering the spontaneous breaking of $U(1)_B$ through a complex vector field. This field interacts with baryons and leptons via a vector-current coupling and, by construction, acquires a nonzero vacuum expectation value. Accordingly, the theory also exhibits a spontaneous violation of Lorentz invariance, effectively realizing a Bumblebee model. In this picture, the pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson arising from spontaneous breaking of the $U(1)_B$ global symmetry is the global phase of the Bumblebee vector and, in the broken phase, it results minimally coupled with the baryonic current, guaranteeing the violation of the baryon number. Consequently, we assume that the pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone, arising from spontaneous breaking of $U(1)_B$, plays the role of the inflaton, leading to baryogenesis across the entire inflationary stage, up to when the inflaton decays into baryon-antilepton and antibaryon-lepton pairs through a CP-violating interaction that also violates the Lorentz symmetry. Afterwards, we address the issue of flavor oscillations among baryon and lepton fields, including the oscillation probability in the calculation of the baryon asymmetry. Remarkably, our framework predicts a non-null mixing factor even for massless fermions. This mixing acts on the spatial momenta rather than on the masses of the produced fermions, allowing larger values of the coupling constant even guaranteeing the production of light fermions. The net baryon asymmetry results accordingly modified, and may also reproduce the experimental data for allowed values of the coupling constant.</description>

      <title>The Art of Counting: a reappraisal of the HEFT expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the power counting of the Higgs Effective Field Theory (HEFT) from first principles, by requiring that predictions for physical observables follow a series expansion in small, dimensionless quantities. Depending on whether HEFT is formulated in terms of a unique low-energy scale $v$ or in terms of two scales $v&lt;f$, this approach identifies two viable power counting rules that can accommodate any operator normalization choice. We provide quantitative prescriptions for the consistent truncation of HEFT operators, amplitudes and observable contributions and we illustrate our arguments with a number of examples.</description>

      <title>Higgs pair production in gluon fusion to higher orders in Higgs Effective Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Higgs pair production offers the opportunity to probe correlations among the couplings of one or two Higgs bosons to fermions and gauge bosons. In this context, it serves as a powerful test of the underlying Effective Field Theory (EFT) framework. In particular, while such couplings remain correlated in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) at dimension six, they can become fully de-correlated in Higgs Effective Field Theory (HEFT) already at leading order in the EFT expansion. In this work, we study Higgs pair production via gluon fusion within the HEFT framework. We demonstrate that adopting a consistent power counting in combination with next-to-leading order (NLO) diagrams necessitates the inclusion of higher-dimensional operators beyond the leading ones. We analyze their phenomenological impact and re-assess critically the kinematic benchmark scenarios commonly used in experimental non-resonant di-Higgs searches in light of these additional contributions.</description>

      <title>SU($N_c$) confinement and color $N_c$-ality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent work, we have argued that the net quark number gained by a bath of quarks and gluons upon bringing an external static quark probe, while being equal to $1$ in the high temperature, deconfined phase, is equal to $0$ or $3$ in the low temperature, confined phase, depending on the value of the quark chemical potential. This establishes a clear-cut connection between the confinement of a medium as probed by order parameters such as the Polyakov loop, and the ability of that same medium to screen the quark probe into states with the same net quark content as mesons or baryons. In this work, we extend these findings to the SU($N_c$) color group, consider color probes in various (fundamental and non-fundamental) representations, and conjecture a rationale of how these results could be recovered from a purely thermodynamic argument that shortcuts the use of the Euclidean functional framework, while emphasizing the role of color $N_c$-ality as a proxy for center symmetry within the Minkowskian framework.</description>

      <title>IRC-safe jet flavour without modifying anything</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we describe how infrared-collinear safety can be restored perturbatively for standard definitions of jets and jet flavour. We will explicitly study this approach at next-to-next-to-leading order in QCD, where we will discuss the cause of the violation of infrared safety, argue that it is merely an artefact of the calculation, and explain how a consistent treatment of flavour removes this violation. The most important feature of our approach is that it does not require any changes to the definition of the jet or its flavour, nor does it modify the definition of the cross section. Consequently, the predictions can be directly compared to measurements performed using the standard anti-$k_T$ jet clustering algorithm, without the need for experimental collaborations to adapt their analyses to some new, infrared-collinear-safe definition of jet flavour, as would be the case for most - if not all - solutions presented in the literature thus far.</description>

      <title>New Particles at the Z-Pole: Tera-Z factories as discovery and precision machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several proposed future lepton colliders are capable of producing trillions of Z-bosons, including FCC-ee, CEPC, LEP3 and LEP-Z. Such Tera-Z factories can discover new elementary particles with couplings to the Z-boson that are orders of magnitude smaller than current bounds. For couplings near the currently excluded parameter regions they could produce sufficiently large samples to study the new particles' properties in detail, hence acting as a discovery and precision machine in one. Using simple analytic estimates, we quantify the dependence of the expected event yield in long-lived particle searches on the number of produced Z-bosons and on the detector dimensions. From this, we derive estimates for both the discovery reach and the measurement precision attainable at such facilities. While the precision of such estimates of course falls short of proper simulations, the analytic approach is suitable for a quick assessment of the sensitivity for a given design. We illustrate this with two examples, heavy neutral leptons and axion-like particles. Under optimistic assumptions, these could be produced in the millions and billions, respectively, effectively turning future lepton colliders into exotics factories.
  We provide a code that quickly generates the sensitivity curves displayed in this work and can be extended to other models at https://github.com/liyuanzhen98/LLPatTeraZ.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a self-consistent prediction for the gravitational wave signal arising from confinement-induced phase transitions in hidden non-Abelian SU(N) gauge theories with F light flavors. To do this, we impose perturbativity and unitarity constraints on the thermal effective potential to identify the portion of parameter space that admits a reliable effective field theory description. We also include the Polyakov-loop-improved finite-temperature potential for both N=3 and N=4, where N is the number of dark colors, using an approximate computation of the mediating effects. We compute the resulting gravitational wave spectrum and delineate the regions of parameter space that remain phenomenologically viable after imposing theoretical consistency conditions. We find that these constraints make uncovering a stochastic background gravitational wave signal in this scenario more challenging, even for proposed future detectors.</description>

      <title>Probing Exotic Astrophysical Dark objects through Astrometric Microlensing from Gaia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first comprehensive study of astrometric microlensing by exotic astrophysical dark objects, focusing on two theoretically motivated models -- Q-ball and boson star. We demonstrate that these extended objects generate distinctive signatures that depart markedly from point-mass lenses like primordial black holes. The smoking-gun signature for these exotic objects is the emergence of caustics, which form when the lens radius is below a critical threshold. Crossing these caustics induces discontinuous jumps in the images-centroid trajectory, a distinctive feature of these extended dark objects. We show these patterns are sensitive to the internal mass profile, with boson stars generating larger, more prominent caustic structures than Q-balls -- enabling the models to be distinguished. Using the Gaia DR3 stellar catalogue, we forecast a high-yield discovery potential, up to $\sim 6000$ detectable astrometric microlensing events for a 10-year mission, peaking for $M \sim 1-10~M_\odot$ and $R \lesssim 10~\text{AU}$. In the absence of anomalous detections, Gaia can set powerful 90% confidence level constraints on the fractional abundance of these exotic objects, reaching $f_{\mathrm{DM}} \le 10^{-3}$ in the peak region which covers masses from $10^{-1}-10^{7}~M_{\odot}$ and radii $R&lt;10^{6}~\text{AU}$. Crucially, these projected astrometric microlensing constraints are significantly stronger than existing photometric microlensing limits in the $1-10~M_\odot$ mass range. This work establishes astrometric microlensing with Gaia as a powerful, complementary, and near-future probe with the potential to discover exotic astrophysical dark objects.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that General Relativity and other geometrical theories can be viewed as a degenerate Otto cycle with only heat-exchange legs in emergent gravity. Including work-producing legs yields controlled violations of local Lorentz invariance and energy-momentum conservation, which produce late-time cosmological acceleration. Implications for the cosmological constant problem, structure formation and local observations are discussed.</description>

      <title>On the possibility of superradiant neutrino emission by atomic condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a recent work [B. J. P. Jones and J. A. Formaggio, Phys. Rev. Lett. 135, 111801 (2025)], the possibility of superradiant neutrino emission from atomic condensates has been theoretically proposed. Subsequent analysis by Y. K. Lu, H. Lin, and W. Ketterle [arXiv:2510.21705] questioned this scenario, emphasizing the limiting role of the fermionic nature of the decayed atoms. In this study, we revisit the problem and discuss under which conditions collective emission phenomena might still emerge in cold-atom systems.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the effect of rotation on the confinement/deconfinement transition of the quark-gluon plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is an apparent contradiction in the current literature about the effect of rotation in the quark gluon plasma (QGP). While results from lattice QCD predict an increase in the confinement/deconfinement critical temperature, approximated calculations and effective models, including holographic ones, lead to the opposite result. Non central heavy ion collisions form QGPs with relativistic rotational velocities. Thereby, a great interest was drawn into the effect of rotation in strongly interacting matter. In this work, we show that the apparent contradiction is associated with the choices of observer considered in each case. We consider a holographic description of a rotating plasma using a Myers-Perry black hole. For a static observer, the result is that the confinement/deconfinement temperature decreases with the angular velocity, while for an observer co-rotating with the plasma the opposite behavior is found, in agreement with lattice calculations.</description>

      <title>Robust evidence for dynamical dark energy in light of DESI DR2 and joint ACT, SPT, and Planck data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements released by DESI, when combined with cosmic microwave background (CMB) data and type Ia supernova (SN) data, suggest a significant preference for dynamical dark energy (DDE) that exhibits the phantom-like behavior in the past and has transitioned into quintessence-like behavior today. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of six representative DDE parametrization models by utilizing the latest and most precise CMB data jointly from ACT, SPT, and Planck, in conjunction with BAO data from DESI DR2 and SN data from DESY5, PantheonPlus, and Union3. Our overall analysis indicates that the preference for DDE in the Quintom-B regime remains robust, regardless of the DDE parameterization model and the data combination employed. The trend of this preference is significantly strengthened with the support of DESY5 SN data. Specifically, when using the CMB+DESI+DESY5 data, for the Barboza-Alcaniz (BA) model, we obtain $w_0 = -0.785 \pm 0.047$ and $w_a = -0.43^{+0.10}_{-0.09}$, which significantly deviate from the $\Lambda$CDM values and provide evidence for DDE at the $4.2\sigma$ level. By the reconstruction of the dark energy equation of state $w(z)$, normalized dark energy density $f_{\mathrm{DE}}(z)$, and the deceleration parameter $q(z)$, we also observe clear departures from $\Lambda$CDM, further reinforcing the case for DDE. Furthermore, the Bayesian evidence analysis indicates that the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder, BA and Exponential models are moderately favored relative to $\Lambda$CDM based on the CMB+DESI+DESY5 data.</description>

      <title>Deconstructing symmetry breaking dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM) successfully predicts the density of topological defects deposited by the phase transitions, but it is not clear why. Its key conjecture is that, near the critical point of the second-order phase transition, critical slowing down will result in a period when the system is too sluggish to follow the potential that is changing faster than its reaction time. The correlation length at the freeze-out instant $\hat t$ when the order parameter catches up with the post-transition broken symmetry configuration is then decisive, determining when the mosaic of broken symmetry domains locks in topological defects. To understand why the KZM works so well we analyze Landau-Ginzburg model and show why temporal evolution of the order parameter plays such a key role. The analytical solutions we obtain suggest novel, hitherto unexplored, experimentally accessible observables that can shed light on symmetry breaking dynamics while testing the conjecture on which the KZM is based.</description>

      <title>NuclearConfectionery: Multi-stage Simulation Framework for Modeling Relativistic Heavy-ion Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the NuclearConfectionery, a modular framework for simulating the full dynamical evolution of relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Its core hydrodynamic module, CCAKE 2.0, represents a major advance over previous SPH-based relativistic hydrodynamic codes. CCAKE 2.0 simultaneously evolves energy-momentum and multiple conserved charges (B, S, Q) with a four-dimensional equation of state, and can be run in either Cartesian or hyperbolic coordinates, enabling consistent simulations from the RHIC Beam Energy Scan to LHC energies. We have implemented a particlization module that supports global BSQ charge conservation on the freeze-out surface; the resulting hadron ensemble is then propagated through a hadronic transport afterburner. A source term is included in the equations of motion to couple jets to the fluid, allowing simultaneous bulk and hard-probe evolution or, alternatively, for stopped baryons at low beam energies. The framework offers flexible choices of equations of motion (Israel-Stewart, DNMR, ADNH) and transport coefficients, along with GPU-ready performance via Kokkos/Cabana, offline equation of state inversion for 4D tables, and containerized portability. We validate the code with semi-analytical benchmarks (including BSQ Gubser and Landau-Khalatnikov solutions) and extensive convergence studies. The NuclearConfectionery provides a user-friendly, high-performance, open-source tool for event-by-event simulations across collision energies, offering flexibility to study QCD matter at both vanishing and finite densities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigated the phase structure and the equation of state (EoS) for dense two-color QCD at low temperatures using the lattice Monte Carlo simulations. A rich phase structure below the pseudo-critical temperature $T_c$ as a function of quark chemical potential has been revealed. In a high-density regime, we can see a superfluid phase, where the diquark condensate takes a non-zero expectation value. We have newly found that the speed of sound exceeds the conformal bound, which is the value of the relativistic free theory. This talk is based on Refs.~\cite{Iida:2022hyy, Iida:2024irv, Itou:2025vcy}.</description>

      <title>Collapse of Axion Domain Wall Induced by Helical Primordial Magnetic Fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stable domain wall (DW) must decay to avoid overclose the Universe. A commonly used solution is to slightly break the PQ symmetry by introducing a bias term in the potential. In this work, we propose an alternative, symmetry-preserving mechanism: coupling the axion field to a helical primordial magnetic field (PMF) via the Chern-Simons term. Using three-dimensional lattice simulations, we evolve the DW network and demonstrate that it can successfully drive DW decay. Our quantitative results further show that the correlation length of the PMF plays a crucial role in determining the decay rate of the DW network and the resulting axion and gravitational wave radiation.</description>

      <title>Incorporating neutron star physics into gravitational wave inference with neural priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayesian inference, widely used in gravitational-wave parameter estimation, depends on the choice of priors, i.e., on our previously existing knowledge. However, to investigate neutron star mergers, priors are often chosen in an agnostic way, leaving valuable information from nuclear physics and independent observations of neutron stars unused. In this work, we propose to encode information on neutron star physics into data-driven prior distributions constructed with normalizing flows, referred to as neural priors. These priors take input from constraints on the nuclear equation of state and neutron star population models. Applied to GW170817, GW190425, and GW230529, we highlight two contributions of the framework. First, we demonstrate its ability to provide source classification and to enable model selection of equation of state constraints for loud signals such as GW170817, directly from the gravitational-wave data. Second, we obtain narrower constraints on the source properties through these informed priors. As a result, the neural priors consistently recover higher luminosity distances compared to agnostic priors. Our method paves the way for classifying future ambiguous low-mass mergers observed through gravitational waves and for continuously incorporating advances in our understanding of neutron star properties into gravitational-wave data analysis.</description>

      <title>Scalar field effective potentials in de Sitter spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate two different definitions of a scalar field effective potential in quantum field theory in de Sitter spacetime: the standard textbook definition, and the constraint effective potential proposed by O'Raifeartaigh et al. in 1986. While these definitions are equivalent in Minkowski spacetime, they differ significantly in de Sitter. We demonstrate this by computing them both explicitly at one-loop order in perturbation theory. It is well known that the perturbative expansion of the standard effective potential fails converge for light fields. In contrast, the constraint effective potential does not suffer from this infrared problem, and it can therefore be computed using perturbation theory. We discuss the physical interpretation of the two effective potentials. In particular, we provide evidence supporting an earlier conjecture that the constraint effective potential is the correct one to use in the stochastic Starobinsky-Yokoyama theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.23182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that resonant processes during multi-field inflation can generate a large curvature perturbation on small scales. This perturbation naturally leads to the formation of primordial black holes that may constitute dark matter, as well as to the production of stochastic induced gravitational waves in the deci-Hz band. Such waves are within reach of future space-based interferometers such as LISA, DECIGO and BBO. In addition, primordial black hole binaries formed at late times produce merger gravitational waves that can be probed by the resonant cavity experiments in addition to DECIGO and BBO.</description>

      <title>Witten-O'Raifeartaigh potential revisited in the context of Warm Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Warm Inflation is a scenario in which the inflaton field dissipates its energy during inflation to maintain a subdominant constant radiation bath. Two of its remarkable features are (i) inflation can be realized even by very steep potentials and (ii) such a scenario doesn't call for a separate post-inflation reheating phase. We exploit the first feature to show that Warm Inflation can successfully take place on the very steep left wing of the Witten-O'Raifeartaigh potential while remaining in excellent agreement with current cosmological data (joint analysis of Planck, ACT and DESI). The Witten-O'Raifeartaigh potential has a flatter right wing as well, which opens up the possibility of dark energy when the field rolls along this wing. However in order to successfully realize quintessential inflation one needs to (i) normalize the two wings of the Witten-O'Raifeartaigh potential differently in order to bridge between the two extreme energy scales of inflation and dark energy, (ii) allow the quintessence field to be dissipative, which is consistent with the presence of a dissipative term in warm inflation. The dissipative dynamics of the quintessence field is needed in order to sustain slow-roll in the right wing. With these modifications, we demonstrate that the Witten-O'Raifeartaigh potential can give rise to a unified model of warm inflation (on the left wing) and transient dark energy (on the right wing).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.23263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nature of dark matter (DM) remains a profound mystery. Macroscopic candidates, such as Fermi-balls, offer a distinct alternative to conventional particle DM, yet their low number density makes terrestrial detection challenging. In this work, we present a unified search strategy for sub-saturated Fermi-ball DM. We first revisit and significantly update astrophysical constraints from compact objects, utilizing rigorous expressions and additional white dwarf data related to ignition and subsequent supernovae. Crucially, we then explore novel signatures of Fermi-balls in future gravitational wave experiments like LISA and TianQin, performing detailed signal-to-noise ratio and Fisher matrix analyses. By combining these updated white dwarf/neutron star limits with the projected gravitational wave sensitivities, we derive the most comprehensive constraints on Fermi-ball parameter space to date, demonstrating the power of multi-messenger approaches for probing macroscopic DM.</description>

      <title>Unmasking short-range correlations via initial-state fluctuations in relativistic heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although relativistic heavy-ion collisions have emerged as a powerful probe for studying nuclear structure, the potential influence of nucleon-nucleon short-range correlations (NN-SRCs) on the initial state has remained an open question. By incorporating NN-SRCs into the initial conditions, we demonstrate that higher-order fluctuations of the initial transverse size, $n$-particle $c_{E/S}\{n\}$, which can be directly mapped to final-state mean transverse momentum fluctuations, exhibit remarkable sensitivity to NN-SRCs. Quantitatively, $c_{E/S}\{3\}$ and $c_{E/S}\{4\}$ differ by more than 10\% between systems with and without NN correlations. Moreover, we report a universal scaling of these quantities with $A^{-1/3}$ and the average nuclear density, mirroring the connection between the SRC effect and the EMC effect in electron scatterings. This work establishes relativistic heavy-ion collisions as a new tool for probing nuclear structure and constraining two-body or many-body NN interactions across different energy scales and system sizes.</description>

      <title>Kinetic Mixing and the Phantom Illusion: Axion-Dilaton Quintessence in Light of DESI DR2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent results from DESI BAO analyses suggest that dark energy may not be a cosmological constant and is in fact dynamical. Furthermore, the data suggest that the equation of state may have been in the phantom regime in the distant past, recently undergoing a phantom crossing. In this work, we investigate whether this preference can be realized within a kinetically mixed axion-dilaton (KMIX) quintessence model, a string-motivated system in which an axion-like field couples exponentially to a dilaton-like (moduli) field. Crucially, KMIX can appear phantom in a standard Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) based analysis. To confront the model with data, we develop a fast pipeline based on normalizing flows that (i) learns a theory-informed prior on $(w_0,w_a)$ from KMIX realizations and (ii) provides an inverse mapping from CPL parameters back to the physical KMIX parameters. By importance-sampling pre-computed CPL chains using this framework, we effectively transform generic phenomenological constraints into direct, computationally efficient constraints on the underlying KMIX theory, avoiding the prohibitive cost of full parameter space exploration. Applied to Planck+DESI DR2 BAO measurements, our framework finds support for KMIX at $2.5\sigma$ compared to the base CPL fit at $3.1\sigma$, demonstrating that KMIX may account for the DESI preference without invoking true phantom behavior. When additionally including Type Ia supernovae data, we find that the preference remains above $3\sigma$ for Union3 and DES Y5, but drops to $2.1\sigma$ with Pantheon+. The latter, combined with the DESI full-shape power spectrum and bispectrum data, further reduces the preference to $1.7\sigma$. Ultimately, should the DESI deviation persist with future data, KMIX may offer a theoretically well-motivated explanation for the phantom-like signatures inferred from phenomenological fits.</description>

      <title>Shear viscosity and electric conductivity of quark matter at finite temperature and chemical potential with QCD phase transitions</title>

Abstract: In the Beam Energy Scan phase II (BES-II) experiments at RHIC STAR, the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) produced with changing collision energies may probe different regions of the QCD phase diagram. Correspondingly, studying the transport coefficients of quark matter in these regions will contribute to extracting the QCD phase structure through hydrodynamic approaches. We investigate the shear viscosity and electric conductivity within the framework of kinetic theory with the relaxation time approximation, in particular their behaviors near the Mott and first-order phase transitions with a spinodal structure as well as along the isentropic trajectories. To derived the scattering cross-section under different conditions, the temperature and chemical potential dependent masses of quarks, antiquarks and exchanged mesons are calculated in the Polyakov-loop extended Nambu--Jona Lasinio (PNJL) model. The numerical results indicate that, at small chemical potential, the shear viscosity to entropy density ratio ($\eta/s$) has a minimum near the Mott phase transition and increases rapidly in the lower-temperature side of the chiral crossover phase transition. At large chemical potential (high baryon density), $\eta/s$ in the QGP phase is dominated by temperature, and the value of $\eta/s$ is greatly enhanced at low temperatures. At intermediate temperature and chemical potential near the QCD phase transition, the behavior of $\eta/s$ is influenced by the competition between temperature, density, and QCD phase transition. The electirc conductivity ($\sigma/T$) roughly exhibits similar characteristics to $\eta/s$ in the QCD phase diagram, whereas the dimensionless ratio of $\eta/s$ to $\sigma/T$ decreases monotonically with growing temperature, approaching a constant in the high-temperature limit.</description>

      <title>A Catalog of First-Order Electroweak Phase Transitions in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23210v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use modern dimensionally-reduced effective field theory methods, with careful attention to scale hierarchies, to analyze and catalog the types of first-order electroweak phase transitions that are possible in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Our calculations lay the necessary groundwork to perform gauge invariant, properly resummed perturbative expansions, and therefore address many of the theoretical problems with phase transition calculations. We find three types of configurations of the scalar potential that allow for a first-order phase transition, namely tree-level barriers, radiative barriers, or radiative symmetry breaking through the Coleman-Weinberg mechanism. We also find versions of these with significant supercooling. We perform a global likelihood scan over the Wilson coefficients of SMEFT operators involving only the Higgs field, to identify parameter regions that exhibit these first-order phase transitions and are consistent with experimental and theoretical constraints. We comment on the possibilities for electroweak baryogenesis within the SMEFT, and roughly estimate if the gravitational wave spectra generated by the phase transitions are detectable.</description>

      <title>Unveiling hadronic resonance dynamics at LHC energies: insights from EPOS4</title>

Abstract: Hadronic resonances, with lifetimes of a few fm/\textit{c}, are key tools for studying the hadronic phase in high-energy collisions. This work investigates resonance production in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13.6$ TeV and in Pb$-$Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm{NN}}} = 5.36$ TeV using the EPOS4 model, which can switch the Ultra-relativistic Quantum Molecular Dynamics (UrQMD) ON and OFF, enabling the study of final-state hadronic interactions. We focus on hadronic resonances and the production of non-strange and strange hadrons, addressing effects like rescattering, regeneration, baryon-to-meson production, and strangeness enhancement, using transverse momentum ($p_\textrm{T}$) spectra and particle ratios. Rescattering and strangeness effects are important at low $p_\rm{T}$, while baryon-to-meson ratios dominate at intermediate $p_\rm{T}$. A strong mass-dependent radial flow is observed in the most central Pb$-$Pb collisions. The average $p_\rm{T}$, scaled with reduced hadron mass (mass divided by valence quarks), shows a deviation from linearity for short-lived resonances. By analyzing the yield ratios of short-lived resonances to stable hadrons in pp and Pb$-$Pb collisions, we estimate the time duration ($\tau$) of the hadronic phase as a function of average charged multiplicity. The results show that $\tau$ increases with multiplicity and system size, with a nonzero value in high-multiplicity pp collisions. Proton (p), strange ($\rm{\Lambda}$), and multi-strange ($\rm{\Xi}$, $\rm{\Omega}$) baryon production in central Pb$-$Pb collisions is influenced by strangeness enhancement and baryon-antibaryon annihilation. Comparing with LHC measurements offers insights into the dynamics of the hadronic phase.</description>

      <title>Decoding spin-parity quantum numbers and decay widths of double $J/\psi$ exotic states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13455v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive helicity amplitudes for the fully charmed tetraquark states decays into vector meson pair under two types of models, where the one is from quark model and the other one is from diquark model. The decay angular distributions have been given by the cascade decays $T_{4c}\to J/\psi(D_{(s)}^*)+J/\psi(\bar{D}_{(s)}^*)$ along with $J/\psi\to \mu^++\mu^-$ or $D_{(s)}^*\to D_{(s)}+\pi$, showing that spin-0 and spin-2 states can be distinguished. We also find that the spin-0 state decay to $J/\psi$-pair exhibits a higher degree of quantum entanglement than that in spin-2 state decays. These findings will assist in experimentally differentiating various spin-parity states, determining decay widths and unveiling undiscovered hadronic states within existing structures, thereby shedding light on the internal properties of double $J/\psi$ exotic states.</description>

Abstract: In comparisons of precision measurements at colliders to the most accurate predictions available in perturbative quantum chromodynamics (QCD), it is required to correct for nonperturbative effects. By means of Monte Carlo event generators this article investigates the impact of such nonperturbative effects on two processes relevant for precision determinations of the strong coupling constant and the proton structure: triple-differential dijet and Z+jet production. We observe significant differences between the two processes. Whether this non-universal behaviour is realized in nature remains an open question. We therefore propose a triple-differential measurement of the underlying event in Z+jet production.</description>

Abstract: Left-Right Symmetric Model(LRSM) in this work is extended with a sterile fermion per generation, the lightest of the same is considered to be a suitable dark matter candidate for the study and analysis of the associated properties. The model has been realized using $A_{4}$ modular symmetry, the advantage being the non-requirement of the use of extra fields, hence keeping the model minimal. Because of the extension of LRSM with the sterile fermion, the neutrino mass in this work will be generated by the double seesaw mechanism as described thoroughly within the manuscript. And for phenomenological studies, we have considered neutrinoless double beta decay the details of which have been discussed thoroughly within the work.</description>

      <title>Precision Tests in $b\to s\ell^+\ell^-$ ($\ell=e,\mu$) at FCC-ee</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22635v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rare semi-leptonic decays $B\to K^\ast \ell^+\ell^-$, with $\ell=e, \mu$, are highly sensitive to new physics (NP) due to their suppression in the Standard Model (SM). Current LHCb measurements in the muon channel exhibit a significant tension with state-of-the-art SM theory predictions. The proposed tera-$Z$ run at FCC-ee provides a unique opportunity to untangle the origin of this tension by producing a very large sample of $B$-mesons in a clean $e^+e^-$ environment. We explore the expected precision of $B\to K^\ast \ell^+\ell^-$ ($\ell=e, \mu$) measurements at FCC-ee, complementing existing studies with $\tau^+\tau^-$ in the final state, and compare with HL-LHC projections. For the case of muons in the final state, we show that HL-LHC and FCC-ee are expected to deliver a similar number of events, while the latter performs much better in the case of final state electrons. Regardless of the lepton flavour, we expect the FCC-ee environment to be much cleaner than at HL-LHC, with subleading systematics. We also find that a significant reduction in theory uncertainties on the SM predictions is required to capitalize on the advantage going from HL-LHC to FCC-ee. We demonstrate the power of such measurements at FCC-ee to extract information on the long-distance contribution to these decays, and to reveal evidence for new physics even if no deviations are seen in electroweak precision tests.</description>

      <title>Optimal Observables for the Chiral Magnetic Effect from Machine Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03248v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The detection of the Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME) in relativistic heavy-ion collisions remains challenging due to substantial background contributions that obscure the expected signal. In this Letter, we present a novel machine learning approach for constructing optimized observables that significantly enhance CME detection capabilities. By parameterizing generic observables constructed from flow harmonics and optimizing them to maximize the signal-to-background ratio, we systematically develop CME-sensitive measures that outperform conventional methods. Using simulated data from the Anomalous Viscous Fluid Dynamics framework, our machine learning observables demonstrate up to 90\% higher sensitivity to CME signals compared to traditional $\gamma$ and $\delta$ correlators, while maintaining minimal background contamination. The constructed observables provide physical insight into optimal CME detection strategies, and offer a promising path forward for experimental searches of CME at RHIC and the LHC.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21498v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we examine the domain wall within the framework of a cosmological harmonic oscillator. We investigate the interaction between the domain wall and a periodic background field, which can induce perturbations in the oscillatory behavior of the wall. We propose a novel mechanism for resolving the domain wall problem through the phenomenon of resonant oscillation. Resonant oscillation occurs when the frequency of the external driving force aligns with the intrinsic frequency of the domain wall. This synchrony can significantly amplify the amplitude of the oscillation. If the amplitude of oscillation exceeds a predetermined critical deformation threshold, the domain wall may be deconstructed. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this mechanism remains valid in models that preserve discrete symmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04279v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a parametrization of neutrino masses and mixing in the minimal seesaw model (MSM). The MSM, which introduces two heavy sterile neutrinos, is the minimal extension of the Standard Model in addressing the tiny masses of active neutrinos. The parametrization includes 11 free parameters: 6 neutrino oscillation parameters (2 mass-squared differences $\Delta m^2_{21}$, $\Delta m^2_{31}$, 3 mixing angles $\theta_{12}$, $\theta_{13}$, $\theta_{23}$, and 1 Dirac phase $\delta_{\rm CP}$), 1 mass parameter in $0\nu2\beta$ decay $m_{ee}$, and 4 additional parameters: 2 heavy neutrino masses $M_1$ and $M_2$, 1 active-sterile mixing angle $\theta_{14}$ and 1 CP-violating phase $\delta_{14}$. This parametrization is derived exactly from the most general neutrino mass matrix in the MSM without any approximation. We further discuss its implications in phenomenological studies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00494v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze various two-point correlation functions of fermionic bilinears in a rotating finite-size cylinder at finite temperatures, with a focus on susceptibility functions. Due to the noninvariance of radial translation, the susceptibility functions are constructed using the Dirac propagator in the Fourier-Bessel basis instead of the plane-wave basis. As a specific model to demonstrate the susceptibility functions in an interacting theory, we employ the two-flavor Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model. We show that the incompatibility between the mean-field analysis and the Fourier-Bessel basis is evaded under the local density approximation, and derive the resummation formulas of susceptibilities with the help of a Ward-Takahashi identity. The resulting formulation reveals the rotational effects on meson, baryon number, and topological susceptibilities, as well as the moment of inertia. Our results may serve a useful benchmark for future lattice QCD simulations in rotating frames.</description>

      <title>The $\theta$-term effects on isospin asymmetric hot and dense quark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02697v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of the CP-violating $\theta$ term on isospin symmetry breaking in quark matter and compact star properties using a two-flavor Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model. By incorporating the $\theta$ parameter through the Kobayashi-Maskawa-'t Hooft (KMT) determinant interaction, we derive the thermodynamic potential and gap equations under finite temperature, baryon chemical potential, and isospin chemical potential. At zero temperature and baryon density, $\theta$ suppresses conventional chiral ($\sigma$) and pion ($\pi$) condensates while promoting pseudo-scalar ($\eta$) and scalar-isovector ($\delta$) condensates, thereby reducing the critical isospin chemical potential $\mu_I^{\text{crit}}$ for spontaneous symmetry breaking. For $\theta=\pi$, a first-order phase transition emerges at $\mu_I^{\text{crit}} = 0.021$ GeV, accompanied by CP symmetry restoration. Extending the investigation to finite temperature and baryon chemical potential reveals that these $\theta$-term-induced effects persist. Axion effects (modeled via $\theta\equiv a/f_a$) stiffen the equation of state (EOS) of non-strange quark stars, increasing their maximum mass and radii, in agreement with multimessenger constraints from pulsar observations and gravitational wave events. These results establish $\theta$ as a critical parameter modulating both the Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) phase structure and compact star observables.</description>

      <title>Rare Higgs Decay into a Photon and a Z Boson in Radiatively-Driven Natural Supersymmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09395v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we study the rare decay process in which a Higgs boson decays into a $Z$ boson and a photon. In the first part of the paper, we analyze the Standard Model (SM) contributions to the corresponding decay width, including the full leading-order result, two-loop $O(\alpha_s)$ QCD corrections, and the recently reported two-loop $O(\alpha)$ electroweak corrections, evaluated under four different $\alpha$ renormalization schemes. The dependence on the Higgs boson mass is studied within the experimentally allowed range reported by the LHC. In the considered schemes, a non-negligible variation of about $4\%$ is found when the mass is varied within its current experimental uncertainty. In the second part of the paper, we analyze the leading-order contributions to the same process within the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM). The spectrum of soft SUSY-breaking parameters and SUSY particle masses at the electroweak scale, which enter the computation of the one-loop amplitudes contributing to the decay width, is obtained by evolving the GUT-scale parameters of a Radiatively-Driven Natural Supersymmetry (RNS) model with non-universal Higgs boson masses. Variations of the RNS parameters can enhance the average SM prediction by up to $\sim20\%$, reaching a value of $\sim7.5~$keV, while still satisfying the Higgs boson mass constraint. However, this comes at the cost of allowing a moderately large fine-tuning parameter, with values exceeding $100$, thereby placing the model outside its most natural parameter region. The predicted decay width in the RNS scenario is closer to the recent ATLAS RUN 2 + 3 combined measurement than the SM expectation.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Kinetic Mixing of Dark Photons from Dilepton Spectra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11163v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dark photons, the hypothetical gauge bosons associated with an additional $U(1)^{\prime}$ symmetry, can couple to Standard Model particles through a small kinetic mixing parameter $\varepsilon$ with the ordinary photon. This mechanism provides a portal between the dark sector and visible matter. In this study, we present a procedure to derive theoretical upper bounds on the kinetic mixing parameter $\varepsilon^2(M_U)$ by analyzing dilepton spectra from heavy-ion collisions across a broad energy range, from SIS to LHC energies. Our analysis is based on the microscopic Parton-Hadron-String Dynamics (PHSD) transport approach, which successfully reproduces the measured dilepton spectra in $p+p$, $p+A$, and $A+A$ collisions across the same energy range. Besides the dilepton channels resulting from interactions and decays of Standard Model particles (such as mesons and baryons), the PHSD has been extended to include the decay of hypothetical dark photons into dileptons, $U \to e^+ e^-$. The production of these dark photons occurs via Dalitz decays of $\pi^0$, $\eta$, $\omega$, $\eta^{\prime}$, and $\Delta$ resonances; direct decays of $\rho$, $\omega$, and $\phi$; the kaon mode $K^+ \to \pi^+ U$; and thermal $q\bar q$ annihilation in the quark-gluon plasma. Our results show that high-precision measurements of dilepton spectra in heavy-ion collisions provide a sensitive and competitive probe of dark photons in the MeV to multi-GeV mass range. Furthermore, we quantify the experimental accuracy required to constrain the remaining viable parameter space of kinetic mixing in dark photon scenarios.</description>

      <title>Parity violation in M{\o}ller scattering within low-energy effective field theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17652v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We include electroweak effects in Moller scattering at low energies in an effective field theory approach and compute the left-right parity-violating asymmetry. The calculation using low-energy effective field theory provides a solid framework to integrate out heavy particles with masses of the order of the electroweak scale, allowing the resummation of all large logarithms between the electroweak scale and the scale, where QCD perturbation theory breaks down. The NLO electroweak corrections with leading logarithmic resummation, combined with QED corrections at NNLO and hadronic effects are implemented into the Monte Carlo framework McMule. Thus, we obtain a fully differential description and present results adapted to the MOLLER experiment. The potential impact of large logarithms at the next-to-leading logarithmic level is investigated.</description>

      <title>Rare few-body decays of the Standard Model Higgs boson</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00466v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a survey of rare and exclusive few-body decays of the standard model (SM) Higgs boson, defined as those into two to four final particles with branching fractions $\mathcal{B}\lesssim 10^{-5}$. Studies of such decays can be exploited to constrain Yukawa couplings of quarks and leptons, probe flavour-changing Higgs decays, estimate backgrounds for exotic Higgs decays into beyond-SM particles, and/or confirm quantum chromodynamics factorization with small nonperturbative corrections. We collect the theoretical $\mathcal{B}$ values for about 70 unobserved Higgs rare decay channels, indicating their current experimental limits, and estimating their expected bounds in p-p collisions at the HL-LHC. Among those, we include 20 new decay channels computed for the first time for ultrarare Higgs boson decays into photons and/or neutrinos, radiative quark-flavour-changing exclusive decays, and radiative decays into leptonium states. This survey can help guide and prioritize upcoming experimental and theoretical studies of unobserved Higgs boson decays.</description>

      <title>Leptophilic dark matter in $U(1)_{L_{i}-L_{j}}$ models: a solution to the Fermi-LAT Galactic Center Excess consistent with cosmological and laboratory observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02775v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The particle origin of dark matter (DM) remains elusive despite decades of direct, indirect, and collider searches. Several groups have reported a $\gamma$-ray excess toward the Galactic Centre, commonly referred to as the Galactic Centre Excess (GCE). Its spectrum is consistent with annihilation of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) of mass $\mathcal{O}(10-100)$ GeV and a thermal-relic cross section. Although many concrete WIMP models reproduce the GCE spectrum, most are now excluded by direct detection experiments that are approaching the neutrino floor. We investigate a class of anomaly-free extensions of the Standard Model featuring gauged differences of lepton number, $U(1)_{L_i-L_j}$, and gauged baryon minus lepton number, $U(1)_{B-L}$. We show that these models can reproduce the GCE while remaining compatible with the observed relic abundance. We then impose collider and direct detection constraints, accounting for both tree-level and loop-induced kinetic mixing. The $L_\mu-L_e$ model gives the best fit to the GCE: a DM mass of $m_\chi\sim 40-50$ GeV remains consistent with the muon and electron magnetic moment anomalies, $(g-2)_{\mu,e}$, as well as current collider and direct detection limits, for mediator masses in the range $m_{A'}\sim 70-86$ GeV and a DM-mediator coupling of $(1-5)\times10^{-2}$. By contrast, the $L_e-L_\tau$ and $L_\mu-L_\tau$ models yield poorer fits; satisfying both the relic density and experimental bounds forces the DM mass to lie very close to resonance (i.e., approximately half the mediator mass). Finally, while the $B-L$ model also matches the GCE well, its parameter space is almost entirely ruled out by strong direct detection limits, except for the narrow resonance region where $m_\chi$ should be equal to $m_{A'}/2$ requiring a fine-tuning at the few-percent level.</description>

      <title>Renormalization Group Running of the Minimal Leptophilic Dark Matter Model toward a UV Completion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16299v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the renormalization group running of the coupling constants in a minimal leptophilic dark matter model in which a Standard Model singlet fermion, acting as the dark matter (DM) candidate, couples exclusively to right-handed charged leptons via a new charged scalar mediator. Reproduction of the observed thermal relic abundance of the DM candidate requires sizable Yukawa couplings, and such sizable Yukawa couplings can significantly affect the renormalization group evolution of the model parameters. We examine the conditions that the model remains perturbative and the vacuum stability is maintained up to high-energy scales. We find that the parameter space is severely constrained to ensure the perturbativity and the vacuum stability up to the Planck scale. In particular, the masses of the dark matter and the charged scalar mediator should be smaller than about 350 GeV and can be tested by future collider experiments. The lower bound of the dark matter mass that is larger than a few GeV is also obtained by perturbativity.</description>

      <title>NNLO electron structure functions (PDFs) from SCET</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16964v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We calculate the electron structure functions, aka parton distribution functions (PDFs), to NNLO in QED. The calculation is based on the definition of the PDFs in terms of operator matrix elements in soft collinear effective theory (SCET) and directly performed in momentum space. The electron PDFs describe the universal effects of collinear initial state radiation (ISR) off the electron (or positron) in DIS or $e^+ e^-$ collision events. The parton collinear to the electron that enters the hard scattering process governed by the energy scale $Q$ can be a photon or a (anti)fermion with mass $m_f \sim m_e \ll Q$. Our SCET momentum-space calculation confirms earlier results obtained from a QED computation in Mellin space and extends them by taking more than one massive fermion flavor into account. The well-known factorization of sufficiently inclusive cross sections into PDFs with massive fermions and hard partonic cross sections with massless fermions at leading order in $m_e/Q$ is discussed from the SCET perspective. Analogies to the nonperturbative PDFs and collinear factorization in QCD are pointed out. Based on this factorization DGLAP-type resummation of large logarithms of the ratio $m_e/Q$ is straightforward.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04325v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Probing the CP nature of the Higgs Yukawa couplings is a promising avenue for unraveling new physics effects. In this work, we investigate the possible single- and two-field UV origins of CP-violating leptonic Yukawa couplings, using the Standard Model Effective Field Theory as a stepping stone. We demonstrate a rich set of constraints on the UV model parameters, including direct Higgs measurements, electric and magnetic dipole moments of leptons, charged lepton flavor violating observables, and electroweak precision tests. Studying representative flavor assumptions we find that the precision constraints are often, but not always, more constraining than the dedicated LHC analyses of modified leptonic Yukawa couplings.</description>

      <title>Soft-hard factorization of heavy-quark transport in QCD matter at finite chemical potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23872v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We calculate the collisional energy loss and momentum diffusion coefficients of heavy quarks traversing a hot and dense QCD medium at finite quark chemical potential, $\mu\neq0$. The analysis is performed within an extended soft-hard factorization model (SHFM) that consistently incorporates the $\mu$-dependence of the Debye screening mass $M_D(\mu)$ and of the fermionic thermal distribution functions. Both the energy loss and the diffusion coefficients are found to increase with $\mu$, with the enhancement being most pronounced at low temperatures where the chemical potential effects dominate the medium response. To elucidate the origin of this dependence, we derive analytic high-energy approximations in which the leading $\mu$-corrections appear as logarithmic terms: a soft logarithm $\sim\mu^{2}\ln(|t^{*}|/M_{D}^{2})$ from $t$-channel scattering off thermal gluonic excitations, and a hard logarithm $\sim\mu^{2}\ln(E_{1}T/|t^{*}|)$ from scattering off thermal quarks. In the complete result the dependence on the intermediate separation scale $t^{\ast}$ cancels, as required. We also confirm the expected mass hierarchy $-dE/dz(charm)&lt;-dE/dz(bottom)$ at fixed velocity. Our findings demonstrate that finite chemical potential plays a significant role in heavy-quark transport and must be included in theoretical descriptions of heavy-flavor dynamics in baryon-rich environments, such as those probed in the RHIC Beam Energy Scan, and at FAIR and NICA.</description>

      <title>A Way of Axion Detection with Mass $10^{-4} \text{-}10^{-3}$eV Using Cylindrical Sample with Low Electric Conductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16746v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A dark matter axion with mass $m_a$ induces an oscillating electric field in a cylindrical sample placed under a magnetic field $B$ parallel to the cylinder axis. When the cylinder is made of a highly electrically conductive material, the induced oscillating current flows only at the surface. In contrast, if the cylinder is composed of a material with small conductivity, e.g. $\sigma = 10^{-3}\text{eV}$, the electric current flows inside the bulk of the cylinder. Within the QCD axion model, the current $I$ is estimated as $I(m_a=10^{-4}\text{eV}) \simeq 1.9\times 10^{-14}\text{A}g_{\gamma}(R/6\text{cm})^2 (\sigma/10^{-3}\text{eV})(B/10\text{T})(10/\epsilon)(\rho_a/0.3\text{GeVcm}^{-3}) $ with radius $R$, length $L$, permittivity $\epsilon = 10$ of the cylinder and axion energy density $\rho_a$, where $g_{\gamma}$ is model dependent parameter; $g_{\gamma}(\text{KSVZ}) = -0.96$ and $g_{\gamma}(\text{DFSZ}) = 0.37$. Using an LC circuit with a quality factor $Q = 10$, the signal-to-noise ratio at temperature $T=100$mK and observation time $t_{ob}=60$second is $\sim 0.5(Q/10)\sqrt{(m_a/10^{-4}\text{eV})(100\text{mK}/T)(t_{ob}/60\text{s})}$. The detection of dark matter axions is feasible in the mass range $m_a =10^{-4}\text{-}10^{-3}\text{eV}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.24396v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A recent study shows that incorporating a new term into the thermodynamic potential density, as required by the thermodynamic consistency criterion, can effectively resolve the thermodynamic inconsistency problems of the conventional perturbative QCD model. This additional term plays a crucial role in resolving inconsistencies at relatively low densities and becomes negligible at extremely high densities. Within this revised perturbative QCD model, we find that if we require only that the energy per baryon of up-down ($ud$) quark matter exceeds 930 MeV so as not to contradict the standard nuclear physics, the maximum mass of an $ud$ quark star allowed by the revised perturbative QCD model can reach up to 2.17 $M_{\odot}$. From this perspective, the observed 2.14 $M_{\odot}$ pulsar PSR J0740+6620 may be an $ud$ quark star. However, if we further impose the constraint that the tidal deformability of a 1.4 $M_{\odot}$ $ud$ quark star must be consistent with the GW170817 event, the maximum mass allowed by the revised perturbative QCD model would decrease to no more than 2.08 $M_{\odot}$. Consequently, our results suggest that the compact object with a mass of 2.50-2.67 $M_{\odot}$, as observed in the GW190814 event, cannot be an $ud$ quark star, according to the revised perturbative QCD model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.27691v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine theoretical uncertainties in state-of-the-art calculations of the bubble wall velocity during first-order cosmological phase transitions. By utilising the software WallGo for two extensions of the Standard Model, we find several $O(1)$ uncertainties arising from the number of particles taken out of equilibrium, the logarithmically and power enhanced collision integrals, the treatment of thermal masses, the nucleation temperature, the $\tanh$ ansatz, and the perturbative order of the effective potential. However, we show that the linearisation of the Boltzmann equations is generally a good approximation with much smaller associated errors. We further clarify the limitations of the quasiparticle approximation in regions with negative mass squared. This study provides a detailed uncertainty budget and highlights where future efforts should be directed to improve the reliability of wall velocity and hence gravitational wave predictions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04537v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Within the collinear factorization framework based on Generalized Parton Distributions (GPDs), we calculate the spin density matrix of exclusively produced quark and antiquark pairs $u\bar{u}$, $d\bar{d}$, $s\bar{s}$, $c\bar{c}$, $b\bar{b}$ in Deep Inelastic Scattering. The presence of both real and imaginary parts in the GPD amplitudes leads to a rich pattern of entanglement between the quark and the antiquark. We map out kinematical regions where the pairs exhibit entanglement, Bell nonlocality and non-stabilizerness (`magic'). We also predict that massive quarks and antiquarks are transversely polarized, similar to the well-known transverse hyperon polarization in unpolarized collisions. In strangeness, charm and bottom productions, the polarization can reach 50-80% in certain kinematic regions in the low-energy runs of the Electron-Ion Collider.</description>

      <title>Perturbative aspects of the electroweak phase transition with a complex singlet and implications for gravitational wave predictions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.14831v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a detailed analysis of strong first-order electroweak phase transitions within the extension of the Standard Model by a complex scalar singlet (cxSM). Focusing on the impact of renormalization scale and gauge dependence, we systematically compare commonly used perturbative frameworks for predicting thermodynamic observables that characterize the phase transition and the associated gravitational-wave (GW) spectrum. These include both the four-dimensional ($4D$) formalism and the dimensionally reduced three-dimensional effective field theory ($3D$ EFT) approach in different renormalization schemes. Within the $3D$ EFT, we compute the effective potential up to two-loop order in a general $R_\xi$ gauge, and demonstrate that applying the $\hbar$-expansion yields gauge-independent results in excellent agreement with those obtained from a direct minimization of the loop-corrected potential. In contrast, large discrepancies between the two methods persist in the $4D$ approaches. We find that, across most of the parameter space, the $3D$ EFT approach provides the most robust predictions for phase-transition parameters and GW spectra, reducing theoretical uncertainties in the GW peak amplitude by more than an order of magnitude compared to the $4D$ calculations. We point out, however, that the $3D$ EFT approach is subject to an additional theory uncertainty from truncating the EFT at finite operator dimension and show that higher-dimensional operators within the $3D$ EFT approach can substantially modify the predicted transition strength and GW signals. This indicates a potential breakdown of the high-temperature expansion precisely in the region with the lowest transition temperatures, where the strongest GW signals are expected and the detection prospects with LISA are most promising.</description>

      <title>$\mathbb Z_2$-Stable Dark Matter via Broken $\text{SU}(5)$ Gauge Bosons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19462v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I construct and analyze a dark matter sector that is neutral under the unbroken Standard Model gauge group and couples only to the broken $\text{SU}(5)$ gauge directions, the leptoquark vectors $X,Y$. An exact $\mathbb Z_2$ renders the dark matter stable. I give a gauge-covariant definition of projectors onto the unbroken Standard Model and broken ($X,Y$) subspaces, demonstrate that the covariant derivative of dark matter selects only $X,Y$, and integrate out $X,Y$ at tree level to obtain the leading effective operators. I also derive the loop-induced $\chi^2\,G^a_{\mu\nu}G^{a\mu\nu}$ coupling to gluons, prove color neutrality, and show consistency with cold dark matter phenomenology. Cosmological production proceeds via UV freeze-in or even more suppressed channels in.</description>

      <title>Production of excited $\Lambda_c^+$ baryons through $\Lambda_b$ hadronic weak decays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21483v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, to establish a more abundant $\Lambda_c$ baryon spectrum, we discuss the production potentials of the excited $\Lambda_c$ baryons through $\Lambda_b$ hadronic weak decays within a constituent quark model. Based on our successful explanations of the existing experimental data for the $\Lambda_b \to \Lambda_c(\pi^-, K^{-}, D^{-}, D^{-}_s, D_s^{*-})$ processes, we further calculate the decay rates of the $\Lambda_b$ baryon into the $1P$-, $1D$-, $2S$-, $3S$-, $2P$-, $1F$-, and $2D$-wave $\Lambda_c$ excited states. It is found that these $\Lambda_c$ excitations have a large production rate in the $\Lambda_b$ hadronic weak decay process associated $\pi^-$ meson emitting, i.e., $\Lambda_b\to \Lambda_c^{*}\pi^-$, their branching fractions can reach up to $\mathcal{O}(10^{-3})$. To search for the higher $3S$-, $2P$-, $1F$-, and $2D$-wave $\Lambda_c$ states, the $\Lambda_b \to \Lambda_c (3S) \pi^-\to D^{*0}p \pi^-$, and $\Lambda_b\to \Lambda_c(2P,2D,1F) \pi^-\to D^{(*)0}p\pi^-$ decays are worth observing in future experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14531v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first joint-likelihood analysis of Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) and Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data. Bayesian inference is performed on the baryon abundance and the effective number of neutrino species, $N_{\rm eff}$, using a CMB Boltzmann solver in combination with LINX, a new flexible and efficient BBN code. We marginalize over Planck nuisance parameters and nuclear rates to find $N_{\rm{eff}} = 3.08_{-0.13}^{+0.13},\,2.94 _{-0.16}^{+0.16},$ or $2.98_{-0.13}^{+0.14}$, for three separate reaction networks. This framework enables robust testing of the Lambda Cold Dark Matter paradigm and its variants with CMB and BBN data.</description>

Abstract: We introduce LINX (Light Isotope Nucleosynthesis with JAX), a new differentiable public Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) code designed for fast parameter estimation. By leveraging JAX, LINX achieves both speed and differentiability, enabling the use of Bayesian inference, including gradient-based methods. We discuss the formalism used in LINX for rapid primordial elemental abundance predictions and give examples of how LINX can be used. When combined with differentiable Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) power spectrum emulators, LINX can be used for joint CMB and BBN analyses without requiring extensive computational resources, including on personal hardware.</description>

Abstract: Most of the matter in the universe is in the form of dark matter, that has evaded detection so far. ALPs -- ultralight axionlike particles -- are a class of dark matter candidates that produce measurable signatures in the form of oscillating violations of discrete symmetries in nuclei. We report results from a search for an oscillating parity-odd time-reversal-odd nuclear Schiff moment of $^{153}$Eu ions in a crystal, which leads to constraints on ALP-gluon coupling strength across a wide band spanning eight decades in ALP mass.</description>

      <title>Cosmological perturbation theory with trinity of scalar fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02991v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an explicit formulation of cosmological perturbation theory for three-field models with a flat field space. By performing rotations to align one field with the direction of curvature perturbations and applying the same rotations to the other two field directions, we introduce the semikinematic basis, which is applicable to models with more than two fields. We derive the governing equations in this basis. We also stress a characteristic property of more-than-two-field models: the freedom in choosing the isocurvature perturbations. This framework enables the computation of the curvature and two isocurvature power spectra for any given potential. We numerically solve the background and perturbation equations for three distinct scenarios. First, to validate the consistency of our three-field formalism, we examine an effective two-field model inspired by the two-block case of the multigiant vacua matrix inflation scenario. Next, we analyze a purely three-field system without direct interfield interactions. Finally, we study a three-field case that incorporates direct interactions. For all scenarios, we numerically compute the curvature perturbation power spectra and highlight the effects of rapid turns on the spectra. Finally, we investigate the relationship between these quantities and the observables in the early radiation-dominated era. Through both general arguments and a simple example, we show that three-field inflation can yield a much richer phenomenology. This is particularly true when we assume the initial perturbations in the radiation era include two isocurvature modes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13047v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a neural network training method capable of accounting for the effects of systematic variations of the data model in the training process and describe its extension towards neural network multiclass classification. The procedure is evaluated on the realistic case of the measurement of Higgs boson production via gluon fusion and vector boson fusion in the $\tau\tau$ decay channel at the CMS experiment. The neural network output functions are used to infer the signal strengths for inclusive production of Higgs bosons as well as for their production via gluon fusion and vector boson fusion. We observe improvements of 12 and 16% in the uncertainty in the signal strengths for gluon and vector-boson fusion, respectively, compared with a conventional neural network training based on cross-entropy.</description>

      <title>Conditions for Quantum Violation of Macrorealism in Large-spin Limit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13162v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the emergence of macroscopic classical behavior from quantum foundations via the entropic Leggett--Garg inequality. We introduce a geometric framework for deriving entropic Leggett--Garg inequalities with higher-order temporal correlations and demonstrate their advantages over conventional formulations. Numerical analyses show that entropic Leggett--Garg inequalities offer a robust and complementary criterion to standard approaches, providing a transparent information theoretic interpretation that facilitates the characterization of coherent quantum processes. By applying the WKB approximation, we prove that violations for maximally mixed states remain bounded by a constant in the macroscopic limit, indicating that macrorealism dominates in generic parameter regimes. We further explain previously reported maximal violations at specific parameter regimes as a consequence of the breakdown of the WKB approximation. Our findings indicate that quantum and classical descriptions remain macroscopically incompatible, while violations persist only in fine-tuned regimes, clarifying the conditions for detecting macroscopic quantum phenomena.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of magnetized BPS baryonic layers and the effects of the Isospin chemical potential</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18007v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Through the Hamilton-Jacobi equation of classical mechanics, BPS magnetized Baryonic layers (possessing both baryonic charge and magnetic flux) have been constructed in the gauged non-linear sigma model (G-NLSM) minimally coupled to Maxwell theory, which is one of the most relevant effective theories for Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) in the strongly interacting low-energy limit which also takes into account the electromagnetic interactions. Since the topological charge that naturally appears on the right hand side of the BPS bound is a non-linear function of the baryonic charge, the thermodynamics of these magnetized Baryonic layers is highly non-trivial. In this work, using tools from the theory of Casimir effect, we derive analytical relationship between baryonic charge, topological charge, magnetic flux and relevant thermodynamical quantities (such as pressure, specific heat and magnetic susceptibility) of these layers. The critical Baryonic chemical potential is identified. Quite interestingly, the grand canonical partition function can be related with the Riemann zeta function. On the technical side, it is quite a remarkable result to derive explicit expressions for all these thermodynamics quantities of a strongly interacting magnetized system at finite Baryon density. The effects of the Isospin chemical potential can be included as well: in particular, we will be able to construct explicitly the BPS bound and the corresponding BPS configurations also in the case in which the Isospin chemical potential is non-zero. The physical interpretations of our analytical results will be discussed.</description>

      <title>Effect of Noncommutative Geometry on Accretion Disks around RGI-Schwarzschild Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13056v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we explore the combined effects of quantum gravity induced by non-commutativity and scale-dependent gravitational coupling on the thermal properties of the thin accretion disks around a Schwarzschild black hole. We consider a $\kappa$-deformed Renormalization Group Improved (RGI) Schwarzschild black hole, where the classical Schwarzschild black hole geometry is modified by the $\kappa$-deformation of space-time and the running Newton's coupling constant $G(r)$. Using the modified metric, we derive the geodesic motion of massive particles, the effective potential, and the thermal properties such as the radiated energy flux, luminosity, and the temperature profile of the accretion disk around the $\kappa$-deformed RGI-Schwarzschild black hole. Our study shows that when non-commutativity is combined with the RGI framework, the effects produce a noticeable deviation from the classical Schwarzschild case. In particular, for small values of the deformation parameter, we observe an increase in the peak energy flux and the temperature of the accretion disk. This suggests that quantum gravity corrections enhance the disk's radiative efficiency, especially in the inner regions closer to the black hole.</description>

      <title>SN2023syz and SN2025cbj: Two Type IIn Supernovae Associated with IceCube High-energy Neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19080v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Type IIn supernovae (SNe IIn) are a subclass of core-collapse SNe in which strong interactions occur between the ejecta and dense circumstellar material, creating ideal conditions for the production of high-energy neutrinos. This makes them promising candidate sources of neutrinos.In this work, we conduct an association study between 163 SNe IIn observed by the Zwicky Transient Facility and 138 neutrino alert events detected by the IceCube neutrino observatory. After excluding alerts with poor localization, we find two SNe that are spatiotemporally coincident with neutrino events. IC231027A and IC250421A coincide with the positions of SN2023syz and SN2025cbj, respectively, within their localization uncertainties, and the neutrino arrival times are delayed by 38 days and 61 days relative to the discovery times of the corresponding SNe. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we estimate that the probability of such two coincidences occurring by chance in our sample is $p \sim 0.67\%$, suggesting that they may originate from genuine physical associations, though the result is not yet statistically significant. Our model calculations, however, indicate that the likelihood of a neutrino originating from IC231027A is low, implying that the association between IC231027A and SN2023syz is likely coincidental. Nevertheless, under optimistic parameters, the probability of detecting a neutrino from the whole SNe IIn sample could reach $\gtrsim6\%$, indicating that detecting neutrino emission from the SNe population may be possible. Our study provides a systematic analysis, combining statistical analysis and model calculations, to assess whether interacting supernovae can serve as potential sources of neutrino emission.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08501v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate an approximation to the Schwinger-Dyson (SD) equations of the collective Coulomb field of the large $N$ Homogeneous Electron Fluid. The large $N$ approximation transforms the infinite SD hierarchy into a set of closed, equations for 1 and 2-pt correlators. In this paper, the dynamics of a toy model -- a small, square Euclidean lattice with periodic boundary conditions -- are considered. The Markov Chain Monte Carlo numerical method evaluated the 1 and 2-pt correlation functions on a $2 \times 2$ and $3 \times 3$ lattice. The derived equations are checked with the correlator values, and an agreement at $N \sim 100$ to order $10^{-3}$ was found. The agreement can be further strengthened by increasing runs in the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method.</description>

      <title>The String Theory Photoverse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12874v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: String theory compactifications come with numerous $U(1)$ factors, implying the presence of many hidden photons in the low-energy EFT. One may call this the ``string photoverse''. We argue that, generically, these hidden photons are massless and do not couple to any light dark current such that, naively, kinetic mixing with the Standard Model is unobservable. The leading interactions of these ``superhidden'' photons are then dimension-6 dipole operators which couple them to quarks or leptons and the Higgs field. This induces magnetic and electric dipole moments with respect to both the superhidden photons as well as, through kinetic mixing, to the Standard Model photon. We derive these couplings by dimensionally reducing the fermionic action of 7-branes realizing the Standard Model: In the first step to 6d theories on intersection curves and then, in the presence of fluxes, to our 4d chiral EFT. We analyze how experiments and observations can employ this effect to place lower bounds on the string scale, which is relevant for compactifications with very large volumes. Finally, we briefly discuss how supersymmetry implies the presence of relatively light photinos and hence an accompanying ``photinoverse'', which may be observed via renormalizable mixing effects.</description>

Abstract: We report a high precision calculation of the isospin vector charge $g_{S,T}$ of the nucleon using recently proposed ``blending" method which provides a high-precision stochastic estimate of the all-to-all fermion propagator. By combining the current-involved interpolation operator, which can efficiently cancel the major excited state contaminations, we can extract high-precision $g_S$ and $g_T$ directly at the physical pion mass. Using 15 $N_f=2+1$ lattice ensembles which cover 5 lattice spacing, 5 combinations with the same quark masses and lattice spacing but multiple volumes, including three at the physical pion mass, we report so far most precise lattice QCD prediction $g_T^{\rm QCD} = 1.0256[78]_{\rm tot}(58)_{\rm stat} (17)_{a} (44)_{\rm FV} (01)_\chi (22)_{\rm ex} (05)_{\rm re}$ and $g_S^{\rm QCD} = 1.107[46]_{\rm tot}(32)_{\rm stat} ( 04)_{a} (29)_{\rm FV} (01)_\chi (13)_{\rm ex} (08)_{\rm re}$ at $\overline{\mathrm{MS}}$ 2~GeV, with the systematic uncertainties from continuum, infinite volume, chiral extrapolations, excited state contamination and also renormalization.</description>

      <title>A Bottom-Up EFT Approach To Superdense Baryonic Matter</title>

Abstract: How to arrive at the densest matter in massive compact stars starting from Walecka's linear $\omega$-$\sigma$ mean-field model is described in a series of arguments anchored on hidden local symmetry, hidden scale symmetry and emergent parity-doublet symmetry. I follow the bottom-up approach from chiral symmetry with pions, coupled to hidden local and scale symmetry degrees of freedom. Exploiting the renormalization-group treatment \`a la Shankar and Polchinski of the fermionic interactions on the Fermi sphere, leading to Landau-Migdal Fermi-liquid, one obtains a sort of generalized ``Density Functional" that allows via a topology change hadrons transform to quarks without phase changes at the center of massive stars. The highly dense matter is ``pseudo-conformal" with the sound velocity $v_{pcs}^2/c^2\approx 1/3$ but the trace of the energy-momentum tensor is not equal to zero, hence the matter is non-conformal.</description>
