      <title>Vietoris--Rips Shadow for Euclidean Graph Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The shadow of an abstract simplicial complex $K$ with vertices in $\mathbb R^N$ is a subset of $\mathbb R^N$ defined as the union of the convex hulls of simplices of $K$. The Vietoris--Rips complex of a metric space $(S,d)$ at scale $\beta$ is an abstract simplicial complex whose each $k$-simplex corresponds to $(k+1)$ points of $S$ within diameter $\beta$. In case $S\subset\mathbb R^2$ and $d(a,b)=\|a-b\|$ standard Euclidean, the natural shadow projection of the Vietoris--Rips is already proved to be $1$-connected. We extend the result beyond the standard Euclidean distance on $S\subset\mathbb R^N$ to a family of path-based metrics $d^\varepsilon_{S}$. From the pairwise Euclidean distances of points of $S$, we introduce a family (parametrized by $\varepsilon$) of path-based Vietoris--Rips complexes $R^\varepsilon_\beta(S)$ for a scale $\beta&gt;0$. If $S\subset\mathbb R^2$ is Hausdorff-close to a planar Euclidean graph $G$, we provide quantitative bounds on scales $\beta,\varepsilon$ for the shadow projection map of the Vietoris--Rips of $(S,d^\varepsilon_{S})$ at scale $\beta$ to be $1$-connected. As a novel application, this paper first studies the homotopy-type recovery of $G\subset\mathbb R^N$ using the abstract Vietoris--Rips complex of a Hausdorff-close sample $S$ under the $d^\varepsilon_{S}$ metric. Then, our result on the $1$-connectivity of the shadow projection lends itself to providing also a geometrically close embedding for the reconstruction. Based on the length of the shortest loop and large-scale distortion of the embedding of $G$, we quantify the choice of a suitable sample density $\varepsilon$ and a scale $\beta$ at which the shadow of $R^\varepsilon_\beta(S)$ is homotopy-equivalent and Hausdorff-close to $G$.</description>

      <title>Trivial Monodromy without Separation: A Non-Hausdorff Counterexample in Covering Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a concrete topological construction, a non-Hausdorff, locally Euclidean space with multiple origins, that behaves unexpectedly well under path-lifting. Despite lacking the Hausdorff property, the space remains second-countable, T1, and path-connected, yet its fundamental group sees only trivial monodromy. This violates intuitive expectations from classical covering theory and invites a systematic rethinking of how separation axioms interact with lifting properties. We offer this space as a foundational test case for a broader theory of generalized covers in non-Hausdorff settings. We invite mathematicians to explore its categorical, logical, and geometric consequences, and to develop the corresponding machinery.</description>

      <title>A Topological Semantics of Dialogue: Nerve Structures and Logical Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a concise, topologically-motivated semantics for finite dialogues by mapping each utterance to an open set in a fixed semantic space, building the corresponding nerve complex of joint satisfiability, and extracting fundamental combinatorial invariants:
  1. The negative nerve, which enumerates all finite collections of utterances whose
  opens have empty intersection, providing a straightforward criterion for merging
  separate transcripts without contradiction.
  2. The global interpretation subspace, the unique minimal open in which all asserted
  utterances hold simultaneously, enabling effective enumeration of all logical
  consequences of the entire dialogue.
  3. A practical demonstration in the Wolfram Language, with algorithms for constructing
  nerves, detecting inconsistencies, and computing the global interpretation, thereby
  illustrating computational feasibility.
  Our framework is grounded in classical duality and topological semantics (Stone duality, Priestley duality, Tarski's semantics, coherence-space methods, Scott domains, topos semantics, and homotopy type theory) while drawing on recent advances in topological data analysis and dialogue-based semantics.</description>

      <title>New aspects of quantum topological data analysis: Betti number estimation, and testing and tracking of homology and cohomology classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, the application of quantum computation to topological data analysis (TDA) has received increasing attention. In particular, several quantum algorithms have been proposed for estimating (normalized) Betti numbers, a central challenge in TDA. However, it was recently proven that estimating Betti numbers is an NP-hard problem, revealing a complexity-theoretic limitation to achieving a generic quantum advantage for this task. Motivated by this limitation and inspired by previous progress, we explore broader quantum approaches to TDA. First, we consider scenarios in which a simplicial complex is specified in a more informative form, enabling alternative quantum algorithms to estimate Betti numbers and persistent Betti numbers. We then move beyond Betti numbers and study the problem of testing the homology class of a given cycle, as well as distinguishing between homology classes. We also introduce cohomological techniques for these problems, along with a quantum algorithm. We then discuss their potential use in the testing and tracking of homology classes, which can be useful for TDA applications. Our results show that, despite the hardness of general Betti number estimation, quantum algorithms can still offer speed-ups in structured settings.</description>

      <title>Latent Space Topology Evolution in Multilayer Perceptrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a topological framework for interpreting the internal representations of Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs). We construct a simplicial tower, a sequence of simplicial complexes connected by simplicial maps, that captures how data topology evolves across network layers. Our approach enables bi-persistence analysis: layer persistence tracks topological features within each layer across scales, while MLP persistence reveals how these features transform through the network. We prove stability theorems for our topological descriptors and establish that linear separability in latent spaces is related to disconnected components in the nerve complexes. To make our framework practical, we develop a combinatorial algorithm for computing MLP persistence and introduce trajectory-based visualisations that track data flow through the network. Experiments on synthetic and real-world medical data demonstrate our method's ability to identify redundant layers, reveal critical topological transitions, and provide interpretable insights into how MLPs progressively organise data for classification.</description>

      <title>Stabilization of the Spread-Global Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by constructions from applied topology, there has been recent interest in the homological algebra of linear representations of posets, specifically in homological algebra relative to non-standard exact structures. A prominent example of such exact structure is the spread exact structure, which is an exact structure on the category of representations of a fixed poset whose indecomposable projectives are the spread representations (that is, the indicator representations of convex and connected subsets). The spread-global dimension is known to be finite on finite posets, and unbounded on the collection of Cartesian products between two arbitrary finite total orders. It is conjectured in [AENY23] that the spread-global dimension is bounded on the collection of Cartesian products between a fixed, finite total order and an arbitrary finite total order. We give a positive answer to this conjecture, and, more generally, we prove that the spread-global dimension is bounded on the collection of Cartesian products between any fixed, finite poset and an arbitrary finite total order. In doing this, we also establish the existence of finite spread-resolutions for finitely presented representations of arbitrary upper semilattices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18497v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a constructive model of homotopy type theory in a Quillen model category that classically presents the usual homotopy theory of spaces. Our model is based on presheaves over the cartesian cube category, a well-behaved Eilenberg-Zilber category. The key innovation is an additional equivariance condition in the specification of the cubical Kan fibrations, which can be described as the pullback of an interval-based class of uniform fibrations in the category of symmetric sequences of cubical sets. The main technical results in the development of our model have been formalized in a computer proof assistant.</description>

Abstract: We define real topological Hochschild homology of separated log schemes with involutions. We show that real topological Hochschild homology is $(\mathbb{P}^n,\mathbb{P}^{n-1})$-invariant, which leads to the definition of the motivic real topological Hochschild spectrum living in a certain $\mathbb{Z}/2$-equivariant logarithmic motivic category. We explore properties of real topological Hochschild homology that can be deduced from the logarithmic motivic homotopy theory. We also define the motivic real topological cyclic spectrum.</description>

      <title>Spectral Sequence Computation of Higher Twisted $K$-Groups of $ SU(n)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.00423v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the Freed-Hopkins-Teleman theorem we study graded equivariant higher twists of $K$-theory for the groups $G = SU(n)$ induced by exponential functors. We compute the rationalisation of these groups for all $n$ and all non-trivial functors. Classical twists use the determinant functor and yield equivariant bundles of compact operators that are classified by Dixmier-Douady theory. Their equivariant $K$-theory reproduces the Verlinde ring of conformal field theory. Higher twists give equivariant bundles of stable UHF algebras, which can be classified using stable homotopy theory. Rationally, only the $K$-theory in degree $\dim(G)$ is again non-trivial. The non-vanishing group is a quotient of a localisation of the representation ring $R(G) \otimes \mathbb{Q}$ by a higher fusion ideal $J_{F,\mathbb{Q}}$. We give generators for this ideal and prove that these can be obtained as derivatives of a potential. For the exterior algebra functor, which is exponential, we show that the determinant bundle over $LSU(n)$ has a non-commutative counterpart where the fibre is the unitary group of the UHF algebra.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19396v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To our knowledge, the analysis of convergence rates for persistence diagrams estimation from noisy signals has predominantly relied on lifting signal estimation results through sup-norm (or other functional norm) stability theorems. We believe that moving forward from this approach can lead to considerable gains. We illustrate it in the setting of nonparametric regression. From a minimax perspective, we examine the inference of persistence diagrams (for the sublevel sets filtration). We show that for piecewise H\"older-continuous functions, with control over the reach of the set of discontinuities, taking the persistence diagram coming from a simple histogram estimator of the signal permits achieving the minimax rates known for H\"older-continuous functions.</description>

      <title>Residual finiteness of some automorphism groups of high dimensional manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08902v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that for a smooth, closed 2-connected manifold $M$ of dimension $d \geq 6$, the topological mapping class group $\pi_0 \mathrm{Homeo}(M)$ is residually finite, in contrast to the situation for the smooth mapping class group $\pi_0 \mathrm{Diff}(M)$. Combined with a result of Sullivan, this implies that $\pi_0 \mathrm{Homeo}(M)$ is an arithmetic group. The proof uses embedding calculus, and is of independent interest: we show that the $T_k$-mapping class group, $\pi_0 T_k \mathrm{Diff}(M)$, is residually finite, for all $k \in \mathbb{N}$. The statement on the topological mapping class group is then deduced from the Weiss fibre sequence, convergence of the embedding calculus tower and smoothing theory.</description>

Abstract: Inspired by the simple fact that a compact n-dimensional manifold-with-boundary which satisfies Poincar\'e-Lefschetz duality of dimension n has a boundary which itself satisfies Poincar\'e duality of dimension n, we show that the categorical formal punctured neighborhood of infinity, a canonical categorical construction associated to every $A_{\infty}$ category, has a weak proper Calabi-Yau structure of dimension n-1 whenever the original $A_{\infty}$ category admits a weak smooth Calabi-Yau structure of dimension n. Applications include proper Calabi-Yau structures on Rabinowitz Fukaya category of a Liouville manifold and Orlov's singularity category of a proper singular Gorenstein scheme of finite type.</description>

      <title>Generalized Symmetries of Non-SUSY and Discrete Torsion String Backgrounds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10484v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: String / M-theory backgrounds with degrees of freedom at a localized singularity provide a general template for generating strongly correlated systems decoupled from lower-dimensional gravity. There are by now several complementary procedures for extracting the associated generalized symmetry data from orbifolds of the form $\mathbb{R}^6 / \Gamma$, including methods based on the boundary topology of the asymptotic geometry, as well as the adjacency matrix for fermionic degrees of freedom in the quiver gauge theory of probe branes. In this paper we show that this match between the two methods also works in non-supersymmetric and discrete torsion backgrounds. In particular, a refinement of geometric boundary data based on Chen-Ruan cohomology matches the expected answer based on quiver data. Additionally, we also show that free (i.e., non-torsion) factors count the number of higher-dimensional branes which couple to the localized singularity. We use this to also extract quadratic pairing terms in the associated symmetry theory (SymTh) for these systems, and explain how these considerations generalize to a broader class of backgrounds.</description>

      <title>Hypergraph Neural Sheaf Diffusion: A Symmetric Simplicial Set Framework for Higher-Order Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05702v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The absence of intrinsic adjacency relations and orientation systems in hypergraphs creates fundamental challenges for constructing sheaf Laplacians of arbitrary degrees. We resolve these limitations through symmetric simplicial sets derived directly from hypergraphs, which encode all possible oriented subrelations within each hyperedge as ordered tuples. This construction canonically defines adjacency via facet maps while inherently preserving hyperedge provenance. We establish that the normalized degree zero sheaf Laplacian on our induced symmetric simplicial set reduces exactly to the traditional graph normalized sheaf Laplacian when restricted to graphs, validating its mathematical consistency with prior graph-based sheaf theory. Furthermore, the induced structure preserves all structural information from the original hypergraph, ensuring that every multi-way relational detail is faithfully retained. Leveraging this framework, we introduce Hypergraph Neural Sheaf Diffusion (HNSD), the first principled extension of Neural Sheaf Diffusion (NSD) to hypergraphs. HNSD operates via normalized degree zero sheaf Laplacians over symmetric simplicial sets, resolving orientation ambiguity and adjacency sparsity inherent to hypergraph learning. Experimental evaluations demonstrate HNSD's competitive performance across established benchmarks.</description>
