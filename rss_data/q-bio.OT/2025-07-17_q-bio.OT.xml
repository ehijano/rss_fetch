      <title>Effect of organic fertilizer and nano calcium spray on growth, yield and storage characteristics of fig fruits cv. waziri</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study was carried out to estimate the effect of organic fertilizer and Nano Calcium spray on the growth, yield, and storage of fig fruits cv. Waziri. It was conducted in the village of Kani Sard in the Sharbazhir district near the Sitak area. This is about 35 km northeast of the center of Sulaymaniyah. This study was conducted at 54 plants with three-year-old fig trees cultivated using the cordon method during the 2024 growth season. The controlled environment of the plastic house enabled a precise evaluation of how different fertilizer treatments affected plant development, fruit traits, and post-storage fruit quality. A randomized complete block design (R.C.B.D.) factorial laid out within two main factors: Bio Health fertilizer applied at three levels (0, 15, and 30 g tree-1) and Nano Calcium applied at three concentrations (0, 75, and 150 mg L-1). The Bio Health fertilizer was applied to the plant in the soil, and Nano Calcium as the foliage with a 16-liter backpack sprayer until completely wet. The fertilizer was supplied in two batches during the growing season, with sprayed in three batches, including the first added (16/4/2024) and the second on (16/5/2024), and the first spraying after a week of fruit holding (25/5/2024). The second spray was after 15 days of the first one, and the third after 15 days of the second spraying. The study reached the following results.</description>

      <title>Urban Dengue and Spatial Dependence: A SAR Model Incorporating Favela Data in Recife, Brazil</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we used a dataset of approximately 96,000 reported dengue cases from 2015 to 2024 in Recife, the capital of northeastern Brazil, all geocoded by neighborhood. The dataset was enriched with sociodemographic data from the national census (population density, average residents per household), the proportion of slum areas per neighborhood, a dummy variable for high-income neighborhoods (above 7.5 minimum wages), seasonal information (rainy/dry), and water indicators derived from NDWI and MNDWI indexes. We first tested for spatial dependence in dengue cases per square kilometer using Moran's I, which confirmed significant spatial autocorrelation, justifying spatial econometric models. We then applied the SAR (Spatial Autoregressive) model with the listed variables and tested four spatial weight structures (Queen, Rook, KNN, Distance Band). The best-performing model was SAR with Rook contiguity, yielding a pseudo-R-squared of 0.6864 and a spatial pseudo-R-squared of 0.6934. Five variables showed p-values below 0.05. Moran's I applied to the residuals showed no significant spatial autocorrelation, suggesting the model effectively captured spatial structure. The SAC model (also with Rook) was tested but SAR remained slightly superior. In addition to generating a thematic risk map, the SAR model ranked neighborhoods by predicted vulnerability. The Spearman correlation between predicted and observed rankings was 0.901. These findings support SAR as a robust tool for understanding urban dengue patterns and for informing graph-based SIR models.</description>

      <title>Gene-environment interplay and public policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22441v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This perspective posits that gene-environment interplay (GxE) studies should be developed both theoretically and empirically to be of relevance to policy makers. On the theoretical front, this development is essential because the current literature lacks the integration of a clear framework capturing the various goals of public policies. Empirically, GxE models need to be further developed because the common way of modelling GxE effects fails to adequately capture the heterogeneous effects public policies may have along the distribution of genetic propensities (as captured by polygenic indices). We fill these gaps by proposing a policy classification for GxE research and by offering guidance on advancing the empirical modelling of policy-informative GxE interplay. While doing so, we provide a review of existing GxE studies on educational outcomes exploiting policy reforms or environments that could be targeted by public policy.</description>
