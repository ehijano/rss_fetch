      <title>Explicit Generators for the Unit Group of the Burnside ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To the best of our knowledge, there is no explicit, constructive description of the generating set for the unit group $A(G)^\times$ of the Burnside ring associated with a finite group $G$. We resolve this long-standing open question, proving that $A(G)^\times$ is generated by the set of \emph{basic degrees} -- canonical Burnside ring elements arising from the $G$-equivariant degree of the identity map on irreducible $G$-representations. In particular, we demonstrate that every unit in $A(G)$ is realized as the equivariant degree of a linear $G$-isomorphism on a suitable orthogonal $G$-representation which, in turn, can be described as the Burnside ring product of a finite number of basic degrees, establishing a concrete link between the multiplicative structure of the Burnside ring and the field of equivariant topology.</description>

      <title>Weakly Strongly 2-Nil-Clean Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce and explore in-depth the notion of {\it weakly strongly 2-nil-clean rings} as a common non-trivial generalization of both strongly 2-nil-clean rings and strongly weakly nil-clean rings as defined and studied by Chen-Sheibani in the J. Algebra \&amp; Appl. (2017). We, specifically, succeeded to prove that any weakly strongly 2-nil-clean ring is strongly $\pi$-regular and, concretely, it decomposes as the direct product of a strongly 2-nil-clean ring and a ring of the type $\mathbb{Z}_{2^k}$ for some $k\geq 1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish noncommutative Kn\"{o}rrer periodicity for projective-module factorizations over an arbitrary ring, using the equivariantization theory with respect to various actions by a cyclic group of order two. We obtain an explicit quasi-inverse of the periodicity. We compare the periodicity with a certain tensor functor between big singularity categories.</description>

      <title>A characterization of perfect Leibniz algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Leibniz algebras are non-antisymmetric generalizations of Lie algebras that have attracted substantial interest due to their close relation with the latter class. A Leibniz algebra $A$ is called perfect if it coincides with its derived subalgebra $A^2$. As a generalization of an analogous result for Lie algebras, we show that perfect Leibniz algebras, of arbitrary dimension and over any field, are characterized among Leibniz algebras by the property that they are ideals whenever they are embedded as subideals. Equivalently, we prove that perfect Leibniz algebras are precisely those Leibniz algebras such that whenever they are embedded as ideals, they are characteristic ideals, i.e., they are invariant under all derivations of the ambient algebra. We apply the above to prove certain inclusion relations for derivation algebras of perfect Leibniz algebras.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the cyclic codes of length $n$, where $n$ is odd with certain restrictions, over a finite chain ring $R$, have been studied using the structure of group algebra approach. The primitive idempotents of $RG$ of a finite cyclic group $G$ have been determined, and then the number of codewords and the minimum weight corresponding to a cyclic code have been computed.</description>

      <title>Rings on quotient divisible abelian groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper is devoted to the study of absolute ideals of groups in the class $\mathcal{QD}1$, which consists of all quotient divisible abelian groups of torsion-free rank 1. A ring is called an $AI$-ring (respectively, an $RF$-ring) if it has no ideals except absolute ideals (respectively, fully invariant subgroups) of its additive group. An abelian group is called an $RAI$-group (respectively, an $RFI$-group) if there exists at least one $AI$-ring (respectively, $FI$-ring) on it. If every absolute ideal of an abelian group is a fully invariant subgroup, then this group is called an $afi$-group.
  It is shown that every group in $\mathcal{QD}1$ is an $RAI$-group, an $RFI$-group, and an $afi$-group. Thus, Problem 93 of L. Fuchs' monograph \emph{``Infinite Abelian Groups, Vol. II, New York-London: Academic Press, 1973''} is resolved within the class $\mathcal{QD}1$. For any group in $\mathcal{QD}1$, all rings on it that are $AI$-rings are described. Furthermore, the set of all $AI$-rings on $G \in \mathcal{QD}1$ coincides with the set of all $FI$-rings on $G$. In addition, the principal absolute ideals of groups in $\mathcal{QD}1$ are described.</description>

      <title>Real $C$-, $G$-structures and sign-coherence of cluster algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We generalize the theory of integer $C$-, $G$-matrices in cluster algebras to the real case. By a skew-symmetrizing method, we can reduce the problem of skew-symmetrizable patterns to the one of skew-symmetric patterns. In this sense, we extend the sign-coherence of integer $C$-, $G$-matrices proved by Gross-Hacking-Keel-Kontsevich to a more general real class called of quasi-integer type. Furthermore, we give a complete classification of this type by a combinatorial method of real weighted quivers. However, the sign-coherence of real $C$-, $G$-matrices does not always hold in general. For this purpose, we classify all the rank $2$ case and the finite type case via the Coxeter diagrams. We also give two conjectures about the real exchange matrices and $C$-, $G$-matrices. Under these conjectures, the dual mutation, $G$-fan structure and synchronicity property hold. As an application, the isomorphism of several kinds of exchange graphs is studied.</description>

      <title>On a class of involutive Yang-Baxter groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A group is called an involutive Yang-Baxter group (IYB-group) if it is isomorphic to the permutation group of an involutive, non-degenerate set-theoretic solution of the Yang-Baxter equation. This paper investigates finite soluble groups whose Sylow subgroups have nilpotency class at most two, addressing Ced\'{o} and Okni\'{n}ski's question~\cite{CedoOkninski2025} of whether such groups are IYB-groups. We establish that a finite soluble group with Sylow subgroups of class at most two is an IYB-group if its nilpotent residual is $\Q_8$-free. We also prove that a finite soluble group with Sylow subgroups of class at most two and Sylow $2$-subgroups isomorphic to $Q_8$ is an IYB-group.</description>

      <title>On the arithmetic of power monoids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08615v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a monoid $H$ (written multiplicatively), the family $\mathcal{P}_{\mathrm{fin},1}(H)$ of all non-empty finite subsets of $H$ containing the identity element $1_H$ is itself a monoid, called the reduced finitary power monoid of $H$, under the operation of setwise multiplication induced by $H$. We investigate the arithmetic of $\mathcal P_{\mathrm{fin},1}(H)$ from the perspective of minimal factorizations into irreducibles, paying particular attention to the potential presence of non-trivial idempotents. Among other results, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions on $H$ for $\mathcal P_{\mathrm{fin},1}(H)$ to admit unique minimal factorizations. Our results generalize and shed new light on recent developments on the topic.</description>

      <title>Submonoids of Infinite Symmetric Inverse Monoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04200v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this thesis we study the subsemigroup structure of the symmetric inverse monoid $I_X$, the inverse semigroup of bijections between subsets of the set $X$, when $X$ is an infinite set. We explore three different approaches to this task. First, we classify the maximal subsemigroups of $I_X$ containing certain subgroups of the symmetric group on $X$. The subgroups in question are the symmetric group itself, the pointwise stabiliser of a finite non-empty subset of $X$, the stabiliser of an ultrafilter on $X$, and the stabiliser of a finite partition of $X$. Next, we study subsemigroups of $I_X$ which are closed in semigroup topologies on $I_X$ introduced by Elliot et al. in 2023. We discover that the closed subsemigroups in these topologies that contain all the idempotents of $I_X$ coincide exactly with semigroups of partial endomorphisms and partial automorphisms of relational structures defined on $X$. Furthermore, we show that if a relational structure $R$ on a countable set $X$ only contains a finite number of relations, then there exists a finite subset $U$ of $I_X$ such that the union of the partial automorphisms of $R$ together with $U$ generates all of $I_X$. Finally, we study the subsemigroup structure of $I_X$ under a preorder introduced by George Bergman and Saharon Shelah in 2006 for the symmetric group. Extending the preorder to $I_X$, if $S_1$ and $S_2$ are subsemigroups of $I_X$, we say that $S_1 \preccurlyeq S_2$ if there exists a finite subset $U$ of $I_X$ such that $S_1$ is contained in the semigroup generated by the union of $S_2$ and $U$. We classify certain types of subsemigroups of $I_X$ according the Bergman-Shelah preorder, and we formulate a conjecture analogous to the main result by Bergman and Shelah.</description>

      <title>Computing positroid cells in the Grassmannian of lines, their boundaries and their intersections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.14001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.14001v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Positroids are families of matroids introduced by Postnikov in the study of non-negative Grassmannians. In particular, positroids enumerate a CW decomposition of the totally non-negative Grassmannian. Furthermore, Postnikov has identified several families of combinatorial objects in bijections with positroids. We will provide yet another characterization of positroids for Gr$_{\geq 0}(2,n)$, the Grassmannians of lines, in terms of certain graphs. We use this characterization to compute the dimension and the boundary of positroid cells. This also leads to a combinatorial description of the intersection of positroid cells, that is easily computable. Our techniques rely on determining different ways to enlarge a given collection of subsets of $\{1,\ldots,n\}$ to represent the dependent sets of a positroid, that is the dependencies among the columns of a matrix with non-negative maximal minors. Furthermore, we provide an algorithm to compute all the maximal positroids contained in a set.</description>

      <title>A multiplication formula for cluster characters in gentle algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06410v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a multiplication formula for cluster characters induced by generating extensions in a gentle algebra A, generalizing a result of Cerulli Irelli, Esposito, Franzen, Reineke. In the case where A is the gentle algebra of a triangulation T of an unpunctured marked surface, this provides a representation-theoretic interpretation of the exchange relations in the cluster algebra with principal coefficients in T. As an application, we interpret a formula that relates cluster variables of type B to cluster variables of type A in the symmetric module category of the algebras arising from special triangulations of a regular polygon.</description>
