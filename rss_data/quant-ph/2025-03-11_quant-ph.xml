      <title>Mentor initiated Bi-directional Hybrid quantum Communication Protocol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a hybrid bidirectional controlled quantum communication protocol between two parties, initiated by a Mentor. Initially, the two main parties and the controller do not share a common quantum entanglement; instead, each party shares entanglement separately with the Mentor. The Mentor's actions create entanglement among the two parties and the controller. The protocol operates deterministically in the absence of environmental noise. Furthermore, we analyze the effects of various types of noises on the protocol, calculate the fidelity, and study how fidelity varies with different parameters. We also provide a theoretical description of the generation of the initial entangled channel used in the protocol. The quantum circuits for entanglement generation and also of the entire protocol are presented. To verify the protocol, these quantum circuits are executed on a real IBM quantum computer.</description>

      <title>Reassessing the boundary between classical and nonclassical for individual quantum processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is a received wisdom about where to draw the boundary between classical and nonclassical for various types of quantum processes. For instance, for multipartite states, it is the divide between separable and entangled, for channels, the divide between entanglement-breaking and not, for sets of measurements, the divide between compatible and incompatible, and for assemblages, the divide between steerable and unsteerable. However, no unified justification of these placements of the classical-nonclassical divide has been proposed. That is, although each might be motivated by some notion of what it means to be classically explainable, it is not the same notion for all of them. One well-motivated notion of classical explainability is the one based on generalized noncontextuality: a set of circuits is classically explainable if the statistics they generate can be realized by a generalized-noncontextual ontological model. In this work, we show that this notion can be leveraged to define a classical-nonclassical divide for individual quantum processes of arbitrary type. A set of measurements is judged to be classical if and only if a particular set of circuits -- the one obtained by contracting these measurements with every possible quantum state -- is classically explainable in the sense just articulated. We begin the task of characterizing where the classical-nonclassical divide lies according to this proposal for a variety of different types of processes. In particular, we show that all of the following are judged to be nonclassical: every entangled state, every set of incompatible measurements, every non-entanglement-breaking channel, every steerable assemblage. However, it also judges certain subsets of the complementary classes to be nonclassical, i.e., certain separable states, compatible sets of measurements, entanglement-breaking channels, and unsteerable assemblages.</description>

      <title>Quantum Schrodinger bridges: large deviations and time-symmetric ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum counterparts of Schrodinger's classical bridge problem have been around for the better part of half a century. During that time, several quantum approaches to this multifaceted classical problem have been introduced. In the present work, we unify, extend, and interpret several such approaches through a classical large deviations perspective. To this end, we consider time-symmetric ensembles that are pre- and post-selected before and after a Markovian experiment is performed. The Schrodinger bridge problem is that of finding the most likely joint distribution of initial and final outcomes that is consistent with obtained endpoint results. The derived distribution provides quantum Markovian dynamics that bridge the observed endpoint states in the form of density matrices. The solution retains its classical structure in that density matrices can be expressed as the product of forward-evolving and backward-evolving matrices. In addition, the quantum Schrodinger bridge allows inference of the most likely distribution of outcomes of an intervening measurement with unknown results. This distribution may be written as a product of forward- and backward-evolving expressions, in close analogy to the classical setting, and in a time-symmetric way. The derived results are illustrated through a two-level amplitude damping example.</description>

      <title>Bypassing orthogonalization in the quantum DPP sampler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given an $n\times r$ matrix $X$ of rank $r$, consider the problem of sampling $r$ integers $\mathtt{C}\subset \{1, \dots, n\}$ with probability proportional to the squared determinant of the rows of $X$ indexed by $\mathtt{C}$. The distribution of $\mathtt{C}$ is called a projection determinantal point process (DPP). The vanilla classical algorithm to sample a DPP works in two steps, an orthogonalization in $\mathcal{O}(nr^2)$ and a sampling step of the same cost. The bottleneck of recent quantum approaches to DPP sampling remains that preliminary orthogonalization step. For instance, (Kerenidis and Prakash, 2022) proposed an algorithm with the same $\mathcal{O}(nr^2)$ orthogonalization, followed by a $\mathcal{O}(nr)$ classical step to find the gates in a quantum circuit. The classical $\mathcal{O}(nr^2)$ orthogonalization thus still dominates the cost. Our first contribution is to reduce preprocessing to normalizing the columns of $X$, obtaining $\mathsf{X}$ in $\mathcal{O}(nr)$ classical operations. We show that a simple circuit inspired by the formalism of Kerenidis et al., 2022 samples a DPP of a type we had never encountered in applications, which is different from our target DPP. Plugging this circuit into a rejection sampling routine, we recover our target DPP after an expected $1/\det \mathsf{X}^\top\mathsf{X} = 1/a$ preparations of the quantum circuit. Using amplitude amplification, our second contribution is to boost the acceptance probability from $a$ to $1-a$ at the price of a circuit depth of $\mathcal{O}(r\log n/\sqrt{a})$ and $\mathcal{O}(\log n)$ extra qubits. Prepending a fast, sketching-based classical approximation of $a$, we obtain a pipeline to sample a projection DPP on a quantum computer, where the former $\mathcal{O}(nr^2)$ preprocessing bottleneck has been replaced by the $\mathcal{O}(nr)$ cost of normalizing the columns and the cost of our approximation of $a$.</description>

      <title>When Clifford benchmarks are sufficient; estimating application performance with scalable proxy circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of benchmarking is to determine how far the output of a noisy system is from its ideal behavior; this becomes exceedingly difficult for large quantum systems where classical simulations become intractable. A common approach is to turn to circuits comprised of elements of the Clifford group (e.g., CZ, CNOT, $\pi$ and $\pi/2$ gates), which probe quantum behavior but are nevertheless efficient to simulate classically. However, there is some concern that these circuits may overlook error sources that impact the larger Hilbert space. In this manuscript, we show that for a broad class of error models these concerns are unwarranted. In particular, we show that, for error models that admit noise tailoring by Pauli twirling, the diamond norm and fidelity of any generic circuit is well approximated by the fidelities of proxy circuits composed only of Clifford gates. We discuss methods for extracting the fidelities of these Clifford proxy circuits in a manner that is robust to errors in state preparation and measurement and demonstrate these methods in simulation and on IBM Quantum's fleet of deployed heron devices.</description>

      <title>Molecular representations of quantum circuits for quantum machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish an isomorphism between quantum circuits and a subspace of polyatomic molecules, which suggests that molecules can be used as descriptors of quantum circuits for quantum machine learning. Our numerical results show that the performance of quantum circuits for quantum support vector machines can be characterized by dimensionality-reduced molecular fingerprints as well as by the size of the largest and smallest Gershgorin circles derived from the Coulomb matrices of the corresponding molecules. This can be used to restrict the search space for the compositional optimization of quantum circuits. We show that a high accuracy of a quantum algorithm can be achieved with high probability by sampling from a specific set of molecules. This work implies that quantum ansatz optimization can benefit from advances in cheminformatics and suggests an approach to identify key elements that enhance the accuracy of a quantum algorithm by mapping quantum circuits onto molecules and exploring correlations between physical properties of molecules and circuit performance.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of sample-based quantum diagonalization with phaseless auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Selected Configuration Interaction (QSCI) and an extended protocol known as Sample-based Quantum Diagonalization (SQD) have emerged as promising algorithms to solve the electronic Schr\"odinger equation with noisy quantum computers. In QSCI/SQD a quantum circuit is repeatedly prepared on the quantum device, and measured configurations form a subspace of the many-body Hilbert space in which the Hamiltonian is diagonalized classically. For the dissociation of N$_2$ and a model $\mathrm{[2Fe-2S]}$ cluster (correlating 10 electrons in 26 orbitals and 30 electrons in 20 orbitals, respectively) we show that a non-perturbative stochastic approach, phaseless auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (ph-AFQMC), using truncated SQD trial wavefunctions obtained from quantum hardware can recover a substantial amount (e.g., O(100) mHa) of correlation energy and alleviate the possible sampling redundancy of the QSCI/SQD procedure. Extrapolation of the ph-AFQMC energy versus the energy variance of the SQD trial wavefunctions has the potential to further improve the energy accuracy.</description>

      <title>Quantum Electrodynamics from Quantum Cellular Automata, and the Tension Between Symmetry, Locality and Positive Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that free QED is equivalent to the continuous-space-and-time limit of Fermi and Bose lattice quantum cellular automata theories derived from quantum random walks satisfying simple symmetry and unitarity conditions. In doing so we define the Fermi and Bose theories in a unified manner using the usual fermion internal space but a boson internal space that is six-dimensional. We show that the reduction to a two-dimensional boson internal space (two helicity states arising from spin-1 plus the photon transversality condition) comes from restricting the quantum cellular automaton theory to positive energies. We briefly examine common symmetries of quantum cellular automata, and how time-reversal symmetry demands the existence of negative-energy solutions. These solutions produce a tension in coupling the Fermi and Bose theories, in which the strong locality of quantum cellular automata seems to require a nonzero amplitude to produce negative-energy states, leading to an unphysical cascade of negative-energy particles. However, we show in a 1D model that by extending interactions over a larger (but finite) range it is possible to exponentially suppress the production of negative-energy particles to the point where they can be neglected.</description>

      <title>Blockwise Post-processing in Satellite-based Quantum Key Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Free-space satellite communication has significantly lower photon loss than terrestrial communication via optical fibers. Satellite-based quantum key distribution (QKD) leverages this advantage and provides a promising direction in achieving long-distance QKD. While the technological feasibility of satellite-based QKD has been demonstrated experimentally, optimizing the key rate remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we argue that improving classical post-processing is an important direction in increasing key rate in satellite-based QKD, while it can also be easily incorporated in existing satellite systems. In particular, we explore one direction, blockwise post-processing, to address highly dynamic satellite channel conditions due to various environmental factors. This blockwise strategy divides the raw key bits into individual blocks that have similar noise characteristics, and processes them independently, in contrast to traditional non-blockwise strategy that treats all the raw key bits as a whole. Using a case study, we discuss the choice of blocks in blockwise strategy, and show that blockwise strategy can significantly outperform non-blockwise strategy. Our study demonstrates the importance of post-processing in satellite QKD systems, and presents several open problems in this direction.</description>

      <title>The Art of Optimizing T-Depth for Quantum Error Correction in Large-Scale Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Error Correction (QEC), combined with magic state distillation, ensures fault tolerance in large-scale quantum computation. To apply QEC, a circuit must first be transformed into a non-Clifford (or T) gate set. T-depth, the number of sequential T-gate layers, determines the magic state cost, impacting both spatial and temporal overhead. Minimizing T-depth is crucial for optimizing resource efficiency in fault-tolerant quantum computing. While QEC scalability has been widely studied, T-depth reduction remains an overlooked challenge. We establish that T-depth reduction is an NP-hard problem and systematically evaluate multiple approximation techniques: greedy, divide-and-conquer, Lookahead-based brute force, and graph-based. The Lookahead-based brute-force algorithm (partition size 4) performs best, optimizing 90\% of reducible cases (i.e., circuits where at least one algorithm achieved optimization) with an average T-depth reduction of around 51\%. Additionally, we introduce an expansion factor-based identity gate insertion strategy, leveraging controlled redundancy to achieve deeper reductions in circuits initially classified as non-reducible. With this approach, we successfully convert up to 25\% of non-reducible circuits into reducible ones, while achieving an additional average reduction of up to 6.2\%. Furthermore, we analyze the impact of different expansion factor values and explore how varying the partition size in the Lookahead-based brute-force algorithm influences the quality of T-depth reduction.</description>

      <title>Quantum circuit for implementing AES S-box with low costs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is one of the most widely used and extensively studied encryption algorithms globally, which is renowned for its efficiency and robust resistance to attacks. In this paper, three quantum circuits are designed to implement the S-box, which is the sole nonlinear component in AES. By incorporating a linear key schedule, we achieve a quantum circuit for implementing AES with the minimum number of qubits used. As a consequence, only 264/328/398 qubits are needed to implement the quantum circuits for AES-128/192/256. Furthermore, through quantum circuits of the S-box and key schedule, the overall size of the quantum circuit required for Grover's algorithm to attack AES is significantly decreased. This enhancement improves both the security and resource efficiency of AES in a quantum computing environment.</description>

      <title>The study of double kicked top: a classical and quantum perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the double kicked top (DKT), which is an extension of the standard quantum kicked top (QKT) model. The model allows us to study the transition from time-reversal symmetric to broken time-reversal symmetric dynamics. Our transformation in the kick strength parameter space $(k, k') \to (k_r, k_\theta)$ reveals interesting features. The transformed kicked strength parameter $k_r$ drives a higher growth of chaos and is equivalent to the standard QKT, whereas the other transformed kicked strength parameter $k_\theta$ leads to a weaker growth. We discuss the fixed points, their stability, and verify results obtained by computing the largest Lyapunov exponent (LLE) and the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy (KSE). We exactly solve 2- to 4-qubit versions of DKT by obtaining its eigenvalues, eigenvectors and the entanglement dynamics. Furthermore, we find the criteria for periodicity of the entanglement dynamics. We investigate measures of quantum correlations from two perspectives: the deep quantum and the semi-classical regime. Signatures of phase-space structure are numerically shown in the long-time averages of the quantum correlations. Our model can be realised experimentally as an extension of the standard QKT.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a unified form of the partition function in phase space. In quantum statistical mechanics, the notation of phase space is introduced via Bohmian trajectories. The partition function encapsulates the ensemble of positions and momenta, and also the probability distribution that reflects the accuracy in measuring particles' locations. The quantum-to-classical transition emerges and agrees naturally in dynamics and statistical mechanics.</description>

      <title>QAOA in Quantum Datacenters: Parallelization, Simulation, and Orchestration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scaling quantum computing requires networked systems, leveraging HPC for distributed simulation now and quantum networks in the future. Quantum datacenters will be the primary access point for users, but current approaches demand extensive manual decisions and hardware expertise. Tasks like algorithm partitioning, job batching, and resource allocation divert focus from quantum program development. We present a massively parallelized, automated QAOA workflow that integrates problem decomposition, batch job generation, and high-performance simulation. Our framework automates simulator selection, optimizes execution across distributed, heterogeneous resources, and provides a cloud-based infrastructure, enhancing usability and accelerating quantum program development. We find that QAOA partitioning does not significantly degrade optimization performance and often outperforms classical solvers. We introduce our software components -- Divi, Maestro, and our cloud platform -- demonstrating ease of use and superior performance over existing methods.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we present a modified version of the proof given Jing-Yang-Zhao's paper "Local Unitary Equivalence of Quantum States and Simultaneous Orthogonal Equivalence," which established the correspondence between local unitary (LU) equivalence and simultaneous orthogonal equivalence of bipartite quantum states. Our modified proof utilizes a hypermatrix algebra framework, and with this framework we are able to generalize this correspondence to tripartite quantum states. Finally, we apply a generalization of Specht's criterion proved in Futorny-Horn-Sergeichuk' paper "Specht's Criterion for Systems of Linear Mappings" to \textit{essentially} reduce the problem of local unitary equivalence of tripartite quantum states to checking trace identities and a few other LU invariants. We also note that all of these results can be extended to arbitrary multipartite quantum states, however there are some practical limitations.</description>

      <title>HIVQE: Handover Iterative Variational Quantum Eigensolver for Efficient Quantum Chemistry Calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel hybrid quantum-classical approach has been developed to efficiently address the multireference quantum chemistry problem. The Handover Iterative Variational Quantum Eigensolver (HiVQE) is designed to accurately estimate ground-state wavefunctions by leveraging both quantum and classical computing resources. In this framework, noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardwares efficiently explore electron configurations, while classical computers compute the corresponding wavefunction without the effect of noise of NISQ computer, ensuring both accuracy and computational efficiency. By generating compact yet chemically accurate wavefunctions, HiVQE advances quantum chemistry simulations and facilitates the discovery of novel materials. This approach demonstrates significant potential for overcoming the limitations of classical methods in strongly correlated electronic systems.</description>

      <title>Imperfect detectors for adversarial tasks with applications to quantum key distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Security analyses in quantum key distribution (QKD) and other adversarial quantum tasks often assume perfect device models. However, real-world implementations often deviate from these models. Thus, it is important to develop security proofs that account for such deviations from ideality. In this work, we develop a general framework for analysing imperfect threshold detectors, treating uncharacterised device parameters such as dark counts and detection efficiencies as adversarially controlled within some ranges. This approach enables a rigorous worst-case analysis, ensuring security proofs remain valid under realistic conditions. Our results strengthen the connection between theoretical security and practical implementations by introducing a flexible framework for integrating detector imperfections into adversarial quantum protocols.</description>

      <title>A quantum annealing approach to graph node embedding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Node embedding is a key technique for representing graph nodes as vectors while preserving structural and relational properties, which enables machine learning tasks like feature extraction, clustering, and classification. While classical methods such as DeepWalk, node2vec, and graph convolutional networks learn node embeddings by capturing structural and relational patterns in graphs, they often require significant computational resources and struggle with scalability on large graphs. Quantum computing provides a promising alternative for graph-based learning by leveraging quantum effects and introducing novel optimization approaches. Variational quantum circuits and quantum kernel methods have been explored for embedding tasks, but their scalability remains limited due to the constraints of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware. In this paper, we investigate quantum annealing (QA) as an alternative approach that mitigates key challenges associated with quantum gate-based models. We propose several formulations of the node embedding problem as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) instance, making it compatible with current quantum annealers such as those developed by D-Wave. We implement our algorithms on a D-Wave quantum annealer and evaluate their performance on graphs with up to 100 nodes and embedding dimensions of up to 5. Our findings indicate that QA is a viable approach for graph-based learning, providing a scalable and efficient alternative to previous quantum embedding techniques.</description>

      <title>Digital Zero-Noise Extrapolation with Quantum Circuit Unoptimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum circuit unoptimization is an algorithm that transforms a quantum circuit into a different circuit that uses more gate operations while maintaining the same unitary transformation. We demonstrate that this method can implement digital zero-noise extrapolation (ZNE), a quantum error mitigation technique. By employing quantum circuit unoptimization as a form of circuit folding, noise can be systematically amplified. The key advantages of this approach are twofold. First, its ability to generate an exponentially increasing number of distinct circuit variants as the noise level is amplified, which allows noise averaging over many circuit instances with slightly different circuit structure which mitigates the effect of biased error propagation because of the significantly altered circuit structure from quantum circuit unoptimization, or highly biased local noise on a quantum processor. Second, quantum circuit unoptimization by design resists circuit simplification back to the original unmodified circuit, making it plausible to use ZNE in contexts where circuit compiler optimization is applied server-side. We evaluate the effectiveness of quantum circuit unoptimization as a noise-scaling method for ZNE in two test cases using depolarizing noise numerical simulations: random quantum volume circuits, where the observable is the heavy output probability, and QAOA circuits for the (unweighted) maximum cut problem on random 3-regular graphs, where the observable is the cut value. We show that using quantum circuit unoptimization to perform ZNE can approximately recover signal from noisy quantum simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Imaging thermal sources naturally yields Gaussian states at the receiver, raising the question of whether Gaussian measurements can perform optimally in quantum imaging. In this work, we establish no-go theorems on the performance of Gaussian measurements when imaging thermal sources with mean photon number per temporal mode $\epsilon \rightarrow 0$ or when solving two sources with the separation $L \rightarrow 0$. Our results show that non-Gaussian measurements can outperform any Gaussian measurement by a factor of $\epsilon$ (or $L^2$) in terms of the estimation variance, for both interferometric and single-lens imaging. We also present several examples to illustrate the no-go results.</description>

      <title>Observing the exponential growth of the eigenmodes in the absence of coalescence for a non-Hermitian circuit with an unavoidable inductor dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06367v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate, both experimentally and theoretically, the eigenmodes of an electronic circuit in which gain and loss $RLC$ resonators are coupled through a capacitor. Due to the unavoidable magnetic loss in the inductors, we find that the eigenmode coalescence no longer emerges in contrast to the conventional non-Hermitian systems with the spontaneous $\cal{PT}$-symmetry breaking. In particular, we find a transition from the exponential decay to exponential growth in the amplitude of the periodic voltage oscillations of the resonators. The transition occurs near the exceptional points of the non-Hermitian circuit without considering the dissipations in inductors. We introduce a small resistor of three orders of magnitude smaller than that of the $RLC$ resonators to mimic the energy dissipation in inductors and numerically solve the equivalent non-Hermitian Schr{\" o}dinger equation. The numerical results can well reproduce experimental observations. Our above findings unambiguously indicate that the exponential growth behavior beyond the exceptional points is robust against some unavoidable dissipative perturbations.</description>

      <title>Star exponentials and Wigner functions for time-dependent harmonic oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the Wigner distribution and the star exponential function for a time-dependent harmonic oscillator for which the mass and the frequency terms are considered explicitly depending on time. To such an end, we explore the connection between the star exponential, naturally emerging within the context of deformation quantization, and the propagators constructed through the path integral formalism. In particular, the Fourier-Dirichlet expansion of the star exponential implies a distinctive quantization of the Lewis-Riesenfeld invariant. Further, by introducing a judicious time variable, we recovered a time-dependent phase function associated with the Lewis-Riesenfeld construction of the standard Schr\"odinger picture. In particular, we applied our results to the cases of the Caldirola-Kanai and the time-dependent frequency harmonic oscillators, recovering relevant results previously reported in the literature.</description>

      <title>Conserved Quantities in Linear and Nonlinear Quantum Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this tutorial, which contains some original results, we bridge the fields of quantum computing algorithms, conservation laws, and many-body quantum systems by examining three algorithms for searching an unordered database of size $N$ using a continuous-time quantum walk, which is the quantum analogue of a continuous-time random walk. The first algorithm uses a linear quantum walk, and we apply elementary calculus to show that the success probability of the algorithm reaches 1 when the jumping rate of the walk takes some critical value. We show that the expected value of its Hamiltonian $H_0$ is conserved. The second algorithm uses a nonlinear quantum walk with effective Hamiltonian $H(t) = H_0 + \lambda|\psi|^2$, which arises in the Gross-Pitaevskii equation describing Bose-Einstein condensates. When the interactions between the bosons are repulsive, $\lambda &gt; 0$, and there exists a range of fixed jumping rates such that the success probability reaches 1 with the same asymptotic runtime of the linear algorithm, but with a larger multiplicative constant. Rather than the effective Hamiltonian, we show that the expected value of $H_0 + \frac{1}{2} \lambda|\psi|^2$ is conserved. The third algorithm utilizes attractive interactions, corresponding to $\lambda &lt; 0$. In this case there is a time-varying critical function for the jumping rate $\gamma_c(t)$ that causes the success probability to reach 1 more quickly than in the other two algorithms, and we show that the expected value of $H(t)/[\gamma_c(t) N]$ is conserved.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) are specialized neural networks for feature extraction from graph-structured data. In contrast to traditional convolutional networks, GCNs offer distinct advantages when processing irregular data, which is ubiquitous in real-world applications. This paper introduces an enhancement to GCNs based on spectral methods by integrating quantum computing techniques. Specifically, a quantum approach is employed to construct the Laplacian matrix, and phase estimation is used to extract the corresponding eigenvectors efficiently. Additionally, quantum parallelism is leveraged to accelerate the convolution operations, thereby improving the efficiency of feature extraction. The findings of this study demonstrate the feasibility of employing quantum computing principles and algorithms to optimize classical GCNs. Theoretical analysis further reveals that, compared to classical methods, the proposed quantum algorithm achieves exponential speedup concerning the number of nodes in the graph.</description>

      <title>Entangled mixed-state datasets generation by quantum machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advancement of classical machine learning is inherently linked to the establishment and progression of classical dataset. In quantum machine learning (QML), there is an analogous imperative for the development of quantum entangled datasets comprised with huge quantity and high quality. Especially for multipartite mixed-state datasets, due to the lack of suitable entanglement criteria, previous researchers often could only perform classification tasks on datasets extended based on Werner states or other well-structured states. This paper is dedicated to provide a method for generating mixed-state datasets for entangled-separable classification tasks. This method is based on supervised quantum machine learning and the concentratable entanglement measures. It furthers the assembly of quantum entangled datasets, inspires the discovery of new entanglement criteria with both classical and quantum machine learning, and provides a valuable resource for benchmarking QML models, thereby opening new avenues for exploring the rich structure of quantum entanglement in mixed states. Additionally, we benchmark several machine learning models using this dataset, offering guidance and suggestions for the selection of QML models.</description>

      <title>Maximal coin-position entanglement and non-Hermitian skin effect in discrete-time quantum walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A distinctive feature of non-Hermitian systems is the skin effect, which has attracted widespread attention in recent studies. Quantum walks provide a powerful platform for exploring the underlying mechanisms of the non-Hermitian skin effect. Additionally, the generation of hybrid entanglement in quantum walks is recognized as another crucial property. However, the experimentally exploring the influence of skin effect on the evolution of entanglement dynamical in the non-Hermitian system remains a challenge. In this paper, we present a flexible photonic implementation of discrete-time quantum walks over 20 evolution steps using an optimized time-multiplexed loop configuration. Through optimizing the coin parameter, we achieve maximal coin-position entanglement in 20-steps quantum walks. Moreover, we experimentally measure the polarization-averaged growth rates and the evolution of coin-position entanglement for specific coin and loss parameters. We observe the asymmetric Lyapunov exponent profiles and the suppression of entanglement induced by the skin effect in non-Hermitian systems. Interestingly, this entanglement suppression weakens with increasing coin parameters and enhances with increasing loss parameters and evolution steps. Our results demonstrate the potential of quantum walks as a powerful platform for investigating hybrid entanglement properties and skin effect in non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <title>Distributed quantum algorithm for the dihedral hidden subgroup problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To address the issue of excessive quantum resource requirements in Kuperberg's algorithm for the dihedral hidden subgroup problem, this paper proposes a distributed algorithm based on the function decomposition. By splitting the original function into multiple subfunctions and distributing them to multiple quantum nodes for parallel processing, the algorithm significantly reduces the quantum circuit depth and qubit requirements for individual nodes. Theoretical analysis shows that when $n\gg t$ ($t$ is the number of quantum nodes), the time complexity of the distributed version is optimized from $2^{O(\sqrt{n})}$ (the traditional algorithm's complexity) to $2^{o(\sqrt{n-t})}$. Furthermore, we carried out the simulation on the Qiskit platform, and the accuracy of the algorithm is verified. Compared to the original algorithm, the distributed version not only reduces the influence of circuit depth and noise, but also improves the probability of measurement success.</description>

      <title>Multifunctional Nonreciprocal Quantum Device Based on Superconducting Quantum Circuit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonreciprocal devices, such as isolator or circulator, are crucial for information routing and processing in quantum networks. Traditional nonreciprocal devices, which rely on the application of bias magnetic fields to break time-reversal symmetry and Lorentz reciprocity, tend to be bulky and require strong static magnetic fields. This makes them challenging to implement in highly integrated large-scale quantum networks. Therefore, we design a multifunctional nonreciprocal quantum device based on the integration and tunable interaction of superconducting quantum circuit. This device can switch between two-port isolator, three-port symmetric circulator, and antisymmetric circulator under the control of external magnetic flux. Furthermore, both isolator and circulator can achieve nearly perfect unidirectional signal transmission. We believe that this scalable and integrable nonreciprocal device could provide new insight for the development of large-scale quantum networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advancement in quantum technology has brought the implementation of Grover's Search attack on cybersecurity algorithms much closer to reality. For such tasks, the Hilbert space has to be designed to make the relation between the input and output of these cryptographic algorithms in quantum circuits. Also, these algorithms are tested on current quantum simulators such as Qiskit, where memory constraints and limited processing power are hurdles. Here, we present an easy-to-implement method using a conventional arithmetic number field approach which can be applied to quantum circuits by CNOT and Toffoli gates, while focusing on resource constraints. Also, we give a Python code that can generate a Qiskit code for the quantum implementation of similar cryptographic S-boxes using the CNOT and 3-Tofflie gates by using simple logic presented in this paper.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is shown that quantum computer can detect the existence of root of a function almost exponentially more efficient than the classical counterpart. It is also shown that a quantum computer can produce quantum state corresponding to the solution of nonlinear algebraic equations quadratically faster than the best known classical approach. Various applications and implications are discussed, including a quantum algorithm for solving dense linear systems with quadratic speedup, determining equilibrium states, simulating the dynamics of nonlinear coupled oscillators, estimating Lyapunov exponent, an improved quantum partial differential equation solver, and a quantum-enhanced collision detector for robotic motion planning. This provides further evidence of quantum advantage without requiring coherent quantum access to classical data, delivering meaningful real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Lindblad many-body scars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06665v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum many-body scars have received much recent attention for being both intriguing non-ergodic states in otherwise quantum chaotic systems and promising candidates to encode quantum information efficiently. So far, these studies have mostly been restricted to Hermitian systems. Here, we study many-body scars in many-body quantum chaotic systems coupled to a Markovian bath, which we term Lindblad many-body scars. They are defined as simultaneous eigenvectors of the Hamiltonian and dissipative parts of the vectorized Liouvillian. Importantly, because their eigenvalues are purely real, they are not related to revivals. The number and nature of the scars depend on both the symmetry of the Hamiltonian and the choice of jump operators. For a dissipative four-body Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model with $N$ fermions, either Majorana or complex, we construct analytically some of these Lindblad scars while others could only be obtained numerically. As an example of the former, we identify $N/2+1$ scars for complex fermions due to the $U(1)$ symmetry of the model and two scars for Majorana fermions as a consequence of the parity symmetry. Similar results are obtained for a dissipative XXZ spin chain. We also characterize the physical properties of Lindblad scars. First, the operator size is independent of the disorder realization and has a vanishing variance. By contrast, the operator size for non-scarred states, believed to be quantum chaotic, is well described by a distribution centered around a specific size and a finite variance, which could be relevant for a precise definition of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis in dissipative quantum chaos. Moreover, the entanglement entropy of these scars has distinct features such as a strong dependence on the partition choice and, in certain cases, a large entanglement.</description>

      <title>Quantum proper time: A Finsler space from entropy and purity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A quantum clock cannot be modeled as a point mass moving along a single geodesic if it is in a state with nonzero position fluctuations. Instead, it is an extended object subject to tidal forces and a superposition of time dilations at different altitudes. Here, a geometrical formulation of quantum mechanics is used to show that additional quantum properties representing correlations between different directions imply a non-Riemannian geometrical structure experienced by a quantum clock. A specific version of Finsler geometry parameterized by entropy and purity of the state provides a novel setting for a combination of quantum and gravitational effects. A crucial ingredient is given by a new parameterization of quantum-information properties related to second-order moments of a state and may also be useful in other applications.</description>

      <title>An Accurate Efficient Analytic Model of Fidelity under Depolarizing Noise oriented to Large Scale Quantum System Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fidelity is one of the most valuable and commonly used metrics for assessing the performance of quantum circuits on error-prone quantum processors. Several approaches have been proposed to estimate circuit fidelity without the need of executing it on quantum hardware, but they often face limitations in scalability or accuracy. In this work, we present a comprehensive theoretical framework to predict the fidelity of quantum circuits under depolarizing noise. Building on theoretical results, we propose an efficient fidelity estimation algorithm based on device calibration data. The method is thoroughly validated through simulation and execution on real hardware, demonstrating improved accuracy compared to state-of-the-art alternatives. The proposed approach provides a scalable and practical tool for benchmarking quantum hardware, comparing quantum software techniques such as compilation methods, obtaining computation bounds for quantum systems, and guiding hardware design decisions, making it a critical resource for the development and evaluation of quantum computing technologies.</description>

      <title>Noise-Robust Estimation of Quantum Observables in Noisy Hardware</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Error mitigation is essential for counteracting noise in quantum computations until fault-tolerant quantum technologies become viable. Here, we introduce Noise-Robust Estimation (NRE), a noise-agnostic framework that systematically reduces estimation bias through a two-step post-processing approach. At its core, NRE exploits a bias-dispersion correlation uncovered in this work, wherein a measurable metric -- normalized dispersion -- quantifies and helps suppress unknown residual bias in expectation value estimations. To reveal this correlation, we leverage bootstrapping on the existing measurement counts. We experimentally validate NRE on an IQM superconducting quantum processor, executing quantum circuits with up to 20 qubits and 240 entangling CZ gates. Our results demonstrate that NRE consistently achieves near bias-free estimations across different implementation settings while maintaining a manageable sampling overhead. These findings establish NRE as a reliable and broadly applicable error mitigation method for quantum computation with noisy hardware.</description>

      <title>Frequency estimation by frequency jumps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The frequency of a quantum harmonic oscillator cannot be determined through static measurement strategies on a prepared state, as the eigenstates of the system are independent of its frequency. Therefore, dynamic procedures must be employed, involving measurements taken after the system has evolved and encoded the frequency information. This paper explores the precision achievable in a protocol where a known detuning suddenly shifts the oscillator's frequency, which then reverts to its original value after a specific time interval. Our results demonstrate that the squeezing induced by this frequency jump can effectively enhance the encoding of frequency information, significantly improving the quantum signal-to-noise ratio (QSNR) compared to standard free evolution at the same resource (energy and time) cost. The QSNR exhibits minimal dependence on the actual frequency and increases with both the magnitude of the detuning and the overall duration of the protocol. Furthermore, incorporating multiple frequency jumps into the protocol could further enhance precision, particularly for lower frequency values.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel method that combines spin resonance spectroscopy with transmission electron microscopy (TEM), enabling localized in-situ detection of microwave (MW)-driven spin excitations. Our approach utilizes continuous wave MW excitation at GHz frequencies, while employing the free-space electron beam as a signal receiver to sense spin precession. Spin state polarization is achieved via the magnetic field of the TEM's polepiece, while a custom-designed microresonator integrated into a TEM sample holder drives spin transitions and modulates the electron beam. This modulation enables phase-locked detection with picosecond temporal resolution, allowing the isolation of spin precession contributions to the electron beam deflection with a sensitivity of $\sim 280$ prad. The presented technique lays foundations for the MW spectroscopic in-situ exploration of spin dynamics at the nanoscale.</description>

      <title>Optimizing two-qubit gates for ultracold atoms using Fermi-Hubbard models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultracold atoms trapped in optical lattices have emerged as a scalable and promising platform for quantum simulation and computation. However, gate speeds remain a significant limitation for practical applications. In this work, we employ quantum optimal control to design fast, collision-based two-qubit gates within a superlattice based on a Fermi-Hubbard description, reaching errors in the range of $10^{-3}$ for realistic parameters. Numerically optimizing the lattice depths and the scattering length, we effectively manipulate hopping and interaction strengths intrinsic to the Fermi-Hubbard model. Our results provide five times shorter gate durations by allowing for higher energy bands in the optimization, suggesting that standard modeling with a two-band Fermi-Hubbard model is insufficient for describing the dynamics of fast gates and we find that four to six bands are required. Additionally, we achieve non-adiabatic gates by employing time-dependent lattice depths rather than using only fixed depths. The optimized control pulses not only maintain high efficacy in the presence of laser intensity and phase noise but also result in negligible inter-well couplings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement is a key resource in quantum technologies, enhancing precision and resolution in imaging and sensing by leveraging the cross-correlation of photon pairs. This correlation enables precise time synchronization of photons reaching the photodetectors, effectively suppressing environmental noise and improving measurement accuracy. Building on this concept, we theoretically introduce and experimentally explore phase-dependent Quantum Optical Coherence Tomography. This technique employs phase-shifted entangled photon pairs for non-invasive morphological analysis of multilayered samples. We demonstrate that applying a phase shift to entangled photon pairs in the Hong-Ou-Mandel interferometer effectively eliminates artifacts (false patterns) caused by cross-reflections between different sample layers. This significantly improves the accuracy and reliability of the interferometric signal. The impact of this work extends to both the fundamental and practical domains. We show that phase-shifting entangled photon pairs in a Hong-Ou-Mandel interferometer can lead to tangible advancements in quantum sensing and probing. Practically, our method addresses a key challenge in Quantum Optical Coherence Tomography by eliminating artifacts, offering promising applications in biomedical imaging and material science.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface acoustic wave (SAW) devices are key components of classical communication systems and recently studied for quantum information processing. We here propose and study a hybrid quantum system composed of skyrmion qubit and a SAW cavity, which supports a number of long-lived phononic modes. The results show that the system allows for strong coupling between skyrmion qubit and single phonon of different modes. By manipulating the qubit(s) through a static magnetic field and a time-dependent modulation magnetic field, we further study the interaction between skyrmion qubit and individual phononic modes, phonon-phonon interaction, and qubit-qubit interaction, which operates in strong-coupling regime. The controllability of nanoscale skyrmion qubit and the dense phononic modes of single SAW cavity would make our system have promising applications in large-scale quantum communication and computing.</description>

      <title>Scalable entanglement of nuclear spins mediated by electron exchange</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of nuclear spins for quantum computation is limited by the difficulty in creating genuine quantum entanglement between distant nuclei. Current demonstrations of nuclear entanglement in semiconductors rely upon coupling the nuclei to a common electron, which is not a scalable strategy. Here we demonstrate a two-qubit Control-Z logic operation between the nuclei of two phosphorus atoms in a silicon device, separated by up to 20 nanometers. Each atoms binds separate electrons, whose exchange interaction mediates the nuclear two-qubit gate. We prove that the nuclei are entangled by preparing and measuring Bell states with a fidelity of 76 +/- 5 $\%$ and a concurrence of 0.67 +/- 0.05. With this method, future progress in scaling up semiconductor spin qubits can be extended to the development of nuclear-spin based quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Fabrication and Characterization of Impedance-transformed Josephson Parametric Amplifier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a method of using a double-layer resist lift-off process to prepare the capacitor dielectric layer for fabricating impedance-engineered Josephson parametric amplifiers (IMPAs). Compared with traditional techniques, this method enhances fabrication success rate, accelerates production. The IMPA we made experimentally achieves an instantaneous bandwidth over 950 (600) MHz with a gain exceeding 10 (14) dB, along with saturation input power of -115 dBm and near quantum-limited noise. We demonstrate the negligible backaction from the IMPA on superconducting qubits, resulting in no significant degradation of the relaxation time and coherence time of the qubits. The IMPA improves the signal-to-noise ratio from 1.69 to 14.56 and enables the amplification chain to achieve a high quantum efficiency with $\eta \approx 0.26$, making it a critical necessity for large-scale quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Quantization of nonlinear non-Hamiltonian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several important dynamical systems are in $\mathbb{R}^2$, defined by $(x',y')=(f(x,y),g(x,y))$. A question of fundamental importance is how such systems might behave quantum mechanically. In developing quantum theory, Dirac and others realized that classical Hamiltonian systems can be mapped to their quantum counterparts via canonical quantization. The resulting quantum dynamics is always physical, characterized by completely-positive and trace-preserving evolutions in the Schr\"odinger picture. However, whether non-Hamiltonian systems can be quantized systematically while respecting the same physical requirements has remained a long-standing problem. Here we resolve this question when $f(x,y)$ and $g(x,y)$ are arbitrary polynomials. By leveraging open-systems theory, we prove constructively that every polynomial system admits a physical generator of time evolution in the form of a Lindbladian. We refer to our method as cascade quantization, and demonstrate its power by analyzing several paradigmatic examples of nonlinear dynamics such as bifurcations, noise-activated spiking, and Li\'{e}nard systems. In effect, any classical system whose $f(x,y)$ and $g(x,y)$ are analytic functions can be quantized with arbitrary precision. Crucially, our method is exact. Being free from any approximations, cascade quantization dispenses with simplifying assumptions such as the weakly-nonlinear limit, or semiclassical dynamics in the quantized system -- both of which have been critical in facilitating quantization in the literature. We also highlight the advantages of cascade quantization over the existing proposals, by weighing it against examples from the variational paradigm using Lagrangians, as well as non-variational approaches.</description>

      <title>Exploring Dynamics of Open Quantum Systems in Naturally Inaccessible Regimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Markovian open quantum systems are governed by the Lindblad master equation where the dissipation contains two parts, i.e., the anti-Hermitian operator and the quantum jumps, which share a common dissipation rate. We generalize the Lindblad master equation via postselection to a generalized Liouvillian formalism in which the effective damping rate of the anti-Hermitian operator can be different from the quantum jump rate. Our formalism provides a parameter space with regimes inaccessible in naturally-occurring systems. We explore these new regimes and find several interesting results including negative damping rates and generalized Liouvillian exceptional points. In a previously unexplored zero-damping Liouvillian regime where the damping rate is negligible, we investigate the effect only due to the quantum jumps and show an unusual polynomial decay of the excited state. This generalized Liouvillian formalism offers opportunities to explore novel phenomena and quantum technologies associated with the peculiar behavior of quantum jumps.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the most remarkable features that distinguish open systems from closed ones is the presence of exceptional points (EPs), where two or more eigenvectors of a non-Hermitian operator coalesce, accompanying the convergence of the correcponding eigenvalues. So far, EPs have been demonstrated on a number of platforms, ranging from classical optical systems to fully quantum-mechanical spin-boson models. In these demonstrations, the reservoir that induced the non-Hermiticity was treated as a Markovian one, without considering its memory effect. We here present the first experimental demonstration of non-Markovian quantum EPs, engineered by coupling a Josephson-junction-based qubit to a leaky electromagnetic resonator, which acts as a non-Markovian reservoir. We map out the spectrum of the extended Liouvillian superoperator by observing the quantum state evolution of the qubit and the pseudomode, in which the memory of the reservoir is encoded. We identify a two-fold second-order EP and a third-order EP in the Liouvillian spectrum, which cannot be realized with a Markovian reservoir. Our results pave the way for experimental exploration of exotic phenomena associated with non-Markovian quantum EPs.</description>

Abstract: We present Schmidt decomposition formulas for mutually orthogonal two-qubit pure states and classify orthonormal sets based on their entanglement structure. First, we derive explicit Schmidt decomposition formulas for any pure state and extend them to two orthogonal pure states. For three mutually orthogonal states, we provide formulas for specific cases and discuss the challenges of obtaining analytic expressions for the rest. Additionally, we derive explicit formulas for certain orthonormal bases and analyze those containing one or two maximally entangled states. Finally, we prove that no orthonormal basis can consist of three product states and one entangled state.</description>

      <title>High-accuracy disposable micro-optical anti-counterfeiting labels based on single-molecule quantum coherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we introduce an innovative approach to single-molecule quantum coherence (SMQC)-based disposable micro-optical anti-counterfeiting labels. This method facilitates the editing and reading of anti-counterfeiting with single molecules used as the anti-counterfeiting information labels. The label is meticulously crafted through inkjet printing technology, while its authentication is achieved via frequency domain imaging. Through a validation process including experimental demonstration, numerical simulation, and neural network analysis, we demonstrate the feasibility of this approach, further validate the integrity of the miniature anti-counterfeiting information storage, and verify the signal extraction accuracy with the recognition accuracy of the labels is consistently above 99.995%. The combination of SMQC-based disposable micro-optical anti-counterfeiting technology is expected to enable more precise preparation of single-molecule-array chips, thus providing a crucial foundation for the advancement of high-tech and smart manufacturing industries.</description>

      <title>Entanglement distribution over metropolitan fiber using on-chip broadband polarization entangled photon source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entangled photon pairs are of crucial importance in quantum networks. For the future demands of large-scale and secure quantum communication, integrated photon sources are highly effective solutions. Here, we report entanglement distribution over a 30 km metropolitan area using on-chip broadband silicon nanowire biphoton polarization entangled source based on a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) platform. This source generates a continuous spectrum spanning the entire C-band (4.5 THz), achieving a locally detected coincidence counts of about 154 kHz within 100GHz bandwidth, making it suitable for long-distance entanglement distribution among multiple users. By combining this source with quantum entanglement, enhanced by high-precision clock synchronization that achieves an Allan variance of 56.8 ps over 600s, we observe a violation of the CHSH inequality by 27.8 standard deviations. Our results showcase the potential of silicon photonic technology as a scalable and practical platform for quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Weak-coupling bound states in semi-infinite topological waveguide QED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A striking feature of cavity quantum electrodynamics is the existence of atom-photon bound states, which typically form when the coupling between the atom and its environment are strong enough that after de-excitation the atom can ``grab'' an emitted photon and re-absorb it, resulting in a virtual cloud surrounding the atom. Here we will demonstrate the existence of bound states that instead form in the case of weak coupling. Specifically, we show that when a quantum emitter is weakly coupled to a structured reservoir exhibiting topologically-protected surface states, hybridizations between these states and the emitter can form, resulting in mid-gap bound states. We illustrate this using a semi-infinite extension of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model as our reservoir. First, we diagonalize the bare semi-infinite SSH chain and reveal a winding number that predicts only the edge state on the finite side of the chain survives the semi-infinite extension. Then, after coupling the quantum emitter to this end of the chain, we analyze the modified emitter spectrum and reveal the existence of bound states in three parameter regions. Two of these represent the usual strong-coupling bound states, while the third gives the weak-coupling bound states with eigenvalue appearing in the SSH band gap and which exhibit partial sublattice localization. We demonstrate that oscillations between the weak-coupling bound states can be used to transfer the particle from the emitter into the lattice in a predictable and reversible manner.</description>

      <title>Numerical security analysis for quantum key distribution with partial state characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical security proofs offer a versatile approach for evaluating the secret-key generation rate of quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols. However, existing methods typically require perfect source characterization, which is unrealistic in practice due to the presence of inevitable encoding imperfections and side channels. In this paper, we introduce a novel security proof technique based on semidefinite programming that can evaluate the secret-key rate for both prepare-and-measure and measurement-device-independent QKD protocols when only partial information about the emitted states is available, significantly improving the applicability and practical relevance compared to existing numerical techniques. We demonstrate that our method can outperform current analytical approaches addressing partial state characterization in terms of achievable secret-key rates, particularly for protocols with non-qubit encoding spaces. This represents a significant step towards bridging the gap between theoretical security proofs and practical QKD implementations.</description>

      <title>Optomechanical non-Gaussian quantum steering and remote preparation of large-size motional Sch\"ordinger cat states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a scheme for remotely generating large-size motional Schr\"{o}dinger cat states in cavity optomechanical (OM) systems with non-Gaussian quantum steering of continuous variables. We consider that the output field from the OM cavity undergoes three typical kinds of multiphoton operations: multiphoton subtraction, multiphoton addition, or multiphoton catalysis, followed by homodyne detection. We first demonstrate that these multiphoton operations can lead to non-Gaussian OM quantum steerable correlations, which are unveiled by the subsequent homodyne detection with a Fisher-information-based steering criterion. It is found that the non-Gaussian steering is obviously enhanced with an increasing number $n$ of photons in the multiphoton operations, which, as we show, fails to be revealed with the well-known Reid's steering criterion. It therefore suggests that the Fisher-information-based criterion is more effective for witnessing non-Gaussian quantum steering. We next show that the strong OM steering enables the remote preparation of large-size Schr\"{o}dinger odd or even cat states of the mechanical oscillator by the homodyne detection. Accordingly, the amplitudes of the cat states also increase significantly with the photon number $n$, particularly in the cases of multiphoton subtraction and addition. Our results reveal the properties of non-Gaussian steering generated by multiphoton operations, and the large cat states of macroscopic mechanical resonators hold promise for fundamental tests in quantum mechanics and practical applications in quantum science.</description>

      <title>Steady-state tripartite non-Gaussian entanglement and steering in output field from intracavity triple-photon parametric downconversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nondegenerate triple-photon parametric downconversion (NTPD) is a potential source for unconditional tripartite non-Gaussian entangled states of continuous variables. Recent experiment has demonstrated strong third-order correlations among bright photon triplets via microwave NTPD in a superconducting cavity [Phys. Rev. X 10, 011011 (2020)]. Previous theoretic works have revealed that only short-time genuine tripartite non-Gaussian entanglement can be generated in NTPD even in the absence of dissipation. In this paper, we investigate the properties of tripartite non-Gaussian entanglement and steering in the cavity output field by taking into account of the cavity dissipation. We first derive experimentally detectable criteria for fully inseparable and genuine tripartite non-Gaussian entanglement and steering. With the criteria, we then find that steady-state tripartite non-Gaussian entanglement and steering can be generated in the output field, although they merely exist in the short-time regime inside the cavity. We also find that the initial cavity-field coherent states can obviously enhance the steady-state and transient tripartite entanglement and steering, in comparison to the case of initial vacuum states. We finally show that the output tripartite non-Gaussian steerable correlations can be applied to the remote generation of negative Wigner-function quantum states by homodyne detection.</description>

      <title>TANGO: A Robust Qubit Mapping Algorithm via Two-Stage Search and Bidirectional Look</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current quantum devices typically lack full qubit connectivity, making it difficult to directly execute logical circuits on quantum devices. This limitation necessitates quantum circuit mapping algorithms to insert SWAP gates, dynamically remapping logical qubits to physical qubits and transforming logical circuits into physical circuits that comply with device connectivity constraints. However, the insertion of SWAP gates increases both the gate count and circuit depth, ultimately reducing the fidelity of quantum algorithms. To achieve a balanced optimization of these two objectives, we propose the TANGO algorithm. By incorporating a layer-weight allocation strategy, the algorithm first formulates an evaluation function that balances the impact of qubit mapping on both mapped and unmapped nodes, thereby enhancing the quality of the initial mapping. Next, we design an innovative two-stage routing algorithm that prioritizes the number of executable gates as the primary evaluation metric while also considering quantum gate distance, circuit depth, and a novel bidirectional-look SWAP strategy, which optimizes SWAP gate selection in conjunction with preceding gates, improving the effectiveness of the mapping algorithm. Finally, by integrating advanced quantum gate optimization techniques, the algorithm's overall performance is further enhanced. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to state-of-the-art methods, the proposed algorithm achieves multi-objective co-optimization of gate count and circuit depth across various benchmarks and quantum devices, exhibiting significant performance advantages.</description>

      <title>Photonic Mode Description of the Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian provides the elemental description of a two-level system interacting with a photonic mode. In this Article, we derive an expression for the transmission response via a photonic signal that describes the hybridized states as separate photonic modes. As a result, we obtain the effective input/output couplings and the internal losses of each mode. These set the decoherence rate of the hybridized states, and provide a simple description of the strength of the response signal, that we call "visibility", and its linewidth. In particular, the result allows us to describe a situation where the coherence increases significantly while the signal remains strongly visible in the response.</description>

      <title>Quasiparticle poisoning of superconducting qubits with active gamma irradiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When a high-energy particle, such as a $\gamma$-ray or muon, impacts the substrate of a superconducting qubit chip, large numbers of electron-hole pairs and phonons are created. The ensuing dynamics of the electrons and holes changes the local offset-charge environment for qubits near the impact site. The phonons that are produced have energy above the superconducting gap in the films that compose the qubits, leading to quasiparticle excitations above the superconducting ground state when the phonons impinge on the qubit electrodes. An elevated density of quasiparticles degrades qubit coherence, leading to errors in qubit arrays. Because these pair-breaking phonons spread throughout much of the chip, the errors can be correlated across a large portion of the array, posing a significant challenge for quantum error correction. In order to study the dynamics of $\gamma$-ray impacts on superconducting qubit arrays, we use a $\gamma$-ray source outside the dilution refrigerator to controllably irradiate our devices. By using charge-sensitive transmon qubits, we can measure both the offset-charge shifts and quasiparticle poisoning due to the $\gamma$ irradiation at different doses. We study correlations between offset-charge shifts and quasiparticle poisoning for different qubits in the array and compare this with numerical modeling of charge and phonon dynamics following a $\gamma$-ray impact. We thus characterize the poisoning footprint of these impacts and quantify the performance of structures for mitigating phonon-mediated quasiparticle poisoning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning quantum Hamiltonians with high precision is important for quantum physics and quantum information science. We propose a multi-stage neural network framework that significantly enhances Hamiltonian learning precision through successive network optimization of residual errors. Our approach utilizes time-series data from single-qubit Pauli measurements of random initial states, enabling the estimation of unknown Hamiltonian parameters without prior structural assumptions. We demonstrate the framework on two-qubit systems, achieving orders-of-magnitude improvement in parameter accuracy, and further extend the method to larger systems by integrating dynamical decoupling techniques. Additionally, the protocol exhibits robustness against experimental noise. This work bridges the gap between scalable Hamiltonian learning and high-precision requirements, offering a practical tool for precise quantum control and metrology.</description>

      <title>Opening Krylov space to access all-time dynamics via dynamical symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solving short and long time dynamics of closed quantum many-body systems is one of the main challenges of both atomic and condensed matter physics. For locally interacting closed systems, the dynamics of local observables can always be expanded into (pseudolocal) eigenmodes of the Liouvillian, so called dynamical symmetries. They come in two classes - transient operators, which decay in time and perpetual operators, which either oscillate forever or stay the same (conservation laws). These operators provide a full characterization of the dynamics of the system. Deriving these operators, apart from a very limited class of models, has not been possible. Here, we present a method to numerically and analytically derive some of these dynamical symmetries in infinite closed systems by introducing a naturally emergent open boundary condition on the Krylov chain. This boundary condition defines a partitioning of the Krylov space into system and environment degrees of freedom, where non-local operators make up an effective bath for the local operators. We demonstrate the practicality of the method on some numerical examples and derive analytical results in two idealized cases. Our approach lets us directly relate the operator growth hypothesis to thermalization and exponential decay of observables in chaotic systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In traveling-wave parametric amplifiers (TWPAs) low-loss capacitors are necessary to provide 50 $\Omega$ impedance matching to the increased inductance that is brought in by the nonlinear elements used for amplification, be it Josephson junctions or high kinetic inductance materials. Here we report on the development of a fabrication process for vacuum-gap microstrips, a design in which the ground plane is suspended in close proximity above the center conductor without the support of a dielectric. In addition to high-capacitance transmission lines, this architecture also enables air-bridges and compact parallel-plate capacitors. The performance of the fabrication is examined using distributed aluminum and granular aluminum resonators in a cryogenic dilution refrigerator setup, showing quality factors on par with the fabrication processes used in state-of-the-art TWPAs. In addition to characterizing the dependence of the quality factors on power, also their behavior with respect to temperature is explored, applying a model based on thermal quasi-particles and saturable two-level systems (TLS), showing that the quality factors of the resonators are limited by TLS.</description>

      <title>Optimal Connectivity from Idle Qubit residual coupling Cross-Talks in a Cavity Mediated Entangling Gate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum processors operated through long range interaction mediated by a microwave resonator have been envisioned to allow for high connectivity. The ability to selectively operate qubits rely on the possibility to dynamically suppress the coupling between each qubit and the resonator, however there always remains a residual coupling. In this article, we investigate the effect of high processor connectivity on average two qubit gate fidelity in a cavity based architecture with tunable coupling. Via a perturbative approach, we quantify the cross-talk errors from transverse residual couplings and show that they scale as $nm^2$ where $n$ is the number of idle qubits and $m$ is the ratio between the transverse residual and active couplings. Setting an error threshold $E_\mathrm{thr}$, we demonstrate that cross-talks restrict the hardware topology and prevent the full use of all-to-all connectivity. We predict that the maximum number of qubits allowed by $E_\mathrm{thr}$ scales as $n \propto E_\mathrm{thr}/m^2$.</description>

      <title>Causality violation of Schr\"{o}dinger-Newton equation: direct test on the horizon?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We quote a definitive simple proof that neither classical stochastic dynamics nor quantum dynamics can be nonlinear if we stick to their standard statistical interpretations. A recently proposed optomechanical test of gravity's classicality versus quantumness is based on the nonlinear Schr\"odinger-Newton equation (SNE) which is the nonrelativistic limit of standard semiclassical gravity. While in typical cosmological applications of semiclassical gravity the predicted violation of causality is ignored, it cannot be disregarded in applications of the SNE in high sensitive laboratory tests hoped for the coming years. We reveal that, in a recently designed experiment, quantum optical monitoring of massive probes predicts fake action-at-a-distance (acausality) on a single probe already. The proposed experiment might first include the direct test of this acausality.</description>

Abstract: Nonstabilizerness, also known as quantum magic, characterizes the beyond-Clifford operations needed to prepare a quantum state and constitutes an essential resource, alongside entanglement, for achieving quantum advantage. This work investigates how nonstabilizerness spreads under the dynamics of disordered quantum many-body systems. Using the $\ell$-bit model, a phenomenological model of many-body localization (MBL), we present an analytical description of the nonstabilizerness growth in MBL systems. We demonstrate that our analytical formulas describe the nonstabilizerness growth in strongly disordered quantum spin chains. Our findings establish a new facet of MBL phenomenology and identify the vital role of the disorder in slowing down the growth of the complexity of quantum states, important for our understanding of quantum advantage.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Monitoring of Multimode Squeezing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimode squeezed light is a key resource for high-dimensional quantum technologies, enabling applications in metrology, secure communication, and measurement-based quantum computing. So far, its full practical potential remains unrealized due to the limitations of homodyne detection, which is inherently restricted to single-mode operation and, at best, retrieves multimode data through post-processing. Here, we employ multimode optical parametric amplification (MOPA) to, for the first time to the best of our knowledge, achieve real-time monitoring of co-propagating modes of multimode squeezed light. By leveraging simultaneous multimode phase-sensitive amplification followed by mode sorting, we enable real-time detection of nine spatial modes and report high-purity squeezing of approximately -8 dB in the fundamental mode, which, as far as we are aware, is the highest recorded for pulsed squeezing. Furthermore, we propose MOPA for the efficient characterization of cluster states, enabling real-time monitoring of all cluster links. This work completes the set of capabilities needed for robust multimode squeezed light detection and significantly expands its applicability in quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Genuine Continuous Quantumness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Randomness is a key feature of quantum physics. Heisenberg's uncertainty principle reveals existence of an intrinsic noise, usually explored through Gaussian squeezed states. Due to their insufficiency for quantum advantage, the focus is currently shifting towards genuinely quantum non-Gaussian states. However, while the genuine quantum behavior comes naturally to discrete variable systems, its preparation and verification is difficult in the continuous ones. Simultaneously, a unifying theoretical framework based on the continuous nature is missing. Here, we introduce nonlinear squeezing as a general framework to describe and verify genuine quantumness in noise of continuous quantum states. Using this approach, we certify the non-Gaussianity of experimentally prepared multi-photon-added coherent states of light for the first time. Chiefly, we demonstrated the nonlinear squeezing corresponding to third- and fifth-order quantum nonlinearities, going significantly beyond the current state-of-the-art in quantum technology. This framework advances quantum science and supports the development of quantum technologies by uncovering intricate quantum properties in cutting-edge experiments.</description>

      <title>Quantum-like cognition and decision making in the light of quantum measurement theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We characterize the class of quantum measurements that matches the applications of quantum theory to cognition (and decision making) - quantum-like modeling. Projective measurements describe the canonical measurements of the basic observables of quantum physics. However, the combinations of the basic cognitive effects, such as the question order and response replicability effects, cannot be described by projective measurements. We motivate the use of the special class of quantum measurements, namely {\it sharp repeatable non-projective measurements} - ${\cal SR\bar{P}}. $ This class is practically unused in quantum physics. Thus, physics and cognition explore different parts of quantum measurement theory. Quantum-like modeling isn't automatic borrowing of the quantum formalism. Exploring the class ${\cal SR\bar{P}}$ highlights the role of {\it noncommutativity of the state update maps generated by measurement back action.} Thus, ``non-classicality'' in quantum physics as well as quantum-like modeling for cognition is based on two different types of noncommutativity, of operators (observables) and instruments (state update maps): {\it observable-noncommutativity} vs. {\it state update-noncommutativity}. We speculate that distinguishing quantum-like properties of the cognitive effects are the expressions of the latter, or possibly both.</description>

      <title>Electric polarization in Chern insulators: Unifying many-body and single-particle approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, it has been established that Chern insulators possess an intrinsic two-dimensional electric polarization, despite having gapless edge states and non-localizable Wannier orbitals. This polarization, $\vec{P}_{\text{o}}$, can be defined in a many-body setting from various physical quantities, including dislocation charges, boundary charge distributions, and linear momentum. Importantly, there is a dependence on a choice of real-space origin $\text{o}$ within the unit cell. In contrast, Coh and Vanderbilt extended the single-particle Berry phase definition of polarization to Chern insulators by choosing an arbitrary point in momentum space, $\vec{k}_0$. In this paper, we unify these two approaches and show that when the real-space origin $\text{o}$ and momentum-space point $\vec{k}_0$ are appropriately chosen in relation to each other, the Berry phase and many-body definitions of polarization are equal.</description>

      <title>Femtosecond Temporal Phase-Resolved Nonlinear Optical Spectroscopy in Molecules with Lock-in Enabled Phase Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe an experiment to measure the emitted real-time electric field from an ultrafast third-order nonlinear optical interaction in molecules, using a phase-tracked spectral interferometry scheme. By combining a software lock-in amplification based spectrometer with spectral interferometry, we measure the electric field of the nonlinear optical signal from rotationally excited gas-phase molecules. The lock-in spectrometer allows selective measurement of signals of interest with improved signal-to-noise ratio, while rejecting any unwanted incoherent background. The nonlinear optical signal interferes with a known reference pulse on the spectrometer, which allows measurement of ultraweak signal electric fields. Further, we show that lock-in detection enables correction of slow interferometric drifts by utilizing a multidimensional measurement space. Thus, interferometric stability is achieved without the need for active stabilization, which typically utilizes an independent phase drift measurement. We present data from an experiment in impulsively aligned molecules that demonstrates the important features of our scheme. The scheme can be applied to study ultrafast dynamics in laser excited systems in the gas, liquid, and solid phases of matter.</description>

      <title>Controllable and Continuous Quantum Phase Transitions in Intrinsic Magnetic Topological Insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The intrinsic magnetic topological material MnBi2Te4 has demonstrated great potential to investigate the interplay between topology and magnetism, which opens up new avenues for manipulating non-trivial electronic states and designing quantum devices. However, challenges and controversies remain due to its inevitable n-type antisite defects, hindering the experimental realization of intrinsic magnetic topological phenomena and rendering the precise control of topological phase transitions (TPTs) unachievable. Here, we study a candidate material family, Mn(1-x)GexBi2Te4, in which the heavy n-type doping features are strongly suppressed when the Ge content reaches 0.46, and multiple topological phases are well maintained with the surface Dirac point located near the Fermi level. Based on angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, transport measurements, and first-principles calculations, we reveal two magnetism-induced TPTs: the first is antiferromagnetic-ordering-induced transition from strong topological insulator to a magnetic topological insulator as revealed by gap opening of topological surface states; the second is external-magnetic-field-dependent transition from magnetic topological insulator to a Weyl semimetal with the gap reclosed. Our work paves the way for the realization of intrinsic magnetic topological states in MnBi2Te4 family and provides an ideal platform for achieving controllable and continuous TPTs towards future spintronic applications.</description>

Abstract: We present a quantum response approach to momentum-space gravity in dissipative multiband systems, which dresses both the quantum geometry--through an interband Weyl transformation--and the equations of motion. In addition to clarifying the roles of the contorsion and symplectic terms, we introduce the three-state quantum geometric tensor and discuss the significance of the emergent terms from a gravitational point of view. We also identify a dual quantum geometric drag force in momentum space that provides an entropic source term for the multiband matrix of Einstein field equations.</description>

      <title>Driven Magnon-Photon System as a Tunable Quantum Heat Rectifier</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Controlling the flow of heat in quantum systems or circuits is very desirable for the development of quantum technologies. Here, we investigate the quantum heat transport in a driven hybrid magnonphoton system in contact with two thermal baths operating at different temperatures. Specifically, we analyze the role of the parameters of the hybrid quantum system in the processes that lead to the asymmetry of the steady-state heat current. We find that the thermal rectification is high in the regime of weak magnon-photon hybridization strength and large magnon-drive. Moreover, this driving and the system parameters could serve as experimental knobs to tune the thermodynamic properties of the magnon-photon system, as we demonstrate for the rectification parameter tunable by the drive in its entire physical range. The results from this research would provide very useful insight into the design of quantum thermal machines with a driven magnon-photon system.</description>

      <title>Harvesting correlations from BTZ black hole coupled to a Lorentz-violating vector field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the effects of Lorentz violation on correlations harvesting, specifically focusing on the harvested entanglement and harvested mutual information between two Unruh-DeWitt detectors interacting with a quantum field in the Lorentz-violating BTZ black hole spacetime. Our findings reveal that Lorentz symmetry breaking has contrasting impacts on entanglement harvesting and mutual information harvesting in BTZ backgrounds: it enhances mutual information harvesting while suppressing entanglement harvesting. This phenomenon suggests that the increase in total correlations in Lorentz-violating vector field backgrounds with gravitational coupling is predominantly driven by classical components, with quantum correlations contributing less to the overall mutual information. These results indicate that Lorentz violation, as a quantum property of spacetime, may impose intrinsic constraints on the quantum information capacity encoded in spacetime due to competition among quantum degrees of freedom for resources. Furthermore, Lorentz symmetry breaking expands the \textit{entanglement shadow} region, further demonstrating its disruptive effect on quantum correlations.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Matrix Product States in the Heisenberg Picture: Projectivity, Ergodicity, and Mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a Heisenberg picture approach to Matrix Product States (MPS), offering a rigorous yet intuitive framework to explore their structure and classification. MPS efficiently represent ground states of quantum many-body systems, with infinite MPS (iMPS) capturing long-range correlations and thermodynamic behavior. We classify MPS into projective and non-projective types, distinguishing those with finite correlation structures from those requiring ergodic quantum channels to define a meaningful limit. Using the Markov-Dobrushin inequality, we establish conditions for infinite-volume states and introduce ergodic and mixing MPS. As an application, we analyze the depolarizing MPS, highlighting its lack of finite correlations and the need for an alternative ergodic description. This work deepens the mathematical foundations of MPS and iMPS, providing new insights into entanglement, phase transitions, and quantum dynamics.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the diagrammatic theory of the irreducible self-energy and Bethe-Salpeter kernel that naturally arises within the Green's function formalism for a general $N$-body non-hermitian interaction. In this work, we focus specifically on the coupled-cluster self-energy generated by the similarity transformation of the electronic structure Hamiltonian. We develop the biorthogonal quantum theory to construct dynamical correlation functions where the time-dependence of operators is governed by a non-hermitian Hamiltonian. We extend the Gell-Mann and Low theorem to include non-hermitian interactions and to generate perturbative expansions of many-body Green's functions. We introduce the single-particle coupled-cluster Green's function and derive the perturbative diagrammatic expansion for the non-hermitian coupled-cluster self-energy in terms of the `non-interacting' reference Green's function, $\tilde{\Sigma}[G_0]$. From the equation-of-motion of the single-particle coupled-cluster Green's function, we derive the self-consistent renormalized coupled-cluster self-energy, $\tilde{\Sigma}[\tilde{G}]$, and demonstrate its relationship to the perturbative expansion of the self-energy, $\tilde{\Sigma}[G_0]$. Subsequently, we show that the usual electronic self-energy can be recovered from the coupled-cluster self-energy by neglecting the effects of the similarity transformation. We show how the coupled-cluster ground state energy is related to the coupled-cluster self-energy and provide an overview of the relationship between approximations for the coupled-cluster self-energy, IP/EA-EOM-CCSD and the $G_0W_0$ approximation. As a result, we introduce the CC-$G_0W_0$ self-energy by leveraging the connections between Green's function and coupled-cluster theory. Finally, we derive the diagrammatic expansion of the coupled-cluster Bethe-Salpeter kernel.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate how the gravitational field generated by a four-dimensional electrovacuum cosmological space-time influences the dynamics of fermionic fields governed by the Dirac equation, while also considering the effects of topology. We derive the radial wave equation corresponding to the relativistic Dirac equation and subsequently obtain analytical solutions for the energy levels and wave functions of the fermionic field within our chosen framework. Our analysis reveals that various parameters, including geometric topology, the cosmological constant, and quantum numbers, play significant roles in determining the eigenvalue solution of the quantum particles. Specifically, we demonstrate that the presence of the topological parameter disrupts the degeneracy of the energy spectrum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Abelian anyons such as Majorana zero modes (MZMs) have the potential to enable fault-tolerant quantum computing through topological protection. Experimentally reported InSb topological superconductor nanowires (TSNW) are investigated theoretically and numerically to evaluate their suitability to host MZMs. We employ eigenspectra analysis and quantum transport based on the non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) formalism to investigate the eigenenergies, Majorana wave functions via local density of states, transmission spectra for Andreev processes, and zero-bias conductance peaks (ZBCPs) in InSb TSNWs. For 1.6 {\mu}m- and 2.2 {\mu}m-long InSb TSNWs we demonstrate the existence of the optimum design space defined by the applied magnetic field and electrochemical potential, which leads to clear ZBCP signatures with a Majorana localization length down to ~340 nm.</description>

      <title>Correlated vibration-solvent and Duschinsky effects on optical spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the role of vibrations in optical spectroscopies is essential for the precise interpretation of spectroscopic behavior, especially in systems with complex solvation effects. This workstudies the correlated Duschinsky and solvent effects on the optical spectra using the extended dissipaton-equation-of-motion (ext-DEOM) approach, which is an exact and non-Markovian, nonperturbative approach for nonlinear environmental couplings. In the paper, the environment (bath) is composed of the solvent and intramolecular vibrational modes whose Duschinsky rotations constitute the quardratic couplings to the electronic states. To apply the ext-DEOM, one key step is to obtain the bath coupling descriptors, which is elaborated. As an accurate description of solvated molecular systems, the simulating results demonstrate how the above factors affect the position and shape of spectral bands.</description>

      <title>Probing Topological Anderson Transition in Quasiperiodic Photonic Lattices via Chiral Displacement and Wavelength Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interplay of topology and disorder in quantum dynamics has recently attracted significant attention across diverse platforms, including solid-state devices, ultracold atoms, and photonic systems. Here, we report on a topological Anderson transition caused by quasiperiodic inter-cell coupling disorder in photonic Su-Schrieffer-Heeger lattices. As the quasiperiodic strength is varied, the system exhibits a reentrant transition from a trivial phase to a topological phase and back to a trivial phase. Unlike the traditional detection of photonic topological edge modes, we measure the mean chiral displacement from the transport of light in the bulk of the lattices. In our photonic lattices with a fixed length, the propagation dynamics is retrieved by varying the wavelength of light, which tunes the inter-waveguide couplings.</description>

      <title>Time- and frequency-resolved dynamics of resonant two-photon terahertz quantum cascade lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-photon terahertz (THz) quantum cascade lasers (QCLs) can immensely improve the conventional applications of THz frequency sources and open windows to new applications due to their ability to generate quantum-entangled twin photon beams. The rich intrinsic non-linearity in a two-photon THz QCL arises from cascaded photon transitions, leading to time-resolved and frequency-resolved dynamics that are less predictable. This work investigates the time- and frequency-resolved dynamics of a resonant two-photon THz QCL by numerically solving the coupled Maxwell-Bloch equations. Our findings indicate that the output intensity is significantly higher, and the emission spectra are much broader in a two-photon THz QCL than in a conventional one-photon THz QCL. Additionally, a pronounced Risken-Nummedal-Graham-Haken (RNGH) instability onsets for a resonant two-photon QCL at a smaller pumping current. We also observe an increase in the number of lasing modes, as well as a higher power per line in a resonant two-photon QCL. Furthermore, Rabi splitting is observed in the emission spectra at high pumping currents.</description>

      <title>Time delay of mean field interaction in thermal Rydberg atomic gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mean field theory is commonly employed to study nonequilibrium dynamics in hot Rydberg atomic ensembles, but the fundamental mechanism behind the generation of the mean-field interactions remains poorly understood. In this work, we experimentally observe a time-delay effect in the buildup of mean-field interaction, which reveals the key role of collision ionization. We analyze the relevant collision channels and propose a microscopic mechanism that quantitatively explains the hysteresis window observed in optical bistability. Then, using square-wave modulation spectroscopy (SMS) to monitor the growth of the mean-field interaction, we experimentally demonstrate a delay in its dynamical buildup following the initial Rydberg excitation. Finally, we demonstrate how this delay effect may help understand the recently observed self-sustained oscillations in thermal Rydberg gases. Our findings provide compelling evidence for the contribution of ionization processes in the nonequilibrium dynamics of thermal Rydberg gas, a system of growing interest for quantum sensing and quantum information science.</description>

      <title>Multi-set variational quantum dynamics algorithm for simulating nonadiabatic dynamics on quantum computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accelerating quantum dynamical simulations with quantum computing has received considerable attention but remains a significant challenge. In variational quantum algorithms for quantum dynamics, designing an expressive and shallow-depth parameterized quantum circuit (PQC) is a key difficulty. Here, we proposed a multi-set variational quantum dynamics algorithm (MS-VQD) tailored for nonadiabatic dynamics involving multiple electronic states. MS-VQD employs multiple PQCs to represent the electronic-nuclear coupled wavefunction, with each circuit adapting to the motion of nuclear wavepacket on a specific potential energy surface. By simulating excitation energy transfer dynamics in molecular aggregates described by the Frenkel-Holstein model, we demonstrated that MS-VQD achieves the same accuracy as traditional VQD while requiring significantly shallower PQCs. Notably, its advantage increases with the number of electronic states, making it suitable for simulating nonadiabatic quantum dynamics in complex molecular systems.</description>

      <title>Bound state formation within the Lindblad approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Lindblad master equation is a frequently used Markovian approach to describe open quantum systems in terms of the temporal evolution of a reduced density matrix. Here, the thermal environment is traced out to obtain an expression to describe the evolution of what is called a system: one particle or a chain of interacting particles, which is/are surrounded by a thermal heat bath. In this work, we investigate the formation of non-relativistic bound states, involving the P\"oschl-Teller potential, in order to discuss the formation time and the thermal equilibrium, applying scales from nuclear physics. This problem is borrowed from the field of heavy-ion collisions, where the deuteron is a probe which is measured at temperature regimes around the chemical freeze out temperature, while the deuteron itself has a binding energy which is much lower. This is known and often described as a ``snowball in hell". We use a reformulated Lindblad equation, in terms of a diffusion-advection equation with sources and therefore provide a hydrodynamical formulation of a dissipative quantum master equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a Josephson traveling-wave parametric amplifier (JTWPA) based on a low-loss coplanar lumped-element waveguide architecture. By employing open-stub capacitors and Manhattan-pattern junctions, our device achieves an insertion loss below 1 dB up to 12 GHz. We introduce windowed sinusoidal modulation for phase matching, demonstrating that smooth impedance transitions effectively suppress intrinsic gain ripples. Using Tukey-windowed modulation with 8 % impedance variation, we achieve 20$-$23-dB gain over 5-GHz bandwidth under ideal matching conditions. In a more practical circuit having impedance mismatches, the device maintains 17$-$20-dB gain over 4.8-GHz bandwidth with an added noise of 0.13 quanta above standard quantum limit at 20-dB gain and $-99$-dBm saturation power, while featuring zero to negative backward gain below the bandgap frequency.</description>

      <title>On the Minimum Distances of Finite-Length Lifted Product Quantum LDPC Codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum error correction (QEC) is critical for practical realization of fault-tolerant quantum computing, and recently proposed families of quantum low-density parity-check (QLDPC) code are prime candidates for advanced QEC hardware architectures and implementations. This paper focuses on the finite-length QLDPC code design criteria, specifically aimed at constructing degenerate quasi-cyclic symmetric lifted-product (LP-QLDPC) codes. We describe the necessary conditions such that the designed LP-QLDPC codes are guaranteed to have a minimum distance strictly greater than the minimum weight stabilizer generators, ensuring superior error correction performance on quantum channels. The focus is on LP-QLDPC codes built from quasi-cyclic base codes belonging to the class of type-I protographs, and the necessary constraints are efficiently expressed in terms of the row and column indices of the base code. Specifically, we characterize the combinatorial constraints on the classical quasi-cyclic base matrices that guarantee construction of degenerate LP-QLDPC codes. Minimal examples and illustrations are provided to demonstrate the usefulness and effectiveness of the code construction approach. The row and column partition constraints derived in the paper simplify the design of degenerate LP-QLDPC codes and can be incorporated into existing classical and quantum code design approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2005.13418v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In order to reject the local hidden variables hypothesis, the usefulness of a Bell inequality can be quantified by how small a p-value it will give for a physical experiment. Here we show that to obtain a small expected p-value it is sufficient to have a large gap between the local and Tsirelson bounds of the Bell inequality, when it is formulated as a nonlocal game. We develop an algorithm for transforming an arbitrary Bell inequality into an equivalent nonlocal game with the largest possible gap, and show its results for the CGLMP and $I_{nn22}$ inequalities. We present explicit examples of Bell inequalities with gap arbitrarily close to one, and show that this makes it possible to reject local hidden variables with arbitrarily small p-value in a single shot, without needing to collect statistics. We also develop an algorithm for calculating local bounds of general Bell inequalities which is significantly faster than the na\"ive approach, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2205.04829v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a software tool-set which combines the theoretical, optimal control view of quantum devices with the practical operation and characterization tasks required for quantum computing. In the same framework, we perform model-based simulations to create control schemes, calibrate these controls in a closed-loop with the device (or in this demo \textemdash by emulating the experimental process) and finally improve the system model through minimization of the mismatch between simulation and experiment, resulting in a digital twin of the device. The model based simulator is implemented using TensorFlow, for numeric efficiency, scalability and to make use of automatic differentiation, which enables gradient-based optimization for arbitrary models and control schemes. Optimizations are carried out with a collection of state-of-the-art algorithms originated in the field of machine learning. All of this comes with a user-friendly Qiskit interface, which allows end-users to easily simulate their quantum circuits on a high-fidelity differentiable physics simulator.</description>

      <title>Quantum Supermaps are Characterized by Locality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2205.09844v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a new characterisation of quantum supermaps in terms of an axiom that refers only to sequential and parallel composition. Consequently, we generalize quantum supermaps to arbitrary monoidal categories and operational probabilistic theories. We do so by providing a simple definition of locally-applicable transformation on a monoidal category. The definition can be rephrased in the language of category theory using the principle of naturality, and can be given an intuitive diagrammatic representation in terms of which all proofs are presented. In our main technical contribution, we use this diagrammatic representation to show that locally-applicable transformations on quantum channels are in one-to-one correspondence with deterministic quantum supermaps. This alternative characterization of quantum supermaps is proven to work for more general multiple-input supermaps such as the quantum switch and on arbitrary normal convex spaces of quantum channels such as those defined by satisfaction of signaling constraints.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2205.13217v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We set the criteria under which superposition of causal order can be incorporated in to quantum walks. In particular, we show that only periodic quantum walks or those with at least one disorder exhibit Superposition of causal order under the action of `quantum switch'. We exemplify our results with a simple example of two-period discrete-time quantum walks. In particular, we observe that periodic quantum walks exhibit causal asymmetry pertaining to the dynamics of the reduced coin state: the dynamics are more non-Markovian for one temporal order than the other. We also note that the non-Markovianity of the reduced coin state due to indefiniteness in causal order tends to match the dynamics of a particular temporal order of the coin state. We substantiate our results with numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Prog-QAOA: Framework for resource-efficient quantum optimization through classical programs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.03386v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current state-of-the-art quantum optimization algorithms require representing the original problem as a binary optimization problem, which is then converted into an equivalent cost Hamiltonian suitable for the quantum device. Implementing each term of the cost Hamiltonian separately often results in high redundancy, significantly increasing the resources required. Instead, we propose to design classical programs for computing the objective function and certifying the constraints, and later compile them to quantum circuits, eliminating the reliance on the binary optimization problem representation. This results in a new variant of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), which we name the Program-based QAOA (Prog-QAOA). We exploit this idea for optimization tasks like the Travelling Salesman Problem and Max-$K$-Cut and obtain circuits that are near-optimal with respect to all relevant cost measures, e.g., number of qubits, gates, and circuit depth. While we demonstrate the power of Prog-QAOA only for a particular set of paradigmatic problems, our approach is conveniently applicable to generic optimization problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.05576v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the RF Quantum Upconverter (RQU) and describe its application to quantum metrology of electromagnetic modes between dc and the Very High Frequency band (VHF) ($\lesssim$300MHz). The RQU uses a Josephson interferometer made up of superconducting loops and Josephson junctions to implement a parametric interaction between a low-frequency electromagnetic mode (between dc and VHF) and a mode in the microwave C Band ($\sim$ 5GHz), analogous to the radiation pressure interaction between electromagnetic and mechanical modes in cavity optomechanics. We analyze RQU performance with quantum amplifier theory, and show that the RQU can operate as a quantum-limited op-amp in this frequency range. It can also use non-classical measurement protocols equivalent to those used in cavity optomechanics, including back-action evading (BAE) measurements, sideband cooling, and two-mode squeezing. These protocols enable experiments using dc--VHF electromagnetic modes as quantum sensors with sensitivity better than the Standard Quantum Limit (SQL). We demonstrate signal upconversion from low frequencies to microwave C band using an RQU and show a phase-sensitive gain (extinction ratio) of $46.9$\;dB, which is a necessary step towards the realization of full BAE.</description>

      <title>Quantum Chernoff divergence in advantage distillation for quantum key distribution and device-independent quantum key distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.06975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.06975v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Device-independent quantum key distribution (DIQKD) aims to mitigate adversarial exploitation of imperfections in quantum devices, by providing an approach for secret key distillation with modest security assumptions. Advantage distillation, a two-way communication procedure in error correction, has proven effective in raising noise tolerances in both device-dependent and device-independent QKD. Previously, device-independent security proofs against IID collective attacks were developed for an advantage distillation protocol known as the repetition-code protocol, based on security conditions involving the fidelity between some states in the protocol. However, there exists a gap between the sufficient and necessary security conditions, which hinders the calculation of tight noise-tolerance bounds based on the fidelity. We close this gap by presenting an alternative proof structure that replaces the fidelity with the quantum Chernoff divergence, a distinguishability measure that arises in symmetric hypothesis testing. Working in the IID collective attacks model, we derive matching sufficient and necessary conditions for the repetition-code protocol to be secure (up to a natural conjecture regarding the latter case) in terms of the quantum Chernoff divergence, hence indicating that this serves as the relevant quantity of interest for this protocol. Furthermore, using this security condition we obtain some improvements over previous results on the noise tolerance thresholds for DIQKD. Our results provide insight into a fundamental question in quantum information theory regarding the circumstances under which DIQKD is possible.</description>

Abstract: An operational (measurement based) scheme that connects measurement invasiveness and the presence of non-classical memory effects in open quantum systems is defined. Its underlying theoretical basis relies on a non-invasive measurability of (memoryless) quantum Markovian dynamics when the corresponding observable is diagonal in the same basis as the system density matrix. In contrast, violation of this property can be related to intrinsic non-classical memory effects. Related conditions for violation of Leggett-Garg inequality due to quantum memory effects emerge from this perspective. The developed approach applies to open quantum dynamics whose time-evolution is derived from a full unitary (microscopic) description, stochastic Hamiltonian dynamics, as well as for a broad class of non-unitary system-environment models (bipartite Lindblad equations).</description>

      <title>Vulnerability of fault-tolerant topological quantum error correction to quantum deviations in code space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.12859v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum computers face significant challenges from quantum deviations or coherent noise, particularly during gate operations, which pose a complex threat to the efficacy of quantum error correction (QEC) protocols. In this study, we scrutinize the performance of the topological toric code in 2 dimension (2D) under the dual influence of stochastic noise and quantum deviations, especially during the critical phases of initial state preparation and error detection facilitated by multi-qubit entanglement gates. By mapping the protocol for multi-round error detection--from the inception of an imperfectly prepared code state via imperfect stabilizer measurements--to a statistical mechanical model characterized by a 3-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory coupled with a 2-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory, we establish a novel link between the error threshold and the model's phase transition point. We find two distinct error thresholds that demarcate varying efficacies in error correction. The empirical threshold that signifies the operational success of QEC aligns with the theoretical ideal of flawless state preparation operations. Contrarily, below another finite theoretical threshold, a phenomenon absent in purely stochastic error models emerges: unidentifiable measurement errors precipitate QEC failure in scenarios with large code distances. For codes of finite or modest distance $d$, it is revealed that maintaining the preparation error rate beneath a crossover scale, proportional to $1/\log d$, allows for the suppression of logical errors. Considering that fault-tolerant quantum computation is valuable only in systems with large scale and exceptionally low logical error rates, this investigation explicitly demonstrates the vulnerability of 2D toric codes to quantum deviations in code space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.13450v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the complexity for the mixed state density operator derived from a one-dimensional discrete-time quantum walk (DTQW). The complexity is computed using a two-qubit quantum circuit obtained from canonically purifying the mixed state. We demonstrate that the Nielson complexity for the unitary evolution oscillates around a mean circuit depth of $k$. Further, the complexity of the step-wise evolution operator grows cumulatively and linearly with the steps. From a quantum circuit perspective, this implies a succession of circuits of (near) constant depth to be applied to reach the final state.</description>

Abstract: In a nonlocal game, two noncommunicating players cooperate to convince a referee that they possess a strategy that does not violate the rules of the game. Quantum strategies allow players to optimally win some games by performing joint measurements on a shared entangled state, but computing these strategies can be challenging. We present a variational quantum algorithm to compute quantum strategies for nonlocal games by encoding the rules of a nonlocal game into a Hamiltonian. We show how this algorithm can generate a short-depth optimal quantum strategy for a graph coloring game with a quantum advantage. This quantum strategy is then evaluated on fourteen different quantum hardware platforms to demonstrate its utility as a benchmark. Finally, we discuss potential sources of errors that can explain the observed decreased performance of the executed task and derive an expression for the number of samples required to accurately estimate the win rate in the presence of noise.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.15587v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We initiate the study of utilizing Quantum Langevin Dynamics (QLD) to solve optimization problems, particularly those non-convex objective functions that present substantial obstacles for traditional gradient descent algorithms. Specifically, we examine the dynamics of a system coupled with an infinite heat bath. This interaction induces both random quantum noise and a deterministic damping effect to the system, which nudge the system towards a steady state that hovers near the global minimum of objective functions. We theoretically prove the convergence of QLD in convex landscapes, demonstrating that the average energy of the system can approach zero in the low temperature limit with an exponential decay rate correlated with the evolution time. Numerically, we first show the energy dissipation capability of QLD by retracing its origins to spontaneous emission. Furthermore, we conduct detailed discussion of the impact of each parameter. Finally, based on the observations when comparing QLD with classical Fokker-Plank-Smoluchowski equation, we propose a time-dependent QLD by making temperature and $\hbar$ time-dependent parameters, which can be theoretically proven to converge better than the time-independent case and also outperforms a series of state-of-the-art quantum and classical optimization algorithms in many non-convex landscapes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11677v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Building upon recent research in spin systems with non-local interactions, this study investigates operator growth using the Krylov complexity in different non-local versions of the Ising model. We find that the non-locality results in a faster scrambling of the operator to all sites. While the saturation value of Krylov complexity of local integrable and local chaotic theories differ by a significant margin, this difference is much suppressed when non-local terms are introduced in both regimes. This results from the faster scrambling of information in the presence of non-locality. In addition, we investigate the behavior of level statistics and spectral form factor as probes of quantum chaos to study the integrability breaking due to non-local interactions. Our numerics indicate that in the non-local case, late time saturation of Krylov complexity distinguishes between different underlying theories, while the early time complexity growth distinguishes different degrees of non-locality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.02370v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A generalization of the quantum Rabi model is obtained by replacing the linear (dipole) coupling between the two-level system and the radiation mode by a non-linear expression in the creation and annihilation operators, corresponding to multi-photon excitations. If each spin flip involves $k$ photons, it is called the "$k$-photon" quantum Rabi model. While the formally symmetric Hamilton operator is self-adjoint in the case $k=2$, it is demonstrated here that the Hamiltonian is not self-adjoint for $k\ge 3$. Therefore it does not generate a unitary time evolution and is unphysical. This result cannot be obtained by numerical calculations in finite-dimensional spaces which attempt to approximate an unbounded operator by a finite-rank operator.</description>

Abstract: Recently, the propagation of information through quantum many-body systems, developed to study quantum chaos, have found many application from black holes to disordered spin systems. Among other quantitative tools, Krylov complexity has been explored as a diagnostic tool for information scrambling in quantum many-body systems. We introduce a universal limit to the growth of the Krylov complexity in dissipative open quantum systems by utilizing the uncertainty relation for non-hermitian operators. We also present the analytical results of Krylov complexity for characteristic behavior of Lanczos coefficients in dissipative systems. The validity of these results are demonstrated by explicit study of transverse-field Ising model under dissipative effects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08859v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computing vacuum states of lattice gauge theories (LGTs) containing fermionic degrees of freedom can present significant challenges for classical computation using Monte-Carlo methods. Quantum algorithms may offer a pathway towards more scalable computation of groundstate properties of LGTs. However, a comprehensive understanding of the quantum computational resources required for such a problem is thus far lacking. In this work, we investigate using the quantum subspace expansion (QSE) algorithm to compute the groundstate of the Schwinger model, an archetypal LGT describing quantum electrodynamics in one spatial dimension. We perform numerical simulations, including the effect of measurement noise, to extrapolate the resources required for the QSE algorithm to achieve a desired accuracy for a range of system sizes. Using this, we present a full analysis of the resources required to compute LGT vacuum states using a quantum algorithm using qubitization within a fault tolerant framework. We develop of a novel method for performing qubitization of a LGT Hamiltonian based on a 'linear combination of unitaries' (LCU) approach. The cost of the corresponding block encoding operation scales as $\tilde{O}(N)$ with system size $N$. Including the corresponding prefactors, our method reduces the gate cost by multiple orders of magnitude when compared to previous LCU methods for the QSE algorithm, which scales as $\tilde{O}(N^2)$ when applied to the Schwinger model. While the qubit and single circuit T-gate cost resulting from our resource analysis is appealing to early fault-tolerant implementation, we find that the number of shots required to avoid numerical instability within the QSE procedure must be significantly reduced in order to improve the feasibility of the methodology we consider and discuss how this might be achieved.</description>

Abstract: Realizing the full potential of quantum computing requires large-scale quantum computers capable of running quantum error correction (QEC) to mitigate hardware errors and maintain quantum data coherence. While quantum computers operate within a two-level computational subspace, many processor modalities are inherently multi-level systems. This leads to occasional leakage into energy levels outside the computational subspace, complicating error detection and undermining QEC protocols. The problem is particularly severe in engineered qubit devices like superconducting transmons, a leading technology for fault-tolerant quantum computing. Addressing this challenge requires effective multi-level quantum system readout to identify and mitigate leakage errors. We propose a scalable, high-fidelity three-level readout that reduces FPGA resource usage by $60\times$ compared to the baseline while reducing readout time by 20\%, enabling faster leakage detection. By employing matched filters to detect relaxation and excitation error patterns and integrating a modular lightweight neural network to correct crosstalk errors, the protocol significantly reduces hardware complexity, achieving a $100\times$ reduction in neural network size. Our design supports efficient, real-time implementation on off-the-shelf FPGAs, delivering a 6.6\% relative improvement in readout accuracy over the baseline. This innovation enables faster leakage mitigation, enhances QEC reliability, and accelerates the path toward fault-tolerant quantum computing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09613v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum information theory is plagued by the problem of regularisations, which require the evaluation of formidable asymptotic quantities. This makes it computationally intractable to gain a precise quantitative understanding of the ultimate efficiency of key operational tasks such as entanglement manipulation. Here we consider the problem of computing the asymptotic entanglement cost of preparing noisy quantum states under quantum operations with positive partial transpose (PPT). By means of an analytical example, a previously claimed solution to this problem is shown to be incorrect. Building on a previous characterisation of the PPT entanglement cost in terms of a regularised formula, we construct instead a hierarchy of semi-definite programs that bypasses the issue of regularisation altogether, and converges to the true asymptotic value of the entanglement cost. Our main result establishes that this convergence happens exponentially fast, thus yielding an efficient algorithm that approximates the cost up to an additive error $\varepsilon$ in time $\mathrm{poly}(D,\,\log(1/\varepsilon))$, where $D$ is the underlying Hilbert space dimension. To our knowledge, this is the first time that an asymptotic entanglement measure is shown to be efficiently computable despite no closed-form formula being available.</description>

Abstract: A central task in quantum metrology is to exploit quantum correlations to outperform classical sensitivity limits. Metrologically useful entanglement is identified when the quantum Fisher information (QFI) exceeds a separability bound for a given parameter-encoding Hamiltonian. However, so far, only results for linear Hamiltonians are well-established. Here, we characterize metrologically useful entanglement for nonlinear Hamiltonians, presenting separability bounds for collective angular momenta. Also, we provide a general expression for entangled states maximizing the QFI, which can be written as the superposition between the GHZ-like and singlet states. Finally, we compare the metrological usefulness of linear and nonlinear cases, in terms of entanglement detection and random symmetric states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18504v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum measurements profoundly influence system dynamics. They lead to complex nonequilibrium phenomena like the quantum Zeno effect, and they can be used for mitigating errors in quantum simulations.
  Such an ability is particularly valuable for lattice gauge theories (LGTs), which require the challenging preservation of an extensive number of local conservation laws.
  While it is known that tailored quantum measurements can soften violations of gauge symmetry, the nature of this protection, and in particular the possibility of a threshold behavior, is still unexplored.
  Here, we demonstrate the existence of a sharp transition, triggered by the measurement rate, between a protected gauge-theory regime resistant to simulation errors and an irregular regime.
  Our results are based on the paradigmatic example of a 1+1d $\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGT. We study in detail the protection through projective measurements of ancillary qubits coupled to the local symmetry generators, and compare this approach with analog (weak) measurement protocols.
  We show that, while the resulting ensemble averages in the continuous-time limit share the same Liouvillian dynamics, different physical implementations of the stochastic gauge protection protocol yield trajectory unravelings with vastly different statistics.
  Additionally, we design an on-chip feedback mechanism that corrects bit-flip errors and significantly enhances the discrete-time scheme. Our results shed light on the dissipative criticality of strongly-interacting, highly-constrained quantum systems, and they offer valuable insights into error mitigation and correction of gauge-theory quantum simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14461v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Engineering atom-atom interactions is essential both for controlling novel phases of matter and for efficient preparation of many-body entangled states, which are key resources in quantum communication, computation, and metrology. In this work, we propose a scheme to tailor these interactions by coupling driven atom pairs to optical cavity photons via a molecular state in the dispersive regime, resulting in an effective photon-field-dependent potential. As an illustrative example, by analyzing the quantum Fisher information, we show that such induced interactions can generate robust many-body entanglement in two-mode ultracold bosons in an optical cavity. By tuning the photon-induced interactions through the cavity drive, we identify conditions for preparing highly entangled states on timescales that mitigate decoherence due to photon loss. Our results show that entanglement formation rate scales strongly with both photon and atom number, dramatically reducing the timescale compared to bare atomic interactions. We also identify an optimal measurement for exploiting the metrological potential of the atomic state in an interferometric protocol with significant photon losses, saturating the quantum Cramer-Rao lower bound. Furthermore, we show that despite these losses the atomic state exhibits strong Bell correlations. Our results pave the way for engineering atom-atom interactions to study novel phases of light and matter in hybrid atom-photon systems, as well as for tailoring complex quantum states for new quantum technology protocols and fundamental tests of quantum mechanics.</description>

Our estimator attains the Cram\'{e}r-Rao type bound when the dimension $d$ is fixed. It also achieves the sample complexity $O(d^2)$ when the dimension $d$ increases. This sample complexity is optimal when $\sigma$ is the completely mixed state. Also, it has time complexity $O(d^6 \polylog d)$. Our proposed estimator unifiedly works under both settings.</description>

      <title>The single-photon steering and the quantum mechanical free-interaction measurement are identical phenomena</title>

Abstract: In this work, firstly, we propose how to experimentally demonstrate the single photon steering phenomenon in a simple way. The quantum steering phenomenon was discovered by Erwin Schrodinger, who reason that the laws of quantum mechanics obliges us to admit that by suitable measurements taken on one of two entangled system, then the state of the other system can be determined and steered. On the other hand, the first proposal about the nonlocal property of a single photon focus on showing the Bell nonlocality by using the single-photon path entanglement. Here, we propose a new experimental scheme that, by incorporating and manipulating the internal degree of freedom (IDF) of the photon, easily demonstrate the nonlocal steering phenomenon of single-photon's states. The experimental set-up that we propose differs from those published in the quantum optics' literature to shown the single photon nonlocality, which generally use the path entanglement of photons and homodyne measurements. Secondly, by incorporating its IDF, we show that the single photon steering and the quantum mechanical interaction-free measurement (QM-IFM) are identical phenomena; we will argue that QM-IFM is just a particular instance of the single-photon steering. In short, both the single photon steering and QM-IFM (being identical phenomena) have a common cause: the nonlocality of the wave function. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that it is possible to produce a nonlocal phenomena by manipulating the single photon internal degree of freedom. On the other hand, this unification between steering and QM-IFM could establish a strong support to counterfactual quantum communication and computation.</description>

Abstract: Microwave photons are important carriers of quantum information in many promising platforms for quantum computing. They can be routinely generated, controlled, and teleported in experiments, indicating a variety of applications in quantum technology. However, observation of quantum statistical properties of microwave photons remains demanding: The energy of several microwave photons is considerably smaller than the thermal fluctuation of any room-temperature detector, while amplification necessarily induces noise. Here, we present a measurement technique with a nanobolometer that directly measures the photon statistics at the millikelvin temperature and overcomes this trade-off. We apply our method to thermal states generated by a blackbody radiator operating in the regime of circuit quantum electrodynamics. We demonstrate the photon number resolvedness of the nanobolometer, and reveal the n(n+1)-scaling law of the photon number variance as indicated by the Bose--Einstein distribution. By engineering the coherent and incoherent proportions of the input field, we observe the transition between super-Poissonian and Poissonian statistics of the microwave photons from the bolometric second-order correlation measurement. This technique is poised to serve in fundamental tests of quantum mechanics with microwave photons and function as a scalable readout solution for a quantum information processor.</description>

      <title>Controlization Schemes Based on Orthogonal Arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09382v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Realizing controlled operations is fundamental to the design and execution of quantum algorithms. In quantum simulation and learning of quantum many-body systems, an important subroutine consists of implementing a controlled Hamiltonian time-evolution. Given only black-box access to the uncontrolled evolution $e^{-iHt}$, controlizing it, i.e., implementing $\mathrm{ctrl}(e^{-iHt}) = |0\rangle\langle 0|\otimes I + |1\rangle\langle 1 |\otimes e^{-iHt}$ is non-trivial. Controlization has been recently used in quantum algorithms for transforming unknown Hamiltonian dynamics [OKTM24] leveraging a scheme introduced in Refs. [NSM15, DNSM21]. The main idea behind the scheme is to intersperse the uncontrolled evolution with suitable operations such that the overall dynamics approximates the desired controlled evolution. Although efficient, this scheme uses operations randomly sampled from an exponentially large set. In the present work, we show that more efficient controlization schemes can be constructed with the help of orthogonal arrays for unknown 2-local Hamiltonians. We conduct a detailed analysis of their performance and demonstrate the resulting improvements through numerical experiments. This construction can also be generalized to $k$-local Hamiltonians. Moreover, our controlization schemes based on orthogonal arrays can take advantage of the interaction graph's structure and be made more efficient.</description>

Abstract: Uncertainty principle forbids one to determine which of the two paths a quantum system has travelled, unless interference between the alternatives had been destroyed by a measuring device, e.g., by a pointer. One can try to weaken the coupling between the device and the system, in order to avoid the veto. We demonstrate, however, that a weak pointer is at the same time an inaccurate one, and the information about the path taken by the system in each individual trial is inevitably lost. We show also that a similar problem occurs if a classical system is monitored by an inaccurate quantum meter. In both cases one can still determine some characteristic of the corresponding statistical ensemble, a relation between path probabilities in the classical case, and a relation between the probability amplitudes if a quantum system is involved.</description>

Abstract: Kostka, Littlewood-Richardson, Plethysm and Kronecker coefficients are the multiplicities of irreducible representations in the decomposition of representations of the symmetric group that play an important role in representation theory, geometric complexity and algebraic combinatorics. We give quantum algorithms for computing these coefficients whenever the ratio of dimensions of the representations is polynomial and study the computational complexity of this problem. We show that there is an efficient classical algorithm for computing the Kostka numbers under this restriction and conjecture the existence of an analogous algorithm for the Littlewood-Richardson coefficients. We argue why such classical algorithm does not straightforwardly work for the Plethysm and Kronecker coefficients and conjecture that our quantum algorithms lead to superpolynomial speedups for these problems. The conjecture about Kronecker coefficients was concurrently disproved by Greta Panova in [arXiv:2502.20253] with a classical solution which, if optimal, points to a $O(n^{4+2k})$ vs $\tilde{\Omega}(n^{4k^2+1})$ polynomial gap in quantum vs classcial computational complexity for an integer parameter $k$.</description>

      <title>Eigenstate Correlations in Dual-Unitary Quantum Circuits: Partial Spectral Form Factor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19929v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While the notion of quantum chaos is tied to random matrix spectral correlations, also eigenstate properties in chaotic systems are often assumed to be described by random matrix theory. Analytic insights into eigenstate correlations can be obtained by the recently introduced partial spectral form factor. Here, we study the partial spectral form factor in chaotic dual-unitary quantum circuits in the thermodynamic limit. We compute the latter for a finite subsystem in a brickwork circuit coupled to an infinite complement. For initial times, shorter than the subsystem's size, spatial locality and (dual) unitarity implies a constant partial spectral form factor, clearly deviating from the linear ramp of the random matrix prediction. In contrast, for larger times we prove, that the partial spectral form factor follows the random matrix result up to exponentially suppressed corrections. We supplement our exact analytical results by semi-analytic computations performed in the thermodynamic limit as well as with numerics for finite-size systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01770v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For Dirac particles interacting with external fields, we use the exact operator of the Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation obtained by Eriksen and rigorously derive a leading correction in the weak-field approximation to the known relativistic Foldy-Wouthuysen Hamiltonian. For this purpose, we carry out the operator extraction of a square root in the Eriksen operator. The derived correction is important for the scattering of relativistic particles. Since the description of this scattering by a relativistic wave equation of the second order is more convenient, we determine a general connection between relativistic wave equations of the first and second orders. For Dirac particles, the relativistic wave equation of the second order is obtained with a correction similar to that to the Foldy-Wouthuysen Hamiltonian.</description>

Abstract: Entanglement is essential for quantum information processing, but is limited by noise. We address this by developing high-yield entanglement distillation protocols with several advancements. (1) We extend the 2-to-1 recurrence entanglement distillation protocol to higher-rate n-to-(n-1) protocols that can correct any single-qubit errors. These protocols are evaluated through numerical simulations focusing on fidelity and yield. We also outline a method to adapt any classical error-correcting code for entanglement distillation, where the code can correct both bit-flip and phase-flip errors by incorporating Hadamard gates. (2) We propose a constant-depth decoder for stabilizer codes that transforms logical states into physical ones using single-qubit measurements. This decoder is applied to entanglement distillation protocols, reducing circuit depth and enabling protocols derived from high-performance quantum error-correcting codes. We demonstrate this by evaluating the circuit complexity for entanglement distillation protocols based on surface codes and quantum convolutional codes. (3) Our stabilizer entanglement distillation techniques advance quantum computing. We propose a fault-tolerant protocol for constant-depth encoding and decoding of arbitrary states in surface codes, with potential extensions to more general quantum low-density parity-check codes. This protocol is feasible with state-of-the-art reconfigurable atom arrays and surpasses the limits of conventional logarithmic depth encoders. Overall, our study integrates stabilizer formalism, measurement-based quantum computing, and entanglement distillation, advancing both quantum communication and computing.</description>

      <title>Subspace-thermal discrete time crystals from phase transitions between different n-tuple discrete time crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02848v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new Floquet time crystal model that responds in arbitrary multiples of the driving period. Such an $n$-tuple discrete time crystal is theoretically constructed by permuting spins in a disordered chain and is well suited for experimental implementations. Transitions between these time crystals with different periods give rise to a novel phase of matter that we call subspace-thermal discrete time crystals, where states within subspaces of definite charges are fully thermalized at an early time. However, the whole system still robustly responds to the periodic driving subharmonically, with a period being the greatest common divisor of the original two periods. Existing theoretical analysis from many-body localization cannot be used to understand the rigidity of such subspace-thermal time crystal phases. To resolve this, we develop a new theoretical framework for the robustness of DTCs from the perspective of the robust $2\pi/n$ quasi-energy gap. Its robustness is rigorously proved if the system satisfies a certain condition where the mixing length, defined by the Hamming distance of the symmetry charges, does not exceed a global threshold. The proof applies beyond the models considered here to other existing DTCs realized by kicking disordered systems, where conventional MBL-DTCs can be regarded as a special case of the subspace-thermal DTC with the subspace dimension being one, thus offering a systematic way to construct new discrete time crystal models. We also introduce the notion of DTC-charges that allow us to probe the observables that spontaneously break the time-translation symmetry in both the regular discrete time crystals and subspace-thermal discrete time crystals. Moreover, our discrete time crystal models can be generalized to systems with higher spin magnitudes or qudits, as well as to higher spatial dimensions.</description>

      <title>Uncovering Quantum Many-body Scars with Quantum Machine Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07405v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum many-body scars are rare eigenstates hidden within the chaotic spectra of many-body systems, representing a weak violation of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH). Identifying these scars, as well as other non-thermal states in complex quantum systems, remains a significant challenge. Besides exact scar states, the nature of other non-thermal states lacking simple analytical characterization remains an open question. In this study, we employ tools from quantum machine learning -- specifically, (enhanced) quantum convolutional neural networks (QCNNs), to explore hidden non-thermal states in chaotic many-body systems. Our simulations demonstrate that QCNNs achieve over 99% single-shot measurement accuracy in identifying all known scars. Furthermore, we successfully identify new non-thermal states in models such as the xorX model, the PXP model, and the far-coupling Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. In the xorX model, some of these non-thermal states can be approximately described as spin-wave modes of specific quasiparticles. We further develop effective tight-binding Hamiltonians within the quasiparticle subspace to capture key features of these many-body eigenstates. Finally, we validate the performance of QCNNs on IBM quantum devices, achieving single-shot measurement accuracy exceeding 63% under real-world noise and errors, with the aid of error mitigation techniques. Our results underscore the potential of QCNNs to uncover hidden non-thermal states in quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09840v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present work we explore nonclassical effects in the phase space of two superposed kitten states induced by photon addition and subtraction operations applied in different sequences. We investigate two scenarios: In the first, photon addition is applied to the state, followed by photon subtraction, while in the second, the order of operations is reversed. We demonstrate that applying multiphoton operations to the state results in notable nearly isotropic sub-Planck structures, with the characteristics of these structures being influenced by the photon addition and subtraction. Increasing the number of added photons compresses the sub-Planck structures in both cases. Photon subtraction, however, has the opposite effect on the sub-Planck structures in the first case and no effect in the second. Furthermore, we observe that the optimal choices of multiphoton operations lead to improved isotropy of sub-Planck structures in our cases. The presence of the sub-Planck structures in our states leads to improved sensitivity to displacements, exceeding the standard quantum limit, as verified across all the depicted scenarios.</description>

Abstract: Quantum sources with strong correlations are essential but delicate resources in quantum information science and engineering. Decoherence and loss are the primary factors that degrade nonclassical quantum correlations, with scattering playing a role in both processes. In this work, we present a method that leverages Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), a machine learning technique known for its effectiveness in time-series prediction, to mitigate the detrimental impact of scattering in quantum systems. Our setup involves generating two-mode squeezed light via four-wave mixing in warm rubidium vapor, with one mode subjected to a scatterer to disrupt quantum correlations. Mutual information and intensity-difference squeezing between the two modes are used as metrics for quantum correlations. We demonstrate a 74.7~\% recovery of mutual information and 87.7~\% recovery of two-mode squeezing, despite significant photon loss that would otherwise eliminate quantum correlations. This approach marks a significant step toward recovering quantum correlations from random disruptions without the need for hardware modifications, paving the way for practical applications of quantum protocols.</description>

Abstract: Quantum secret sharing is a cryptographic scheme that enables a secure storage and reconstruction of quantum information. While the theory of secret sharing is mature in its development, relatively few studies have explored the performance of quantum secret sharing on actual devices. In this work, we provide a pedagogical description of encoding and decoding circuits for different secret sharing codes, and we test their performance on IBM's 127-qubit Brisbane system. We evaluate the quality of implementation by performing a SWAP test between the decoded state and the ideal one, as well as by estimating how well the code preserves entanglement with a reference system. Results indicate that a ((3,5)) threshold secret sharing scheme performs slightly better overall than a ((5,7)) scheme based on the SWAP test, but is outperformed by the Steane Code scheme in regards to the entanglement fidelity. We also investigate one implementation of a ((2,3)) qutrit scheme and find that it performs the worst of all, which is expected due to the additional number of multi-qubit gate operations needed to encode and decode qutrits.</description>

Abstract: Digital signatures are a powerful cryptographic tool widely employed across various industries for securely authenticating the identity of a signer during communication between signers and verifiers. While quantum digital signatures have been extensively studied, the security still depends on a trusted third-party. To address this limitation and enhance the applicability in real-world scenarios, here we propose a novel quantum digital signature protocol without a trusted third-party to further improve the security. We note that a quantum one-way function can work appropriately in digital signature due to the intrinsic non-cloning property for quantum states. Secret keys in the protocol are constituted by classical private keys and quantum public keys because we assume that no user is trusted in the protocol. We prove that the protocol has information-theoretical unforgeability. Moreover, it satisfies other important secure properties, including asymmetry, undeniability, and expandability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14366v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe a simple quantum algorithm to simulate time-dependent Hamiltonian, extending the methodology of quantum signal processing. The framework achieves optimal scaling up to some factor with respect to other parameters, and nearly optimal in inverse of error tolerance, which could be improved to optimal scaling under certain input models. As applications, we discuss the problem of simulating generalized lattice system and time-periodic, or Floquet system, showing that our framework provides a neater yet highly efficient solution, achieving optimal/nearly optimal scaling in all parameters. In particular, our method also paves a new way for studying phase transition on quantum computer, extending the reach of quantum simulation.</description>

      <title>Processing and Decoding Rydberg Decay Error with MBQC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04664v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Achieving fault-tolerant quantum computing with neutral atom necessitates careful consideration of the errors inherent to this system. One typical error is the leakage from Rydberg states during the implementation of multi-qubit gates, which may propagate to multiple correlated errors and deteriorate the performance of error correction. To address this, researchers have proposed an erasure conversion protocol that employs fast leakage detection and continuous atomic replacement to convert leakage errors into benign erasure errors. While this method achieves a high threshold and a favorable error distance d_e = d, its applicability is restricted to certain atom species. In this work, we present a novel approach to manage Rydberg decay errors in measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC). From a hardware perspective, we utilize practical experimental techniques along with an adaptation of the Pauli twirling approximation (PTA) to mitigate the impacts of leakage error, which propagates similarly to Pauli error without degrading the error distance. From a decoding perspective, we leverage the inherent structure of topological cluster states and final leakage detection information to locate propagated errors from Rydberg decay error. This approach eliminates the need for mid-circuit leakage detection, while maintaining an error distance d_e = d and achieving a high threshold of 3.617(3)% per CZ gate for pure Rydberg decay. In the presence of additional Pauli errors, we demonstrate the performance of our protocol in logical error rate within a reasonable range of physical errors and draw a comparison with erasure conversion. The results show a comparable performance within a modest R_e, which reveals possible application of our method in near-term platform.</description>

      <title>Vacuum polarization in a one-dimensional effective quantum-electrodynamics model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07246v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the aim of progressing toward a practical implementation of an effective quantum-electrodynamics (QED) theory of atoms and molecules, which includes the effects of vacuum polarization through the creation of virtual electron-positron pairs but without the explicit photon degrees of freedom, we study a one-dimensional effective QED model of the hydrogen-like atom with delta-potential interactions. This model resembles the three-dimensional effective QED theory with Coulomb interactions while being substantially simpler. We provide some mathematical details about the definition of this model, calculate the vacuum-polarization density, and the Lamb-type shift of the bound-state energy, correcting and extending results of previous works. We also study the approximation of the model in a finite plane-wave basis, and in particular we discuss the basis convergence of the bound-state energy and eigenfunction, of the vacuum-polarization density, and of the Lamb-type shift of the bound-state energy. We highlight the difficulty of converging the vacuum-polarization density in a finite basis and we propose a way to improve it. The present work could give hints on how to perform similar calculations for the three-dimensional effective QED theory of atoms and molecules.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13471v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We characterize a class of superclassical non-Markovian open quantum system dynamics that are defined by their lack of measurement invasiveness when the corresponding observable commutates with the pre-measurement state. This diagonal non-invasiveness guarantees that joint probabilities for measurement outcomes fulfill classical Kolmogorov consistency conditions. These features are fulfilled regardless of the previous (measurement) system history and are valid at arbitrary later times after an arbitrary system initialization. It is shown that a subclass of depolarizing dynamics, which are based on a (time-irreversible) non-unitary system-environment coupling, satisfy the required properties. The relationship with other operational [Milz et al., Phys. Rev. X 10, 041049 (2020)] and non-operational [Banacki et al., Phys. Rev. A 107, 032202 (2023)] notions of classicality in non-Markovian open quantum systems is studied in detail and exemplified through different examples.</description>

      <title>Quantum Error Correction resilient against Atom Loss</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07841v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate quantum error correction protocols for neutral atoms quantum processors in the presence of atom loss. We complement the surface code with loss detection units (LDU) and analyze its performances by means of circuit-level simulations for two distinct protocols -- the standard LDU and a recently proposed teleportation-based LDU --, focussing on the impact of both atom loss and depolarizing noise on the logical error probability. We introduce and employ a new adaptive decoding procedure that leverages the knowledge of loss locations provided by the LDUs, improving logical error probabilities by nearly three orders of magnitude compared to a naive decoder. For the considered error models, our results demonstrate the existence of an error threshold line that depends linearly on the probabilities of atom loss and of depolarizing errors. For zero depolarizing noise, the atom loss threshold is about $2.6\%$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16514v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since the final quantum state in the Grover search algorithm is the normalized marked quantum state from the Gram-Schmidt process, Abrams and Lloyd[1] has shown that we can generate this vector by using a non-unitary gate. Following their ideas, in this paper, we present multiple explicit unitary implementations by using the square root of the non-unitary matrix and by a unitary matrix that mimics the Gram-Schmidt process. We also discuss the implementation through a linear combination of unitary matrices or similar methods and how these approximations may change the complexity. The reading of the marked element from the given circuits with high probability still requires multiple repetitions similar to the original algorithm. However, it gives an alternative implementations which may be useful in certain platforms.</description>

      <title>Probing Entanglement Scaling Across a Quantum Phase Transition on a Quantum Computer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18602v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The investigation of strongly-correlated quantum matter is difficult due to the curse of dimensionality and intricate entanglement structures. These challenges are particularly pronounced in the vicinity of continuous quantum phase transitions, where quantum fluctuations manifest across all length scales. While quantum simulators give controlled access to a number of strongly correlated systems, the study of critical phenomena has been hampered by finite-size effects arising from diverging correlation lengths. Moreover, the experimental investigation of entanglement in many-body systems has been hindered by limitations in measurement protocols. To address these challenges, we employ the multiscale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA) and implement a holographic scheme for subsystem tomography on a fully-connected trapped-ion quantum computer. Our method accurately represents infinite systems and long-range correlations with few qubits, facilitating the efficient extraction of observables and entanglement properties, even at criticality. We observe a quantum phase transition with spontaneous symmetry breaking and reveal the evolution of entanglement properties across the critical point. For the first time, we demonstrate log-law scaling of subsystem entanglement entropies at criticality on a digital quantum computer. This achievement highlights the potential of MERA for the investigation of strongly-correlated many-body systems on quantum computers.</description>

      <title>A simple model for entangled photon generation in resonant structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05516v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ability to engineer pairs of entangled photons is essential to quantum information science, and generating these states using spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) in nano- and micrometer-scale materials offers numerous advantages. To properly engineer such sources, a reliable model describing nano- and micrometer-scale SPDC is necessary; however, such a theoretical description remains a challenge. Here, we propose and derive a simplified model to describe SPDC in resonant structures, which considers the generation of photon pairs and the resonant enhancement of spectral bands to be separate processes, even though they actually occur simultaneously. We compare our simplified model to both the rigorous theory of SPDC in an etalon - a simple example of a resonant structure - and our experiments on SPDC in etalons and find agreement for low-gain SPDC. By simplifying the calculations required to generate photon pairs, our model promises to make designing complex resonant structures easier, and it promises to hasten the iteration of designs across the field of quantum state engineering.</description>

      <title>Probing the Quantum Nature of Gravity through Classical Diffusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13030v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The question of whether gravity is fundamentally quantum remains one of the most profound open problems in modern physics. A recently explored approach consists in testing gravity's ability to entangle quantum systems, which requires preparing and controlling large-mass quantum states-a formidable experimental challenge. We propose an alternative strategy that circumvents the need for quantum state engineering. We show that if gravity is classical in the sense of being a local operation and classical communication (LOCC) channel, it must necessarily introduce diffusion in the motion of quantum systems. We derive the master equation governing this diffusive dynamics and establish a lower bound on the noise that any classical gravitational interaction must induce. Next, we outline an experimental protocol based on a high-precision torsion pendulum at millikelvin temperatures, showing that the predicted diffusion, if present, is in principle detectable with near-term technology. Our approach offers a novel route to testing the classical vs quantum nature of gravity without requiring macroscopic quantum superpositions or high control of the quantum state of the system, significantly reducing the experimental complexity.</description>

      <title>Packaged Quantum States in Field Theory: No Partial Factorization, Multi-Particle Packaging, and Hybrid Gauge-Invariant Entanglement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00766v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that quantum field excitations can generate packaged entangled states, in which all internal quantum numbers (IQNs) (e.g., electric charge, flavor, and color) are inseparably entangled and constrained to irreducible representation (irrep) blocks. This is a consequence of local gauge invariance and superselection rules. The confinement restricts the net gauge charge to a single superselection sector, thereby excluding cross-sector superpositions but allowing entanglement within one sector. We establish theorems that: \textbf{(1)} Explain how these packaged entangled states naturally arise from quantum field excitations, \textbf{(2)} Show how they remain gauge invariant or transform covariantly within a fixed net-charge sector, and \textbf{(3)} Illustrate how external degrees of freedom (DOFs) (e.g., spin or momentum) can combine with packaged internal charges to yield gauge-invariant entanglement. Finally, we show that spin or momentum measurements on these hybrid states induce a collapse of the internal entanglement.</description>

      <title>Solving the encoding bottleneck: of the HHL algorithm, by the HHL algorithm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13534v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL) algorithm offers exponential speedup for solving the quantum linear-system problem. But some caveats for the speedup could be hard to met. One of the difficulties is the encoding bottleneck, i.e., the efficient preparation of the initial quantum state. To prepare an arbitrary $N$-dimensional state exactly, existing state-preparation approaches generally require a runtime of $O(N)$, which will ruin the speedup of the HHL algorithm. Here we show that the states can be prepared approximately with a runtime of $O(poly(\log N))$ by employing a slightly modified version of the HHL algorithm itself. Thus, applying this approach to prepare the initial state of the original HHL algorithm can preserve the exponential speedup advantage. It can also serve as a standalone solution for other applications demanding fast state preparation.</description>

      <title>Noise Mitigation in Single Microwave Photon Counting by Cascaded Quantum Measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14804v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While single-photon counting is routinely achieved in the optical domain, operational single microwave photon detectors (SMPDs) have only recently been demonstrated. SMPDs are critical for sensing weak signals from incoherent emitters, with applications ranging from the detection of individual electron spins and dark-matter candidates to advancements in hybrid quantum devices and superconducting quantum computing. These detectors offer a substantial advantage over quantum-limited amplification schemes by bypassing the standard quantum limit for power detection, therefore further reductions in their intrinsic noise are essential for advancing quantum sensing at microwave frequencies. Several SMPD designs utilize the state of a superconducting qubit to encode the detection of an itinerant photon, and rely on a non-destructive photon-qubit interaction. Here, we leverage this Quantum-Non-Demolition feature by repeatedly measuring the impinging photon with cascaded Four-Wave-Mixing processes and encoding the detection on several qubits. This cascaded detector mitigates the intrinsic local noise of individual qubits, achieving a two-order-of-magnitude reduction in intrinsic detector noise at the cost of halving the efficiency. We report an intrinsic sensitivity of $8(1)\times10^{-24}\text{W}/\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$, with an operational sensitivity of $5.9(6)\times 10^{-23}\text{W}/\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ limited by thermal photons in the input line.</description>

Abstract: This paper is a general introduction to the t\={u}Q toolchain (https://github.com/QSI-BAQS/tuQ) and a discussion of its two main workflows, 'reduce and optimise' and 'draft and compile'. The t\={u}Q toolchain was designed to advance research in cluster-state computing and the workflows are presented as suggestions for how a researcher might use the tool. The two modes of t\={u}Q are Modeller and Simulator. Simulator mode has a tile-based syntax for drafting cluster-state algorithms. Modeller enables the user to reduce a lattice through preset measurement functions and optimise an algorithm by minimising the count of qubits or the count of controlled-Z ('CZ') interactions. In addition, t\={u}Q makes it possible to compile an algorithm to OpenQASM 3.0.</description>

      <title>Genuine Quantum effects in Dicke-type Models at large atom numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03396v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the occurrence of genuine quantum effects and beyond mean-field physics in the balanced and unbalanced open Dicke model with a large, yet finite number of atoms $N$. Such driven and dissipative quantum many-body systems have recently been realized in experiments involving ultracold gases inside optical cavities and are known to obey mean-field predictions in the thermodynamic limit $N\to\infty$. Here we show quantum effects that survive for large but finite $N$, by employing a novel open-system dynamics method that allows us to obtain numerically exact quantum dynamical results for atom numbers up to a mesoscopic $N\approx 1000$. While we find that beyond-mean-field effects vanish quickly with increasing $N$ in the balanced Dicke model, we are able to identify parameter regimes in the unbalanced Dicke model that allow genuine quantum effects to persist even for mesoscopic $N$. They manifest themselves in a strong squeezing of the steady state and a modification of the steady-state phase diagram that cannot be seen in a mean-field description. This is due to the fact that the steady-state limit $t\rightarrow \infty$ and thermodynamic limit $N\rightarrow \infty$ do not commute.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the random Schr\"odinger equation, with a noise term given by a random Hermitian matrix as a means to model noisy quantum systems. We derive bounds on the error of the synthesised unitary in terms of bounds on the norm of the noise, and show that for certain noise processes these bounds are tight. We then show that in certain situations, minimising the error is equivalent to finding a geodesic on SU (n) with respect to a Riemannian metric encoding the coupling between the control pulse and the noise process. Our work thus extends the series of seminal papers by Nielsen et al. on the geometry of quantum gate complexity.</description>

Abstract: Quantum spin glasses form a good testbed for studying the performance of various quantum annealing and optimization algorithms. In this work we show how two- and three-dimensional tensor networks can accurately and efficiently simulate the quantum annealing dynamics of Ising spin glasses on a range of lattices. Such dynamics were recently simulated using D-Wave's Advantage$2$ system [arXiv:2403.00910] and, following extensive comparison to existing numerical methods, claimed to be beyond the reach of classical computation. Here we show that by evolving lattice-specific tensor networks with simple belief propagation to keep up with the entanglement generated during the time evolution and then extracting expectation values with more sophisticated variants of belief propagation, state-of-the-art accuracies can be reached with modest computational resources. The scalability of our simulations allows us to verify the universal physics present in the system and extract a value for the associated Kibble-Zurek exponent which agrees with recent values obtained in literature. Our results demonstrate that tensor networks are a viable approach for simulating large scale quantum dynamics in two and three dimensions on classical computers, and algorithmic advancements are expected to expand their applicability going forward.</description>

      <title>Emergence of synchronisation in a driven-dissipative hot Rydberg vapor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.05188v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We observe synchronisation in a thermal (35-60 {\deg}C) atomic (Rb) ensemble driven to a highly-excited Rydberg state (principle quantum number n ranging from 43 to 79). Synchronisation in this system is unexpected due to the atomic motion, however, we show theoretically that sufficiently strong interactions via a global Rydberg density mean field causes frequency and phase entrainment. The emergent oscillations in the vapor's bulk quantities are detected in the transmission of the probe laser for a two-photon excitation scheme.</description>

      <title>Feshbach Resonances in Exciton-Charge-Carrier Scattering in Semiconductor Bilayers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.08729v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Feshbach resonances play a vital role in the success of cold atoms investigating strongly-correlated physics. The recent observation of their solid-state analog in the scattering of holes and intralayer excitons in transition metal dichalcogenides [Schwartz et al., Science 374, 336 (2021)] holds compelling promise for bringing fully controllable interactions to the field of semiconductors. Here, we demonstrate how tunneling-induced layer hybridization can lead to the emergence of two distinct classes of Feshbach resonances in atomically thin semiconductors. Based on microscopic scattering theory we show that these two types of Feshbach resonances allow to tune interactions between electrons and both short-lived intralayer, as well as long-lived interlayer excitons. We predict the exciton-electron scattering phase shift from first principles and show that the exciton-electron coupling is fully tunable from strong to vanishing interactions. The tunability of interactions opens the avenue to explore Bose-Fermi mixtures in solid-state systems in regimes that were previously only accessible in cold atom experiments.</description>

      <title>Probing quantum properties of black holes with a Floquet-driven optical lattice simulator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14058v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the curved spacetime of a black hole, quantum physics gives rise to distinctive effects such as Hawking radiation and maximally fast scrambling. Here, we present a scheme for an analogue quantum simulation of (1 + 1) and (2 + 1)-dimensional black holes using ultracold atoms in a locally Floquet-driven optical lattice. We show how the effective dynamics of the driven system can generate position-dependent tunnelling amplitudes that encode the curved geometry of the black hole. Moreover, we provide a simple and robust scheme to determine the Hawking temperature of a (1+1)D simulated black hole based solely on on-site atom population measurements. Combined with the highly tunable onsite atom-atom interactions typical for cold atoms, our simulator provides a powerful and feasible platform to probe the scrambling of quantum information in black holes. We illustrate the ergodicity of our (2+1)D black-hole simulator by showing numerically that its level statistics in the hard-core limit approaches the ergodic regime faster than a globally homogeneous Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Exact time-evolving scattering states in open quantum-dot systems with an interaction: Discovery of time-evolving resonant states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10251v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study exact time-evolving many-electron states of an open double quantum-dot system with an interdot Coulomb interaction. A systematic construction of the time-evolving states for arbitrary initial conditions is proposed. For any initial states of one- and two-electron plane waves on the electrical leads, we obtain exact solutions of the time-evolving scattering states, which converge to known stationary scattering eigenstates in the long-time limit. For any initial states of localized electrons on the quantum dots, we find exact time-evolving states of a new type, which we refer to as time-evolving resonant states. In contrast to stationary resonant states, whose wave functions spatially diverge and not normalizable, the time-evolving resonant states are normalizable since their wave functions are restricted to a finite space interval due to causality. The exact time-evolving resonant states enable us to calculate the time-dependence of the survival probability of electrons on the quantum dots for the system with the linearized dispersions. It decays exponentially in time on one side of an exponential point of resonance energies while, on the other side, it oscillates during the decay as a result of the interference of the two resonance energies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04125v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the particle creation of a harmonic oscillator using the classical stochastic method. This recently constructed method reproduces all the vacuum expectation values in quantum theory. We prepare the vacuum state at the initial time and evolve it over time using Langevin equations of motion. By averaging over the ensemble, we compute the energy of the state at the final time and determine the amount of particles created. We verify that the particle creation agrees with predictions from quantum theory and thus give an evidence that this method can really compute the quantum dynamics.</description>

      <title>Detecting kHz gravitons from a neutron star merger with a multi-mode resonant mass detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16898v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a multi-mode bar consisting of mass elements of decreasing size for the implementation of a gravitational version of the photo-electric effect through the stimulated absorption of up to kHz gravitons from a binary neutron star merger and post-merger. We find that the multi-mode detector has normal modes that retain the coupling strength to the gravitational wave of the largest mass-element, while only having an effective mass comparable to the mass of the smallest element. This allows the normal modes to have graviton absorption rates due to the tonne-scale largest mass, while the single graviton absorption process in the normal mode could be resolved through energy measurements of a mass-element in-principle smaller than pico-gram scale. We argue the feasibility of directly counting gravito-phonons in the bar through energy measurements of the end mass. This improves the transduction of the single-graviton signal, enhancing the feasibility of detecting single gravitons.</description>

      <title>Localization and entanglement characterization of edge states in HgTe quantum wells in a finite strip geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12469v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum information measures are proposed to analyze the structure of near-gap electronic states in HgTe quantum wells in a strip geometry $(x,y)\in (-\infty,\infty)\times [0,L]$ of finite width $L$. This allows us to establish criteria for distinguishing edge from bulk states in the topological insulator phase, including the transition region and cutoff of the wave number $k_x$ where edge states degenerate with bulk states. Qualitative and quantitative information on the near-gap Hamiltonian eigenstates, obtained by tight-binding calculations, is extracted from localization measures, like the inverse participation ratio (IPR), and entanglement entropies of the reduced density matrix (RDM) to the spin sector, measuring quantum correlations due to the spin-orbit coupling (SOC). The analysis of IPR and entanglement entropies in terms of spin, wave number $k_x$ and position $y$, evidences a spin polarization structure and spatial confinement of near-gap wave functions at the boundaries $y=0,L$ and low $k_x$, as correspond to helical edge states. IPR localization measures provide momentum $k_x$ cutoffs from which near-gap states are no longer localized at the boundaries of the sample and become part of the bulk. Below this $k_x$-point cutoff, the entanglement entropy and the spin probabilities of the RDM also capture the spin polarization structure of edge states and exhibit a higher variability compared to the relatively low entropy of the bulk state region.</description>

Abstract: We generalize the generalized Arimoto-Blahut algorithm to a general function defined over Bregman-divergence system. In existing methods, when linear constraints are imposed, each iteration needs to solve a convex minimization. Exploiting our obtained algorithm, we propose a minimization-free-iteration algorithm. This algorithm can be applied to classical and quantum rate-distortion theory. We numerically apply our method to the derivation of the optimal conditional distribution in the rate-distortion theory.</description>

      <title>Tracking the variation of entanglement R\'enyi negativity: a quantum Monte Carlo study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10273v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Entanglement entropy has been a powerful tool for analyzing phases and criticality in pure ground states via quantum Monte Carlo (QMC). However, mixed-state entanglement, relevant to systems with dissipation, finite temperature, and disjoint regions, remains less explored due to the lack of efficient numerical methods. In this work, we present a practical and easy-to-implement QMC method within the reweight-annealing framework, enabling efficient computation of the entanglement R\'enyi negativity (RN) by tracking its variation along given parameter paths. This method is scalable, parallelizable, and well-suited for high-dimensional and large-scale simulations. Applying it to diverse scenarios-including 1D and 2D systems, ground and thermal states, and bipartite and tripartite partitions, not only the information of the underlying conformal field theory is achieved, but the role of entanglement in quantum and thermal phase transitions is revealed.</description>

      <title>(SPT-)LSM theorems from projective non-invertible symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18113v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Projective symmetries are ubiquitous in quantum lattice models and can be leveraged to constrain their phase diagram and entanglement structure. In this paper, we investigate the consequences of projective algebras formed by non-invertible symmetries and lattice translations in a generalized $1+1$D quantum XY model based on group-valued qudits. This model is specified by a finite group $G$ and enjoys a projective $\mathsf{Rep}(G)\times Z(G)$ and translation symmetry, where symmetry operators obey a projective algebra in the presence of symmetry defects. For invertible symmetries, such projective algebras imply Lieb-Schultz-Mattis (LSM) anomalies. However, this is not generally true for non-invertible symmetries, and we derive a condition on $G$ for the existence of an LSM anomaly. When this condition is not met, we prove an SPT-LSM theorem: any unique and gapped ground state is necessarily a non-invertible weak symmetry protected topological (SPT) state with non-trivial entanglement, for which we construct an example fixed-point Hamiltonian. The projectivity also affects the dual symmetries after gauging $\mathsf{Rep}(G)\times Z(G)$ sub-symmetries, giving rise to non-Abelian and non-invertible dipole symmetries, as well as non-invertible translations. We complement our analysis with the SymTFT, where the projectivity causes it to be a topological order non-trivially enriched by translations. Throughout the paper, we develop techniques for gauging $\mathsf{Rep}(G)$ symmetry and inserting its symmetry defects on the lattice, which are applicable to other non-invertible symmetries.</description>

      <title>Physical aspects of symmetry breaking in non-interacting Bose gases at thermal equilibrium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10893v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The theory of non-interacting Bose gases is supplemented by a numerical quantum field description with a two-dimensional non-local order parameter that allows the modeling of wave-like atomic correlations and interference effects in the limit of low atomic densities. From the present model, it is possible to explain certain new fundamental symmetry aspects of ideal and very weakly interacting Bose gases in the limit of fluctuating particle numbers, like the forward propagation of time and the relation to the breaking and preservation of phase gauge symmetry in solids. In the present formalism, the propagation of one-directional time arises from the pre-defined and equivalent convergence of independent quantum fields towards the Boltzmann equilibrium, and it is shown that Glauber coherent states are related to the definition of the quantized field. Coherently coupling condensate and non-condensate parts as a direct consequence of the increasing quantum coherence time between the different quantum field components in the Bose gas from cooling to below the critical temperature, the present model describes symmetry breaking, which is originally known from the definition of a specific gauge field from Elitzur's theorem for local gauge fields, as a global physical rather than a purely formal mathematical process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21062v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Relative entropy is a non-negative quantity and offers a powerful means of achieving a unified understanding of fundamental properties in physics, including the second law of thermodynamics and positivity bounds on effective field theories (EFTs). We analyze the relative entropy in scalar field theories and show that the non-negativity of relative entropy is potentially violated in perturbative calculations based on operator and loop expansions. Conversely, this suggests that the consistency of the EFT description in the scalar field theory can be identified by the sign of the relative entropy. In fact, we revisit an EFT of single-field inflation and present a relation between its non-linear parameter $f_{\rm NL}$ and the consistency condition of the EFT description derived from the relative entropy method. We find that interesting regions of $f_{\rm NL}$ that are observationally allowed can be constrained from the relative entropy by imposing the consistency of the EFT description when the EFT is generated via the interaction with heavy fields in UV theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22628v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Thermodynamic force and irreversible current are the foundational concepts of classical nonequilibrium thermodynamics. Entropy production rate is provided by their product in classical systems, ranging from mesoscopic to macroscopic systems. However, there is no complete quantum extension of such a structure that respects quantum mechanics. In this paper, we propose anti-Hermitian operators that represent currents and forces accompanied by a gradient structure in open quantum systems described by the quantum master equation. We prove that the entropy production rate is given by the product of the force and current operators, which extends the canonical expression of the entropy production rate in the classical systems. The framework constitutes a comprehensive analogy with the nonequilibrium thermodynamics of discrete classical systems. We also show that the structure leads to the extensions of some results in stochastic thermodynamics: the geometric housekeeping-excess decomposition of entropy production and thermodynamic trade-off relations such as the thermodynamic uncertainty relation and the dissipation-time uncertainty relation. In discussing the trade-off relations, we will introduce a measure of fluctuation, which we term the quantum diffusivity.</description>

Abstract: The Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix, which controls flavor mixing between the three generations of quark fermions, is a key input to the Standard Model of particle physics. In this paper, we identify a surprising connection between quantum entanglement and the degree of quark mixing. Focusing on a specific limit of $2 \to 2$ quark scattering mediated by electroweak bosons, we find that the quantum entanglement generated by scattering is minimized when the CKM matrix is almost (but not exactly) diagonal, in qualitative agreement with observation. With the discovery of neutrino masses and mixings, additional angles are needed to parametrize the Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata (PMNS) matrix in the lepton sector. Applying the same logic, we find that quantum entanglement is minimized when the PMNS matrix features two large angles and a smaller one, again in qualitative agreement with observation, plus a hint for suppressed CP violation. We speculate on the (unlikely but tantalizing) possibility that minimization of quantum entanglement might be a fundamental principle that determines particle physics input parameters.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11294v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Numerous challenges persist in High Energy Physics (HEP), the addressing of which requires advancements in detection technology, computational methods, data analysis frameworks, and phenomenological designs. We provide a concise yet comprehensive overview of recent progress across these areas, in line with advances in quantum technology. We will discuss the potential of quantum devices in detecting subtle effects indicative of new physics beyond the Standard Model, the transformative role of quantum algorithms and large-scale quantum computers in studying real-time non-perturbative dynamics in the early universe and at colliders, as well as in analyzing complex HEP data. Additionally, we emphasize the importance of integrating quantum properties into HEP experiments to test quantum mechanics at unprecedented high-energy scales and search for hints of new physics. Looking ahead, the continued integration of resources to fully harness these evolving technologies will enhance our efforts to deepen our understanding of the fundamental laws of nature.</description>

      <title>Semiclassical Backreaction: A Qualitative Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19825v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The backreaction of quantum degrees of freedom on classical backgrounds is a poorly understood topic in theoretical physics. Most often it is treated within the semiclassical approximation with the help of various ad hoc prescriptions accounting for the effect of quantum excitations on the dynamics of the background. We focus on two popular ones: (i) the mean-field approximation whereby quantum degrees of freedom couple to the classical background via their quantum expectation values; (ii) the (stochastic) Truncated Wigner method whereby the fully coupled system is evolved using classical equations of motion for various randomly sampled initial conditions of the quantum degree of freedom, and a statistical average is performed a posteriori. We evaluate the performance of each method in a simple toy model against a fully quantum mechanical treatment, and identify its regime of validity. We interpret the results in terms of quantum entanglement and loss of classicality of the background.</description>

      <title>Sulfur in diamond and its effect on the creation of nitrogen-vacancy defect from \textit{ab initio} simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16310v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center is one of the most significant and widely studied defects in diamond that plays a prominent role in quantum technologies. The precise engineering of the location and concentration of NV centers is of great importance in quantum technology applications. To this end, irradiation techniques such as nitrogen-molecule ion implantation are applied. Recent studies have reported enhanced NV center creation and activation efficiencies introduced by nitrogen molecule ion implantation in doped diamond layers, where the maximum creation efficiency at $\sim75$\% has been achieved in sulfur-doped layers. However, the microscopic mechanisms behind these observations and the limits of the efficiencies are far from understood. In this study, we employ hybrid density functional theory calculations to compute the formation energies, charge transition levels, and the magneto-optical properties of various sulfur defects in diamond where we also consider the interaction of sulfur and hydrogen in chemical vapor-deposited diamond layers. Our results imply that the competition between the donor substitutional sulfur and the hyper-deep acceptor sulfur-vacancy complex is an important limiting factor on the creation efficiency of the NV center in diamond. However, both species are able to trap interstitial hydrogen from diamond, which favorably mediates the creation of NV centers in chemical vapor-deposited diamond layers.</description>

      <title>The $S=\frac{1}{2}$ XY and XYZ models on the two or higher dimensional hypercubic lattice do not possess nontrivial local conserved quantities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18504v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the $S=\frac{1}{2}$ quantum spin system on the $d$-dimensional hypercubic lattice with $d\ge2$ with uniform nearest-neighbor interaction of the XY or XYZ type and arbitrary uniform magnetic field. By extending the method recently developed for quantum spin chains, we prove that the model possesses no local conserved quantities except for the trivial ones, such as the Hamiltonian. This result strongly suggests that the model is non-integrable. We note that our result applies to the XX model without a magnetic field, which is one of the easiest solvable models in one dimension.</description>

      <title>Black Hole Waterfall: a unitary phenomenological model for black hole evaporation with Page curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00948v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a unitary phenomenological model for black hole evaporation based on the analogy of the laboratory process of spontaneous parametric down conversion (SPDC) when the black hole (pump) is allowed to deplete to zero mass. The model incorporates an additional new feature that allows for the interior Hawking partner-particles (idlers) behind the horizon to further generate new Hawking particle pairs of lower energy, one of which remains behind the horizon, and the other that adds to the externally emitted Hawking radiation (signals) outside the horizon. This model produces a Page curve for the evolution of the reduced density matrices for the evaporating black hole internal degrees of freedom entangled with the generated Hawking radiation pairs entangled across the horizon. The Page curve yields an entropy that rises at early times during the evaporation process as Hawking pairs are generated, reaches a peak midway through the evolution, and then decays to zero upon complete evaporation of the black hole. The entire system remains in a pure state at all times undergoing unitary (squeezed state) evolution, with the initial state of the black hole modeled as a bosonic Fock state of large, but finite number $n_{p0}$ of particles. For the final state of the system, the black hole reaches the vacuum state of zero mass, while the external Hawking radiation carries away the total energy of the initial black hole. Inside the horizon there remains $n_{p0}$ Hawking partner-particles of vanishingly small total energy, reminiscent of the "soft-hair" (zero energy) qubit model of Hotta, Nambu and Yamaguchi, but now from a Hamiltonian for squeezed state generation perspective. The model presented here can be readily extended to encompass arbitrary initial pure states for the black hole, and in falling matter.</description>

      <title>Constraints from Entanglement Wedge Nesting for Holography at a Finite Cutoff</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15024v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore constraints that arise from associating an entanglement wedge (EW) to subregions of a cutoff boundary at a finite distance in AdS/CFT, using a subcritical end-of-the-world (ETW) brane acting as a cutoff. In particular, we consider the case of two intervals in the holographic dual to a BCFT, with one interval $A$ located at the asymptotic boundary and the second interval $B$ located on the ETW brane. We discuss in detail subtleties that arise near the RT end-points when defining the EW for this configuration, particularly in the connected phase. Entanglement wedge nesting (EWN) requires that $\mathcal{W}_E(A) \cup \mathcal{W}_E(B) \subseteq \mathcal{W}_E(A\cup B)$. We demonstrate that already in the simplest example of an AdS$_3$ bulk geometry, EWN can be violated even if $A$ and $B$ are spacelike separated through the bulk and instead we must require the stronger condition that $\mathcal{W}_E(A)$ be spacelike separated from $\mathcal{W}_E(B)$, which highlights the non-local nature of the cutoff theory. Our prescription to associate EWs to subregions on the ETW brane is different from the restricted maximin procedure in arXiv:2008.07022 but will agree within the subset of parameter space where EWN is respected. Additionally, we study EWN in a two sided BTZ black hole geometry with an ETW brane in one of the exteriors. In the BTZ black hole example we find that our condition for EWN disallows configurations where the RT surface goes from the brane to the black hole singularity.</description>

      <title>Engineering high Pockels coefficients in thin-film strontium titanate for cryogenic quantum electro-optic applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14349v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Materials which exhibit the Pockels effect are notable for their strong electro-optic interaction and rapid response times and are therefore used extensively in classical electro-optic components for data and telecommunication applications. Yet many materials optimized for room-temperature operation see their Pockels coefficients at cryogenic temperatures significantly reduced - a major hurdle for emerging quantum technologies which have even more rigorous demands than their classical counterpart. A noted example is $\mathrm{BaTiO_3}$, which features the strongest effective Pockels coefficient at room temperature, only to see it reduced to a third (i.e. $\mathrm{r_{eff}} \approx$ 170 pm/V) at a few Kelvin. Here, we show that this behaviour is not inherent and can even be reversed: Strontium titanate ($\mathrm{SrTiO_3}$), a material normally not featuring a Pockels coefficient, can be engineered to exhibit an $\mathrm{r_{eff}}$ of 345 pm/V at cryogenic temperatures - a record value in any thin-film electro-optic material. By adjusting the stoichiometry, we can increase the Curie temperature and realise a ferroelectric phase that yields a high Pockels coefficient, yet with limited optical losses - on the order of decibels per centimetre. Our findings position $\mathrm{SrTiO_3}$ as one of the most promising materials for cryogenic quantum photonics applications.</description>

      <title>An experimental platform for levitated mechanics in space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17108v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conducting levitated mechanical experiments in extreme conditions has long been the aim of researchers, as it allows for the investigation of new fundamental physics phenomena. One of the great frontiers has been sending these experiments into the micro-g environment of space, with multiple proposals calling for such a platform. At the same time, levitated sensors have demonstrated a high sensitivity to external stimuli which will only improve in low-vibrational conditions. conditions This paper describes the development of a technology demonstrator for optical and magnetic trapping experiments in space. Our payload represents the first concrete step towards future missions with aims of probing fundamental physical questions: matter-wave interferometry of nanoparticles to probe the limits of macroscopic quantum mechanics, detection of Dark Matter candidates and gravitational waves to test physics beyond the Standard Model, and accelerometry for Earth-observation.</description>

      <title>Formation of Complex Discrete Time Crystals with Ultracold Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18613v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study discrete time crystal formation in a system driven periodically by an oscillating atomic mirror, consisting of two distinct ultracold atomic clouds in the presence of a gravitational field. The intra-species interactions are weak and attractive, while the inter-species interactions are infinitely strong and repulsive. The clouds are arranged in a one-dimensional stack, where the bottom cloud bounces on an oscillating atomic mirror, which effectively acts as a driving force for the upper cloud due to the infinite inter-species repulsion. Using a Jastrow-like variational ansatz for the many-body wavefunction, we show that sufficiently strong attractive intra-species interactions drive each subsystem to spontaneously break discrete time translation symmetry, resulting in the formation of a complex discrete time crystal evolving with a period different than the driving period. Since the bottom cloud serves as the effective periodic driving for the upper cloud, this leads to a cascade of spontaneous symmetry breaking. With increasing intra-species interactions, we first observe a pronounced effect of spontaneous time translation symmetry breaking in the upper cloud, followed by a similar effect in the lower atomic cloud.</description>

      <title>Local Quenches from a Krylov Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19485v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate local quench dynamics in two-dimensional conformal field theories using Krylov space methods. We derive Lanczos coefficients, spread complexity, and Krylov entropies for local joining and splitting quenches in theories on an infinite line, a circle, a finite interval, and at finite temperature. We examine how these quantities depend on the central charge of the underlying conformal field theory and find that both spread complexity and Krylov entropy are proportional to it. Interestingly, Krylov entropies evolve logarithmically with time, mirroring standard entanglement entropies, making them useful for extracting the central charge. In the large central charge limit, using holography, we establish a connection between the rate of spread complexity and the proper momentum of the tip of the end-of-the world brane, which probes the bulk analogously to a point particle. Our results further demonstrate that spread complexity and Krylov entropies are powerful tools for probing non-equilibrium dynamics of interacting quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Leap into the future: shortcut to dynamics for quantum mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01447v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of the long-time dynamics of quantum systems can be a real challenge, especially in systems like ultracold gases, where the required timescales may be longer than the lifetime of the system
  itself. In this work, we show that it is possible to access the
  long-time dynamics of a strongly repulsive atomic gas mixture in
  shorter times. The shortcut-to-dynamics protocol that we propose
  does not modify the fate of the observables, but effectively jumps
  ahead in time without changing the system's inherent evolution. Just
  like the next-chapter button in a movie player that allows to quickly reach the part of the movie one wants to watch, it is a leap into the future.</description>
