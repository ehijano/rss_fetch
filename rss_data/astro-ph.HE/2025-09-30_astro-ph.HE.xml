      <title>JWST Spectroscopy of GRB 250702B: An Extremely Rare and Exceptionally Energetic Burst in a Dusty, Massive Galaxy at $z=1.036$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present follow-up observations of the day-long, repeating GRB 250702B with the Near Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) on board the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Through the identification of narrow hydrogen emission lines at a consistent redshift of $z = 1.036 \pm 0.004$, we calibrate the distance scale, and therefore the energetics, of this unique extragalactic transient. At this distance, the resulting $\gamma$-ray energy release is at least $E_{\gamma,\rm iso} = 2.2 \times 10^{54}$\,erg. We find no evidence for ongoing transient emission at the GRB position, and exclude any accompanying supernova with a luminosity comparable to the Type Ic broad-line SN 2023lcr, though we are unable to constrain fainter events. The inferred rate of such events, assuming at most one in the lifetime of {\em Fermi}, suggests that such bursts are very rare, with volumetric rates $&gt;1,000$ times lower than normal high luminosity long GRBs and $&gt; 10^5$ times lower than core collapse supernovae when corrected for beaming. Furthermore, we find that the host galaxy is unique amongst GRB host galaxies, and extremely rare in the general galaxy population, being extremely large, dusty and with high stellar mass. The identification of such an exotic GRB in such an unusual galaxy raises the possibility that the environment was important in the progenitor channel for this event.</description>

      <title>Ultra-long Gamma-ray Bursts from Micro-Tidal Disruption Events: The Case of GRB 250702B</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-long gamma-ray bursts (ULGRBs), a rare class of high-energy transients with durations $&gt;10^3$,s, remain poorly understood. GRB,250702B ($z=1.04$) is notable for its multi-hour prompt emission, an X-ray precursor $\sim$1 day earlier, off-nuclear host position, and hard, rapidly variable gamma-rays. This combination is difficult to explain with standard ULGRB progenitors such as blue-supergiant collapsars, magnetar engines, or white-dwarf tidal disruptions by intermediate-mass black holes. We interpret the event as a micro-tidal disruption event ($\mu$TDE), where a stellar-mass black hole or neutron star partially or fully disrupts a main-sequence star. Three $\mu$TDE pathways can reproduce the observed precursor-main flare delay: (i) a \emph{dynamical (partial/repeating)} disruption, in which a grazing passage yields a faint precursor and the core returns after $\sim$day for a deeper encounter; (ii) a \emph{natal-kick} disruption, where the delay reflects the ballistic motion of a newborn compact object relative to its companion, leading to full disruption; and (iii) a \emph{hybrid natal-kick + partial} case, in which the kick seeds the close encounter but the first passage is only partial, with the core returning on the day-scale period. Cross-section scalings imply comparable rates for partial and full outcomes in both dynamical and natal-kick scenarios. The highly variable, hard $\gamma$-ray emission supports association with a stellar-mass compact object. Fallback and viscous accretion naturally explain the ultra-long duration, energetics, and ks-scale X-ray variability. We outline observational discriminants between the three channels and argue that $\mu$TDEs offer a compelling framework for ULGRBs such as GRB 250702B.</description>

      <title>Optical/infrared observations of the extraordinary GRB 250702B: a highly obscured afterglow in a massive galaxy consistent with multiple possible progenitors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: GRB 250702B was the longest gamma-ray burst ever observed, with a duration that challenges standard collapsar models and suggests an exotic progenitor. We collected a rich set of optical and infrared follow-up observations of its rapidly fading afterglow using a suite of telescopes including the W. M. Keck Observatory, the Gemini telescopes, the Magellan Baade Telescope, the Victor M. Blanco 4-meter telescope, and the Fraunhofer Telescope at Wendelstein Observatory. Our analysis reveals that the afterglow emission is well described by forward shock emission from a highly obscured relativistic jet. Deep photometric observations of the host galaxy reveal a massive 10^10.66 solar masses, dusty, and extremely asymmetric system that is consistent with two galaxies undergoing a major merger. The galactocentric offset, host galaxy properties, and jet characteristics do not definitively distinguish between competing progenitor scenarios. We find that the afterglow and host are consistent with a range of progenitors including a collapsar, a merger between a helium star and a stellar mass black hole, the disruption of a star by a stellar mass compact object, and the tidal disruption of a star by an off-nuclear intermediate mass black hole.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive X-ray Observations of the Exceptional Ultra-long X-ray and Gamma-ray Transient GRB 250702B with Swift, NuSTAR, and Chandra: Insights from the X-ray Afterglow Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: GRB 250702B is an exceptional transient that produced multiple episodes of luminous gamma-ray radiation lasting for $&gt;25$ ks, placing it among the class of ultra-long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). However, unlike any known GRB, a soft X-ray precursor was discovered by the Einstein Probe up to 24 hours before the gamma-ray triggers. We present comprehensive X-ray observations of the transient's afterglow obtained with the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory, the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array, and the Chandra X-ray Observatory between 0.5 to 65 days (observer frame) after the initial high-energy trigger. The X-ray emission decays steeply as $\sim t^{-1.9}$, and shows short timescale X-ray variability ($\Delta T/T &lt; 0.03$) in both Swift and NuSTAR, consistent with flares superposed on an external shock continuum. Serendipitous detections by the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) out to $\sim$0.3 days and continued NuSTAR variability to $\sim$2 days imply sustained central engine activity; including the precursor, the required engine duration is $\gtrsim 3$ days. Afterglow modeling favors the combination of forward and reverse shock emission in a wind-like ($k \approx 2$) environment. These properties, especially the long-lived engine and soft X-ray precursor, are difficult to reconcile with a collapsar origin, and GRB 250702B does not fit neatly with canonical ultra-long GRBs or relativistic tidal disruption events (TDEs). A hybrid scenario in which a star is disrupted by a stellar-mass black hole (a micro-TDE) provides a plausible explanation, although a relativistic TDE from an intermediate-mass black hole remains viable. Decisive discrimination between progenitors will require sensitive late-time X-ray observations.</description>

      <title>GRB 250702B: Discovery of a Gamma-Ray Burst from a Black Hole Falling into a Star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts are the most luminous electromagnetic events in the universe. Their prompt gamma-ray emission has typical durations between a fraction of a second and several minutes. A rare subset of these events have durations in excess of a thousand seconds, referred to as ultra-long gamma-ray bursts. Here, we report the discovery of the longest gamma-ray burst ever seen with a ~25,000 s gamma-ray duration, GRB 250702B, and characterize this event using data from four instruments in the InterPlanetary Network and the Monitor of All-sky X-ray Image. We find a hard spectrum, subsecond variability, and high total energy, which are only known to arise from ultrarelativistic jets powered by a rapidly-spinning stellar-mass central engine. These properties and the extreme duration are together incompatible with all confirmed gamma-ray burst progenitors and nearly all models in the literature. This burst is naturally explained with the helium merger model, where a field binary ends when a black hole falls into a stripped star and proceeds to consume and explode it from within. Under this paradigm, GRB 250702B adds to the growing evidence that helium stars expand and that some ultra-long GRBs have similar evolutionary pathways as collapsars, stellar-mass gravitational wave sources, and potentially rare types of supernovae.</description>

      <title>Probing the origin of the X-ray and optical emission in the z=3.1 strongly lensed radio-quiet quasar GraL J065904.1+162909 to milliarcsecond resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform milliarcsecond X-ray astrometry of the quadruply lensed radio-quiet quasar GraL J065904.1+162909 (J0659). This z = 3.083 quasar is lensed into four images and was discovered with the second Data Release of the Gaia Space Observatory (Gaia DR2). The methodology of using gravitational lenses as high resolution telescopes has been applied, so far, to five lensed quasars (including J0659) and shows potential to elucidate the spatial origin of the X-ray and optical emitting regions in distant quasars. We use Gaia DR3 and HST observations of J0659 and infer a mass model for the deflector that reproduces the positions of the quasar lensed images to milliarcsecond precision. Next, we apply archival Chandra observations of J0659, together with our lens model, to conduct a Bayesian test evaluating whether the X-ray emitting region coincides with the optical source position predicted by our mass model. We constrain the origin of the X-ray emission to be within a 0.''030 x 0.''020 ellipse at the 99.7% level, finding the maximum possible distance between the X-ray and optical source is 44.7 milliarcseconds. Our methodology enhances Chandra's spatial resolution at high-z by a factor of 6. We provide a novel approach that extends the methodology towards investigating the origin of the soft and hard X-ray emitting regions in lensed quasars. We elaborate on the potential of upcoming broadband and spectrally resolved X-ray astrometric studies to probe complex quasar morphology at high-z and to identify dual and binary AGN candidates.</description>

      <title>Steady state of fast-oscillating neutrinos in an inhomogeneous medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The streaming of neutrinos in an inhomogeneous medium is known to affect the physics of flavor conversion. We employ an ensemble of single-crossed angular distributions and explore the physics of flavor conversion, while neutrinos propagate across a one-dimensional inhomogeneous medium. The advective term in the neutrino equations of motion is responsible for the cascade of flavor waves towards ever smaller spatial and angular scales. However, as the system evolves, perturbations with large wavenumbers are damped, with a resulting smearing of the flavor configuration. We provide a simple recipe that allows to forecast the steady-state flavor configuration achieved by neutrinos without solving their kinetic equations. In particular, we find that flavor equipartition on one side of the angular spectrum and the cancellation of the spectral crossing in the lepton number distributions, proposed in the literature as generic flavor outcome, is a special solution depending on the degree of neutrino-antineutrino asymmetry. This work constitutes a step forward towards the development of semi-analytic schemes to account for flavor conversion physics in hydrodynamic simulations of core-collapse supernovae and neutron-star merger remnants.</description>

      <title>Can GRB 250702B be explained as the tidal disruption of a white dwarf by an intermediate mass black hole? Yes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: GRB 250702B is a unique astrophysical transient characterised by its nature as a repeating gamma-ray trigger. Its properties include possible periodicity in its gamma-ray light curve, an X-ray counterpart that rose prior to the gamma-ray outbursts and faded quickly, and radio and infrared counterparts. These features are difficult to reconcile with most models of high energy transients but we show that they are compatible with a white dwarf bound to an intermediate mass black hole that is tidally stripped over multiple pericentre passages before being fully disrupted. Accretion onto the black hole powers a mildly relativistic jet that produces the X-rays through internal processes and the infrared and radio counterparts through thermal emission and external shocks respectively but is unable to produce the gamma-ray emission on its own. We propose that chaotic debris streams from the multiple stripping episodes can collide with a period roughly the same as the orbital period of the star. These shocks produce hard X-ray photons that are upscattered by the jet to produce the observed gamma-ray emission. Future analysis of the jet properties will allow us to place firmer constraints on our model.</description>

      <title>On the properties of turbulence in the remnant of Tycho supernova</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the turbulent structures in the Tycho supernova remnant (SNR) by applying two-point autocorrelation and power spectral analyses to high-resolution X-ray and radio images. Using cleaned Chandra and VLA data, we derive two-dimensional (2D) and one-dimensional (1D) autocorrelation functions and power spectra, revealing that the fluctuations in both X-ray brightness (approximately tracing plasma density) and radio brightness (tracing magnetic field strength) follow the power-law distributions consistent with Kolmogorov-type turbulence. Specifically, power spectra exhibit a slope $8/3$ in 2D and $5/3$ in 1D analyses, indicating fully developed turbulence across a broad range of spatial scales. The structure functions and spectral slopes remain robust with and without correction for line-of-sight integration effects, suggesting the presence of Kolmogorov-like turbulence locally throughout the remnant's volume. Anisotropies in the 2D autocorrelation function are aligned with known density and magnetic field gradients. Analysis of the 1D radial properties of turbulence confirms Kolmogorov scaling and indicates that modes in the power spectra may be related either to periodicity in the fluctuations or to the physical sizes of bright or dim features in the surface brightness. Our results demonstrate that the Tycho SNR hosts a spatially and temporally developed turbulent cascade, providing insight into the physics of turbulence in SNRs.</description>

      <title>Closure Relations of Synchrotron Self-Compton from Reverse shock and Fermi-LAT GRBs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synchrotron radiation from the reverse- and forward-shock regions typically describes the evolution of temporal and spectral features given by the closure relations (CRs) during the late and long-/short-lasting emission in the afterglow phase of Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Although synchrotron photons are restricted to keV and a few MeV energies, the synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) mechanism can disperse them above hundreds of MeV energies. We present the CRs of the SSC process radiated from the reverse-shock region for the case of a thick and thin shell, considering that the reverse shock lies in the adiabatic regime and evolves in an environment with a homogeneous and stratified medium. We analyze these CRs with the spectral and temporal characteristics of the bursts described in the second \textit{Fermi}-LAT GRB catalog (2FLGC) and found that i) the thin shell case is preferred over a thick shell and a constant-density medium over a stellar-wind environment, ii) bursts with an atypical and hard spectral index could be successfully described by this scenario in different cooling conditions, iii) the early optical flash and GeV emission exhibited in GRB 160625B and 180720B were generated from the same accelerated region and electron population, concluding that LAT emission originated during the early afterglow, and iv) the maximum synchrotron energy radiated from the reverse-shock scenario could explain only a few photons with the exception of a pair of bursts, so that scattered photons by the SSC process must be required.</description>

      <title>The Terzina payload on board the NUSES space mission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Terzina payload, onboard the NUSES space mission is being built in collaboration with TAS-I by GSSI, INFN and the University of Geneva. It is a Cherenkov Schmidt-Cassegrain compact telescope with an effective focal length of 925~mm and a camera focal assembly composed of 640 pixels (16 vertically and 40 horizontally) organized in $8\times 8$ tiles produced by FBK with sensitive area $2.73 \times 2.64$~mm$^2$. We will illustrate the performance for the signal of cosmic rays beyond a threshold of few hundreds of PeV. Understanding the operation of SiPMs in space with almost direct exposure to solar and trapped protons and electrons, defining the mitigation strategy for the increase of DCR of exposed silicon, the characterisation of the luminous backgrounds, the data acquisition strategy for this payload, the maximization of the effective exposure to the atmospheric showers induced by the signal of neutrinos and cosmic rays are the challenges. At this conference, we describe how they are being addressed.</description>

      <title>Particle Acceleration along Magnetic Fields as the Origin of Ear-like Structures in Supernova Remnants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of ear-like structures with two opposite lobes extending from the shell of supernova remnants (SNRs) remains a subject of active debate, with proposed mechanisms ranging from jet-driven explosions to interactions with bipolar circumstellar media. We present a novel investigation using Particle-in-Cell (PIC) simulations to examine the dynamics of a spherical ejecta in magnetized media, revealing a different formation mechanism for these structures. Our results demonstrate that particle acceleration is significantly enhanced along the magnetic-field direction, producing substantial modifications to shock morphology. These effects naturally generate elongated protrusions bearing a remarkable similarity to the observed SNR ear structures. This magnetic alignment scenario represents a distinct mechanism from the existing jet-based and circumstellar interaction models. Our findings suggest that magnetic field orientation may serve as a crucial diagnostic for distinguishing between different ear formation mechanisms in SNRs.</description>

      <title>Interferometric inference of black hole spin from photon ring size and brightness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $n=1$ photon ring is a full image of the astrophysical source around a black hole, produced by photons that execute $n\approx1$ half-orbit around the event horizon on their way to an observer. The Black Hole Explorer (BHEX) is a proposed extension of the Event Horizon Telescope to space that will target the $n=1$ photon rings of the supermassive black holes M87${}^\ast$ and Sgr\,A${}^\ast$. In this paper, we introduce a new interferometric observable that will be directly measurable on BHEX baselines and which admits a clear image-domain interpretation in terms of the photon ring brightness profile. Across a wide range of semi-analytic equatorial emission models, we find that the azimuthal intensity profile of the ring can change depending on the astrophysics of the source, but its width $w_b$ is weakly sensitive to these details -- much like the ring shape, which has previously been identified as a probe of the spacetime geometry. Our survey suggests that interferometric measurements of the photon ring diameter and $w_b$ can place constraints (to $\lesssim\!20\%$) on the spin and inclination of a black hole with a known mass-to-distance ratio, such as Sgr\,A${}^\ast$. State-of-the-art numerical simulations support this finding, paving the way to a precise photon-ring-based spin measurement for Sgr\,A${}^\ast$ with BHEX.</description>

      <title>Tidal disruption of a magnetized star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tidal disruptions of stars by supermassive black holes in galactic centers (TDEs) are now being actively studied both theoretically and observationally. They are observed throughout the electromagnetic spectrum, from radio to gamma-rays. It is still unclear how the emission is produced and, in particular, what is the role of the magnetic field of the disrupted star. There are many ways how magnetic fields might affect the dynamics of a TDE. They are likely responsible for the angular momentum transfer in the accretion disk formed at later stages and thus affect the radiation associated with the disk. Magnetic fields are also an important requirement for the formation of relativistic jets, that are seen in some TDEs. The goal of our study is to connect the field within the star to the fields that develop during the fallback and disk accretion. Using the fluid-dynamic code Athena++, we perform a large-scale three-dimensional adaptive-mesh magnetohydrodynamic simulation of a tidal disruption of a magnetized star. The fallback stream returning to the black-hole vicinity after the disruption contains smooth magnetic fields aligned with the stream lines. Formation of a nozzle shock near the pericenter of the initial orbit leads to a turbulent eccentric disk-like structure where the field is amplified and entangled on the local dynamic time scales up to approximate equipartition. The resulting field is mildly anisotropic and has a typical length several times smaller than the pericenter distance. The properties of the field are consistent with the early stages of turbulent dynamo.</description>

      <title>Aligned Hierarchical Black Hole Mergers in AGN disks revealed by GWTC-4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The active galactic nucleus (AGN) accretion disks are ideal sites for hierarchical black hole (BH) mergers. To robustly probe such a possibility, we analyze binary black hole mergers in the GWTC-4 with a flexible mixture population model for component masses, spin magnitudes, and spin tilt angles, and identify two distinct subpopulations. In the second subpopulation characterized by high spin magnitudes $\chi\sim 0.8$ as well as the broad mass distribution up to $\gtrsim 150M_\odot$, we find a pronounced preference for spins aligned with the orbital angular momentum: an isotropic tilt distribution is strongly disfavored (logarithmic Bayes factor = 4.5). The aligned events account for $\sim 0.57^{+0.23}_{-0.31}$ of the second subpopulation, corresponding to a local rate of $\sim 0.25^{+0.38}_{-0.16} ~ {\rm Gpc}^{-3} {\rm yr}^{-1}$ (all values reflect central 90\% credible intervals). These notable features naturally arise from hierarchical mergers embedded in AGN disks, where gas torques can effectively align spins. Our results identify AGN-disk hierarchical assembly as an important channel in the present gravitational-wave sample and provide concrete, testable predictions for future detection.</description>

      <title>Constraining the strangeness enhancement scenario of the UHECR muon puzzle with LHC experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The excess of muons observed in ultra-high-energy cosmic-ray air showers relative to simulation predictions, known as the muon puzzle, provides indirect evidence of our incomplete understanding of high-energy hadronic interactions. An unambiguous resolution requires that each proposed solution be directly tested through collider experiments probing hadronic interactions. In this work, we develop a framework to assess the strangeness enhancement scenario, wherein an increased yield of kaons relative to pions boosts muon production. Using the MCEQ air-shower simulation package, we first identify the key phase-space regions of hadronic interactions that drive muon yields in this scenario. We then demonstrate that combining Pierre Auger Observatory muon measurements with forthcoming kaon-to-pion ratio data from LHC Run~3 can robustly constrain the scenario's parameters. In particular, we find that achieving 10.8% precision on the kaon-to-pion ratio at LHCb and 8.4% at FASER is sufficient to test the strangeness enhancement hypothesis over its viable parameter space. These upcoming experimental results will provide the first direct constraints on strangeness enhancement as a potential resolution of the muon puzzle.</description>

      <title>A Simulation Study on the Cosmic Ray Energy Spectra of Elemental Mass Groups using the Tibet Air Shower and Muon Detector Arrays through the Bayesian Unfolding Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the analysis method to determine the cosmic-ray energy spectra of different mass groups assuming the use of the Tibet AS$\gamma$ experiment, which consists of the high-density Tibet air-shower array (Tibet-AS) and the underground muon detector (MD) array. These arrays measure the sampling air shower size $\Sigma\rho$ and the total muon number $\Sigma N_{\mu}$ of each air shower event. These parameters are known to contain information on the energy and mass of the primary particle. To reconstruct the energy spectra of individual cosmic-ray mass groups, we apply a multidimensional unfolding method based on Bayes' theorem to the two-dimensional distribution of $\Sigma\rho$ and $\Sigma N_{\mu}$ produced by Monte Carlo simulation. Simulated datasets with combinations of the EPOS-LHC, SIBYLL-2.3c, and QGSJET~II-04 high-energy hadronic interaction models and a helium-dominant composition model are analyzed while using a response matrix produced by EPOS-LHC. The unfolded spectra of the EPOS + helium-dominant composition model dataset show a deviation from the input flux within $\pm$10\% except for a few bins, meaning that the uncertainty of the technique itself and the composition model dependence is at that level. It is also shown that the deviation in the all-particle spectrum is within $\pm$10\% even when using different hadronic interaction models in the dataset and the response matrix. On the other hand, the unfolded spectra of individual mass groups have a clear dependence on the hadronic interaction model. The model dependence of the proton and helium spectra amounts to \pm25% below 10$^{6.5}$ GeV. The dependence in the carbon group is at a \pm25% level below 10$^{6}$ GeV, and for the iron spectrum, it amounts to +55% and -30% in the energy range of 10$^{5.1}$ GeV to 10$^{6.7}$ GeV.</description>

      <title>To cut or not to cut: Data-quality evaluation for the ASTRI Mini-Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ASTRI Mini-Array consists of nine Cherenkov telescopes under construction at the Observatorio del Teide, with one of them already performing observations since November 2024. Given the complexity of the analysis of gamma-ray data acquired with Cherenkov telescopes, a proper evaluation of the quality of these data is important to avoid a negative impact on the high-level scientific products. There are several factors that can contribute to reducing the quality of the observations, such as clouds, high humidity or a high dust concentration in the air, among others. In order to take all these factors into account and evaluate their impact on the data, a quality check pipeline has been developed for ASTRI. This contribution describes the pipeline, from its inputs at different data levels to the production of outputs in the form of good-quality lists and diagnostic plots. We also show how setting preliminary quality cuts on the Crab Nebula data taken with the first ASTRI telescope can significantly improve the source detection.</description>

      <title>LST-1 observations of GRB 221009A: Insights into its late-time VHE afterglow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) originate from explosions at cosmological distances, generating collimated jets. GRB 221009A, exploded on 9 October 2022, has been established as the brightest GRB to date. Its bright and long emission was extensively followed up from radio to gamma rays. LHAASO firmly detected the onset of the afterglow emission at energies up to $\sim$13 TeV within about an hour after the burst, starting just a few minutes after the trigger. While this VHE emission component can be accounted for in a narrow jet scenario, such an interpretation cannot reproduce the broadband emission observed at later times, which exceeds the theoretical expectations. This discrepancy can be settled if more complex models are considered, providing the first strong evidence for a structured jet in a long GRB. Unfortunately, the VHE emission after a few hours is poorly constrained, as sensitive VHE observations by Cherenkov Telescopes were prevented due to strong moonlight conditions. The first Large-Sized Telescope (LST-1) of the future Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory began observations about one day after the burst under high night sky background conditions. These observations are the first ones performed on GRB 221009A by a Cherenkov telescope, revealing a hint of a signal with a statistical significance of about 4$\sigma$ during the observations performed at 1.3 days after the burst. The monitoring campaign continued until the end of November 2022, making it the deepest observation campaign performed on a GRB with the LST-1. In this contribution, we will present the analysis results of the LST-1 observation campaign on GRB 221009A in October 2022.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Reconstruction on Crab LST-1 Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) is the next-generation ground-based observatory for very-high-energy (VHE) gamma-ray astronomy. The Large-Sized Telescope prototype, LST-1, located on the Canary Island of La Palma, is responsible for observation of the low-energy range of the VHE gamma-ray spectrum. It is undergoing commissioning and has already observed the Crab Nebula as a standard reference source. Accurate reconstruction of shower parameters (e.g. energy, direction, and particle type) is crucial for achieving the scientific goals of the CTAO. In this work, we use CTLearn to implement deep-learning event reconstruction, as an alternative to the standard Random Forest method. CTLearn is built to be fully compatible with ctapipe, a framework for prototyping the low-level data processing algorithms for the CTAO, and can be seamlessly used for data analysis without changing the general framework. It implements convolution-neural-network based models that take the integrated charge and the relative peak time of calibrated pixels in cleaned images as an input, to infer the primary particle's properties. Using Crab Nebula observations as a validation sample, we explore two different approaches. The first is to train a model with Monte-Carlo (MC) simulations covering all possible altitude-azimuth coordinates of the Crab Nebula sample observations, resulting in a single model that can be used to reconstruct events from any Crab Nebula observations. The second approach is to train 10 models along this coordinate line, each incorporating a range of \textasciitilde10{\deg} in altitude. In this contribution, we present our investigation of the performance of CTLearn models, and highlight the potential of CTLearn for future data analysis in the CTAO.</description>

      <title>Dark matter and fundamental physics with the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) will be the next-generation major ground-based gamma-ray observatory. It will be made up of two large arrays of imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs), with one site in the Northern hemisphere (La Palma, Canary Islands) and one in the Southern (Paranal, Chile). CTAO aims to offer great improvement in energetic and angular resolution with respect to current IACT systems, spanning a photon energy range from 20 GeV to 300 TeV, as well as a significantly larger effective area and full-sky coverage. Besides a percentage of observational time available for external proposals, making it the first open gamma-ray observatory, the core observational program of CTAO is organized in several Key Science Projects. A significant amount of time will be devoted to dark matter (e.g. WIMPs, axion-like particles) and fundamental physics studies from a variety of targets, including the Milky Way's Galactic centre, dwarf spheroidal galaxies, the Large Magellanic Cloud, and extragalactic objects such as blazars. In this contribution, an overview of CTAO's main features is provided, with a focus on its capabilities to investigate these yet unanswered questions of modern physics.</description>

      <title>A machine learning approach to axion-like particle searches in CTAO observations of blazars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Axion-like particles (ALPs) are a common prediction of several extensions of the Standard Model of particle physics and could be detected through their coupling to photons, which enables ALP-photon conversions in external magnetic fields. This conversion could lead to two distinct signatures in gamma-ray spectra of blazars: a superimposition of energy-dependent "wiggles" on the spectral shape, and a hardening at high (multi-TeV) energies, due to the ALP beam eluding absorption by the extragalactic background light (EBL). The enhanced energy resolution of the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) with respect to present ground-based gamma-ray telescopes makes it an ideal instrument to probe such phenomena. In this contribution, we explore a different approach based on the use of machine learning (ML) classifiers and compare it to the standard method. Our preliminary results suggest that both techniques yield consistent results, with the ML-based method offering comparable or even slightly broader coverage, potentially extending the CTAO sensitivity beyond existing constraints.</description>

      <title>Horizon-scale variability of M87* from 2017--2021 EHT observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report three epochs of polarized images of M87* at 230\,GHz using data from the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) taken in 2017, 2018, and 2021. The baseline coverage of the 2021 observations is significantly improved through the addition of two new EHT stations: the 12\,m Kitt Peak Telescope and the Northern Extended Millimetre Array (NOEMA). All observations result in images dominated by a bright, asymmetric ring with a persistent diameter of $43.9\pm 0.6\,\muas$, consistent with expectations for lensed synchrotron emission encircling the apparent shadow of a supermassive black hole. We find that the total intensity and linear polarization of \m87 vary significantly across the three epochs. Specifically, the azimuthal brightness distribution of the total intensity images varies from year to year, as expected for a stochastic accretion flow. However, despite a gamma-ray flare erupting in M87 quasi-contemporaneously to the 2018 observations, the 2018 and 2021 images look remarkably similar. The resolved linear polarization fractions in 2018 and 2021 peak at $\sim$5\%, compared to $\sim$15\% in 2017. The spiral polarization pattern on the ring also varies from year to year, including a change in the electric vector position angle helicity in 2021 that could reflect changes in the magnetized accretion flow or an external Faraday screen. The improved 2021 coverage also provides the first EHT constraints on jet emission outside the ring, on scales of $\lesssim 1$\,mas. Overall, these observations provide strong proof of the reliability of the EHT images and probe the dynamic properties of the horizon-scale accretion flow surrounding \m87.</description>

      <title>Stellar flare detection in XMM-Newton with gradient boosted trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The EXTraS project, based on data collected with the XMM-Newton observatory, provided us with a vast amount of light curves for X-ray sources. For each light curve, EXTraS also provided us with a set of features (https://extras.inaf.it). We extract from the EXTraS database a tabular dataset of 31,832 variable sources by 108 features. Of these, 13,851 sources were manually labeled as stellar flares or non-flares based on direct visual inspection. We employ a supervised learning approach to produce a catalog of stellar flares based on our dataset, releasing it to the community. We leverage explainable AI tools and interpretable features to better understand our classifier. We train a gradient boosting classifier on 80\% of the data for which labels are available. We compute permutation feature importance scores, visualize feature space using UMAP, and analyze some false positive and false negative data points with the help of Shapley additive explanations -- an AI explainability technique used to measure the importance of each feature in determining the classifier's prediction for each instance. On the test set made up of the remainder 20\% of our labeled data, we obtain an accuracy of 97.1\%, with a precision of 82.4\% and a recall of 73.3\%. Our classifier outperforms a simple criterion based on fitting the light curve with a flare template and significantly surpasses a gradient-boosted classifier trained only on model-independent features. False positives appear related to flaring light curves that are not associated with a stellar counterpart, while false negatives often correspond to multiple flares or otherwise peculiar or noisy curves. We apply our trained classifier to currently unlabeled sources, releasing the largest catalog of X-ray stellar flares to date. [abridged]</description>

      <title>XMM-Newton view of pulsating iron fluorescent emission from Centaurus X3</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cen X-3 is a bright, high-mass X-ray binary pulsar. We present a pulse phase-resolved X-ray spectral analysis of data from an archival XMM-Newton observation of Cen X-3 taken during the high state of the source. The observation was entirely in the out-of-eclipse part of the binary orbit. We study the pulse phase variability of the three K${\alpha}$ fluorescent emission lines from near-neutral, Helium-like and Hydrogen-like iron, along with the iron K${\beta}$ emission line. All four lines show clear modulation with the pulse phase of the neutron star, and modulation is found to be higher for the lines from highly ionised iron compared to the neutral lines. Structures within the light travel distance corresponding to the pulse period of the neutron star are likely responsible for the pulse phase modulation of the emission lines. We have also investigated the orbital phase dependence of the pulse phase variability in the iron lines by dividing the data into four segments at different orbital phases of Cen X-3. The pulse phase modulation behaviour of the four lines is quite identical at different orbital phases of Cen X-3, indicating the pulsed iron emission region is persistent in nature and probably phase aligned with respect to the observer. The accretion stream intercepting the line of sight can probably produce the observed phase dependence of the iron fluorescence emission lines.</description>

      <title>Luminous Blue Variables</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.22990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Luminous Blue Variables (LBVs) are a class of massive blue supergiants exhibiting irregular and eruptive instability, sometimes accompanied by extreme mass loss. While they have often been considered to be a brief but very important transitional phase in the evolution of massive single stars, mounting evidence suggests that LBVs are actually a phenomenon associated with binary star evolution by way of mass gainers and mergers. If true, this would leave single massive stars without a way to shed their H envelopes and become Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars, requiring a revision of our most basic paradigm of massive star evolution. Understanding their properties and role in evolution is therefore extremely important. The eruptive mass loss of LBVs is also invoked to account for some of the most extraordinary supernovae (SNe) with dense circumstellar material (CSM), which again contradicts the standard single star scenario where LBVs are massive stars in transition to the WR phase. This chapter reviews many aspects of LBVs including terminology and classification, the physical properties of the stars, their mass loss, and their variability, as well as their observed companion stars, implications of their surrounding stellar populations, and their circumstellar nebulae. These are put into context with proposed evolutionary scenarios and possible mechanisms that drive their eruptive variability.</description>

      <title>New ab initio constrained extended Skyrme equations of state for simulations of neutron stars, supernovae and binary mergers: II. Thermal response in the suprasaturation density domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerical simulations of core-collapse supernovae, mergers of binary neutron stars and formation of stellar black holes, which employed standard Skyrme interactions, established clear correlations between the evolution of these processes, characteristics of the hot compact objects, as well as neutrino and gravitational wave signals, and the value of effective nucleon mass at the saturation density. Unfortunately, the density dependence of the effective mass of nucleons in these models does not align with the predictions of ab initio models with three body forces. In this work, we investigate the thermal response for a set of extended Skyrme interactions that feature widely different density dependencies of the effective mass of the nucleons. Thermal contributions to the energy density and pressure are studied along with a few thermal coefficients over wide domains of density, temperature and isospin asymmetry, relevant for the physics of hot compact objects. For some of the effective interactions, the thermal pressure is negative at high densities. This results in a situation where hot compact stars can support less mass before collapsing into a black hole compared to their cold counterparts. Moreover, the higher the temperature, the lower the maximum mass that the hot star can support.</description>

      <title>Regular Bardeen black holes within non-minimal scalar-linear electrodynamic couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we demonstrate that a linear electromagnetic matter source can be constructed for regular black hole solutions, illustrated by the case of the Bardeen black hole. Our method relies on coupling a scalar field and its potential to General Relativity (GR) alongside electrodynamics. Both fields are minimally coupled to GR but interact with each other. We validate this approach by interpreting the Bardeen solution either as a purely magnetic or as a purely electric configuration for a spherically symmetric metric with an arbitrary electrodynamics Lagrangian $\mathcal{L}(F)$ and a coupling function $W(\varphi)$. By choosing an appropriate form of $W$, the electromagnetic Lagrangian can be rendered linear. We then analyze the behavior of the coupling function and the scalar field potential, emphasizing their relation to the magnetic or electric charge. Finally, we compare the advantages and disadvantages of this framework with the conventional formalism, in which regular charged black holes are supported solely by nonlinear electrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Black bounce solutions via nonminimal scalar-electrodynamic couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Black-bounce (BB) solutions generalize the spacetimes of black holes, regular black holes, and wormholes, depending on the values of certain characteristic parameters. In this work, we investigate such solutions within the framework of General Relativity (GR), assuming spherical symmetry and static geometry. It is well established in the literature that, in order to sustain such geometries, the source of Einstein's equations in the BB context can be composed of a scalar field $\varphi$ and a nonlinear electrodynamics (NLED). In our model, in addition to the Lagrangian associated with the scalar field in the action, we also include an interaction term of the form $W(\varphi)\mathcal{L}(F)$, which introduces a nonminimal coupling between the scalar field and the electromagnetic sector. Notably, the usual minimal coupling configuration is recovered by setting $W(\varphi)=1$. In contrast to approaches where the function $W(\varphi)$ is assumed a priori, here we determine its functional form by modeling the radial dependence of the derivative of the electromagnetic Lagrangian as a power law, namely $\mathcal{L}_F(r) \sim F^n$. This approach enables us to determine $W(r)$ directly from the obtained solutions. We apply this procedure to two specific geometries: the Simpson-Visser-type BB solution and the Bardeen-type BB solution, both analyzed in the purely magnetic ($q_m \neq 0$, $q_e=0$) and purely electric ($q_m=0$, $q_e \neq 0$) cases. In all scenarios, we find that these BB spacetime solutions can be described with a linear electrodynamics, which is a noteworthy result. Furthermore, we examine the regularity of the spacetime through the Kretschmann scalar and briefly discuss the associated energy conditions for the solutions obtained.</description>

      <title>Telling apart black holes and naked singularities with trajectories of massive particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We performed a numerical study of the dynamics of massive particles orbiting black holes and naked singularities in the Reissner-Nordstr\"om geometry. We modeled a stream of particles with a constant angular momentum and with a range of energies. We then solved the geodesic equation of motion and compared the trajectories around black holes and naked singularities by tuning the charge parameter of the metric. The setup that we used can approximate astrophysical scenarios such as tidal disruption events. We discussed differences and similarities in the orbital dynamics and deflection angles. We found that particles reflected by a black hole follow a stream-like family of orbits within a narrow range of deflection angles, whereas in case of naked singularities particles are scattered in all directions on the plain of motion. We explained this behavior as an interplay between the presence of a centrifugal barrier at the location of the unstable circular orbit and an absorbing event horizon in case of a black hole or a reflective zero-gravity sphere in case of a naked singularity. These qualitative differences are expected to impact the observable signatures of tidal disruption events.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24366v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate photon, pion, and rho-meson production from proton synchrotron radiation in the presence of strong magnetic fields. The proton decay widths and the luminosities of the emitted particles are calculated within a relativistic quantum framework that incorporates Landau quantization. A scaling rule is derived for the transition probability between different Landau levels. This allows an evaluation of transitions for extremely high Landau numbers exceeding $10^{15}$. Furthermore, we calculate the momentum distribution of the emitted particles by properly including the proton recoil effect associated with particle emission. The results differ significantly from conventional semiclassical approaches.</description>

      <title>Accounting for Tidal Deformability in Binary Neutron Star Template Banks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modelled searches for gravitational waves emitted by compact binary coalescences currently filter the data with template signals that ignore all effects related to the physics of dense-matter in neutron stars interiors, even when the masses in the template are compatible with a binary neutron star or a neutron star-black hole binary source. The leading neutron star finite-size effect is an additional phase contribution due to tidal deformations induced by the gravitational coupling between the two inspiralling objects in the binary. We show how neglecting this effect in the templates reduces the search sensitivity close to the detection threshold. This is particularly true for binary neutron stars systems, where tidal effects are larger. In this work we therefore propose a new technique for the construction of binary neutron star template banks that accounts for neutron star tidal deformabilities as degrees of freedom of the parameter space to be searched over. A first attempt in this direction was carried out by Harry &amp; Lundgren [Physical Review D 104, 043008 (2021)], who proposed to extract randomly the tidal deformabilities of the stars over a uniform interval, regardless of the binary neutron star component masses. We show that this approach yields 33% additional templates with respect to the equivalent point-like template bank. Our proposed approach, instead, adopts a more physically motivated tidal deformability prior with a support that is informed by the value of the neutron star mass and compatible with the neutron star equation of state constraint provided by the observation of GW170817. This method significantly reduces the needed additional templates to 8.2%.</description>

      <title>Graph-based Analysis for Revealing the Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background in Pulsar Timing Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) reveals valuable information about its origin and the Universe. The pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) are suitable indicators for detecting SGWB within the nano-Hertz frequency range. In this work, we propose a graph-based method implemented on the pulsar timing residuals (PTRs) for SGWB detection and examining uncertainties of its parameters. We construct a correlation graph with pulsars as its nodes, and analyze the graph-based summary statistics, which include topological and geometrical characteristics, for identifying SGWB in real and synthetic datasets. The effect of the number of pulsars, the observation time span, and the strength of the SGWB on the graph-based feature vector is evaluated. Our results demonstrate that the merit feature vector for common signal detection consists of the average clustering coefficient and the edge weight fluctuation. The SGWB detection conducted after the observation of a common signal and then exclusion of non-Hellings \&amp; Downs templates is performed by the second cumulant of edge weight for angular separation thresholds $\bar{\zeta}\gtrsim 40^{\circ}$. The lowest detectable value of SGWB strain amplitude utilizing our graph-based measures at the current PTAs sensitivity is $A_{\rm SGWB}\gtrsim 1.2\times 10^{-15}$. Fisher forecasts confirmed that the uncertainty levels of $\log_{10} A_{\rm SGWB}$ and spectral index reach $2.2\%$ and $28.3\%$, respectively, at $2\sigma$ confidence interval. Evidence for an SGWB at the $3\sigma$ level is obtained by applying our graph-based method to the NANOGrav 15-year dataset.</description>

      <title>AGN hosting jets. I: A semi-analytical model for the evolution of radio galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Three-dimensional simulations of relativistic jets are a useful tool to understand the evolution of jets and radio galaxies in detail. However, computationally demanding as they are, their use is limited to a relatively small number of representative cases. When comparing to the distribution of large samples of objects in the luminosity-distance plane (P-D plane), the most efficient approach is to use analytical or semi-analytical models that reproduce the evolution of the main parameters governing the dynamics and radio luminosity of the sources. Our aim is to build a semi-analytical model that allows us to produce mock samples of radio galaxies to be compared with real populations and use this approach to constrain the general properties of active galaxies with jets in a cosmological context. In this work, we present a new model for the evolution of radio galaxies based on the resolution of ordinary differential equations and inspired both by previous experience on numerical simulations of jets across several orders of magnitude in power, and by observational evidence. Our results show remarkable agreement between the results given by the semi-analytical model and those obtained by both 2D and 3D relativistic hydrodynamics simulations of jets ranging from 1.e35 W to 1.e39 W. From the derived trajectories of powerful radio galaxies through the P-D diagram (powers greater than 1.e36 W), our model agrees with typical lifetimes of galactic activity of &lt; 500 Myr. We also compare our results with previous models in the literature. In a follow-up paper, we use this model to generate mock populations of radio galaxies at low redshifts and compare them to the LoTSS sample.</description>

Abstract: The increasing volume of gamma-ray data demands new analysis approaches that can handle large-scale datasets while providing robustness for source detection. We present a Deep Learning (DL) based pipeline for detection, localization, and characterization of gamma-ray sources. We extend our AutoSourceID (ASID) method, initially tested with \textit{Fermi}-LAT simulated data and optical data (MeerLICHT), to Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) simulated data. This end-to-end pipeline demonstrates a versatile framework for future application to other surveys and potentially serves as a building block for a foundational model for astrophysical source detection.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01611v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the effects of pair creation on the radiation emerging from black holes under the assumption that the magnetic fields are vortex driven. In particular, for a sufficiently broad range of supermassive black holes, we investigated the energies at which photons undergo decay under the influence of a strong magnetic field, producing electron-positron pairs. Depending on particular physical parameters, it has been shown that in certain scenarios high or very high energy emission generated by black holes will be strongly suppressed, thus, will be unable to escape a zone where radiation is generated. In particular, photons with energies exceeding $\sim 1$ GeV will never leave the magnetosphere if they are generated at the scale 10$R_g$ and the threshold is of the order of $1$ TeV, if the emission is produced at $\sim 100\; R_g$. Analysing the process versus the black hole mass, assuming the region $100\; R_g$, it has been shown that for the considered lowest mass, the photons with energies $250$ GeV will never leave the black hole and for the considered highest mass the corresponding value is $\sim 250$ TeV.</description>

      <title>Sporadic radio pulses from a white dwarf binary at the orbital period</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11536v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent observations have revealed rare, previously unknown flashes of cosmic radio waves lasting from milliseconds to minutes, and with periodicity of minutes to an hour. These transient radio signals must originate from sources in the Milky Way, and from coherent emission processes in astrophysical plasma. They are theorized to be produced in the extreme and highly magnetised environments around white dwarfs or neutron stars. However, the astrophysical origin of these signals remains contested, and multiple progenitor models may be needed to explain their diverse properties. Here we present the discovery of a transient radio source, ILT J1101+5521, whose roughly minute-long pulses arrive with a periodicity of 125.5 minutes. We find that ILT J1101+5521 is an M dwarf -- white dwarf binary system with an orbital period that matches the period of the radio pulses, which are observed when the two stars are in conjunction. The binary nature of ILT J1101+5521 establishes that some long-period radio transients originate from orbital motion modulating the observed emission, as opposed to an isolated rotating star. We conclude that ILT J1101+5521 is likely a polar system where magnetic interaction has synchronised the rotational and orbital periods of the white dwarf. Magnetic interaction and plasma exchange between two stars has been theorized to generate sporadic radio emission, making ILT J1101+5521 a potential low-mass analogue to such mechanisms.</description>

Abstract: Accurate thermal emission models of neutron stars are essential for constraining the dense matter equation of state. However, incorporating realistic magnetic field structures is computationally prohibitive, severely constraining feasible parameter space exploration. In this work, we develop a neural network (NN) emulator to generate model thermal bolometric X-ray light curves of millisecond pulsars with multipolar magnetic fields. We assess the NN's predictive and computational performance across a broad parameter space. We find that for a static vacuum field model, the NN provides a &gt;400 times speedup. We integrate this NN emulator into a Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) framework to replace the computationally expensive physical model during parameter exploration. Applied to PSR J0030+0451, this approach allows the MCMC to reach equilibrium in ~1 day on 4000 cores, where with the original physical model alone it would have taken more than a year on the same hardware. We compare posterior distributions by running equivalent MCMC iterations with both the NN and the physical model, evaluate differences in distributions when continuing the physical model MCMC from the NN MCMC equilibrium state, and assess variations in posterior distributions resulting from NNs trained on datasets of different sizes. Our NN architecture is agnostic to the underlying physics of the physical model and can be trained for any other physical model, opening many previously intractable avenues of analysis. The NN speed remains the same regardless of the complexity of the physical model it was trained to emulate, allowing greater speedups for more complex physical models.</description>

      <title>Magnetosphere Evolution and Precursor-Driven Electromagnetic Signals in Merging Binary Neutron Stars</title>

Abstract: We detail new force-free simulations to investigate magnetosphere evolution and precursor electromagnetic (EM) signals from binary neutron stars. Our simulations fully follow a representative inspiral motion, capturing the intricate magnetospheric dynamics and their impact on EM outflows. We explore a range of stellar magnetic moment orientations and relative strengths, finding that the magnetospheres and Poynting flux evolution are strongly configuration-dependent. The Poynting flux exhibits pulsations at twice the orbital frequency, $2\Omega$, and is highly anisotropic, following a power-law dependence on orbital frequency. The index ranges from 1 to 6, shaped by the intricate dynamics of the magnetospheres. Furthermore, we present the first computation of: (1) The EM forces acting on the star surfaces, revealing the presence of torques that, for highly-magnetized stars, could influence the orbital dynamics or break the crust. (2) The high-energy emission signals from these systems by adopting the established isolated pulsar theory. Assuming curvature radiation in the radiation reaction limit, we find that photons could reach TeV--PeV energies in the last $\sim$~ms for magnetic field strengths $10^{10}-10^{15}$~G. However, our analysis of single photon magnetic pair production suggests that these photons are unlikely to escape, with the MeV band emerging as a promising observational window for precursor high-energy emission. In this framework, we construct high-energy emission skymaps and light curves, exploring observational implications. Finally, we propose potential precursor radio emission and delayed afterglow echoes from magnetized outflows, which may contribute to late-time re-brightening in short gamma-ray bursts or to orphan afterglows.</description>

Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) from coalescing binary black holes (BBHs) can come from different environments. GWs interact gravitationally with astrophysical objects, which makes it possible to use gravitational lensing by objects in the same gravitational system (self-lensing) to learn about their environments. We quantify the probability of self-lensing through the optical depth $\tau$ for the main channels of detectable GWs at frequencies $f_{\rm GW}\sim (1-10^3)\,{\rm Hz}$. We then analyze the detectability of the lensing effect (imprint). In star clusters, the probability of self-lensing by stellar-mass black holes (BHs) is low, $\tau\simeq10^{-7}$, even when taking into account nearby BHs in resonant interactions, $\tau\simeq 10^{-5}$. Additionally, the lensing imprint of a stellar-mass lens (diffraction and interference) is too marginal to be detectable by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA detectors and most Einstein Telescope signals. For a massive BH lens in the center of a cluster, the probability can reach $\tau\simeq 10^{-4}$ either via von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai induced mergers of BBHs orbiting a central massive BH, or BBHs formed as GW captures in single-single interactions in the Bahcall-Wolf cusp of a nuclear cluster. For self-lensing by a supermassive BH for BBHs in the migration trap of an active galactic nucleus (AGN) disk, $\tau \simeq 10^{-2}$. The imprint of these massive lenses are multiple images that are already detectable. Moreover, self-lensed signals from AGN disks have a distinct linear polarization. The probability depends on the extent of the detectability through the threshold impact parameter $y_{\rm max}$, which can increase for future detectors. We conclude that constraining the environment of BBHs is possible by combining self-lensing imprints with other waveform signatures such as eccentricity and polarization.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from core-collapse supernovae with no electromagnetic counterparts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03581v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) are regularly observed electromagnetically, prompting targetted searches for their gravitational-wave emission. However, there are scenarios where these powerful explosions may not have any observable electromagnetic signal, but would still have strong detectable emission in gravitational waves and neutrinos. A regular CCSN explosion may be obscured by matter in the Galaxy. A star may undergo a failed CCSN explosion, where the stalled shockwave is not revived, and would eventually form a black hole. Higher mass progenitor stars may revive the shock, but form a black hole too quickly for the shockwave to reach the surface of the star and produce an electromagnetic signal. Previous work has shown that we can determine if a black hole forms from the CCSN neutrino emission if there are long duration sinusoidal modulations in the neutrino signal caused by the standing accretion shock instability (SASI). The SASI also produces an observable signature in the gravitational-wave emission. In this paper, we investigate if we can distinguish between different scenarios for electromagnetically dark CCSNe using the gravitational-wave emission alone. We find, using a reconstruction of the SASI mode, abrupt end times of the gravitational-wave emission, and the rate of change of frequency of the dominant mode, that we are able to accurately distinguish between an obscured CCSN, a failed CCSN, and an explosion with fast black hole formation.</description>

      <title>QPEs from EMRI Debris Streams Impacting Accretion Disks in Galactic Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10096v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quasi-periodic eruption (QPE) sources in galactic nuclei are often associated with a stellar object orbiting a supermassive black hole with hours-days period, brought in as an extreme mass-ratio inspiral (EMRI). In the presence of an accretion disk, repeated star-disk collisions lead to ablation of a small fraction of the stellar mass during each disk passage. We analytically follow the evolution of the stellar debris as it is tidally stretched outside the EMRI's Hill sphere, forming an elongated, dilute stream, that subsequently collides with the disk, half an orbit after the previous star-disk encounter. At sufficiently long orbital periods ($\gtrsim 12$ hr), the stream is too dilute to penetrate the disk, and is instead strongly shocked and deflected at its surface through a reverse shock. We obtain the resulting emission and explore implications for QPE observations. Due to their low optical depth and prolonged interaction time, radiation from the shocked streams typically dominates over that from shocked disk gas directly impacted by the star or by ejecta confined within its Hill sphere, as was first proposed by Yao et al. 2025. We find that: (1) QPE flare durations reflect the stream-disk collision timescale; (2) Flare luminosities of $10^{42-43}$ erg/s, consistent with observed QPEs, are robustly produced; (3) Soft X-ray flares with temperatures of ${\sim}$100 eV arise when the stream mass is sufficient to sustain a radiation mediated shock at the collision interface. Higher mass streams yield softer flares, typically outshone by the disk, while lower mass streams result in collisionless shocks, which likely produce fainter and harder flares. We discuss observational implications of the temporal evolution of the underlying disk, assuming it is the remnant of a prior tidal disruption event in the same galaxy.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Field Configurations in Binary Neutron Star Mergers I: Post-merger Remnant and Disk</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18995v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a suite of general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations of binary neutron star (BNS) mergers performed with the code GR-Athena++. We investigate how a different initial magnetic field configuration, nuclear equation of state, or binary mass ratio affects the magnetic and thermodynamic evolution of the post-merger remnant and disk. We also analyze the impact of the commonly-assumed reflection (bitant) symmetry across the equatorial plane. Magnetic field amplification occurs shortly after the merger due to the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability; later, the field keeps evolving with a predominantly toroidal configuration due to winding and turbulence. The initial magnetic field topology leaves an imprint on the field structure and affects magnetic field amplification for the initial magnetic field values commonly assumed in the literature and the limited resolution of the simulations. Enforcing equatorial reflection symmetry partially suppresses the development of turbulence near the equatorial plane and impacts the post-merger magnetic field evolution. Stiffer EOSs produce larger, less compact remnants that may retain memory of the pre-merger strong poloidal field.</description>

      <title>BRAiSE: synthetic polarisation in RMHD AGN jet simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19541v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new method to calculate the polarised synchrotron emission of radio AGN sources using magnetic field information from 3-dimensional relativistic magnetohydrodynamical (RMHD) simulations. Like its predecessor, which uses pressure as a proxy for the magnetic field, this method tracks the spatially resolved adiabatic and radiative loss processes using the method adapted from the Radio AGN in Semi-analytic Environments formalism. Lagrangian tracer particles in RMHD simulations carried out using the PLUTO code are used to track the fluid quantities of each `ensemble of electrons' through time to calculate the radio emissivity ex-situ. By using the magnetic field directly from simulations, the full set of linear Stokes parameters I, Q, and U can be calculated to study the synthetic radio polarisation of radio AGN sources. We apply this method to a suite of RMHD simulations to study their polarisation properties. The turbulent magnetic field present in radio lobes influences the emission, causing a complex clumpy structure that is visible at high resolution. Our synthetic polarisation properties are consistent with observations; we find that the fractional polarisation is highest (approximately 50 percent) at the lobe edges. We show that for the same source, the integrated and mean fractional polarisation depends on viewing angle to the source. At oblique viewing angles the behaviour of the integrated and mean fractional polarisation over time depends on the morphology of the jet cocoon. Using Faraday rotation measures, we reproduce known depolarisation effects such as the Laing-Garrington depolarisation asymmetry in jets angled to the line of sight. We show that the hotspots and hence the Fanaroff-Riley classification become less clear with our new, more accurate method.</description>

Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are the most luminous astrophysical transients, known to be associated with core collapse of massive stars or mergers of two compact objects such as two neutron stars. They are followed by multi-wavelength afterglow emission originating from the deceleration of the relativistic jets by the ambient medium. The study of afterglow emission offers crucial insights into the physics of relativistic shocks, the properties of the circumburst environment, the physical and geometrical structure of relativistic jets, as well as the viewing geometry of the observer. We present {\tt VegasAfterglow}, a newly developed, high-performance C++ framework designed for modeling GRB afterglows with flexibility and computational efficiency as key features of design. The framework self-consistently solves forward and reverse shock dynamics and calculates synchrotron (including self-absorption or all spectral regimes) and inverse Compton radiation (including Klein-Nishina corrections); it can handle arbitrary user-defined ambient density profiles, central engine activity histories, viewing angles, and the jet structures of energy, Lorentz factor, and magnetization profiles. It supports both relativistic and non-relativistic regimes and includes lateral jet spreading effects. In this paper, we describe the numerical implementation of the framework and assess its computational performance. Our results demonstrate that {\tt VegasAfterglow} is well-suited for interpreting current and future multi-wavelength observations in the era of multi-messenger astronomy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15150v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a pseudo-Newtonian stationary circumbinary slim disk model. We extend the slim disk formalism by including the binary tidal torque and solve the resulting steady-state equations to determine the circumbinary disk structure. We compare the binary slim disk solutions with corresponding binary thin disk solutions, calculate the disk spectrum, explore the impact of different parameters on the system, and estimate the binary shrinkage timescale. We find that; (1) due to the different disk density profiles, the integrated tidal torque exerted on the disk is significantly smaller for the slim disk than for the thin disk; as a result thin disks onto binary black holes can be radiatively significantly more efficient than slim disks; (2) The presence of the secondary alters the emission of the circumbinary disk, making it different from the spectrum of a single black hole Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN); (3) The tidal torque boosts the viscous torque in the outer part of the disk (radii greater than the binary separation), which is strongly dependent on the disk parameters, including the binary mass ratio $q$, the orbital separation $a$, the viscous parameter $\alpha$ and the accretion rate $\dot M$; (4) The vertical component of the potential of the secondary slightly decreases the integrated tidal torque. However, both the vertical and radial components of the potential of the secondary have small impact on the disk radiative flux; (5) Using the integrated disk tidal torque backreacting on the secondary at different orbital separations, we find that the disk provides an efficient way to shrink the binary orbital separation.</description>

      <title>Spinning into the Gap: Direct-Horizon Collapse as the Origin of GW231123 from End-to-End GRMHD Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15887v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: GW231123, the most massive binary black hole (BH) merger observed to date, involves component BHs with masses inside the pair-instability mass gap and unusually high spins. This challenges standard formation channels such as classical stellar evolution and hierarchical mergers. However, stellar rotation and magnetic fields, which have not been systematically incorporated in prior models, can strongly influence the BH properties. We present the first self-consistent simulations tracking a massive, low-metallicity helium star from helium core burning through collapse, BH formation, and post-BH formation accretion using 3D general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations. Starting from a $250\,M_\odot$ helium core, we show that collapse above the pair-instability mass gap, aided by rotation and magnetic fields, drives mass loss through disk winds and jet launching. This enables the formation of highly spinning BHs within the mass gap and reveals a BH spin-mass correlation. Strong magnetic fields extract angular momentum from the BH through magnetically driven outflows, which in turn suppress accretion, resulting in slowly spinning BHs within the mass gap. In contrast, stars with weak fields permit nearly complete collapse and spin-up of the BH to $ a\approx1$. We show that massive low-metallicity stars with moderate magnetic fields naturally produce BHs whose masses and spins match those inferred for GW231123, and are also consistent with those of GW190521. The outflows may impart a BH kick, which can induce spin-orbit misalignment and widen the post-collapse orbit, delaying the merger. The outflows launched during collapse may power short-lived, high-luminosity jets comparable to the most energetic $\gamma$-ray bursts, offering a potential observational signature of such events in the early universe.</description>

      <title>First look at Vela X-1 with XRISM: A simultaneous campaign with XMM-Newton and NuSTAR</title>

Abstract: High-Mass X-ray Binaries (HMXBs) serve as useful laboratories for exploring the behaviour of accreted matter onto compact objects and for probing the complex wind environments of massive stars. These investigations are essential for understanding stellar life cycles and the dynamics of the Milky Way, and they are prominent topics in the science cases for XRISM and NewAthena. We report, for the first time, a XRISM observation of the HMXB Vela X-1, conducted during the first cycle of the XRISM general observer programme and complemented by simultaneous XMM-Newton and NuSTAR coverage. This campaign targeted a critical orbital phase -- when the neutron star is in inferior conjunction -- during which significant changes in absorption are expected. We performed absorption-resolved spectral analyses during two time intervals of interest: the soft and hard hardness ratio (HR) intervals, as it is strongly correlated with absorption variability. We observed a sudden transition in the HR from a soft to a hard state, coinciding with an increase in the absorption column density. This is likely attributed to the onset of the accretion structure crossing our line of sight. With XRISM/Resolve, we also investigated the Fe K region, and we report for the first time the presence of a Fe K$\alpha$ doublet in the spectrum of Vela X-1, together with the presence of already known Fe K$\beta$ and Ni K$\alpha$ lines that are produced in cold clumps embedded in the hot ionised wind. The measured line velocities of the order of $10^2 \ \mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$ are consistent with production sites in the vicinity of the neutron star. This precursor study with Vela X-1 shows the potential of XRISM in studying in unprecedented details the spectral evolution of wind-accreting X-ray binaries.</description>

Abstract: One of the hottest questions in the cosmology of self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) is whether scatterings can induce detectable core-collapse in halos by the present day. Because gravitational tides can accelerate core-collapse, the most promising targets to observe core-collapse are satellite galaxies and subhalo systems. However, simulating small subhalos is computationally intensive, especially when subhalos start to core-collapse. In this work, we present a hierarchical framework for simulating a population of SIDM subhalos, which reduces the computation time to linear order in the total number of subhalos. With this method, we simulate substructure lensing systems with multiple velocity-dependent SIDM models, and show how subhalo evolution depends on the SIDM model, subhalo mass and orbits. We find that an SIDM cross section of $\gtrsim 200$ cm$^2$/g at velocity scales relevant for subhalos' internal heat transfer is needed for a significant fraction of subhalos to core-collapse in a typical lens system at redshift $z=0.5$, and that core-collapse has unique observable features in lensing. We show quantitatively that core-collapse in subhalos is typically accelerated compared to field halos, except when the SIDM cross section is non-negligible ($\gtrsim \mathcal{O}(1)$ cm$^2$/g) at subhalos' orbital velocities, in which case evaporation by the host can delay core-collapse. This suggests that substructure lensing can be used to probe velocity-dependent SIDM models, especially if line-of-sight structures (field halos) can be distinguished from lens-plane subhalos. Intriguingly, we find that core-collapse in subhalos can explain the recently reported ultra-steep density profiles of substructures found by lensing with the \emph{Hubble Space Telescope}</description>

      <title>Gravitational signatures beyond Newton: exploring hierarchical three-body dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06947v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hierarchical three-body systems offer a compelling framework to explore the subtle interplay between Newtonian and relativistic gravitational effects in astrophysical environments. In this work, we investigate post-Newtonian corrections to the periastron shift within such systems, focusing on the impact of orbital eccentricity. Modeling the secondary body's influence as a quadrupolar perturbation, we compare Newtonian, Schwarzschild, and post-Newtonian quadrupolar contributions to orbital precession. Our analysis demonstrates that Newtonian quadrupolar effects could be observable, for a long monitoring time, in the orbit of the S87 star around Sagittarius A* if an intermediate-mass black hole is present, under the assumptions of our model. Additionally, post-Newtonian quadrupolar corrections may influence the dynamics of small Solar System bodies in the presence of massive companions. Although the predicted effects are minute and require long monitoring periods to be measurable, our analysis clarifies how relativistic corrections enter the dynamics of the third body and outlines the conditions under which future observations could reveal them.</description>

      <title>The CONDOR Observatory: A Gamma-Ray Observatory with a 100 GeV Threshold at 5300 Meters Above Sea Level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08850v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the design of the Compact Network of Detectors with Orbital Range (CONDOR), a proposed high-altitude gamma-ray and cosmic-ray (CR) observatory set to become the highest of its kind. Planned for installation at Cerro Toco in the Atacama Desert, Chile, at 5300 meters above sea level (m.a.s.l.), CONDOR is optimized to operate in the 100 GeV to 1 TeV range using the extensive air-shower technique. The design prioritizes simplicity, modularity, and robustness to ensure reliable performance in a harsh environment. The CONDOR array has a full coverage factor of 90 and consists of 6000 plastic scintillator panels, each approximately 1 m^2, read by wavelength-shifting fibers and SiPMs. The readout electronics are based on fast ADCs, with White Rabbit technology ensuring time synchronization. We present an analysis of angular resolution and effective area by variation of the CORSIKA design to meet the developing GeV threshold, complementing other ground-based observatories in gamma-ray and proton CR measurements. CONDOR has the potential to support an extensive research program in astroparticle physics and multimessenger astronomy from the Southern Hemisphere, operating in all-sky mode 24 hours per day, year-round, with satellite data ranges.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic Follow-Up of Candidate Runaway Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20856v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Runaway stars are characterized by higher space velocities than typical field stars. They are presumed to have been ejected from their birth places by one or more energetic mechanisms, including supernova explosions. Accurate radial velocities are essential for investigating their origin, by tracing back their Galactic orbits to look for close encounters in space and in time with neutron stars and young associations. While most studies of runaways have focused on OB stars, later-type stars have also been considered on occasion. Here we report the results of a long-term high-resolution spectroscopic monitoring program with the goal of providing accurate radial velocities for 188 runaway candidates of spectral type A and later, proposed by Tetzlaff et al. (2011). We obtained multiple measurements over a period of about 13 yr to guard against the possibility that some may be members of binary or multiple systems, adding archival observations going back another 25 yr in some cases. We report new spectroscopic orbital solutions for more than three dozen systems. Many more are also found to be binaries based on available astrometric information. A small-scale study carried out here to trace back the paths of our targets together with those of four well-studied, optically-visible neutron stars among the so-called Magnificent Seven, resulted in no credible encounters.</description>

      <title>Multi-MeV electron occurrence and lifetimes in the outer radiation belt and slot region during the maximum of solar cycle 22</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08559v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Combined Release and Radiation Effects Satellite (CRRES) observed the response of the Van Allen radiation belts to peak solar activity within solar cycle 22. This study analyses relativistic and ultra-relativistic electron occurrence and loss timescales within the CRRES High Energy Electron Fluxometer (HEEF) dataset, including during several strong and severe geomagnetic storms that all, remarkably, flooded the slot region with multi-MeV electrons. These allow the first definitive multi-MeV electron lifetimes to be calculated in this region and indicate an elevated risk to satellites in slot region orbits during periods of heightened solar activity. The HEEF outer belt loss timescales are broadly in agreement with those from later solar cycles, but differences include longer-lasting sub-MeV electrons near the inner region of the outer belt and faster-decaying multi-MeV electrons near geosynchronous orbit. These differences are associated with higher levels of geomagnetic activity, a phenomenon that enables the spread in the results to be parameterised accordingly. The timescales generally appear well-bounded by Kp-dependent theoretical predictions, but the variability within the spread is not always well-ordered by geomagnetic activity. This suggests the limitations of using pitch-angle diffusion to account for the decay of elevated electrons following geomagnetic storms, and the need for more sophisticated space weather indices for radiation belt forecasting.</description>

      <title>Enhancing gravitational-wave detection: a machine learning pipeline combination approach with robust uncertainty quantification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17587v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational-wave data from advanced-era interferometric detectors consists of background Gaussian noise, frequent transient artefacts, and rare astrophysical signals. Multiple search algorithms exist to detect the signals from compact binary coalescences, but their varying performance complicates interpretation. We present a machine learning-driven approach that combines results from individual pipelines and utilises conformal prediction to provide robust, calibrated uncertainty quantification. Using simulations, we demonstrate improved detection efficiency and apply our model to GWTC-3, enhancing confidence in multi-pipeline detections, such as the sub-threshold binary neutron star candidate GW200311_103121.</description>

      <title>Defining eccentricity for spin-precessing binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08345v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Standardizing the definition of eccentricity is necessary for unambiguous inference of the orbital eccentricity of compact binaries from gravitational wave observations. In previous works, we proposed a definition of eccentricity for systems without spin-precession that relies solely on the gravitational waveform, is applicable to any waveform model, and has the correct Newtonian limit. In this work, we extend this definition to spin-precessing systems. This simple yet effective extension relies on first transforming the waveform from the inertial frame to the coprecessing frame, and then adopting an amplitude and a phase with reduced spin-induced effects. Our method includes a robust procedure for filtering out spin-induced modulations, which become non-negligible in the small eccentricity and large spin-precession regime. Finally, we apply our method to a set of Numerical Relativity and Effective One Body waveforms to showcase its robustness for generic eccentric spin-precessing binaries. We make our method public via Python implementation in \texttt{gw\_eccentricity}.</description>

      <title>Attenuation of the ultra-high-energy neutrino flux by dark matter scatterings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02869v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A flux of ultra-high-energy (UHE) neutrinos, produced by astrophysical sources at cosmological distances, is anticipated to exist and reach Earth. In this paper, we investigate the impact on the total flux, energy spectrum, and arrival directions of UHE neutrinos of neutrino-dark matter (DM) scatterings. We study scatterings both in the intergalactic medium and in the Milky Way. We emphasize the complementarity among neutrino detectors at different latitudes, that can probe anisotropies induced by neutrinos scattering with the Milky Way DM halo. We also discuss that, with mild astrophysical assumptions, limits on the DM-$\nu$ scattering cross section can be placed even if the neutrino sources are unknown. Finally, we explore all this phenomenology with the recent UHE neutrino event KM3230213A, and place the corresponding limits on the DM-$\nu$ scattering cross section.</description>

      <title>Energy Cascade and Damping in Fast-Mode Compressible Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03443v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Compressible turbulence governs energy transfer across scales in space and astrophysical systems. Capturing both the turbulence cascade and damping is therefore crucial for models of energy conversion, plasma heating, and particle transport in diverse plasma environments, but remains challenging. Progress is constrained by two unresolved fundamental questions: the persistence of the turbulence cascade in the presence of shocks and discontinuities, and the validity of classical wave theories under strong nonlinearity. In particular, it remains unclear whether meaningful cascade dynamics can be defined in compressible turbulence with phase steepening, and whether frameworks developed for monochromatic waves remain applicable to complex, broadband fluctuations. Using large-scale, high-resolution kinetic simulations, we analyze turbulence-particle interactions, which are beyond the capability of standard magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations. We show that compressible turbulence damping at MHD scales in quantitative agreement with transit-time damping theory, even in fully developed nonlinear states. Moreover, the cascade persists despite the generation of shocks and discontinuities due to phase steepening, revealing a surprising robustness of cross-scale energy transfer under extreme conditions. We further provide the spectral expression of compressible turbulence. These results close a long-standing gap in the physics of compressible turbulence and establish a robust foundation for turbulence modeling from the heliosphere to galaxies.</description>

      <title>Polarimetry imprints of exotic compact objects: relativistic fluid spheres and gravastars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20344v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent observations of polarimetric parameters of active galactic nuclei motivate the study of polarization in the spacetime of exotic compact objects which can mimic the features of black holes in the strong field regime of gravity. In this work, we study the properties of two models for ultra-compact objects containing light rings - relativistic fluid spheres and gravastars. We have simulated the orbit of a hot spot around the considered objects in the polarization ray-tracing software GYOTO, and extracted observables, namely integrated images of the Stokes parameters I, Q, U; their evolution during the orbit in the QU-plane, and the electric vector position angle (EVPA). Our models resemble the black hole qualitatively, with slight additional imprints which provide a useful tool to constrain the spacetime metric of supermassive compact objects with current and future observations, and probe the fundamental properties of these objects. We have found that one fluid star model with a pressure singularity resembles the black hole entirely, while another gravastar features notable differences in the EVPA curve in the low-inclination case. Since differences between the models become more pronounced for a higher inclination, our results could potentially restrict the adequateness of ECO classes with future high-inclination observations.</description>
