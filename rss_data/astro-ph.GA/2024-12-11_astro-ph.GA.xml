      <title>Kinematics of Cataclysmic Variables in the Solar Neighborhood in the Gaia Era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using high-precision astrometric data from Gaia DR3 and updated systemic velocities from the literature, kinematical properties of cataclysmic variables (CVs) were investigated. By constraining the data according to the total space velocity error and Galactic population class, a reliable sample of data was obtained. Non-magnetic CVs located in the thin disk have been found to have a total space velocity dispersion of $\sigma_{\nu} = 46.33\pm4.23$ km s$^{-1}$, indicating that the thin disk CVs with a mean kinematical age of $\tau = 3.95\pm0.75$ Gyr are much younger than the local thin disk of the Galaxy with $\tau\sim$6-9 Gyr. Total space velocity dispersions of non-magnetic CVs belonging to the thin disk component of the Galaxy were found to be $\sigma_{\nu}=47.67\pm3.94$ and $\sigma_{\nu}=44.43\pm4.33$ km s$^{-1}$ for the systems below and above the orbital period gap, respectively, corresponding to kinematical ages of $\tau=4.19\pm0.71$ and $\tau=3.61\pm0.74$ Gyr. $\gamma$ velocity dispersions of the thin disk CVs below and above the gap were obtained $\sigma_{\gamma} = 27.52\pm2.28$ and $\sigma_{\gamma} = 25.65\pm2.44$ km s$^{-1}$, respectively. This study also shows that the orbital period is decreasing with increasing age, as expected from the standard theory. The age-orbital period relation for non-magnetic thin disk CVs was obtained as $dP/dt=-2.09\pm0.22\times10^{-5}$ sec yr$^{-1}$. However, a significant difference could not be found between the $\gamma$ velocity dispersions of the systems below and above the gap, which were calculated to be $\sigma_{\gamma} = 27.52\pm2.28$ and $\sigma_{\gamma} = 25.65\pm2.44$ km s$^{-1}$, respectively.</description>

      <title>The Sloan Digital Sky Survey Reverberation Mapping Project: Insights on Maximizing Efficiency in Lag Measurements and Black-Hole Masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-year observations from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Reverberation Mapping (SDSS-RM) project have significantly increased the number of quasars with reliable reverberation-mapping lag measurements. We statistically analyze target properties, light-curve characteristics, and survey design choices to identify factors crucial for successful and efficient RM surveys. Analyzing 172 high-confidence ("gold") lag measurements from SDSS-RM for the H$\beta$, MgII, and CIV emission lines, we find that the Durbin-Watson statistic (a statistical test for residual correlation) is the most significant predictor of light curves suitable for lag detection. Variability signal-to-noise ratio and emission-line placement on the detector also correlate with successful lag measurements. We further investigate the impact of observing cadence on survey design by analyzing the effect of reducing observations in the first year of SDSS-RM. Our results demonstrate that a modest reduction in observing cadence to $\sim$1.5 weeks between observations can retain approximately 90% of the lag measurements compared to twice-weekly observations in the initial year. Provided similar and uniform sampling in subsequent years, this adjustment has a minimal effect on the overall recovery of lags across all emission lines. These results provide valuable inputs for optimizing future RM surveys.</description>

      <title>Conditions for Super-Eddington Accretion onto the First Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations of supermassive black holes at high redshift challenge our understanding of the evolution of the first generation of black holes (BHs) in proto-galactic environments. One possibility is that they grow much more rapidly than current estimates of feedback and accretion efficiency permit. Following our previous analysis of super-Eddington accretion onto stellar-mass black holes in mini-haloes under no-feedback conditions, we now investigate whether this can be sustained when thermal feedback is included. We use four sets of cosmological simulations at sub-pc resolution with initial black hole masses varying from $1 \times 10^3 - 6 \times 10^4 M_\odot$, exploring a range of feedback efficiencies. We also vary the feedback injection radius to probe the threshold of numerical overcooling. We find that super-Eddington growth sustained on the order of $\sim$$100 \, \rm kyr$ is possible with very weak thermal feedback efficiency in all environments and moderate efficiency for the $6 \times 10^4 M_\odot$ BH. Trans-Eddington growth is possible for a $3 \times 10^3 - 6 \times 10^6 M_\odot$ BH at moderate feedback efficiencies. We discuss the effectiveness of thermal feedback in heating the gas, suppressing accretion, and driving outflows at these parameter configurations. Our results suggest that super-Eddington growth may be possible in the presence of thermal feedback for black holes formed from the first stars.</description>

      <title>A SPectroscopic survey of biased halos In the Reionization Era (ASPIRE): Spectroscopically Complete Census of Obscured Cosmic Star Formation Rate Density at $z=4-6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a stringent measurement of the dust-obscured star-formation rate density (SFRD) at $z=4-6$ from the ASPIRE JWST Cycle-1 medium and ALMA Cycle-9 large program. We obtained JWST/NIRCam grism spectroscopy and ALMA 1.2-mm continuum map along 25 independent quasar sightlines, covering a total survey area of $\sim$35 arcmin$^2$ where we search for dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) at $z = 0 - 7$. We identify eight DSFGs in seven fields at $z=4-6$ through the detection of H$\alpha$ or [O III] $\lambda$5008 lines, including fainter lines such as H$\beta$, [O III] $\lambda$4960, [N II] $\lambda$6585, [S II] $\lambda\lambda$6718,6733 for six sources. With this spectroscopically complete DSFG sample at $z=4-6$ and negligible impact from cosmic variance (shot noise), we measure the infrared luminosity function (IRLF) down to $L_\mathrm{IR} \sim 2\times10^{11}$ $L_\odot$. We find flattening of IRLF at $z=4-6$ towards the faint end (power-law slope $\alpha = 0.59_{-0.45}^{+0.39}$). We determine the dust-obscured cosmic SFRD at this epoch as $\log[\rho_\mathrm{SFR,IR} / (\mathrm{M}_\odot\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-3})] = -1.52_{-0.13}^{+0.14}$. This is significantly higher than previous determination using ALMA data in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field, which is void of DSFGs at $z=4-6$ because of strong cosmic variance (shot noise). We conclude that the majority ($66\pm7$%) of cosmic star formation at $z \sim 5$ is still obscured by dust. We also discuss the uncertainty of SFRD propagated from far-IR spectral energy distribution and IRLF at the bright end, which will need to be resolved with future ALMA and JWST observations.</description>

      <title>The MUSE Ultra Deep Field (VIII): A 5 Mpc stretch of the z $\approx$ 4 cosmic web revealed in emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We detect Ly$\alpha$ emission from a ~5 Mpc-long (comoving) portion of the cosmic web hosting an overdensity ($\delta \approx 25$) of 19 Ly$\alpha$ emitters (LAEs) at $z\approx 4$ within the MUSE Ultra Deep Field (MUDF), reaching an average surface brightness (SB) of $5\times 10^{-20}~\rm{erg~s^{-1}~ cm^{-2}~arcsec^{-2}}$. This large-scale structure has an average SB similar to the filament across the two MUDF quasars at $z\approx 3.22$. However, deep multiwavelength data do not show a clear presence of active galactic nuclei, suggesting that the emission is mainly regulated by the underlying gas density. We find $\approx 0.2$ dex higher star formation compared to control samples and a remarkable predominance (5/7) of blue-peaked emission lines in the spectra of the embedded LAEs, indicative of favorable conditions for gas accretion. Lastly, we quantify the contribution of intragalactic gas to the Ly$\alpha$ SB profile at large distances from LAEs. By studying samples of filaments detected in emission within diverse environments, we are finally gaining new insight into the physics of gas accretion within the cosmic web.</description>

      <title>The Pristine Inner Galaxy Survey (PIGS) XI: Revealing the chemical evolution of the interacting Sagittarius dwarf galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy (Sgr dSph) is a satellite orbiting the Milky Way that has experienced multiple stripping events due to tidal interactions with our Galaxy. Its accretion history has led to a distinct stellar overdensity, which is the remnant of the core of the progenitor. We present a complete chemical analysis of 111 giant stars in the core of Sgr dSph to investigate the chemical evolution and enrichment history of this satellite. Employing the metallicity-sensitive Ca H&amp;K photometry from the Pristine Inner Galaxy Survey, we selected stars spanning a wide metallicity range and obtained high-resolution spectra with the ESO FLAMES/GIRAFFE multi-object spectrograph. For the stellar sample covering $-2.13 &lt; \rm{[Fe/H] &lt; -0.35}$, we derived abundances for up to 14 chemical elements with average uncertainties of $\sim 0.09$ dex and a set of stellar ages which allowed us to build an age-metallicity relation (AMR) for the entire sample. With the most comprehensive set of chemical species measured for the core of Sgr, we studied several [X/Fe] ratios. Most trends align closely with Galactic chemical trends, but notable differences emerge in the heavy $n$-capture elements, which offer independent insights into the star formation history of a stellar population. The deficiency in the $\alpha$-elements with respect the Milky Way suggests a slower, less efficient early star formation history, similar to other massive satellites. $S$-process element patterns indicate significant enrichment from AGB stars over time. The AMR and chemical ratios point to an extended star formation history, with a rapid early phase in the first Gyr, followed by declining activity and later star-forming episodes. These findings are consistent with Sgr hosting multiple stellar populations, from young ($\sim 4$ Gyr) to old, metal-poor stars ($\sim 10$ Gyr)</description>

      <title>On the kinematic and thermodynamic state of clouds in complex wind-multi-cloud environments using a Friends-of-Friends analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the interaction between a shock-driven hot wind and a cold multi-cloud layer, for conditions commonly found in interstellar and circumgalactic gas. We present a method for identifying distinct clouds using a Friends-of-Friends algorithm. This approach unveils novel detailed information about individual clouds and their collective behaviour. By tracing the evolution of individual clouds, our method provides comprehensive descriptions of cloud morphology, including measures of the elongation and fractal dimension. Combining the kinematics and morphology of clouds, we refine previous models for drag and entrainment processes. Our by-cloud analysis allows to discern the dominant entrainment processes at different times. We find that after the initial shock passage, momentum transfer due to condensation becomes increasingly important, compared to ram pressure, which dominates at early times. We also find that internal motions within clouds act as an effective dynamic pressure that exceeds the thermal pressure by an order of magnitude. Our analysis shows how the highly efficient cooling of the warm mixed gas at temperatures $\sim 10^{5}$ K is effectively balanced by the kinetic energy injected by the hot wind into the warm and cold phases via shocks and shear motions. Compression-driven condensation and turbulence dissipation maintain a multi-phase outflow and can help explain the presence of dense gas in galaxy-scale winds. Finally, we show that applying our Friends-of-Friends analysis to $\rm{H}_\rm{I}$-emitting gas and correcting for beam size and telescope sensitivity can explain two populations of $\rm{H}_\rm{I}$ clouds within the Milky-Way nuclear wind as structures pertaining to the same outflow.</description>

      <title>Time to Sparkler. Accurate ages of lensed globular clusters at $z=1.4$ with JWST photometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Determining reliable ages for old stellar objects at different redshifts offers a powerful means to constrain cosmology without relying on a specific cosmological model: this is known as the cosmic clocks method. Globular clusters (GCs), long recognised as hosts of the Universe's oldest stars, have served as the archetypical cosmic clocks. However, their age estimates have traditionally been confined to redshift z=0, limiting their role to constraining the present-day age of the Universe. Here we explore how to measure reliable ages of GCs well beyond $z=0$, leveraging their potential to extend cosmic clock measurements to earlier epochs. Specifically, we use 6-band JWST/NIRCam high-precision photometry of candidate stellar clusters in the Sparkler galaxy, located at redshift $z$=1.378 and strongly lensed by the galaxy cluster SMACS J0723.3-7327. By employing stellar population models within a Bayesian inference framework, we constrain the GCs' ages, star formation histories, metallicities, and dust attenuation. The five compact sources previously identified as GCs, based on their red spectral energy distributions being consistent with the colours of old stellar systems, yield a formation age of $1.9\pm0.4$ Gyr on average. This result implies a total age of the Universe that aligns well with the $\Lambda$CDM model derived from Planck18 data. Recent space-based observations have uncovered a wealth of lensed GCs as well as globulars within the member galaxies of the clusters themselves. These findings suggest that the pool of objects available for cosmic clock studies is enormous. A systematic multi-band photometric survey of GCs in and behind galaxy clusters, using facilities like Euclid and JWST, would therefore be a powerful tool for estimating cluster ages across a large range of redshifts, allowing the Universe to be dated across an unprecedented range of epochs.</description>

      <title>Epsilon Canis Majoris: The Brightest EUV Source with Surprisingly Low Interstellar Absorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The B2 star $\epsilon$ CMa, at parallax distance $d = 124\pm2$~pc, dominates the H I photoionization of the local interstellar cloud (LIC). At its closer parallax distance compared to previous estimates, $\epsilon$ CMa has a 0.9 mag fainter absolute magnitude $M_V =-3.97\pm0.04$. We combine measurements of distance with the integrated flux $f = (41.5\pm3.3) \times 10^{-6}~{\rm erg~cm}^{-2}~{\rm s}^{-1}$ and angular diameter $\theta_d = 0.80\pm0.05$~mas to produce a consistent set of stellar parameters: radius $R = 10.7\pm0.7~R_{\odot}$, mass $M = 13.1\pm2.3~M_{\odot}$, gravity $\log g = 3.50\pm0.05$, effective temperature $T_{\rm eff} \approx 21,000$~K, and luminosity $L \approx 20,000~L_{\odot}$. These parameters place Epsilon CMa outside the $\beta$ Cephei instability strip, consistent with its observed lack of pulsations. The observed EUV spectrum yields a hydrogen photoionization rate $\Gamma_{\rm HI} \approx 10^{-15}$ s$^{-1}$ (at Earth). The total flux decrement factor at the Lyman limit ($\Delta_{\rm LL} = 5000\pm500$) is a combination of attenuation in the stellar atmosphere ($\Delta_{\rm star} = 110\pm10$) and interstellar medium ($\Delta_{\rm ISM} = 45\pm5$) with optical depth $\tau_{\rm LL} = 3.8\pm0.1$. After correcting for interstellar HI column density $N_{\rm HI} = (6\pm1)\times10^{17}~{\rm cm}^{-2}$, we find a stellar LyC photon flux $\Phi_{\rm LyC} \approx 3000~{\rm cm}^{-2}~{\rm s}^{-1}$ and ionizing luminosity $Q_{\rm LyC} = 10^{45.7\pm0.3}$ photons s$^{-1}$. The photoionization rate $\Gamma_{\rm H} \approx$ (1-2)$\times 10^{-14}~{\rm s}^{-1}$ at the cloud surface produces an ionization fraction (30-40\%) for total hydrogen density $n_{\rm H} = 0.2$ cm$^{-3}$. With its $27.3\pm0.4$ km/s heliocentric radial velocity and small proper motion, $\epsilon$ CMa passed within $9.3\pm0.5$ pc of the Sun 4.4 Myr ago, with a 180 times higher photoionization rate.</description>

      <title>Photometric Selection of type 1 Quasars in the XMM-LSS Field with Machine Learning and the Disk-Corona Connection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present photometric selection of type 1 quasars in the $\approx5.3~{\rm deg}^{2}$ XMM-Large Scale Structure (XMM-LSS) survey field with machine learning. We constructed our training and \hbox{blind-test} samples using spectroscopically identified SDSS quasars, galaxies, and stars. We utilized the XGBoost machine learning method to select a total of 1\,591 quasars. We assessed the classification performance based on the blind-test sample, and the outcome was favorable, demonstrating high reliability ($\approx99.9\%$) and good completeness ($\approx87.5\%$). We used XGBoost to estimate photometric redshifts of our selected quasars. The estimated photometric redshifts span a range from 0.41 to 3.75. The outlier fraction of these photometric redshift estimates is $\approx17\%$ and the normalized median absolute deviation ($\sigma_{\rm NMAD}$) is $\approx0.07$. To study the quasar disk-corona connection, we constructed a subsample of 1\,016 quasars with HSC $i&lt;22.5$ after excluding radio-loud and potentially X-ray-absorbed quasars. The relation between the optical-to-X-ray power-law slope parameter ($\alpha_{\rm OX}$) and the 2500 Angstrom monochromatic luminosity ($L_{2500}$) for this subsample is $\alpha_{\rm OX}=(-0.156\pm0.007)~{\rm log}~{L_{\rm 2500}}+(3.175\pm0.211)$ with a dispersion of 0.159. We found this correlation in good agreement with the correlations in previous studies. We explored several factors which may bias the $\alpha_{\rm OX}$-$L_{\rm 2500}$ relation and found that their effects are not significant. We discussed possible evolution of the $\alpha_{\rm OX}$-$L_{\rm 2500}$ relation with respect to $L_{\rm 2500}$ or redshift.</description>

Abstract: Context: The study of quasar outflows is essential in understanding the connection between active galactic nuclei (AGN) and their host galaxies. We analyze the VLT/UVES spectrum of quasar SDSS J0932+0840 and identify several narrow and broad outflow components in absorption, with multiple ionization species including Fe II, which puts it among a rare class of outflows known as FeLoBALs. Aims: We study one of the outflow components to determine its physical characteristics by determining the total hydrogen column density, ionization parameter and the hydrogen number density. Through these parameters, we aim to obtain the distance of the outflow from the central source, its mass outflow rate and kinetic luminosity, and to constrain the contribution of the outflow to AGN feedback. Methods: We obtain the ionic column densities from the absorption troughs in the spectrum, and use photoionization modeling to extract the physical parameters of the outflow, including the total hydrogen column density and ionization parameter. The relative population of the observed excited states of Fe II is used to model the hydrogen number density of the outflow. Results: We use the Fe II excited states to model the electron number density ($n_e$) and hydrogen number density ($n_H$) independently and obtain $n_e$ $\simeq$ $10^{3.4}$ cm$^{-3}$ and $n_H$ $\simeq$ $10^{4.8}$ cm$^{-3}$. Our analysis of the physical structure of the cloud shows that these two results are consistent with each other. This places the outflow system at a distance of $0.7_{-0.4}^{+0.9}$ kpc from the central source, with mass flow rate ($\dot{M}$) of $43^{+65}_{-26}$ $M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ and kinetic luminosity ($\dot{E_k}$) of $0.7^{+1.1}_{-0.4}$ $\times$ $10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>JWST UNCOVERs the Optical Size - Stellar Mass Relation at $4&lt;z&lt;8$: Rapid Growth in the Sizes of Low Mass Galaxies in the First Billion Years of the Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the rest-frame optical and ultraviolet morphology of galaxies in the first billion years of the Universe. Using JWST data from the UNCOVER and MegaScience surveys targeting the lensing cluster Abell 2744 we present multi-band morphological measurements for a sample of 995 galaxies selected using 20-band NIRCam photometry and 35 using NIRSpec Prism spectroscopy over the redshift range of $4&lt;z&lt;8$. The wavelength-dependent morphology is measured using pysersic by simultaneously modeling the images in 6 NIRCam wide filters covering the rest-frame UV to optical. The joint modeling technique increases the precision of measured radii by 50\%. Galaxies in our sample show a wide range of Sersic indices, with no systematic difference between optical and UV morphology. We model the size-mass relation in a Bayesian manner using a continuity model to directly fit the redshift evolution while accounting for observational uncertainties. We find the average size of galaxies at $\log M_*/M_\odot=8.5$ grows rapidly, from 400 pc at $z=8$ to 830 pc at $z=4$. This is faster evolution than expected from power law scalings of the Hubble parameter or scale factor that describe well previous results at $z&lt;2$. This suggests that different and/or much stronger processes affect low mass systems during the epoch of reionization. The measured logarithmic slope (0.25) and scatter (0.23 dex) are non-evolving. We discuss the remarkable consistency of the slope and scatter over cosmic time in the context of the galaxy-halo connection.</description>

      <title>Impact of the shape of the prestellar density fluctuations on the core mass function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that departure from sphericity in the geometry of primordial dark matter halos modifies their mass function. The ellipsoidal collapse model yields a better agreement with simulations of hierarchical clustering than the original, spherical model. In the present paper, we examine the same issue in the context of star formation by studying the impact of non-sphericity of density perturbations in a gravoturbulent medium on the prestellar core mass function (CMF). An important question, notably, is to find out how ellipsoidal, instead of spherical, initial density fluctuations modify both the high-mass and low-mass tails of the CMF. Our study shows that triaxial density fluctuations indeed depart from a purely spherical form but the deformation (prolateness and ellipticity) remains modest, suggesting that the usual hypothesis of spherical collapse in existing theories of the IMF is reasonable. We find that, as in the cosmological case, the departure from sphericity increases the collapse barrier, stabilizing the prestellar cores. The striking difference between the stellar case and the cosmological one for the ellipsoidal collapse model is that, although in both cases the less dense structures are the most deformed, they correspond to small scales, thus low mass halos in cosmology but to large scales, thus large mass cores in star formation. As a result, the high mass range of the CMF is the most affected by the ellipsoidal collapse, resulting in a slightly less steep slope than the one predicted with the spherical hypothesis and a peak slightly shifted toward lower masses.</description>

      <title>Associated HI absorption and AGN feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The presence, distribution and kinematics of atomic neutral hydrogen in the central regions of galaxies can be traced by the HI 21~cm line observed in absorption. Depending only on the strength of the radio continuum, the associated absorption can trace the gas down to pc scale, which is ideal for exploring the HI in the nuclear regions of radio AGN. This paper gives a brief overview of the main recent findings with particular focus on the AGN-driven HI outflows. Absorption has made possible the discovery of fast and massive HI outflows and their clumpy structure on pc scales. The similarities with the predictions of numerical simulations confirm the impact of young radio jets in the feedback cycle and galaxy evolution. The field of HI absorption is rapidly expanding thanks to new ``blind" surveys and the increased spectral capabilities of the radio telescopes. This opens many possibilities for future discoveries and complements the studies of HI emission.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Halo Radius Definition on Subhalo Occupation Variation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dark Matter halo properties have been studied extensively within the virial radius of host halo systems, and previous research shows that there are correlations between host halo properties and subhalo occupation. This work explores how the correlation would change when one extends the definition of subhalo occupation out to 1.5 Mpc for Milky Way-mass host halos. We compute the correlations between four host halo properties (half-mass scale, concentration, peak-mass scale, and spin) and subhalo occupation with varying halo radius definitions. We find that the host halo properties impact satellite occupation beyond the virial radius and the locations at which the correlation peaks do not typically align with the virial radius or splashback radius. The behavior of the subhalo occupation variation as a function of radius, especially in the outskirts, is connected to the effect of halo assembly bias. However, there is no universal behavior in the subhalo occupation variation as the halo radius definition changes. We further find that using a ratio of the number of subhalos within an individual host system rather than total number counts can, to some extent, eliminate its concentration dependence. This method shows promise for using observed satellite counts to estimate host halo mass. Our analysis highlights the utility of extending observational surveys of satellite galaxies to beyond the virial radius.</description>

      <title>Not just PAH$_{3.3}$: why galaxies turn red in the Near-Infrared</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We measure the spectral properties of a sample of 20 galaxies at z~0.35 selected for having surprisingly red JWST/NIRCAM F200W-F444W colors. 19 galaxies were observed with JWST/NIRSpec in the PRISM configuration, while one galaxy was observed with the high resolution gratings. 17/20 galaxies in our sample exhibit strong 3.3 $\mu m$ polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH$_{3.3}$) emission (equivalent width EW(PAH$_{3.3}$)$&gt;0.03\mu m$). In these galaxies, the strength of the color excess does not depend on environment and it correlates with EW(PAH$_{3.3}$). Nonetheless, the presence of the PAH$_{3.3}$ alone can not fully explain the color excess, as an equivalent width of ~0.1$\mu m$ is able to increase the color of galaxies by only 0.13 mag. A contribution from a hot dust component is required to explain the excess. Both the EW(PAH$_{3.3}$) and flux correlate with the H$\alpha$ equivalent width and flux, suggesting that they are produced by the same mechanism. 5/20 galaxies showing PAH would be classified as passive based on broad band rest frame colors ((B-V) and/or UVJ diagrams) and are hence "faux-passive". Of these, 3 galaxies have a significantly lower EW(PAH$_{3.3}$) given their color and also have low EW(H$\alpha$) and we tentatively conclude this behaviour is due to the presence of an AGN. The three galaxies with no PAH$_{3.3}$ in emission have passive spectra, as do the 8 galaxies in our sample with normal F200W-F444W colors. We therefore conclude that the PAH$_{3.3}$ feature is linked to dust-enshrouded star formation. The dust corrected SFR from PAH$_{3.3}$ is a factor of 3.5 higher than the SFR obtained from H$\alpha$, suggesting that these galaxies are characterized by significant amounts of dust.</description>

      <title>The Age-velocity Dispersion Relations of the Galactic Disk as Revealed by the LAMOST-Gaia Red Clump Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using nearly 230,000 red clump stars selected from LAMOST and Gaia, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of the stellar age-velocity dispersion relations (AVRs) for various disk populations, within 5.0 $\leq$ $R$ $\leq$ 15.0 kpc and $|Z|$ $\leq$ 3.0 kpc. The AVRs of the whole RC sample stars are accurately described as $\sigma_{v}$ = $\sigma_{v,0}$ ($\tau$ + 0.1)$^{\beta_{v}}$, with $\beta_{R}$, $\beta_{\phi}$ and $\beta_{Z}$ displaying a global exponential decreasing trend with $R$, which may point to the difference in spatial distributions of various disk heating mechanisms. The measurements of $\beta$ $-$ $R$ for various disks suggest that the thin disk exhibits a radial dependence, with a global exponential decreasing trend in $\beta_{R}$ $-$ $R$ and $\beta_{Z}$ $-$ $R$, while $\beta_{\phi}$ remains a nearly constant value (around 0.20$\sim$0.25) within 8.5 $\leq$ $R$ $\leq$ 11.5 kpc. The thick disk displays a global increasing trend in $\beta_{R}$ $-$ $R$, $\beta_{\phi}$ $-$ $R$ and $\beta_{Z}$ $-$ $R$. These results indicate that the thin disk stars are likely heated by long-term heating from GMCs and spiral arms, while thick disk stars are likely heated by some violent heating process from merger and accretion, and/or formed by the inside-out and upside-down star formation scenarios, and/or born in the chaotic mergers of gas-rich systems and/or turbulent ISM. Our results also suggest that the disk perturbation by a recent minor merger from Sagittarius may have occurred within 3.0 Gyr.</description>

      <title>The first exploration of the correlations between \textit{WISE} 12 \micron\ and CO emission in early-type galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the analysis of a comprehensive sample of 352 early-type galaxies using public data, to investigate the correlations between CO luminosities and mid-infrared luminosities observed by \textit{Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer} (\textit{WISE}). We find strong correlations between both CO (1-0) and CO (2-1) luminosities and 12 \micron\ luminosity, boasting a correlation coefficient greater than 0.9 and an intrinsic scatter smaller than 0.1 dex. The consistent slopes observed for the relationships of CO (1-0) and CO (2-1) suggest that the line ratio R21 lacks correlation with mid-infrared emission in early-type galaxies, which is significantly different from star-forming galaxies. Moreover, the slopes of $L_{\rm CO (1-0)}$--$L_{\mbox{12\micron}}$ and $L_{\rm CO (2-1)}$--$L_{\mbox{12\micron}}$ relations in early-type galaxies are steeper than those observed in star-forming galaxies. Given the absence of correlation with color, morphology or sSFR, the correlation between deviations and the molecular gas mass surface density could be eliminated by correcting the possible 12 \micron\ emission from old stars or adopting a systematically different $\alpha_{\rm CO}$. The latter, on average, is equivalent to adding an constant CO brightness density, specifically ${2.8{_{-0.6}}\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!^{+0.8}}~[\mathrm{K~km~s^{-1}}]$ and ${4.4{_{-1.4}}\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!^{+2.2}}~[\mathrm{K~km~s^{-1}}]$ for CO (1-0) and (2-1) respectively. These explorations will serve as useful tools for estimating the molecular gas content in gas-poor galaxies and understanding associated quenching processes.</description>

      <title>Pushing ALMA to the limit: 140 pc resolution observations of a z=6.6 quasar-galaxy merger resolve strikingly different morphologies of dust continuum and [CII] 158 um emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present $0."026$ $(140\ \rm{pc})$ resolution ALMA observations of [C II] $158\ \mu\rm{m}$ and dust continuum emission of the $z=6.6$ quasar J0305--3150, resolved over $\sim 300-400$ independent resolution elements. The dust continuum emission is compact with $\sim 80\%$ recovered within $r&lt;0."3$ $(1.6\ \rm{kpc})$, whereas the [C II] emission profile is composed of a central Gaussian ($r&lt;0."4$, i.e. $&lt;2.2\ \rm{kpc}$) and an extended component (detected up to $\sim 10\ \rm{kpc}$ at $&gt;3\sigma$). We infer a direct contribution of the quasar to the observed 260\ \rm{GHz} continuum $S_{\nu,\rm{QSO}} / S_{\nu,\rm{QSO+Host}} \lesssim 1\%$. We report the detection of FIR-detected star-forming clumps with $r&lt;200 \ \rm{pc}$ and properties similar to that of rest-frame UV-optical clumps reported in the literature. The $200\ \rm{pc}$ resolved [C II]/FIR ratio follows the global relation with the FIR surface brightness established in low- and high-redshift galaxies, even at the quasar location. We find that dust continuum is emitted in regions of $\sim0."02-0."04$ consistent with the size of photo-dissociation regions (PDR), whereas $50\%$ of the [C II] originates from larger physical scales ($\theta \gtrsim 2"$). The large-scale [C II] emission presents a velocity gradient aligned with a nearby companion with perturbed kinematics, and misaligned with the kinematics of the small-scale emission. The absence of significant [C II] emission by structures with physical scale $\lesssim 1\ \rm{kpc}$ implies that [C II] emission is not produced in dense PDR located at the boundary of Giant Molecular Clouds. We argue instead that [C II] is produced in low-density PDRs in the interstellar medium and diffuse HI gas tidally-stripped during the ongoing merger.</description>

      <title>The S2 orbit and tidally disrupted binaries: indications for collisional depletion in the Galactic center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The properties of the stellar cluster surrounding Sagittarius A* can be assessed indirectly through the motion of the S-stars. Specifically, the current accuracy to which the prograde precession of the S2 star is measured allows to place significant constraints on the extended mass enclosed by its orbit. We suggest that high velocity destructive collisions (DCs) offer a natural mechanism for depleting the mass inside the S2 orbit, thus allowing to reconcile the measured precession and the existence of a dense stellar cluster. Such a solution is especially necessary when considering that stars are supplied to the inner part of the cluster by both dynamical relaxation and by stars being captured in tight orbits during tidal disruption of binaries. We use analytic arguments and results from simulations to demonstrate that in order to obtain a precession that is consistent with observations, collisional depletion is necessary if the capture rate is greater than a few $10^{-6} yr^{-1}$. We also show that fluctuations arising from the finite number of stars cannot serve as an alternative to DCs for generating consistency with the observed S2 precession. We conclude that astrometric observations of the S-stars provide a meaningful indication that the inner part of our galactic center is shaped by collisional depletion, supporting the hypothesis that DCs occur in galactic nuclei at an astrophysically significant rate.</description>

      <title>On volume density and star formation in nearby molecular clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Volume density is a key physical quantity controlling the evolution of the interstellar medium (ISM) and star formation, but it cannot be accessed directly by observations of molecular clouds. We aim at estimating the volume density distribution in nearby molecular clouds, to measure the relation between column and volume densities and to determine their roles as predictors of star formation. We develop an inverse modelling method to estimate the volume density distributions of molecular clouds. We apply this method to 24 nearby molecular clouds for which column densities have been derived using Herschel observations and for which star formation efficiencies (SFE) have been derived using observations with the Spitzer space telescope. We then compare the relationships of several column- and volume-density based descriptors of dense gas with the SFE of the clouds. We derive volume density distributions for 24 nearby molecular clouds, which represents the most complete sample of such distributions to date. The relationship between column densities and peak volume densities in these clouds is a piece-wise power-law relation that changes its slope at a column density of $5-10\times 10^{22}$ H$_2$cm$^{-2}$. We interpret this as a signature of hierarchical fragmentation in the dense ISM. We find that the volume-density based dense gas fraction is the best predictor of star formation in the clouds, and in particular, it is as anticipated a better predictor than the column-density based dense gas fraction. We also derive a volume density threshold density for star formation of $2\times 10^4$ H$_2$cm$^{-3}$.</description>

      <title>Radiation-driven dusty outflows from early galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has discovered an overabundance of UV-bright ($M_{\rm UV} \lesssim -20$), massive galaxies at $z \gtrsim 10$ in comparison to pre-JWST theoretical predictions. Among the proposed interpretations, such excess has been explained by negligible dust attenuation conditions following radiation-driven outflows developing when a galaxy goes through a super-Eddington phase. Dust opacity decreases the classical Eddington luminosity by a (boost) factor $A$, thus favoring the driving of outflows by stellar radiation in compact, initially dusty galaxies. Here, we compute $A$ as a function of the galaxy stellar mass, gas fraction, galaxy size, and metallicity (a total of 8 parameters). We find that the main dependence is on metallicity and, for the fiducial model, $A \sim 1800(Z/Z_\odot)/(1+N_{\rm H}/10^{23.5}\, {\rm cm^2})$. We apply such results to 20 spectroscopically confirmed galaxies at $z \gtrsim 10$ and evaluate their modified Eddington ratio. We predict that three galaxies are in the outflow phase. Their outflows have relatively low velocities ($60 -100 \,{\rm km\ s^{-1}}$), implying that they are unlikely to escape from the system. For the remaining 17 galaxies that are not currently in the outflow phase, we calculate the past evolution of the modified Eddington ratio from their star formation history. We find that 15 of them experienced an outflow phase prior to observation during which they effectively displaced their dust to larger radii. Thus, radiation-driven outflows appear to be a common phenomenon among early galaxies, strongly affecting their visibility.</description>

Abstract: HI-rich absorbers seen within quasar spectra contain the bulk of neutral gas in the Universe. However, the spatial extent of these reservoirs are not extensively studied due to the pencil beam nature of quasar sightlines. Using two giant gravitational arc fields (at redshifts 1.17 and 2.06) as 2D background sources with known strong MgII absorption observed with the MUSE integral field spectrograph (IFS), we investigated whether spatially mapped MgII absorption can predict the presence of strong HI systems, and determine both the physical extent and HI mass of the two absorbing systems. We created a simple model of an ensemble of gas clouds in order to simultaneously predict the HI column density and gas covering fraction of HI-rich absorbers based on observations of the MgII rest-frame equivalent width in IFS spaxels. We first test the model on the field with HI observations already available from the literature, finding that we can recover HI column densities consistent with the previous estimates (although with large uncertainties). We then use our framework to simultaneously predict the gas covering fraction, HI column density and total HI mass ($M_{\rm{HI}}$) for both fields. We find that both of the observed strong systems have a covering fraction of $\approx70$% and are likely damped Lyman $\alpha$ systems (DLAs) with $M_{\rm{HI}}&gt;10^9\ M_{\odot}$. Our model shows that the typical MgII metrics used in the literature to identify the presence of DLAs are sensitive to the gas covering fraction. However, these MgII metrics are still sensitive to strong HI, and can be still applied to absorbers towards gravitational arcs or other spatially extended background sources. Based on our results, we speculate that the two strong absorbers are likely representative of a neutral inner circumgalactic medium and are a significant reservoir of fuel for star formation within the host galaxies.</description>

      <title>VLASS-based survey of transition state galaxies and their relationship to compact peaked-spectrum radio sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present multi-frequency and high-resolution studies of a sample of 24 radio transients sources discovered by comparing the NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS) and Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS) surveys. All of them are characterized by a significant increase in radio flux density over the last two decades.Their convex spectra, small sizes and high brightness temperatures are typical for young gigahertz-peaked spectrum (GPS) radio sources and indicative of an AGN buried in the host galaxy. On the other hand, they are much weaker than the archetypical GPS objects and their parsec-scale radio structures, although indicating the presence of young radio jets, are similar to radio-quiet AGNs like Seyfert and low-ionization nuclear emission-line region (LINER) galaxies. Based on the distribution of these objects in power$-$size ($P - D$) and peak frequency$-$size ($\nu_p - D$) diagrams, we suggest that after stabilizing their radio activity, some of the GHz-peaked radio transients (galaxies and quasars) will develop into radio-intermediate and radio-quiet (RI/RQ) quasars and low-frequency peaked-spectrum (PS) objects. We discuss several possible origins for the transient radio emission in our sources and conclude that changes in the accretion rate combined with low-power radio ejecta are the most probable cause. This is the scenario we also propose for one of our sources, 101841$-$13, which was independently identified as a candidate tidal disruption event (TDE) based on its infrared variability. However, we cannot exclude that 101841$-$13 or other sources in our sample are TDEs.</description>

      <title>How do uncertainties in galaxy formation physics impact field-level galaxy bias?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our ability to extract cosmological information from galaxy surveys is limited by uncertainties in the galaxy-dark matter halo relationship for a given galaxy population, which are governed by the intricacies of galaxy formation. To quantify these uncertainties, we examine quenched and star-forming galaxies using two distinct approaches to modeling galaxy formation: UniverseMachine, an empirical semi-analytic model, and the IllustrisTNG hydrodynamical simulation. We apply a second-order hybrid N-body perturbative bias expansion to each galaxy sample, enabling direct comparison of modeling approaches and revealing how uncertainties in galaxy formation and the galaxy-halo connection affect bias parameters and non-Poisson noise across number density and redshift. Notably, we find that quenched and star-forming galaxies occupy distinct parts of bias parameter spacce, and that the scatter induced from these entirely different galaxy formation models is small when conditioned on similar selections of galaxies. We also detect a signature of assembly bias in our samples; this leads to small but significant deviations from predictions of the analytic bias, while samples with assembly bias removed match these predictions well. This work indicates that galaxy samples from a spectrum of reasonable, physically motivated models for galaxy formation roughly spanning our current understanding give a relatively small range of field-level galaxy bias parameters and relations. We estimate a set of priors from this set of models that should be useful in extracting cosmological information from LRG- and ELG-like samples. Looking forward, this indicates that careful estimates of the range of impacts of galaxy formation for a given sample and cosmological analysis will be an essential ingredient for extracting the most precise cosmological information from current and future large galaxy surveys.</description>

      <title>M87: a cosmic laboratory for deciphering black hole accretion and jet formation</title>

Abstract: Over the past decades, there has been significant progress in our understanding of accreting supermassive black holes (SMBHs) that drive active galactic nuclei (AGNs), both from observational and theoretical perspectives. As an iconic target for this area of study, the nearby giant elliptical galaxy M87 has received special attention thanks to its proximity, large mass of the central black hole and bright emission across the entire electromagnetic spectrum from radio to very-high-energy gamma rays. In particular, recent global millimeter-very-long-baseline-interferometer observations towards this nucleus have provided the first-ever opportunity to image the event-horizon-scale structure of an AGN, opening a new era of black hole astrophysics. On large scales, M87 exhibits a spectacular jet propagating far beyond the host galaxy, maintaining its narrowly collimated shape over seven orders of magnitude in distance. Elucidating the generation and propagation, as well as the internal structure, of powerful relativistic jets remains a longstanding challenge in radio-loud AGNs. M87 offers a privileged opportunity to examine such a jet with unprecedented detail. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the observational knowledge accumulated about the M87 black hole across various wavelengths. We cover both accretion and ejection processes at spatial scales ranging from outside the Bondi radius down to the event horizon. By compiling these observations and relevant theoretical studies, we aim to highlight our current understanding of accretion and jet physics for this specific object.</description>

      <title>Detecting the Black Hole Candidate Population in M51's Young Massive Star Clusters: Constraints on Accreting Intermediate Mass Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intermediate mass black holes (10^2 &lt; M_BH&lt; 10^5 Msun) are an open question in our understanding of black hole evolution and growth. They have long been linked to dense star cluster environments thanks to cluster dynamics, but there are a limited number of secure detections. We leverage existing X-ray observations from Chandra X-ray Observatory and optical catalogs from Hubble Space Telescope with new radio observations from the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array to search for any evidence of accreting black holes in young massive clusters in the nearby galaxy M51. We find that of 43 bright ($L_X &gt; 10^{38}$ erg/s) X-ray point sources in M51, 24 had probable matches to objects including possible associated star clusters in the HST Legacy Extragalactic UV Survey catalog, seven of which were classified as contaminants (background galaxies or foreground stars). We explore the optical properties of the remaining 17 sources, including cluster age and mass estimates, and search for radio counterparts in the 8-12 GHz band. The lack of radio counterparts to X-ray sources we know to be associated with young massive clusters in M51 suggests that we do not significantly detect hard-state IMBHs ~ 10^4 Msun or above. However, more sensitive radio facilities like the Square Kilometre Array and next generation Very Large Array may be able to provide evidence for IMBHs with masses down to ~ 10^3 Msun.</description>

      <title>Determining stellar properties of massive stars in NGC346 in the SMC with a Bayesian statistic technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: NGC 346 is a young cluster with numerous hot OB stars. It is part of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), and has an average metallicity that is one-seventh of the Milky Way's. A detailed study of its stellar content provides a unique opportunity to understand the stellar and wind properties of massive stars in low-metallicity environments, and enables us to improve our understanding of star formation and stellar evolution.
  The fundamental stellar parameters defining a star's spectral appearance are its effective surface temperature, surface gravity, and projected rotational velocity. Unfortunately, these parameters cannot be obtained independently from only H and He spectral features as they are partially degenerate. With this work we aim to overcome this degeneracy by applying a newly developed Bayesian statistic technique that can fit these three parameters simultaneously.
  Multi-epoch optical spectra are used in combination with a Bayesian statistic technique to fit stellar properties based on a publicly available grid of synthetic spectra of stellar atmospheres. The use of all of the multi-epoch observations simultaneously allows the identification of binaries.
  The stellar parameters for 34 OB stars within the core of NGC 346 are derived and presented here. By the use of both $\mathrm{He}\textsc{i}$ and $\mathrm{He}\textsc{ii}$ lines, the partial degeneracy between the stellar parameters of effective surface temperature, surface gravity, and projected rotational velocity is overcome. A lower limit to the binary fraction of the sample of stars is found to be at least 46%.
  Based on comparisons with analysis conducted on an overlapping sample of stars within NGC 346, the Bayesian statistic technique approach is shown to be a viable method to measure stellar parameters for hot massive stars in low-metallicity environments even when only low-resolution spectra are available.}</description>

      <title>Gaia20bdk -- a new FUor in Sh 2-301 Star Forming Region</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. We analyse multi-colour photometric and spectroscopic observations of a Young Stellar Object Gaia20bdk. Aims. We aim to investigate the exact nature of the eruptive phenomenon that the star has been experiencing since 2018. Methods. We use public-domain archival photometry to characterise the quiescent phase in order to establish major physical parameters of the progenitor. Then, we use our and public-domain optical and infrared photometry and spectroscopy to study the outburst. Results. Gaia20bdk is a member of the Sharpless 2-301 star-forming region, at a distance of 3.3 kpc. The progenitor is a rather massive 2.7 solar mass, G7-type Class I young star having an effective temperature of 5300 K and bolometric luminosity of 11 solar luminosities. The optical and infrared photometric and spectroscopic data obtained during the outburst show a variety of signatures commonly found in classical FUors. Our disc modelling results in a bolometric luminosity of 100-200 solar luminosities and mass accretion rate of 1-2e-5 solar masses per year, also confirming the object's FUor classification. Further monitoring is necessary to track the light changes, accretion rate and spectral variations, as well as to understood the mechanisms behind the disc flickering.</description>

      <title>Runaway O and Be stars found using Gaia DR3, new stellar bow shocks and search for binaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A relevant fraction of massive stars are runaways, moving with a significant peculiar velocity with respect to their environment. Kicks from supernova explosions or the dynamical ejection of stars from clusters can account for the runaway genesis. We have used Gaia DR3 data to study the velocity distribution of massive O and Be stars from the GOSC and BeSS catalogs and identify runaway stars using a 2D-velocity method. We have discovered 42 new runaways from GOSC and 47 from BeSS, among a total of 106 and 69 runaways found within these catalogs, respectively. These numbers imply a percentage of runaways of ~25% for O-type stars ~5% for Be-type stars. The higher percentages and higher velocities found for O-type compared to Be-type runaways suggest that the dynamical ejection scenario is more likely than the supernova explosion scenario. We have also performed multi-wavelength studies of our runaways. We have used WISE infrared images to discover 13 new stellar bow shocks around the runaway stars. We have also conducted VLA radio observations of some of these bow shocks. Finally, our runaway stars include six X-ray binaries and one gamma-ray binary, implying that new such systems could be found by conducting detailed multi-wavelength studies. In this work we report on this ongoing project to find new runaway stars, study their interaction with the ISM and search for high-energy binary systems.</description>

Abstract: The amplification of astrophysical magnetic fields takes place via dynamo instability in turbulent environments. The presence of vorticity is crucial for the dynamo to happen. However, the role of vorticity is not yet fully understood. This work is an extension of previous research on the effect of an irrotational subsonic forcing on a magnetized medium in the presence of rotation or a differential velocity profile, aimed at exploring a wider parameter space in terms of Reynolds numbers, magnetic Prandtl number, forcing scale, cooling timescale in a Newtonian cooling. We study the effect of imposing either the acceleration or the velocity forcing function to be curl-free and evaluate the terms responsible for the evolution vorticity. We use Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) to solve the fully compressible, resistive magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) equations with the Pencil Code. We study both isothermal and non-isothermal regimes and address the relative importance of different vorticity source terms.We report no small-scale dynamo for the models that do not include shear. We find a hydro instability, followed by a magnetic one, when a shearing velocity profile is applied. The vorticity production is found to be numerical in the purely irrotational case. Non-isothermality, rotation, shear or forcing in the form of a velocity curl-free, when included, contribute to increasing vorticity. Consistently with our previous study, we find that turbulence driven by subsonic expansion waves can amplify vorticity and magnetic field only in the presence of a background shearing profile. The presence of a cooling function make the instability happens on a shorter timescale. We estimate critical Reynolds and Magnetic Reynolds Numbes of 40 and 20, respectively.</description>

      <title>Dynamics around supermassive black holes: Extreme mass-ratio inspirals as gravitational-wave sources</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19443v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Supermassive black holes and their surrounding dense stellar environments nourish a variety of astrophysical phenomena. We focus on the distribution of stellar-mass black holes around the supermassive black hole and the consequent formation of extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs). We derive a steady-state distribution, considering the effects of two-body scattering and gravitational-wave emission, and calculate the EMRI formation rate, eccentricity distribution, and EMRI-to-plunge ratio. Our model predicts: (a) a stronger segregation than previously estimated at the outskirts of the sphere of influence (at $\sim0.01-2\rm pc$ for a Milky Way-like galaxy); (b) an increased EMRI-to-plunge ratio, favoring EMRIs at galaxies where stellar-mass black holes are scarce; (c) a detection of about $2\times10^3$ resolvable EMRIs, with a signal-to-noise ratio above $20$, along a $4\ \rm yr$ LISA mission time; and (d) a confusion noise, induced by a cosmological population of unresolved EMRIs, reducing the LISA sensitivity in the $1-5\ \rm mHz$ frequency range by up to a factor of $\approx2$, relative to the instrumental noise.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11125v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze high-resolution hydrodynamics simulations of an isolated disk dwarf galaxy with an explicit model for unresolved turbulence and turbulence-based star formation prescription. We examine the characteristic values of the star formation efficiency per free-fall time, $\epsilon_\mathrm{ff}$, and its variations with local environment properties, such as metallicity, UV flux, and surface density. We show that the star formation efficiency per free-fall time in $\approx 10$ pc star-forming regions of the simulated disks has values in the range $\epsilon_\mathrm{ff}\approx 0.01-0.1$, similar to observational estimates, with no trend with metallicity and only a weak trend with the UV flux. Likewise, $\epsilon_{\rm ff}$ estimated using projected patches of 500 pc size does not vary with metallicity and shows only a weak trend with average UV flux and gas surface density. The characteristic values of $\epsilon_\mathrm{ff}\approx 0.01-0.1$ arise naturally in the simulations via the combined effect of dynamical gas compression and ensuing stellar feedback that injects thermal and turbulent energy. The compression and feedback regulate the virial parameter, $\alpha_\mathrm{vir}$, in star-forming regions, limiting it to $\alpha_\mathrm{vir}\approx 3-10$. Turbulence plays an important role in the universality of $\epsilon_\mathrm{ff}$ because turbulent energy and its dissipation are not sensitive to metallicity and UV flux that affect thermal energy. Our results indicate that the universality of observational estimates of $\epsilon_\mathrm{ff}$ can be plausibly explained by the turbulence-driven and feedback-regulated properties of star-forming regions.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the role of the Simba feedback model on the structure of the Intra-Group Medium (IGrM) in the new Hyenas suite of cutting-edge cosmological zoom-in simulations. Using 34 high-resolution zooms of halos spanning from $10^{13}-10^{14}$ $M_\odot$ at $z=0.286$, we follow halos for 700 Myr, over several major active galactic nuclei (AGN) jet feedback events. We use the MOXHA package to generate mock Chandra X-ray observations, as well as predictive mocks for the upcoming LEM mission, identifying many feedback-generated features such as cavities, shock-fronts, and hot-spots, closely mimicking real observations. Our sample comprises $105$ snapshots with identified cavities, $50$ with single bubbles and $55$ with two, and spans three orders of magnitude in observed cavity enthalpies, from $10^{41}-10^{44}$ erg/s. Comparing semi-major axis length, midpoint radius, and eccentricity to a matched sample of observations, we find good agreement in cavity dimensions with real catalogues. We estimate cavity power from our mock maps following observational procedures, showing that this is typically more than enough to offset halo cooling, particularly in low-mass halos, where we match the observed excess in energy relative to cooling. Bubble enthalpy as measured with the usual midpoint pressure typically exceeds the energy released by the most recent jet event, hinting that the mechanical work is done predominantly at a lower pressure against the IGrM. We demonstrate for the first time that X-ray cavities are observable in a modern large-scale simulation suite and discuss the use of realistic cavity mock observations as new halo-scale constraints on feedback models in cosmological simulations.</description>

      <title>Mutual neutralization of C$_{60}^+$ and C$_{60}^-$ ions: Excitation energies and state-selective rate coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11851v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context: Mutual neutralization between cations and anions play an important role in determining the charge-balance in certain astrophysical environments. However, empirical data for such reactions involving complex molecular species has been lacking due to challenges in performing experimental studies, leaving the astronomical community to rely on decades old models with large uncertainties for describing these processes in the interstellar medium. Aims: To investigate the mutual neutralization (MN) reaction, C$_{60}^+$ + C$_{60}^-$ $\rightarrow$ C$_{60}^*$ + C$_{60}$, for collisions at interstellar-like conditions. Methods: The mutual neutralization reaction between C$_{60}^+$ and C$_{60}^-$ at collision energies of 100\,meV was studied using the Double ElectroStatic Ion Ring ExpEriment, DESIREE, and its merged-beam capabilities. To aid in the interpretation of the experimental results, semi-classical modeling based on the Landau-Zener approach was performed for the studied reaction. Results: We experimentally identify a narrow range of kinetic energies for the neutral reaction products. Modeling was used to calculate the quantum state-selective reaction probabilities, absolute cross sections, and rate coefficients of these MN reactions, using the experimental results as a benchmark. The MN cross sections are compared with model results for electron attachment to C$_{60}$ and electron recombination with C$_{60}^+$. Conclusions: The present results show that it is crucial to take mutual polarization effects, the finite sizes, and the final quantum states of both molecular ions into account for reliable predictions of MN rates expected to strongly influence the charge-balance and chemistry in, e.g., dense molecular clouds.</description>

      <title>Do stars still form in molecular gas within CO-dark dwarf galaxies?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10983v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the Milky Way and other main-sequence galaxies, stars form exclusively in molecular gas, which is traced by CO emission. However, low metallicity dwarf galaxies are often `CO-dark' in the sense that CO emission is not observable even at the high resolution and sensitivities of modern observing facilities. In this work we use ultra high-resolution simulations of four low-metalicity dwarf galaxies (which resolve star formation down to the scale of star-forming cores, 0.01 pc) combined with a time-dependent treatment of the chemistry of the interstellar medium, to investigate the star formation environment in this previously hidden regime. By generating synthetic observations of our models we show that the galaxies have high to extremely high dark gas fractions (0.13 to 1.00 dependent on beam size and conditions), yet despite this form stars. However, when examined on smaller scales, we find that the stars still form in regions dominated by molecular gas, it is simply that these are far smaller than the scale of the beam (1.5"). Thus, while stars in CO-dark dwarf galaxies form in small molecular cores like larger galaxies, their cloud-scale environment is very different.</description>

      <title>Atomic and molecular gas as traced by [C II] emission</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14284v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The latest ALMA and JWST observations provide new information on the birth and evolution of galaxies in the early Universe, at the epoch of reionization. Of particular importance are measurements at redshift $ z &gt; 5$ of their cold-gas budget, which is known to be the main fuel for star formation. A powerful tool for probing the physics characterising galaxies at high redshift is the \CII\ $158\,\rm \mu m$ emission line. Due to its low excitation potential, \CII\ emission can be produced in photodissociation regions, neutral atomic gas and molecular clouds. To properly capture the cold-gas processes taking place in such environments (molecule formation, self-shielding, dust grain catalysis, photoelectric and cosmic-ray heating), we make use of a new set of state-of-the-art hydrodynamic simulations (\coldsim) including time-dependent non-equilibrium chemistry, star formation, stellar evolution, metal spreading and feedback mechanisms. We are able to accurately track the evolution of \HI, \HII\ and H$_2$ in a cosmological context and predict the contribution of each gas phase to \CII\ luminosity. We provide formulas that can be used to estimate the mass of molecular and atomic gas from \CII\ detections. Furthermore, we analyse how conversion factors evolve with galactic properties, such as stellar metallicity, star formation rate and stellar mass. We demonstrate that \CII\ emission is dominated by \HI\ gas and most of the \CII\ luminosity is generated in warm, dense star-forming regions. Importantly, we conclude that, despite \CII\ tracing predominantly atomic rather than molecular gas, the \CII\ luminosity remains a robust indicator of the H$_2$ mass.</description>

      <title>Signal-to-noise Ratio Analytic Formulae of the Inspiral Binary Black Holes in TianQin</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19401v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Binary black holes are one of the important sources for the TianQin gravitational wave project. Our research has revealed that, for TianQin, the signal-to-noise ratio of inspiral binary black holes can be computed analytically. This finding is expected to greatly simplify the estimation of detection capabilities for binary black holes. In this paper, we demonstrated the signal-to-noise ratio relationships from stellar-mass black holes to massive black holes. With the all-sky average condition, the signal-to-noise ratio for most binary black hole signals can be determined with a relative error of $\lesssim10\%$, with notable deviations only for chirp masses near $1000~M_\odot$. In contrast, the signal-to-noise ratio without the average includes an additional term, which we refer to as the response factor. Although this term is not easily calculated analytically, we provide a straightforward estimation method with an error margin of $1\sigma$ within 2\%.</description>

      <title>Hitting the slopes: A spectroscopic view of UV continuum slopes of galaxies reveals a reddening at z &gt; 9.5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14532v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The UV continuum slope of galaxies, $\beta$, is a powerful diagnostic. Understanding the redshift evolution of $\beta$ and its dependence on key galaxy properties can shed light on the evolution of galaxy physical properties over cosmic time. In this study, we present $\beta$ measurements for 295 spectroscopically confirmed galaxies at $5.5&lt;z&lt;14.3$ selected primarily from JADES, where $\beta$ has been measured from high quality JWST NIRSpec/PRISM spectra. We find a median $\beta=-2.3$ across our full sample, and find mild increase in blueness of $\beta$ with increasing redshift and fainter UV magnitudes. Interestingly, we find evidence for the average $\beta$ at $z &gt; 9.5$ to begin to redden, deviating from the trend observed at $z &lt; 9.5$. By producing stacked spectra in bins of redshift and $\beta$, we derive trends between $\beta$ and dust attenuation, metallicity, ionization parameter, and stellar age indicators directly from spectra, finding a lack of dust attenuation to be the dominant driver of bluer $\beta$ values. We further report six galaxies with $\beta&lt;-3.0$, which show a range of spectroscopic properties and signs of significant LyC photon leakage. Finally, we show that the redder $\beta$ values at $z &gt; 9.5$ may require rapid build-up of dust reservoirs in the very early Universe or a significant contribution from the nebular continuum emission to the observed UV spectra, with the nebular continuum fraction depending on the gas temperatures and densities. Our modeling shows that in the absence of dust, nebular emission at $T &gt; 15,000$ K can reproduce the range of $\beta$ that we see in our sample. Higher gas temperatures driven by hot, massive stars can boost the fraction of nebular continuum emission, potentially explaining the observed $\beta$ values as well as bright UV magnitudes seen across galaxies at $z &gt; 10$.</description>

      <title>Tracing Hierarchical Star Formation out to Kiloparsec Scales in Nearby Spiral Galaxies with UVIT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00872v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Molecular clouds fragment under the action of supersonic turbulence &amp; gravity which results in a scale-free hierarchical distribution of star formation (SF) within galaxies. Recent studies suggest that the hierarchical distribution of SF in nearby galaxies shows a dependence on host galaxy properties. In this context, we study the nature of hierarchical SF from a few tens of pc up to several kpc in 4 nearby spiral galaxies NGC1566, NGC5194, NGC5457 &amp; NGC7793, by leveraging the large FoV &amp; high resolution FUV+NUV observations from the UltraViolet Imaging Telescope (UVIT). Using the two-point correlation function, we infer that the young star-forming clumps (SFCs) in the galaxies are arranged in a fractal-like hierarchical distribution, but only up to a maximum scale ($l_{corr}$) &amp; it ranges from 0.5 kpc to 3.1 kpc. The flocculent spiral NGC7793 has $\sim$5 times smaller $l_{corr}$ than the 3 grand design spirals, possibly due to its lower mass, low pressure environment &amp; lack of strong spiral arms. $l_{corr}$ being much smaller than the galaxy size suggests that the SF hierarchy does not extend to the full galaxy size &amp; it is likely an effect set by multiple physical mechanisms in the galaxy. The hierarchical distribution of SFCs dissipates within 10 to 50 Myr, signifying their migration away from their birthplaces over time. Our results suggest that the global hierarchical properties of SF in galaxies are not universal &amp; significant variations exist in the local &amp; global hierarchy parameters of a galaxy. This study also demonstrates the capabilities of UVIT in characterizing the SF hierarchy in nearby galaxies. In the future, a bigger sample can be employed to further understand the role of large-scale galaxy properties (morphology, environment) &amp; physical processes (feedback, turbulence, shear &amp; ISM conditions) on determining the non-universal hierarchical properties of SF in galaxies.</description>

      <title>Feedback from intermediate mass black holes on dwarf galaxy morphology at z=2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06495v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the influence of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) on galactic morphology, focusing on their evolution within dwarf galaxies at high redshift (z~2). Using high-resolution zoom-in cosmological simulations, we explore how IMBH properties, including seed masses, formation times, and feedback mechanisms, shape the morphology and properties of central dwarf galaxies. The simulations analyze galaxies in both high- and low-spin dark matter halos, under varying conditions of AGN feedback and black hole seeding methods, to assess their effects on gas fractions, star formation, and structural characteristics.
  Results indicate that AGN feedback, particularly wind strength, significantly impacts galactic properties. Strong feedback results in lower stellar masses, flatter morphologies, and intermediate rotational support, along with prominent central structures and low Sersic indices (n &lt; 2). These findings challenge the applicability of low-redshift diagnostics like Gini-M20 at high redshift. Synthetic JWST observations reveal that pixelation effects may overestimate galaxy sizes, highlighting the complexity of linking IMBH evolution with dwarf galaxy formation and morphology. This study provides new insights into the typical environments of IMBHs in dwarf galaxies and their role in shaping early galactic structures.</description>

      <title>zoomies: A tool to infer stellar age from vertical action in Gaia data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09878v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stellar age measurements are fundamental to understanding a wide range of astronomical processes, including Galactic dynamics, stellar evolution, and planetary system formation. However, extracting age information from main-sequence stars is complicated, with techniques often relying on age proxies in the absence of direct measurements. The Gaia data releases have enabled detailed studies of the dynamical properties of stars within the Milky Way, offering new opportunities to understand the relationship between stellar age and dynamics. In this study, we leverage high-precision astrometric data from Gaia DR3 to construct a stellar age prediction model based only on stellar dynamical properties, namely the vertical action. We calibrate two distinct, hierarchical stellar age--vertical action relations, first employing asteroseismic ages for red-giant-branch stars, then isochrone ages for main-sequence turn-off stars. We describe a framework called "zoomies" based on this calibration, by which we can infer ages for any star given its vertical action. This tool is open-source and intended for community use. We compare dynamical age estimates from "zoomies" with age measurements from open clusters and asteroseismology. We use "zoomies" to generate and compare dynamical age estimates for stars from the Kepler, K2, and TESS exoplanet transit surveys. While dynamical age relations are associated with large uncertainty, they are generally mass independent and depend on homogeneously measured astrometric data. These age predictions are uniquely useful for large-scale demographic investigations, especially in disentangling the relationship between planet occurrence, metallicity, and age for low-mass stars.</description>

Abstract: Filaments connecting halos are a long-standing prediction of cold dark matter theories. We present a detection of the cosmic web emission connecting two quasar-host galaxies at redshift z ~3.22 in the MUSE Ultra Deep Field (MUDF). The very deep observations unlock a high-definition view of the filament morphology, a measure of the transition radius between the intergalactic and circumgalactic medium, and the characterization of the surface brightness profiles along the filament and in the transverse direction. Through systematic comparisons with simulations, we validate the filaments' typical density predicted in the current cold dark-matter model. Our analysis of the MUDF field, an excellent laboratory for quantitatively studying filaments in emission, opens a new avenue to constrain the physical properties of the cosmic web and to trace the distribution of dark matter on large scales.</description>

      <title>Map-level baryonification: Efficient modelling of higher-order correlations in the weak lensing and thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03822v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Semi-analytic methods can generate baryon-corrected fields from N-body simulations (``baryonification'') and are rapidly becoming a ubiquitous tool in modeling structure formation on non-linear scales. We extend this formalism to consistently model the weak lensing and thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich (tSZ) fields directly on the full-sky, with an emphasis on higher-order correlations. We use the auto- and cross- $N$th-order moments, with $N \in \{2, 3, 4\}$, as a summary statistic of the lensing and tSZ fields, and show that our model can jointly fit these statistics measured in IllustrisTNG to within measurement uncertainties, for scales above $\gtrsim 1 {\rm Mpc}$ and across multiple redshifts. The model predictions change only minimally when including additional information from secondary halo properties, such as halo concentration and ellipticity. Each individual moment is dependent on halos of different mass ranges and has different sensitivities to the model parameters. A simulation-based forecast on the ULAGAM simulation suite shows that the combination of all moments, measured from current and upcoming lensing and tSZ surveys, can jointly constrain cosmology and baryons to high precision. The lensing and tSZ field are sensitive to different combinations of the baryonification parameters, with degeneracy directions that are often orthogonal, and the combination of the two fields leads to significantly better constraints on both cosmology and astrophysics. Our pipeline for map-level baryonification is publicly available at https://github.com/DhayaaAnbajagane/BaryonForge.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Redshift Distribution Inference through Joint Self-Calibration and Clustering-Redshift Synergy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12009v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurately characterizing the true redshift (true-$z$) distribution of a photometric redshift (photo-$z$) sample is critical for cosmological analyses in imaging surveys. Clustering-based techniques, which include clustering-redshift (CZ) and self-calibration (SC) methods--depending on whether external spectroscopic data are used--offer powerful tools for this purpose. In this study, we explore the joint inference of the true-$z$ distribution by combining SC and CZ (denoted as SC+CZ). We derive simple multiplicative update rules to perform the joint inference. By incorporating appropriate error weighting and an additional weighting function, our method shows significant improvement over previous algorithms. We validate our approach using a DES Y3 mock catalog. The true-$z$ distribution estimated through the combined SC+CZ method is generally more accurate than using SC or CZ alone. To account for the different constraining powers of these methods, we assign distinct weights to the SC and CZ contributions. The optimal weights, which minimize the distribution error, depend on the relative constraining strength of the SC and CZ data. Specifically, for a spectroscopic redshift sample that amounts to 1% of the photo-$z$ sample, the optimal combination reduces the total error by 20% (40%) compared to using CZ (SC) alone, and it keeps the bias in mean redshift [$\Delta \bar{z} / (1 + z) $] at the level of 0.3%. Furthermore, when CZ data is only available in the low-$z$ range and the high-$z$ range relies solely on SC data, SC+CZ enables consistent estimation of the true-$z$ distribution across the entire redshift range. Our findings demonstrate that SC+CZ is an effective tool for constraining the true-$z$ distribution, paving the way for clustering-based methods to be applied at $z\gtrsim 1$.</description>

Abstract: Characterising stellar jet asymmetries is key to setting robust constraints on jet launching models and improving our understanding of the underlying mechanisms behind jet launching. We aim to characterise the asymmetric properties of the bipolar jet coming from the Classical T Tauri Star Th 28. We combined data from integral field spectroscopy with VLT/MUSE and high-resolution spectra from VLT/X-shooter to map the optical emission line ratios in both jet lobes. We carried out a diagnostic analysis of these ratios to compare the density, electron temperature, and ionisation fraction within both lobes. The mass accretion rate was derived from the emission lines at the source and compared with the mass outflow rate derived for both lobes, using the estimated densities and measured [O I]6300 and [S II ]6731 luminosities. The blue-shifted jet exhibits a significantly higher electron temperature and moderately higher ionisation fraction than the red-shifted jet. In contrast to previous studies, we also estimated higher densities in the blue-shifted jet by a factor of ~2. These asymmetries are traced to within 160 au of the source in the line ratio maps. We estimate the mass accretion rate onto the central star and compare this with estimates of the mass outflow rates through each side of the jet. The emission line maps and diagnostic results suggest that the jet asymmetries originate close to the source and are likely to be intrinsic to the jet. Furthermore, the combined dataset offers access to a broad array of accretion tracers. In turn, this enables a more accurate estimation of the mass accretion rate, revealing a value of Macc that is higher by a factor &gt;350 than would otherwise be determined. Supplementary figures and tables are available via a public Zenodo repository (doi:10.5281/zenodo.13373809).</description>

      <title>Externally irradiated young stars in NGC 3603. A JWST NIRSpec catalogue of pre-main-sequence stars in a massive star formation region</title>

Abstract: NGC 3603 is the optically brightest massive star forming region (SFR) in the Milky Way, representing a small scale starburst region. Studying young stars in regions like this allows us to assess how star and planet formation proceeds in a dense clustered environment with high levels of UV radiation. JWST provides the sensitivity, unbroken wavelength coverage, and spatial resolution required to study individual pre-main-sequence (PMS) stars in distant massive SFRs in detail for the first time. Using the Micro-Shutter Assembly (MSA) onboard the Near InfraRed Spectrograph (NIRSpec), multi-object spectroscopy was performed, yielding 100 stellar spectra. We fit the PMS spectra to derive their photospheric properties, extinction, and NIR veiling. From this, we determined the masses and ages of our sources by placing them on the Hertzsprung-Russel diagram (HRD). Their accretion rates were determined by converting the luminosity of hydrogen emission lines to an accretion luminosity. We have classified 42 as actively accreting. Our sources span a range of masses from 0.5 to 7 $M_{\odot}$. Twelve of these accreting sources have ages consistent with $\ge$ 10 Myrs, with four having ages of $\ge$ 15 Myrs. Their mass accretion rates span 5 orders of magnitude and are systematically higher for a given stellar mass than for a comparative sample taken from low-mass SFRs. We report an environmental relationship between $\dot{M}_{acc}$ and the density of ambient molecular gas as traced by nebular $H_2$ emission.</description>

      <title>Kinematic evidence of magnetospheric accretion for Herbig Ae stars with JWST NIRSpec</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05668</link>

Abstract: Hydrogen emission lines are routinely used to estimate the mass accretion rate of pre-main-sequence stars. Despite the clear correlation between the accretion luminosity of a star and hydrogen line luminosities, the physical origin of these lines is still unclear, with magnetospheric accretion and magneto-centrifugal winds as the two most often invoked mechanisms. Using a combination of HST photometry and new JWST NIRSpec spectra, we have analysed the SED and emission line spectra of five sources in order to determine their underlying photospheric properties, and to attempt to reveal the physical origin of their hydrogen emission lines. These sources reside in NGC 3603, a Galactic massive star forming region. We have fitted the SED of the five sources employing a Markov Chain Monte Carlo exploration to estimate $T_{eff}$, $R_{*}$, $M_{*}$ and $A(V)$ for each source. We have performed a kinematic analysis across three spectral series of hydrogen lines, Paschen, Brackett, and Pfund, totalling $\ge 15$ lines. The FWHM and optical depth of the spectrally resolved lines have been studied in order to constrain the emission origin. The five sources all have SEDs consistent with young intermediate-mass stars. We have classified three of these sources as Herbig Ae type stars based on their effective temperature. Their hydrogen lines show broad profiles with FWHMs $\ge 200$ km s$^{-1}$. Hydrogen lines with high upper energy levels $n_{up}$ tend to be significantly broader than lines with lower $n_{up}$. The optical depth of the emission lines is also highest for the high velocity component of each line, becoming optically thin in the low velocity component. This is consistent with emission from a magnetospheric accretion flow, and cannot be explained as originating in a magneto-centrifugal wind, or other line emission mechanisms thought to be present in protoplanetary disks.</description>
