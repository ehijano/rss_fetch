      <title>Geometric influences on quantum Boolean cubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study three problems related to the $L_1$-influence on quantum Boolean cubes. In the first place, we obtain a dimension free bound for $L_1$-influence, which implies the quantum $L^1$-KKL Theorem result obtained by Rouze, Wirth and Zhang. Beyond that, we also obtain a high order quantum Talagrand inequality and quantum $L^1$-KKL theorem. Lastly, we prove a quantitative relation between the noise stability and $L^1$-influence. To this end, our technique involves the random restrictions method as well as semigroup theory.</description>

      <title>A class of Berezin-type operators on weighted Fock spaces with $A_{\infty}$-type weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $0&lt;\alpha,\beta,t&lt;\infty$ and $\mu$ be a positive Borel measure on $\mathbb{C}^n$. We consider the Berezin-type operator $S^{t,\alpha,\beta}_{\mu}$ defined by $$S^{t,\alpha,\beta}_{\mu}f(z):=\left(\int_{\mathbb{C}^n}e^{-\frac{\beta}{2}|z-u|^2}|f(u)|^te^{-\frac{\alpha t}{2}|u|^2}d\mu(u)\right)^{1/t},\quad z\in\mathbb{C}^n.$$ We completely characterize the boundedness and compactness of $S^{t,\alpha,\beta}_{\mu}$ from the weighted Fock space $F^p_{\alpha,w}$ into the Lebesgue space $L^q(wdv)$ for all possible indices, where $w$ is a weight on $\mathbb{C}^n$ that satisfies an $A_{\infty}$-type condition. This solves an open problem raised by Zhou, Zhao and Tang [Banach J. Math. Anal. 18 (2024), Paper No. 20]. As an application, we obtain the description of the boundedness and compactness of Toeplitz-type operators acting between weighted Fock spaces induced by $A_{\infty}$-type weights.</description>

      <title>A note on a Halmos problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the existence of non-trivial closed invariant subspaces of operators $T$ on Banach spaces whenever their square $T^2$ have or, more generally, whether there exists a polynomial $p$ with $\mbox{deg}(p)\geq 2$ such that the lattice of invariant subspaces of $p(T)$ is non-trivial. In the Hilbert space setting, the $T^2$-problem was posed by Halmos in the seventies and in 2007, Foias, Jung, Ko and Pearcy conjectured it could be equivalent to the \emph{Invariant Subspace Problem}.</description>

      <title>Direct Integral and Decompoisitions of Locally Hilbert spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce the concept of direct integral of locally Hilbert spaces by using the notion of locally standard measure space (analogous to standard measure space defined in the classical setup), which we obtain by considering a strictly inductive system of measurable spaces along with a projective system of finite measures. Next, we define a locally Hilbert space given by the direct integral of a family of locally Hilbert spaces. Following that we introduce decomposable locally bounded and diagonalizable locally bounded operators. Further, we show that the class of diagonalizable locally bounded operators is an abelian locally von Neumann algebra, and this can be seen as the commutant of decomposable locally bounded operators. Finally, we discuss the following converse question:
  For a locally Hilbert space $\mathcal{D}$ and an abelian locally von Neumann algebra $\mathcal{M}$, does there exist a locally standard measure space and a family of locally Hilbert spaces such that
  (1) the locally Hilbert space $\mathcal{D}$ is identified with the direct integral of family of locally Hilbert spaces;
  (2) the abelian locally von Neumann algebra $\mathcal{M}$ is identified with the abelian locally von Neumann algebra of all diagonalizable locally bounded operators ?
  We answer this question affirmatively for a certain class of abelian locally von Neumann algebras.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the key property in models of Nonlinear Elasticity which corresponds to the non-interpenetration of matter, i.e. injectivity a.e., can be achieved in the class of weak limits of homeomorphisms under very minimal assumptions.
  Let $\Omega\subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ be a domain and let $p&gt;\left\lfloor\frac{n}{2}\right\rfloor$ for $n\geq 4$ or $p\geq 1$ for $n=2,3$. Assume that $f_k\in W^{1,p}$ is a sequence of homeomorphisms such that $f_k\rightharpoonup f$ weakly in $W^{1,p}$ and assume that $J_f&gt;0$ a.e. Then we show that $f$ is injective a.e.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fusion frames are widely studied for their applications in recovering signals from large data. These are proved to be very useful in many areas, such as, distributed processing, wireless sensor networks, packet encoding. Inspired by the work of Bemrose et al.\cite{Be16}, this paper delves into the properties and characterizations of weaving fusion frames.</description>

      <title>Finite dimensionality of Besov spaces and potential-theoretic decomposition of metric spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of a metric measure space $(X,d,\mu)$, we explore the potential-theoretic implications of having a finite-dimensional Besov space. We prove that if the dimension of the Besov space $B^\theta_{p,p}(X)$ is $k&gt;1$, then $X$ can be decomposed into $k$ number of irreducible components (Theorem 1.1). Note that $\theta$ may be bigger than $1$, as our framework includes fractals. We also provide sufficient conditions under which the dimension of the Besov space is $1$. We introduce critical exponents $\theta_p(X)$ and $\theta_p^{\ast}(X)$ for the Besov spaces. As examples illustrating Theorem 1.1, we compute these critical exponents for spaces $X$ formed by glueing copies of $n$-dimensional cubes, the Sierpi\'{n}ski gaskets, and of the Sierpi\'{n}ski carpet.</description>

      <title>Covering Constants for Metric Projection Operator with Applications to Stochastic Fixed-Point Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we use the Mordukhovich derivatives to precisely find the covering constants for the metric projection operator onto nonempty closed and convex subsets in uniformly convex and uniformly smooth Banach spaces. We consider three cases of the subsets: closed balls in uniformly convex and uniformly smooth Banach spaces, closed and convex cylinders in l, and the positive cone in L, for some p. By using Theorem 3.1 in [2] and as applications of covering constants obtained in this paper, we prove the solvability of some stochastic fixed-point problems. We also provide three examples with specific solutions of stochastic fixed-point problems.</description>

      <title>BGD domains in p.c.f. self-similar sets I: boundary value problems for harmonic functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the boundary value problems for harmonic functions on open connected subsets of post-critically finite (p.c.f.) self-similar sets, on which the Laplacian is defined through a strongly recurrent self-similar local regular Dirichlet form. For a p.c.f. self-similar set $K$, we prove that for any open connected subset $\Omega\subset K$ whose "geometric" boundary is a graph-directed self-similar set, there exists a finite number of matrices called $\textit{flux transfer matrices}$ whose products generate the hitting probability from a point in $\Omega$ to the "resistance" boundary $\partial \Omega$. The harmonic functions on $\Omega$ can be expressed by integrating functions on $\partial \Omega$ against the probability measures. Furthermore, we obtain a two-sided estimate of the energy of a harmonic function in terms of its values on $\partial \Omega$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of this note is to prove that every real-valued Lipschitz function on a Banach space can be pointwise approximated on a given $\sigma$-compact set by smooth cylindrical functions whose asymptotic Lipschitz constants are controlled. This result has applications in the study of metric Sobolev and BV spaces: it implies that smooth cylindrical functions are dense in energy in these kinds of functional spaces defined over any weighted Banach space.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic dynamics on amenable groups and van der Corput sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We answer a question of Bergelson and Lesigne by showing that the notion of van der Corput set does not depend on the F\o lner sequence used to define it. This result has been discovered independently by Sa\'ul Rodr\'iguez Mart\'in. Both ours and Rodr\'iguez's proofs proceed by first establishing a converse to the Furstenberg Correspondence Principle for amenable groups.
  This involves studying the distributions of Reiter sequences over congruent sequences of tilings of the group.
  Lastly, we show that many of the equivalent characterizations of van der Corput sets in $\mathbb{N}$ that do not involve F\o lner sequences remain equivalent for arbitrary countably infinite groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend two celebrated inequalities by Busemann -- the random simplex inequality and the intersection inequality -- to both complex and quaternionic vector spaces. Our proof leverages a monotonicity property under symmetrization with respect to complex or quaternionic hyperplanes. Notably, we demonstrate that the standard Steiner symmetrization, contrary to assertions in a paper by Grinberg, does not exhibit this monotonicity property.</description>

      <title>Improved fewnomial upper bounds from Wronskians and dessins d'enfant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use Grothendieck's dessins d'enfant to show that if $P$ and $Q$ are two real polynomials, any real function of the form $x^\alpha(1-x)^{\beta} P - Q$, has at most $\deg P +\deg Q + 2$ roots in the interval $]0,~1[$. As a consequence, we obtain an upper bound on the number of positive solutions to a real polynomial system $f=g=0$ in two variables where $f$ has three monomials terms, and $g$ has $t$ terms. The approach we adopt for tackling this Fewnomial bound relies on the theory of Wronskians, which was used in Koiran et.\ al.\ (J.\ Symb.\ Comput., 2015) for producing the first upper bound which is polynomial in $t$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present paper, by using the relaxed transposition method[29], we solve the second-order adjoint equations, corresponding to the optimal control of quantum stochastic systems in fermion fields, which plays the fundamental roles in the study of the Pointryagin-type maximum principle in quantum stochastic optimal control. The second-order adjoint equation is a backard operator valued quantum stochastic differential equation, which has no definition in the algebra of bounded operators, and the solution derived from the relaxed transposition method makes sense in W*-topology.</description>

      <title>Character Space and Gelfand type representation of locally C^{*}-algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we identify a suitable approach to define the character space of a commutative unital locally $C^{\ast}$-algebra via the notion of the inductive limit of topological spaces. Also, we discuss topological properties of the character space. We establish the Gelfand type representation between a commutative unital locally $C^{\ast}$-algebra and the space of all continuous functions defined on its character space. Equivalently, we prove that every commutative unital locally $C^{\ast}$-algebra is identified with the locally $C^{\ast}$-algebra of continuous functions on its character space through the coherent representation of projective limit of $C^{\ast}$-algebras. Finally, we construct a unital locally $C^{\ast}$-algebra generated by a given locally bounded normal operator and show that its character space is homeomorphic to the local spectrum. Further, we define the functional calculus and prove spectral mapping theorem in this framework.</description>

Abstract: Consider a non-linear operator equation $x - K(x) = f$, where $f$ is given and $K$ is a Urysohn integral operator with Green's function type kernel defined on $L^\infty [0, 1]$. We apply methods of approximation based on interpolatory projections (where interpolation points are not necessarily Gauss points) and get solutions with higher accuracy than the collocation solution of the above equation. Numerical examples are given to support our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Discrete Triebel-Lizorkin spaces and expansive matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a characterization of two expansive dilation matrices yielding equal discrete anisotropic Triebel-Lizorkin spaces. For two such matrices $A$ and $B$, it is shown that $\dot{\mathbf{f}}^{\alpha}_{p,q}(A) = \dot{\mathbf{f}}^{\alpha}_{p,q}(B)$ for all $\alpha \in \mathbb{R}$ and $p, q \in (0, \infty]$ if and only if the set $\{A^j B^{-j} : j \in \mathbb{Z}\}$ is finite, or in the trivial case when $p = q$ and $|\det(A)|^{\alpha + 1/2 - 1/p} = |\det(B)|^{\alpha + 1/2 - 1/p}$. This provides an extension of a result by Triebel for diagonal dilations to arbitrary expansive matrices. The obtained classification of dilations is different from corresponding results for anisotropic Triebel-Lizorkin function spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we consider a general time-periodic linear transport equation with integral source term. We prove the existence of a Floquet principal eigenvalue, namely a real number such that the equation rescaled by this number admits nonnegative periodic solutions. We also prove the exponential attractiveness of these solutions. The method relies on general spectral results about positive operators.</description>

      <title>Generalized complex Stein manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of a generalized complex (GC) Stein manifold and provide complete characterizations in three fundamental aspects. First, we extend Cartan's Theorem A and B within the framework of GC geometry. Next, we define $L$-plurisubharmonic functions and develop an associated $L^2$ theory. This leads to a characterization of GC Stein manifolds using $L$-plurisubharmonic exhaustion functions. Finally, we establish the existence of a proper GH embedding from any GC Stein manifold into $\mathbb{R}^{2n-2k} \times \mathbb{C}^{2k+1}$, where $2n$ and $k$ denote the dimension and type of the GC Stein manifold, respectively. This provides a characterization of GC Stein manifolds via GH embeddings. Several examples of GC Stein manifolds are given.</description>

      <title>Retraction methods and fixed point free maps with null minimal displacements on unit balls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.12958v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the class of Lipschitz maps on the unit ball $B_X$ of a Banach space $X$, and the question we deal with is whether for any $\lambda&gt;1$ there exists a $\lambda$-Lipschitz fixed-point free mapping $T\colon B_X\to B_X$ with $\mathrm{d}(T,B_X)=0$. We also consider its H\"older version. New related results are obtained. We show that if $X$ has a spreading Schauder basis then such mappings can always be built, answering a question posed by the first author in \cite{Bar}. In the general case, using a recent approach of R. Medina \cite{M} concerning H\"older retractions of $(r_n)$-flat closed convex sets, we show that for any decreasing null sequence $(r_n)\subset \mathbb{R}$ and $\alpha\in (0,1)$, there exists a fixed-point free mapping $T$ on $B_X$ so that $\|T^nx - T^n y\|\leq r_n(\| x - y\|^\alpha +1)$ for all $x, y\in B_X$ and $n\in\mathbb{N}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.10868v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the dynamics of the adjoint of a weighted composition operator and we give necessary and sufficient conditions for this adjoint operator to be topologically hyper-transitive on the space of Radon measures on a locally compact Hausdorff space. Moreover, we provide sufficient conditions for this operator to be chaotic and we give concrete examples. Next, we consider the real Banach space of signed Radon measures and we give in this context the sufficient conditions for the convergence of Markov chains induced by the adjoint of an integral operator. Also, we illustrate this result with a concrete example. In addition, we obtain some structural results regarding the space of Radon measures. We characterize a class of cones whose complement is spaceable in the space of Radon measures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.01033v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new position is introduced and studied for the convolution of log-concave functions, which may be regarded as a functional analogue of the maximum intersection position of convex bodies introduced and studied by Artstein-Avidan and Katzin (2018) and Artstein-Avidan and Putterman (2022). Our main result is a John-type theorem for the maximal intersection position of a pair of log-concave functions, including the corresponding decomposition of the identity. The main result holds under very weak assumptions on the functions; in particular, the functions considered may both have unbounded supports.</description>

      <title>Fixed and Periodic Points of the Intersection Body Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08171v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The intersection body $IK$ of a star-body $K$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ was introduced by E. Lutwak following the work of H. Busemann, and plays a central role in the dual Brunn-Minkowski theory. We show that when $n \geq 3$, $I^2 K = c K$ iff $K$ is a centered ellipsoid, and hence $I K = c K$ iff $K$ is a centered Euclidean ball, answering long-standing questions by Lutwak, Gardner, and Fish-Nazarov-Ryabogin-Zvavitch. To this end, we recast the iterated intersection body equation as an Euler-Lagrange equation for a certain volume functional under radial perturbations, derive new formulas for the volume of $I K$, and introduce a continuous version of Steiner symmetrization for Lipschitz star-bodies, which (surprisingly) yields a useful radial perturbation exactly when $n\geq 3$.</description>

      <title>Construction of irregular complete interpolation sets for shift-invariant spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09099v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For several shift-invariant spaces, there exists a real number $a\in\mathbb{R}$ such that the set $a+\mathbb{Z}$ is a complete interpolation set. In this paper, we characterize the complete interpolation property of the set $(a+\mathbb{N}_0)\cup(\alpha+a+\mathbb{N}^{-})$ for shift-invariant spaces using Toeplitz operators. Using this characterization, we determine all $\alpha$ for which the sample set $\mathbb{N}_0\cup\alpha+\mathbb{N}^{-}$ forms a complete interpolation set for transversal-invariant spaces. We introduce a new recurrence relation for exponential splines, examines the zeros of these splines, and explores the zero-free region of the doubly infinite Lerch zeta function. Consequently, we demonstrate that $\left\langle\frac{m}{2}\right\rangle+\mathbb{N}_0\cup\alpha+\left\langle\frac{m}{2}\right\rangle+\mathbb{N}^{-}$ is a complete interpolation set for a shift-invariant spline space of order $m\geq 2$ if and only if $|\alpha|&lt;1/2$.</description>

      <title>Tracial States and $\mathbb{G}$-Invariant States of Discrete Quantum Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.05176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.05176v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the tracial states and $\mathbb{G}$-invariant states on the reduced $C^*$-algebra $C_r(\widehat{\mathbb{G}})$ of a discrete quantum group $\mathbb{G}$. Here, we denote its dual compact quantum group by $\widehat{\mathbb{G}}$. Our main result is that a state on $C_r(\widehat{\mathbb{G}})$ is tracial if and only if it is $\mathbb{G}$-invariant. This generalizes a known fact for unimodular discrete quantum groups and builds upon the work of Kalantar, Kasprzak, Skalski, and Vergnioux. As one consequence of this, we find that $C_r(\widehat{\mathbb{G}})$ is nuclear and admits a tracial state if and only if $\mathbb{G}$ is amenable. This resolves an open problem due to C.-K. Ng and Viselter, and Crann, in the discrete case. As another consequence, we prove that tracial states on $C_r(\widehat{\mathbb{G}})$ "concentrate" on $\widehat{\mathbb{G}}_F$, where $\mathbb{G}_F$ is the cokernel of the Furstenberg boundary. Furthermore, given certain assumptions, we characterize the existence of traces on $C_r(\widehat{\mathbb{G}})$ in terms of whether or not $\widehat{\mathbb{G}}_F$ is Kac type. We also characterize the uniqueness of (idempotent) traces in terms of whether not $\widehat{\mathbb{G}}_F$ is equal to the canonical Kac quotient of $\widehat{\mathbb{G}}$. These results rely on the following, of which we give proofs: So\l tan's canonical Kac quotient construction, whether it is applied to the universal or the reduced CQG $C^*$-algebra of $\widehat{\mathbb{G}}$ (when the latter admits a trace), yields the maximal Kac type closed quantum subgroup of $\widehat{\mathbb{G}}$.</description>

      <title>Connections and Finsler geometry of the structure group of a JB-algebra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.09208v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We endow the Banach-Lie structure group $Str(V)$ of an infinite dimensional JB-algebra $V$ with a left-invariant connection and Finsler metric, and we compute all the quantities of its connection. We show how this connection reduces to $G(\Omega)$, the group of transformations that preserve the positive cone $\Omega$ of the algebra $V$, and to $Aut(V)$, the group of Jordan automorphisms of the algebra. We present the cone $\Omega$ as an homogeneous space for the action of $G(\Omega)$, therefore inducing a quotient Finsler metric and distance. With the techniques introduced, we prove the minimality of the one-parameter groups in $\Omega$ for any symmetric gauge norm in $V$. We establish that the two presentations of the Finsler metric in $\Omega$ give the same distance there, which helps us prove the minimality of certain paths in $G(\Omega)$ for its left-invariant Finsler metric.</description>

      <title>Sharp $\ell^p$ inequalities for discrete singular integrals on the lattice $\mathbb{Z}^d$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.09737v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates higher dimensional versions of the longstanding conjecture verified in [Ba\~nuelos and Kwa\'snicki, Duke Math. J. (2019)] that the $\ell^p$-norm of the discrete Hilbert transform on the integers is the same as the $L^p$-norm of the Hilbert transform on the real line. It computes the $\ell^p$-norms of a family of discrete operators on the lattice $\mathbb{Z}^{d}$, $d\geq 1.$ They are discretizations of a new class of singular integrals on $\mathbb{R}^d$ that have the same kernels as the classical Riesz transforms near zero and similar behavior at infinity. The discrete operators have the same $p$-norms as the classical Riesz transforms on $\mathbb{R}^d$. They are constructed as conditional expectations of martingale transforms of Doob h-processes conditioned to exit the upper--half space $\mathbb{R}^d\times \mathbb{R}_{+}$ only on the lattice $\mathbb{Z}^d$. The paper also presents a discrete analogue of the classical method of rotations which gives the norm of a different variant of discrete Riesz transforms on $\mathbb{Z}^d$. Along the way a new proof is given based on Fourier transform techniques of the key identity used to identify the norm of the discrete Hilbert transform in [Ba\~nuelos and Kwa\'snicki, Duke Math. J. (2019)]. Open problems are stated.</description>

      <title>A Gaussian Convexity for Logarithmic Moment Generating Functions with Applications in Spin Glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08351v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For any convex function $F$ of $n$-dimensional Gaussian vector $g$ with $\mathbb{E} e^{\lambda F(g)}&lt;\infty$ for any $\lambda&gt;0$, we show that $\lambda^{-1}\ln \mathbb{E} e^{\lambda F(g)}$ is convex in $\lambda\in\mathbb{R}$. Based on this convexity, we draw three major consequences. The first recovers a version of the Paouris-Valettas lower deviation inequality for Gaussian convex functions with an improved exponent. The second establishes a quantitative bound for the Dotsenko-Franz-M\'ezard conjecture arising from the study of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) mean-field spin glass model, which states that in the absence of external field, the annealed free energy of negative replica is asymptotically equal to the free energy. The last further establishes the differentiability for this annealed free energy with respect to the negative replica variable at any temperature and external field.</description>

      <title>Algebraic aspects and functoriality of the set of affiliated operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16170v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we aim to provide a satisfactory algebraic description of the set of affiliated operators for von Neumann algebras. Let $\mathscr{M}$ be a von Neumann algebra acting on a Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$, and let $\mathscr{M}_{\text{aff}}$ denote the set of unbounded operators of the form $T = AB^{\dagger}$ for $A, B \in \mathscr{M}$ with $\ker(B)\subseteq\ker(A)$ , where $(\cdot)^{\dagger}$ denotes the Kaufman inverse. We show that $\mathscr{M}_{\text{aff}}$ is closed under product, sum, Kaufman-inverse and adjoint, and has the structure of a right near-semiring; Moreover, the above quotient representation of an operator in $\mathscr{M}_{\text{aff}}$ is essentially unique. The Murray-von Neumann affiliated operators for $\mathscr{M}$ turn out to be precisely the closed operators in $\mathscr{M}_{\text{aff}}$. Let $\Phi$ be a unital normal homomorphism between represented von Neumann algebras $(\mathscr{M}; \mathcal{H})$ and $(\mathscr{N}; \mathcal{K})$. With the help of the quotient representation, we obtain a canonical extension of $\Phi$ to a mapping $\Phi_{\text{aff}} : \mathscr{M}_{\text{aff}} \to \mathscr{N}_{\text{aff}}$ which respects sum, product, Kaufman-inverse, and adjoint. Thus $\mathscr{M}_{\text{aff}}$ is intrinsically associated with $\mathscr{M}$ and transforms functorially as we change representations of $\mathscr{M}$. Furthermore, $\Phi_{\text{aff}}$ preserves operator properties such as being symmetric, or positive, or accretive, or sectorial, or self-adjoint, or normal, and also preserves the Friedrichs and Krein-von Neumann extensions of densely-defined closed positive operators. As a proof of concept, we transfer some well-known results about closed unbounded operators to the setting of closed affiliated operators for properly infinite von Neumann algebras, via `abstract nonsense'.</description>

      <title>A Center Transversal Theorem for mass assignments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15095v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, based on the ideas of Blagojevi\'c, Karasev &amp; Magazinov, we consider an extension of the center transversal theorem to mass assignments with an improved Rado depth. In particular we substitute the marginal of a measure by a more general concept called a mass assignment over a flag manifold. Our results also allow us to solve the main problem proposed by Blagojevi\'c, Karasev &amp; Magazinov in a linear subspace of lower dimension, as long as it is contained in a high-dimensional enough ambient space.</description>

      <title>Generalized Hyperbolicity, Stability and Expansivity for Operators on Locally Convex Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02843v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce and study the notions of (generalized) hyperbolicity, topological stability and (uniform) topological expansivity for operators on locally convex spaces. We prove that every generalized hyperbolic operator on a locally convex space has the finite shadowing property. Contrary to what happens in the Banach space setting, hyperbolic operators on Fr\'echet spaces may fail to have the shadowing property, but we find additional conditions that ensure the validity of the shadowing property. Assuming that the space is sequentially complete, we prove that generalized hyperbolicity implies the strict periodic shadowing property, but we also show that the hypothesis of sequential completeness is essential. We show that operators with the periodic shadowing property on topological vector spaces have other interesting dynamical behaviors, including the fact that the restriction of such an operator to its chain recurrent set is topologically mixing and Devaney chaotic. We prove that topologically stable operators on locally convex spaces have the finite shadowing property and the strict periodic shadowing property. As a consequence, topologically stable operators on Banach spaces have the shadowing property. Moreover, we prove that generalized hyperbolicity implies topological stability for operators on Banach spaces. We prove that uniformly topologically expansive operators on locally convex spaces are neither Li-Yorke chaotic nor topologically transitive. Finally, we characterize the notion of topological expansivity for weighted shifts on Fr\'echet sequence spaces. Several examples are provided.</description>

      <title>Ahlfors regularity of continua that minimize maxitive set functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09251v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The primary objective of this paper is to establish the Ahlfors regularity of minimizers of set functions that satisfy a suitable maxitive condition on disjoint unions of sets. Our analysis focuses on minimizers within continua of the plane with finite one-dimensional Hausdorff measure. Through quantitative estimates, we prove that the length of a minimizer inside the ball centered at one of its points is comparable to the radius of the ball. By operating within an abstract framework, we are able to encompass a diverse range of entities, including spectral functionals defined in terms of the eigenvalues of elliptic operators, the inradius, and the maximum of the torsion function. These entities are of interest for several applications, such as structural engineering, urban planning, and quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Finite-dimensional approximations of push-forwards on locally analytic functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10769v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel theoretical framework for investigating analytic maps from finite discrete data. Our approach is to consider the push-forward on the space of locally analytic functionals, instead of directly handling the analytic map itself. We establish a methodology enabling appropriate finite-dimensional approximation of the push-forward from finite discrete data, through the theory of the Fourier--Borel transform and the Fock space. Moreover, we prove a rigorous convergence result with a convergence rate. As an application, we prove that it is not the least-squares polynomial, but the polynomial obtained by truncating its higher-degree terms, that approximates analytic functions and further allows for approximation beyond the support of the data distribution. One advantage of our theory is that it enables us to apply linear algebraic operations to the finite-dimensional approximation of the push-forward. Utilizing this, we prove the convergence of a method for approximating an analytic vector field from finite data of the flow map of an ordinary differential equation.</description>

      <title>A transference principle for involution-invariant functional Hilbert spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04384v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\sigma : \mathbb C^d \rightarrow \mathbb C^d$ be an affine-linear involution such that $J_\sigma = -1$ and let $U, V$ be two domains in $\mathbb C^d.$ Let $\phi : U \rightarrow V$ be a $\sigma$-invariant $2$-proper map such that $J_\phi$ is affine-linear and let $\mathscr H(U)$ be a $\sigma$-invariant reproducing kernel Hilbert space of complex-valued holomorphic functions on $U.$ It is shown that the space $\mathscr H_\phi(V):=\{f \in \mathrm{Hol}(V) : J_\phi \cdot f \circ \phi \in \mathscr H(U)\}$ endowed with the norm $\|f\|_\phi :=\|J_\phi \cdot f \circ \phi\|_{\mathscr H(U)}$ is a reproducing kernel Hilbert space and the linear mapping $\varGamma_\phi$ defined by $
\varGamma_\phi(f) = J_\phi \cdot f \circ \phi,$ $f \in \mathrm{Hol}(V),$ is a unitary from $\mathscr H_\phi(V)$ onto $\{f \in \mathscr H(U) : f = -f \circ \sigma\}.$ Moreover, a neat formula for the reproducing kernel $\kappa_{\phi}$ of $\mathscr H_\phi(V)$ in terms of the reproducing kernel of $\mathscr H(U)$ is given. The above scheme is applicable to symmetrized bidisc, tetrablock, $d$-dimensional fat Hartogs triangle and $d$-dimensional egg domain. Although some of these are known, this allows us to obtain an analog of von Neumann's inequality for contractive tuples naturally associated with these domains.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Behaviour of three fractional spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16894v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We obtain asymptotically sharp identification of fractional Sobolev spaces $ W^{s}_{p,q}$, extension spaces $E^{s}_{p,q}$, and Triebel-Lizorkin spaces $\dot{F}^s_{p,q}$. In particular we obtain for $W^{s}_{p,q}$ and $E^{s}_{p,q}$ a stability theory a la Bourgain-Brezis-Mironescu as $s \to 1$, answering a question raised by Brazke--Schikorra--Yung. Part of the results are new even for $p=q$.</description>
