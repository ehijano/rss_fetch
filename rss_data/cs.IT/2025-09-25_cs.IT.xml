      <title>Analyzing {\alpha}-divergence in Gaussian Rate-Distortion-Perception Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of estimating the information rate distortion perception function (RDPF), which is a relevant information-theoretic quantity in goal-oriented lossy compression and semantic information reconstruction, is investigated here. Specifically, we study the RDPF tradeoff for Gaussian sources subject to a mean-squared error (MSE) distortion and a perception measure that belongs to the family of {\alpha} divergences. Assuming a jointly Gaussian RDPF, which forms a convex optimization problem, we characterize an upper bound for which we find a parametric solution. We show that evaluating the optimal parameters of this parametric solution is equivalent to finding the roots of a reduced exponential polynomial of degree {\alpha}. Additionally, we determine which disjoint sets contain each root, which enables us to evaluate them numerically using the well-known bisection method. Finally, we validate our analytical findings with numerical results and establish connections with existing results.</description>

      <title>Efficient $\varepsilon$-approximate minimum-entropy couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given $m \ge 2$ discrete probability distributions over $n$ states each, the minimum-entropy coupling is the minimum-entropy joint distribution whose marginals are the same as the input distributions. Computing the minimum-entropy coupling is NP-hard, but there has been significant progress in designing approximation algorithms; prior to this work, the best known polynomial-time algorithms attain guarantees of the form $H(\operatorname{ALG}) \le H(\operatorname{OPT}) + c$, where $c \approx 0.53$ for $m=2$, and $c \approx 1.22$ for general $m$ [CKQGK '23].
  A main open question is whether this task is APX-hard, or whether there exists a polynomial-time approximation scheme (PTAS). In this work, we design an algorithm that produces a coupling with entropy $H(\operatorname{ALG}) \le H(\operatorname{OPT}) + \varepsilon$ in running time $n^{O(\operatorname{poly}(1/\varepsilon) \cdot \operatorname{exp}(m) )}$: showing a PTAS exists for constant $m$.</description>

      <title>Agentic AI for Low-Altitude Semantic Wireless Networks: An Energy Efficient Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter addresses the energy efficiency issue in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted autonomous systems. We propose a framework for an agentic artificial intelligence (AI)-powered low-altitude semantic wireless network, that intelligently orchestrates a sense-communicate-decide-control workflow. A system-wide energy consumption minimization problem is formulated to enhance mission endurance. This problem holistically optimizes key operational variables, including UAV's location, semantic compression ratio, transmit power of the UAV and a mobile base station, and binary decision for AI inference task offloading, under stringent latency and quality-of-service constraints. To tackle the formulated mixed-integer non-convex problem, we develop a low-complexity algorithm which can obtain the globally optimal solution with two-dimensional search. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of our proposed design, demonstrating significant reductions in total energy consumption compared to conventional baseline approaches.</description>

      <title>Understanding the ratio of the partition sum to its Bethe approximation via double covers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For various classes of graphical models it has been observed that the ratio of the partition sum to its Bethe approximation is often close to being the square of the ratio of the partition sum to its degree-2 Bethe approximation. This is of relevance because the latter ratio can often better be analyzed and/or quantified than the former ratio. In this paper, we give some justifications for the observed relationship between these two ratios and then analyze these ratios for two classes of log-supermodular graphical models.</description>

      <title>Constrained Higher-Order Binary Optimization for Wireless Communications Systems Using Ising Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops an algorithmic solution using Ising machines to solve large-scale higher-order binary optimization (HOBO) problems with inequality constraints for resource optimization in wireless communications systems. Quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) aims to solve a special category of these problems widely encountered in engineering and science. To solve QUBO instances, specialized Ising machines have been designed, while sophisticated quantum annealing algorithm and quantum-inspired classical heuristics have been developed. However, the application of QUBO in wireless communications has limited practical interest mainly due to the complexity of resource optimization problems which are often characterized by high-order polynomial terms and strict inequality constraints. To overcome these bottlenecks and take advantage of recent advancements in Ising machines, in this paper, we propose an iterative algorithmic solution to solve HOBO problems, which is based on the augmented Lagrangian method to handle constraints. Specifically, Taylor expansion is employed to approximate higher-order polynomials to quadratic ones in the augmented Lagrangian function, which enables the solution of a single QUBO problem at each iteration without auxiliary variables. As an illustrative case study, we consider the problem of phase optimization in a simultaneous wireless information and power transfer system, where a reconfigurable intelligent surface with 1-bit phase resolution is used to facilitate information/energy transfer. Simulation results verify that the proposed algorithm achieves satisfactory performance and outperforms heuristic benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>A Federated Fine-Tuning Paradigm of Foundation Models in Heterogenous Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Edge intelligence has emerged as a promising strategy to deliver low-latency and ubiquitous services for mobile devices. Recent advances in fine-tuning mechanisms of foundation models have enabled edge intelligence by integrating low-rank adaptation (LoRA) with federated learning. However, in wireless networks, the device heterogeneity and resource constraints on edge devices pose great threats to the performance of federated fine-tuning. To tackle these issues, we propose to optimize federated fine-tuning in heterogenous wireless networks via online learning. First, the framework of switching-based federated fine-tuning in wireless networks is provided. The edge devices switches to LoRA modules dynamically for federated fine-tuning with base station to jointly mitigate the impact of device heterogeneity and transmission unreliability. Second, a tractable upper bound on the inference risk gap is derived based on theoretical analysis. To improve the generalization capability, we formulate a non-convex mixed-integer programming problem with long-term constraints, and decouple it into model switching, transmit power control, and bandwidth allocation subproblems. An online optimization algorithm is developed to solve the problems with polynomial computational complexity. Finally, the simulation results on the SST-2 and QNLI data sets demonstrate the performance gains in test accuracy and energy efficiency.</description>

      <title>A Novel Two-Dimensional Wigner Distribution Framework via the Quadratic Phase Fourier Transform with a Non-Separable Kernel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel time-frequency distribution, referred to as the Two-Dimensional Non-Separable Quadratic Phase Wigner Distribution (2D-NSQPWD), formulated within the framework of the Two-Dimensional Non-Separable Quadratic Phase Fourier Transform (2D-NSQPFT). By replacing the classical Fourier kernel with the NSQPFT kernel, the proposed distribution generalizes the classical Wigner distribution and effectively captures complex, non-separable signal structures. We rigorously establish several key properties of the 2D-NSQPWD, including time and frequency shift invariance, marginal behavior, conjugate symmetry, convolution relations, and Moyal's identity. Furthermore, the connection between the 2D-NSQPWD and the two-dimensional short-time Fourier transform (2D-STFT) is explored. The distribution's effectiveness is demonstrated through its application to single-, bi-, and tri-component two-dimensional linear frequency modulated (2D-LFM) signals, where it shows superior performance in cross-term suppression and signal localization.</description>

      <title>E2E Learning Massive MIMO for Multimodal Semantic Non-Orthogonal Transmission and Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) promises high spectral efficiency but also leads to high-dimensional downlink channel state information (CSI), which complicates real-time channel acquisition and precoding. To address this, we propose an end-to-end (E2E) uplink-downlink CSI fusion precoding network that jointly models downlink CSI reference signal (CSI-RS) design, CSI feedback, and base-station (BS) precoding within a single E2E neural architecture. Concretely, a projection network built on the MAXIM architecture takes uplink sounding reference signals (SRS) as input and outputs frequency-, beam-, and port-domain projection matrices for designing downlink CSI-RS. User equipment (UE) then compresses/quantizes the resulting CSI-RS observations and feeds back a compact representation. At the base station (BS), two complementary branches produce candidate precoders: one is a feedback-only precoding network driven by quantized downlink observations, and the other is an SRS-only precoding network driven by uplink SRS. These candidate precoders are subsequently combined by a fusion precoding network to yield the final transmit precoder. All the modules are trained with a spectral-efficiency-oriented loss under a three-stage schedule. Simulation results show that the proposed approach effectively harnesses both SRS-derived information and UE feedback, achieving markedly better performance than conventional baselines.</description>

      <title>Joint Channel Estimation and Computation Offloading in Fluid Antenna-assisted MEC Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the emergence of fluid antenna (FA) in wireless communications, the capability to dynamically adjust port positions offers substantial benefits in spatial diversity and spectrum efficiency, which are particularly valuable for mobile edge computing (MEC) systems. Therefore, we propose an FA-assisted MEC offloading framework to minimize system delay. This framework faces two severe challenges, which are the complexity of channel estimation due to dynamic port configuration and the inherent non-convexity of the joint optimization problem. Firstly, we propose Information Bottleneck Metric-enhanced Channel Compressed Sensing (IBM-CCS), which advances FA channel estimation by integrating information relevance into the sensing process and capturing key features of FA channels effectively. Secondly, to address the non-convex and high-dimensional optimization problem in FA-assisted MEC systems, which includes FA port selection, beamforming, power control, and resource allocation, we propose a game theory-assisted Hierarchical Twin-Dueling Multi-agent Algorithm (HiTDMA) based offloading scheme, where the hierarchical structure effectively decouples and coordinates the optimization tasks between the user side and the base station side. Crucially, the game theory effectively reduces the dimensionality of power control variables, allowing deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents to achieve improved optimization efficiency. Numerical results confirm that the proposed scheme significantly reduces system delay and enhances offloading performance, outperforming benchmarks. Additionally, the IBM-CCS channel estimation demonstrates superior accuracy and robustness under varying port densities, contributing to efficient communication under imperfect CSI.</description>

      <title>A Measurement Report Data-Driven Framework for Localized Statistical Channel Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Localized statistical channel modeling (LSCM) is crucial for effective performance evaluation in digital twin-assisted network optimization. Solely relying on the multi-beam reference signal receiving power (RSRP), LSCM aims to model the localized statistical propagation environment by estimating the channel angular power spectrum (APS). However, existing methods rely heavily on drive test data with high collection costs and limited spatial coverage. In this paper, we propose a measurement report (MR) data-driven framework for LSCM, exploiting the low-cost and extensive collection of MR data. The framework comprises two novel modules. The MR localization module addresses the issue of missing locations in MR data by introducing a semi-supervised method based on hypergraph neural networks, which exploits multi-modal information via distance-aware hypergraph modeling and hypergraph convolution for location extraction. To enhance the computational efficiency and solution robustness, LSCM operates at the grid level. Compared to independently constructing geographically uniform grids and estimating channel APS, the joint grid construction and channel APS estimation module enhances robustness in complex environments with spatially non-uniform data by exploiting their correlation. This module alternately optimizes grid partitioning and APS estimation using clustering and improved sparse recovery for the ill-conditioned measurement matrix and incomplete observations. Through comprehensive experiments on a real-world MR dataset, we demonstrate the superior performance and robustness of our framework in localization and channel modeling.</description>

      <title>Neural Network Based Framework for Passive Intermodulation Cancellation in MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Passive intermodulation (PIM) has emerged as a critical source of self-interference in modern MIMO-OFDM systems, especially under the stringent requirements of 5G and beyond. Conventional cancellation methods often rely on complex nonlinear models with limited scalability and high computational cost. In this work, we propose a lightweight deep learning framework for PIM cancellation that leverages depthwise separable convolutions and dilated convolutions to efficiently capture nonlinear dependencies across antennas and subcarriers. To further enhance convergence, we adopt a cyclic learning rate schedule and gradient clipping. In a controlled MIMO experimental setup, the method effectively suppresses third-order passive intermodulation (PIM) distortion, achieving up to 29dB of average power error (APE) with only 11k trainable parameters. These results highlight the potential of compact neural architectures for scalable interference mitigation in future wireless communication systems.</description>

      <title>Impact of RHIs and ipSIC on Active RIS-NOMA Systems with Low-Precision ADCs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study evaluates the performance of an active reconfigurable intelligent surface (ARIS)-assisted non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) system employing low-precision analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). Analytical approximations for the outage probability (OP) are derived, considering residual hardware impairments (RHIs) and imperfect successive interference cancellation (ipSIC). Additionally, we analyze the asymptotic OP, system throughput, and diversity order at high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed quantized ARIS-NOMA system outperforms its passive counterpart (PRIS-NOMA), achieving lower OP and higher throughput with reduced transmit power requirements and fewer reflecting elements. Moreover, the outage performance of both quantized ARIS-NOMA and PRIS-NOMA systems demonstrates significant improvement as the number of reflecting elements increases. The negative impacts of low-precision ADCs can be effectively mitigated by optimizing transmit power and scaling the number of reflecting elements.</description>

      <title>Martingale Projections and Quantum Decoherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce so-called super/sub-martingale projections as a family of endomorphisms defined on unions of Polish spaces. Such projections allow us to identify martingales as collections of transformations that relate path-valued random variables to each other under conditional expectations. In this sense, super/sub-martingale projections are random functionals that (i) are boundedness preserving and (ii) satisfy a conditional expectation criterion similar to that of the classical martingale theory. As an application to the theory of open quantum systems, we prove (a) that any system-environment interaction that manifests a supermartingale projection on the density matrix gives rise to decoherence, and (b) that any system-environment interaction that manifests a submartingale projection gives rise an increase in Shannon-Wiener information. It follows (c) that martingale projections in an open quantum system give rise both to quantum decoherence and to information gain.</description>

      <title>First-Extinction Law for Resampling Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extinction times in resampling processes are fundamental yet often intractable, as previous formulas scale as $2^M$ with the number of states $M$ present in the initial probability distribution. We solve this by treating multinomial updates as independent square-root diffusions of zero drift, yielding a closed-form law for the first-extinction time. We prove that the mean coincides exactly with the Wright-Fisher result of Baxter et al., thereby replacing exponential-cost evaluations with a linear-cost expression, and we validate this result through extensive simulations. Finally, we demonstrate predictive power for model collapse in a simple self-training setup: the onset of collapse coincides with the resampling-driven first-extinction time computed from the model's initial stationary distribution. These results hint to a unified view of resampling extinction dynamics.</description>

      <title>Exponent Function for Stationary Memoryless Channels with Input Cost at Rates above the Capacity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.06545</link>
      <description>arXiv:1701.06545v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the stationaly memoryless channels with input cost. We prove that for transmission rates above the capacity the correct probability of decoding tends to zero exponentially as the block length $n$ of codes tends to infinity. In the case where both of channel input and output sets are finite, we determine the optimal exponent function on the above exponential decay of the correct probability. To derive this result we use a new technique called the recuresive method, which is based on the information spectrum approach. The recursive method utilize a certain recursive structure on the information spectrum quantities.</description>

      <title>A Combinatorial Perspective on Random Access Efficiency for DNA Storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15722v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the fundamental limits of the recently proposed random access coverage depth problem for DNA data storage. Under this paradigm, it is assumed that the user information consists of $k$ information strands, which are encoded into $n$ strands via a generator matrix $G$. During the sequencing process, the strands are read uniformly at random, as each strand is available in a large number of copies. In this context, the random access coverage depth problem refers to the expected number of reads (i.e., sequenced strands) required to decode a specific information strand requested by the user. This problem heavily depends on the generator matrix $G$, and besides computing the expectation for different choices of $G$, the goal is to construct matrices that minimize the maximum expectation over all possible requested information strands, denoted by $T_{\max}(G)$.
  In this paper, we introduce new techniques to investigate the random access coverage depth problem, capturing its combinatorial nature and identifying the structural properties of generator matrices that are advantageous. We establish two general formulas to determine $T_{\max}(G)$ for arbitrary generator matrices. The first formula depends on the linear dependencies between columns of $G$, whereas the second formula takes into account recovery sets and their intersection structure. We also introduce the concept of recovery balanced codes and provide three sufficient conditions for a code to be recovery balanced. These conditions can be used to compute $T_{\max}(G)$ for various families of codes, such as MDS, simplex, Hamming, and binary Reed-Muller codes. Additionally, we study the performance of modified systematic MDS and simplex matrices, showing that the best results for $T_{\max}(G)$ are achieved with a specific combination of encoded strands and replication of the information strands.</description>

      <title>Sparse Max-Affine Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02225v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents Sparse Gradient Descent as a solution for variable selection in convex piecewise linear regression, where the model is given as the maximum of $k$-affine functions $ x \mapsto \max_{j \in [k]} \langle a_j^\star, x \rangle + b_j^\star$ for $j = 1,\dots,k$. Here, $\{ a_j^\star\}_{j=1}^k$ and $\{b_j^\star\}_{j=1}^k$ denote the ground-truth weight vectors and intercepts. A non-asymptotic local convergence analysis is provided for Sp-GD under sub-Gaussian noise when the covariate distribution satisfies the sub-Gaussianity and anti-concentration properties. When the model order and parameters are fixed, Sp-GD provides an $\epsilon$-accurate estimate given $\mathcal{O}(\max(\epsilon^{-2}\sigma_z^2,1)s\log(d/s))$ observations where $\sigma_z^2$ denotes the noise variance. This also implies the exact parameter recovery by Sp-GD from $\mathcal{O}(s\log(d/s))$ noise-free observations. The proposed initialization scheme uses sparse principal component analysis to estimate the subspace spanned by $\{ a_j^\star\}_{j=1}^k$, then applies an $r$-covering search to estimate the model parameters. A non-asymptotic analysis is presented for this initialization scheme when the covariates and noise samples follow Gaussian distributions. When the model order and parameters are fixed, this initialization scheme provides an $\epsilon$-accurate estimate given $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2}\max(\sigma_z^4,\sigma_z^2,1)s^2\log^4(d))$ observations. A new transformation named Real Maslov Dequantization (RMD) is proposed to transform sparse generalized polynomials into sparse max-affine models. The error decay rate of RMD is shown to be exponentially small in its temperature parameter. Furthermore, theoretical guarantees for Sp-GD are extended to the bounded noise model induced by RMD. Numerical Monte Carlo results corroborate theoretical findings for Sp-GD and the initialization scheme.</description>

      <title>Interactive Inference: A Neuromorphic Theory of Human-Computer Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05935v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neuromorphic Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) is a theoretical approach to designing better user experiences (UX) motivated by advances in the understanding of the neurophysiology of the brain. Inspired by the neuroscientific theory of Active Inference, Interactive Inference is a first example of such approach. It offers a simplified interpretation of Active Inference that allows designers to more readily apply this theory to design and evaluation. In Interactive Inference, user behaviour is modeled as Bayesian inference on progress and goal distributions that predicts the next action. We show how the error between goal and progress distributions, or Bayesian surprise, can be modeled as a simple mean square error of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of a task. The problem is that the user's capacity to process Bayesian surprise follows the logarithm of this SNR. This means errors rise quickly once average capacity is exceeded. Our model allows the quantitative analysis of performance and error using one framework that can provide real-time estimates of the mental load in users that needs to be minimized by design. We show how three basic laws of HCI, Hick's Law, Fitts' Law and the Power Law can be expressed using our model. We then test the validity of the model by empirically measuring how well it predicts human performance and error in a car following task. Results suggest that driver processing capacity indeed is a logarithmic function of the SNR of the distance to a lead car. This result provides initial evidence that Interactive Interference can be useful as a new theoretical design tool.</description>

      <title>Benefits of Mutual Coupling in Dynamic Metasurface Antennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15565v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dynamic metasurface antennas (DMAs) are a promising embodiment of next-generation reconfigurable antenna technology to realize base stations and access points with reduced cost and power consumption. A DMA is a thin structure patterned on its front with reconfigurable radiating metamaterial elements (meta-atoms) that are excited by waveguides or cavities. Mutual coupling between the meta-atoms can result in a strongly non-linear dependence of the DMA's radiation pattern on the configuration of its meta-atoms. However, besides the obvious algorithmic challenges of working with physics-compliant DMA models, it remains unclear how mutual coupling in DMAs influences the ability to achieve a desired wireless functionality. In this paper, we provide theoretical, numerical and experimental evidence that strong mutual coupling in DMAs increases the radiation pattern sensitivity to the DMA configuration and thereby boosts the available control over the radiation pattern, improving the ability to tailor the radiation pattern to the requirements of a desired wireless functionality. Counterintuitively, we hence encourage next-generation DMA implementations to enhance (rather than suppress) mutual coupling, in combination with suitable physics-compliant modeling and optimization. We expect the unveiled mechanism by which mutual coupling boosts the radiation pattern control to also apply to other reconfigurable antenna systems based on tunable lumped elements.</description>

      <title>High-Availability Integrity Monitoring for Multi-Constellation GNSS Navigation with Non-Gaussian Errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04284v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) are essential for aviation, requiring strict integrity monitoring to alert users to hazardously misleading information. Conventional receiver autonomous integrity monitoring (RAIM) and advanced RAIM (ARAIM) rely heavily on Gaussian models in bounding nominal errors, which can be overly conservative with real-world non-Gaussian errors with heavy tails, such as the satellite clock and orbit errors. This paper proposes an extended jackknife detector capable of detecting multiple simultaneous faults with non-Gaussian nominal errors. Furthermore, an integrity monitoring algorithm, jackknife ARAIM, is developed by systematically exploiting the properties of the jackknife detector in the range domain. A tight bound of the integrity risk is derived by quantifying the impacts of hypothetical fault vectors on the position solution. The proposed method is examined in worldwide simulations, with the nominal measurement error simulated based on authentic experimental data, which reveals different findings in existing research. In a setting of a single Global Positioning System (GPS) constellation, the proposed method reduces the 99.5 percentile vertical protection level (VPL) 45m, where the VPL of the baseline ARAIM is larger than 50m in most user locations. For dual-constellation (GPS-Galileo) settings, baseline ARAIM suffers VPL inflation over 60m due to the over-conservatism induced by the heavy-tailed Galileo signal-in-space range errors, whereas the proposed jackknife ARAIM retains VPL below 40m, achieving over 92% normal operations for a 35m Vertical Alert Limit. These improvements have promising potential to support localizer performance with vertical guidance (LPV) with a decision height of 200 ft, enhancing integrity and availability for multi-constellation GNSS applications.</description>

      <title>Error Exponents for Quantum Packing Problems via An Operator Layer Cake Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06232v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we prove a one-shot random coding bound for classical-quantum channel coding, a problem conjectured by Burnashev and Holevo in 1998. By choosing the optimal input distribution, the bound implies the optimal error exponent (i.e., the reliability function) of classical-quantum channels for rates above the critical rate, even in infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. Our result extends to various quantum packing-type problems, including classical communication over any fully quantum channel with or without entanglement-assistance, constant composition codes, and classical data compression with quantum side information via fixed-length or variable-length coding.
  Our technical ingredient is to establish an operator layer cake theorem - the directional derivative of an operator logarithm admits an integral representation of certain projections. This shows that a kind of pretty-good measurement is equivalent to a randomized Holevo-Helstrom measurement, which provides an operational explanation of why the pretty-good measurement is pretty good.</description>
