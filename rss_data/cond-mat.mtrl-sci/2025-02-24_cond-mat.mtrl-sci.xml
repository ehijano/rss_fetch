      <title>Towards an automated workflow in materials science for combining multi-modal simulative and experimental information using data mining and large language models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To retrieve and compare scientific data of simulations and experiments in materials science, data needs to be easily accessible and machine readable to qualify and quantify various materials science phenomena. The recent progress in open science leverages the accessibility to data. However, a majority of information is encoded within scientific documents limiting the capability of finding suitable literature as well as material properties. This manuscript showcases an automated workflow, which unravels the encoded information from scientific literature to a machine readable data structure of texts, figures, tables, equations and meta-data, using natural language processing and language as well as vision transformer models to generate a machine-readable database. The machine-readable database can be enriched with local data, as e.g. unpublished or private material data, leading to knowledge synthesis. The study shows that such an automated workflow accelerates information retrieval, proximate context detection and material property extraction from multi-modal input data exemplarily shown for the research field of microstructural analyses of face-centered cubic single crystals. Ultimately, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based Large Language Model (LLM) enables a fast and efficient question answering chat bot.</description>

      <title>Field Dislocation Mechanics, Conservation of Burgers vector, and the augmented Peierls model of dislocation dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dissipative models for the quasi-static and dynamic response due to slip in an elastic body containing a single slip plane of vanishing thickness are developed. Discrete dislocations with continuously distributed cores can glide on this plane, and the models are developed as special cases of a fully three-dimensional theory of plasticity induced by dislocation motion. The reduced models are compared and contrasted with the augmented Peierls model of dislocation dynamics. A primary distinguishing feature of the reduced models is the a-priori accounting of space-time conservation of Burgers vector during dislocation evolution. A physical shortcoming of the developed models as well as the Peierls model with regard to a dependence on the choice of a distinguished, coherent reference configuration is discussed, and a testable model without such dependence is also proposed.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Field-Controlled Mixed Modulation in Magnetoelectric Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetoelectric (ME) magnetic field sensors commonly rely on one of the two modulation principles: the nonlinear dependence of magnetostrictive strain on the applied field or the stress-induced change in magnetization susceptibility. While both effects coexist in any ME device, different readout schemes can be chosen to utilize one or the other effect for magnetic field sensing. This work demonstrates that both principles can be simultaneously implemented in a single electrically modulated ME sensor with inductive readout (a converse ME sensor). This mixed modulation approach significantly enhances low-frequency sensitivity while not affecting the sensitivity at higher frequencies. This leads to a nontrivial dependency of the sensor sensitivity on the frequency of the magnetic field to be measured and can effectively decrease the sensor bandwidth by up to an order of magnitude. We show that the contribution of the modulation from the nonlinearity of the magnetostrictive strain to the sensor sensitivity can be changed by applying a magnetic bias field, offering an additional dimension to the design of ME sensors, especially for potential applications in the unshielded environment.</description>

      <title>Spin-to-charge conversion at KTaO3(111) interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rashba spin-orbit coupling locks the spin with momentum of charge carriers at the broken inversion interfaces, which could generate a large spin galvanic response. Here, we demonstrate spin-to-charge conversion (inverse Rashba-Edelstein effect) in KTaO3(111) two-dimensional electron systems. We explain the results in the context of electronic structure, orbital character, and spin texture at the KTaO3(111) interfaces. We also show that the angle dependence of the spin-to-charge conversion on in-plane magnetic field exhibits a nontrivial behavior which matches the symmetry of the Fermi states. Results point to opportunities to use spin-to-charge conversion as a tool to investigate the electronic structure and spin texture.</description>

      <title>Stable Neel-Twisted Skyrmion Bags in a van der Waals Magnet Fe3-xGaTe2 at Room Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic skyrmion bags with diverse topological charges Q, offer prospects for future spintronic devices based on freedom of Q. While their emergence in van der Waals magnets holds the potential in developing Q-based 2D topological spintronics. However, previous room-temperature skyrmion bags necessitate special anisotropy engineering through disorder Fe intercalation, and the stable phase diagram for skyrmion bags across room temperature regions is lacking. Here, we demonstrate the observation and electrical manipulation of room temperature skyrmion bags in Fe3-xGaTe2 without specially designed Fe intercalation. Combining the pulsed currents with the assistance of magnetic fields, skyrmion bags with various topological charges are generated and annihilated. Especially double nested skyrmion bags are also discovered at room temperature. The stable temperature-field diagram of skyrmion bags has been established. We also demonstrate the electrical-controlled topological phase transformations of skyrmion bags. Our results will provide novel insights for the design of 2D skyrmion-based high-performance devices.</description>

      <title>Quantum critical electro-optic and piezo-electric nonlinearities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electro-optics, the tuning of optical properties of materials with electric fields, is key to a multitude of quantum and classical photonics applications. However, a major obstacle preventing many emerging use cases is inefficient modulation in cryogenic environments, as traditional tuning mechanisms degrade at low temperatures. Guided by the connection between phase transitions and nonlinearity, we identify the quantum paraelectric perovskite SrTiO$_3$ (STO) as the strongest cryogenic electro-optic photonic material. As a result of the unique quantum paraelectric phase of STO, we demonstrate a dynamically tunable linear Pockels coefficient ($r_{33}$) exceeding 500 pm/V at $T=5$ K, and study its full temperature and bias dependence. We also measure an enhanced piezo-electric coefficient ($d_{33}$) above 90 pC/N. Both of these coefficients exceed all previously reported values for cryogenic materials, including lithium niobate ($r_{33}\approx24$ pm/V) and barium titanate ($r_{42}\approx170$ pm/V). Furthermore, by tuning STO towards \textit{quantum criticality} with oxygen isotope substitution we more than double the optical and piezo-electric nonlinearities, demonstrating a linear Pockels coefficient above 1100 pm/V. Our results probe the link between quantum phase transitions, dielectric susceptibility, and optical nonlinearities, unlocking opportunities in cryogenic optical and mechanical systems, and provide a framework for discovering new nonlinear materials.</description>

      <title>Quantum Emitters in Flux Grown hBN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is an emerging material for use in quantum technologies, hosting bright and stable single photon emitters (SPEs). The B-center is one promising SPE in hBN, due to the near-deterministic creation methods and regular emission wavelength. However, incorporation of B-centers in high-quality crystals remains challenging, typically relying on additional post-growth methods to increase creation efficiency. Here, we have demonstrated controlled carbon doping of hBN during growth, using a metal flux based method to increase the efficiency of B-center creation. Importantly, single B-centers with $g^{(2)}(0) &lt; 0.5$ were able to be generated in the as-grown hBN when carbon additions during growth exceeded 2.5 wt.% C. Resonant excitation measurements revealed linewidths of 3.5 GHz with only moderate spectral diffusion present, demonstrating the applicability of the as-grown hBN as a host for high quality B-centers.</description>

      <title>Decoding lithium's subtle phase stability with a machine learning force field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the phase stability of elemental lithium (Li) is crucial for optimizing its performance in lithium-metal battery anodes, yet this seemingly simple metal exhibits complex polymorphism that requires proper accounting for quantum and anharmonic effects to capture the subtleties in its flat energy landscape. Here we address this challenge by developing an accurate graph neural network-based machine learning force field and performing efficient self-consistent phonon calculations for bcc-, fcc-, and 9R-Li under near-ambient conditions, incorporating quantum, phonon renormalization and thermal expansion effects. Our results reveal the important role of anharmonicity in determining Li's thermodynamic properties. The free energy differences between these phases, particularly fcc- and 9R-Li are found to be only a few meV/atom, explaining the experimental challenges in obtaining phase-pure samples and suggesting a propensity for stacking faults and related defect formation. fcc-Li is confirmed as the ground state at zero temperature and pressure, and the predicted bcc-fcc phase boundary qualitatively matches experimental phase transition lines, despite overestimation of the transition temperature and pressure slope. These findings provide crucial insights into Li's complex polymorphism and establish an effective computational approach for large-scale atomistic simulations of Li in more realistic settings for practical energy storage applications.</description>

      <title>Single monolayer ferromagnetic perovskite SrRuO3 with high conductivity and strong ferromagnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving robust ferromagnetism and high conductivity in atomically thin oxide materials is critical for advancing spintronic technologies. Here, we report the growth of a highly conductive and ferromagnetic single monolayer SrRuO3 having a high Curie temperature of 154 K on DyScO3 110 substrates. The SrTiO3 capping layer effectively suppresses surface reactions, which typically hinder ferromagnetism in atomically thin films. X ray absorption spectroscopy and X ray magnetic circular dichroism measurements revealed strong orbital hybridization between Ru 4d and O 2p orbitals in the SRO monolayer, which contributes to enhancement of the conductivity and ferromagnetic ordering of both the Ru 4d and O 2p orbitals. The resistivity of the single monolayer SrRuO3 on the better lattice matched DyScO3 substrate is approximately one-third of that of previously reported single monolayer SrRuO3 grown on an SrTiO3 substrate. This study highlights the potential of monolayer SrRuO3 as a platform for two dimensional magnetic oxide systems, offering new opportunities for the eploration of spintronic devices and quantum transport phenomena.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Exchange Spin Model to Investigate the Curie Temperature Dispersion of Finite-Size L10-FePt Magnetic Nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We developed an anisotropic spin model that accounts for magnetic anisotropy and evaluated the Curie temperature (Tc) dispersion due to finite size effects in L10-FePt nanoparticles. In heat-assisted magnetic recording (HAMR) media, a next-generation magnetic recording technology, high-density recording is achieved by locally heating L10-FePt nanoparticles near their Tc and rapidly cooling them. However, variations in Tc caused by differences in particle size and shape can compromise recording stability and areal density capacity, making the control of Tc dispersion critical. In this study, we constructed atomistic LLG models to explicitly incorporate the spin exchange anisotropy of L10-FePt, based on parameters determined by first-principles calculations. Using this model, we evaluated the impact of particle size on Tc dispersion. As a result, (1) the Tc dispersion critical to the performance of HAMR can be reproduced, whereas it was previously underestimated by isotropic models and (2) approximately 70% of the experimentally observed Tc dispersion can be attributed to particle size effects. This research highlights the role of exchange anisotropy in amplifying finite-size effects and underscores the importance of size control in HAMR media.</description>

      <title>Ultra-Stable Ferrimagnetic Second-Order Topological Insulator in 2D Metal-Organic Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) magnetic second-order topological insulators (SOTIs) exhibit distinct topological phases characterized by spin-polarized zero-dimensional (0D) corner states, which have garnered significant interest. However, 2D ferrimagnetic (FiM) SOTIs, particularly those that simultaneously exhibit ultra-stable corner states, are still lacking. Here, based on first-principles calculations and theoretical analysis, we reveal such SOTI state in a 2D metal-organic framework (MOF) material, Cr(pyz)2 (pyz = pyrazine). This material exhibits FiM ground state with an easy axis aligned along [001] direction. It hosts a nontrivial real Chern number in the spin-up channel, enabled by PT symmetry, with 0D corner states observable in disk. In contrast, the spin-down channel exhibits a trivial gapped bulk state. Notably, the topological corner states in monolayer Cr(pyz)2 show high robustness, even if the symmetries are broken by introducing defects, the corner states persist. We also considered other external perturbations, including uniaxial/biaxial strain, ligand rotation, and electric fields, the corner states still remain stable. Even more, the energy positions of the corner states are also nearly unchanged. This work is the first to identify ultra-stable FiM SOTI state in the MOF system, and provide an ideal platform for future experimental investigations and applications in spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional fully-compensated Ferrimagnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Antiferromagnetic spintronics has long been a subject of intense research interest, and the recent introduction of altermagnetism has further ignited enthusiasm in the field. However, fully-compensated ferrimagnetism, which exhibits band spin splitting but zero net magnetization, has yet to receive enough attention. Since the experimental preparation of two-dimensional (2D) magnetic van der Waals (vdW) materials in 2017, 2D magnetic materials, thanks to their super tunability, have quickly become an important playground for spintronics. Here, we extend the concept of fully-compensated ferrimagnetism (fFIM) to two dimensions and propose 2D \textit{filling-enforced} fFIM, demonstrate its stability and ease of manipulation, and present three feasible realization schemes with respective exemplary candidate materials. A simple model for 2D fully-compensated ferrimagnets (fFIMs) is developed. Further investigation of 2D fFIMs' physical properties reveals that they not only exhibit significant magneto-optical response but also show fully spin-polarized currents and the anomalous Hall effect in the half-metallic states, displaying characteristics previously almost exclusive to ferromagnetic materials, greatly broadening the research and application prospects of spintronic materials.</description>

Abstract: We report on the angle-resolved polarized Raman spectroscopy and estimation of the Raman tensor elements using both classical and quantum treatments to analyse the polarized Raman spectra of single crystal Bismuth Telluride. The observed polar patterns and systematic variations in the relative intensities of four characteristic Raman active modes indicate a higher differential polarizability along the c-axis, accompanied by anisotropic photon-phonon interactions. This interplay of electron-photon-phonon interactions is crucial for understanding the lattice dynamics of Bismuth Telluride, which underpin its thermoelectric performance and topological properties.</description>

      <title>(111) Facet-engineered SnO2 as Electron Transport Layer for Efficient and Stable Triple-Cation Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the (111) facet-engineered cubic phase SnO2 (C-SnO2) as a novel electron transport layer (ETL) for triple-cation mixed-halide Cs0.05(FA0.83MA0.17)0.95Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3 perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The C-SnO2 layer was prepared via a normal sol-gel process followed by the spin-coating technique. The (111) facet C-SnO2 layer provides a larger surface contact area with an adjacent perovskite layer, enhancing charge transfer dynamics at the interface. In addition, the well-matched overlapping band structures improve the charge extraction efficiency between the two layers. Using (111) facet C-SnO2 as ETLs, we obtain PSCs with a higher power conversion efficiency of 20.34% (0.09 cm2) than those employing tetragonal phase SnO2 ETL. The PSCs with C-SnO2 ETL retain over 81% of their initial efficiency even after 480 h.

      <title>Nanoindentation responses of Fe-Cr alloys from room temperature to 600 {\deg}C</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, the evolution of nanomechanical properties was studied systematically as a function of temperature, chemical, and microstructural complexity of different Fe-based alloys. Experiments were performed at different temperatures (room temperature, 200 C, 400 C, 600 C) using the nanoindentation technique on low activation Fe9Cr-1WVTa (Eurofer97), model Fe-9Cr-NiSiP, Fe-9Cr alloys, and pure iron samples, followed by microstructural observations. The results show varying softening and hardening effects depending on the experimental temperature, demonstrating Portevin-Le-Chatelier effect, i.e., dynamic strain aging phenomenon in model alloys. Sources of the dynamic strain aging instabilities were traced back to the interaction between dislocations and alloying elements such as interstitial carbon and substitutional chromium. The materials undergo dynamic recovery and recrystallization below the regions of high-temperature indentation depending on the pre-indentation dislocation density and the alloy composition. Our findings help in the understanding of the structure and mechanical property relationship in complex Eurofer97 alloy at high-temperatures for potential nuclear applications as structural materials.</description>

      <title>Thermally-induced microstructural evolution in nanoparticle-based CuO, WO$_3$ and CuO-WO$_3$ thin films for hydrogen gas sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study systematically investigates the microstructural evolution of nanoparticle-based CuO, WO$_3$, and composite 'CuO-WO$_3$' thin films induced by their post-deposition annealing. The films were reactively deposited using a magnetron-based gas aggregation technique, with the composite films consisting of alternating monolayers of CuO and WO$_3$ nanoparticles. After deposition, the films were annealed in synthetic air at temperatures ranging from 200 to 400$^\circ$C and characterized using scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Annealing of the CuO films led to the most pronounced changes associated with a gradual enhancement of crystallinity accompanied by significant particle growth with increasing annealing temperature, while the WO$_3$ and CuO-WO$_3$ films were more thermally stable to crystallization and particle growth. Notably, at 400$^\circ$C, the CuO--WO$_3$ films crystallized into a novel $\gamma$-CuWO$_4$ phase. The annealed films were further evaluated for their gas-sensing performance upon H$_2$ exposure and the obtained results were analyzed in relation to film properties and the microstructural evolution induced by annealing.</description>

      <title>Interaction of dopants with the I$_3$-type basal stacking fault in hexagonal-diamond Si</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently synthesized hexagonal-diamond silicon, germanium, and silicon-germanium nanowires exhibit remarkable optical and electronic properties when compared to cubic-diamond polytypes. Because of the metastability of the hexagonal-diamond phase, I$_3$-type basal stacking faults are frequently observed in these materials. In the present study, we employ density functional theory calculations to investigate the interaction of extrinsic dopants (group III, IV, and V elements) with the I$_3$-type basal stacking fault in hexagonal-diamond silicon. Contrary to the behavior observed in cubic-diamond silicon with intrinsic stacking faults, we demonstrate that neutral and negatively charged $p$-type impurities exhibit a marked tendency to occupy lattice sites far from the I$_3$-type basal stacking fault. The interaction of acceptors with the planar defect reduces their energetic stability. However, this effect is much less pronounced for neutral or positively charged $n$-type dopants and isovalent impurities. The thermodynamic energy barrier to segregation for these dopants is small and may even become negative, indicating a tendency to segregate into the fault. Through a detailed analysis of structural modifications, ionization effects, and impurity-level charge density distribution, we show that the origin of this behavior can be attributed to variations in the impurity's steric effects and its wave function character. Finally, all these results are validated by considering the extreme case of an abrupt hexagonal/cubic silicon interface, where acceptor segregation from the cubic to the hexagonal region is demonstrated, confirming the behavior observed for $p$-type dopants near to the I$_3$-type defect.</description>

      <title>Fine-tuning foundation models of materials interatomic potentials with frozen transfer learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine-learned interatomic potentials are revolutionising atomistic materials simulations by providing accurate and scalable predictions within the scope covered by the training data. However, generation of an accurate and robust training data set remains a challenge, often requiring thousands of first-principles calculations to achieve high accuracy. Foundation models have started to emerge with the ambition to create universally applicable potentials across a wide range of materials. While foundation models can be robust and transferable, they do not yet achieve the accuracy required to predict reaction barriers, phase transitions, and material stability. This work demonstrates that foundation model potentials can reach chemical accuracy when fine-tuned using transfer learning with partially frozen weights and biases. For two challenging datasets on reactive chemistry at surfaces and stability and elastic properties of tertiary alloys, we show that frozen transfer learning with 10-20% of the data (hundreds of datapoints) achieves similar accuracies to models trained from scratch (on thousands of datapoints). Moreover, we show that an equally accurate, but significantly more efficient surrogate model can be built using the transfer learned potential as the ground truth. In combination, we present a simulation workflow for machine learning potentials that improves data efficiency and computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Formation mechanism, stability and role of zinc and sulfur vacancies on the electronic properties and optical response of ZnS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Combining experimental and theoretical tools, we report that Zn vacanciesplay an important role in the electronic and optical responses of ZnS sphalerite. The defective surface of ZnS (001) single crystal prepared in ultra-highvacuum conditions, has been shown to exhibit a semiconducting character instead of the insulating properties of the pristine structure, as revealed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Interestingly, this effect is attributed to the formation of zinc vacancies in the ZnS system, which also alter the optical response of the material, as supported by photoluminescence (PL) measurements comparing pristine and S-rich (Zn-poor) ZnS. To address these findings from a theoretical point of view, first principles calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) were performed. The optical properties of cation-defective ZnS were evaluated using random-phase approximation and hybrid functional DFT calculations. These calculations revealed absorption peaks in the visible range in the defective ZnS rather than solely in the ultra-violet range obtained for defect-free ZnS. The combination of this finding with joint density of states (JDOS) analysis explains the emergence of new luminescence peaks observed in the PL spectra of cation-defective ZnS. These findings highlight the role of Zn vacancies in tuning ZnS optical properties, making it a potential candidate for optoelectronic applications such as LEDs and photodetectors.</description>

      <title>Universal Semantic Embeddings of Chemical Elements for Enhanced Materials Inference and Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a framework for generating universal semantic embeddings of chemical elements to advance materials inference and discovery. This framework leverages ElementBERT, a domain-specific BERT-based natural language processing model trained on 1.29 million abstracts of alloy-related scientific papers, to capture latent knowledge and contextual relationships specific to alloys. These semantic embeddings serve as robust elemental descriptors, consistently outperforming traditional empirical descriptors with significant improvements across multiple downstream tasks. These include predicting mechanical and transformation properties, classifying phase structures, and optimizing materials properties via Bayesian optimization. Applications to titanium alloys, high-entropy alloys, and shape memory alloys demonstrate up to 23% gains in prediction accuracy. Our results show that ElementBERT surpasses general-purpose BERT variants by encoding specialized alloy knowledge. By bridging contextual insights from scientific literature with quantitative inference, our framework accelerates the discovery and optimization of advanced materials, with potential applications extending beyond alloys to other material classes.</description>

      <title>Expanding the reach of diffusing wave spectroscopy and tracer bead microrheology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusing Wave Spectroscopy (DWS) is an extension of standard dynamic light scattering (DLS), applied to soft materials that are turbid or opaque. The propagation of light is modeled using light diffusion, characterized by a light diffusion coefficient that depends on the transport mean free path l* of the medium. DWS is highly sensitive to small particle displacements or other local fluctuations in the scattering properties and can probe subnanometer displacements. Analyzing the motion of beads in a viscoelastic matrix, known as one-bead microrheology, is one of the most common applications of DWS. Despite significant advancements since its invention in 1987, including two-cell and multi-speckle DWS, challenges such as merging single and multi-speckle data and limited accuracy for short correlation times persist. Here, we address these issues by improving the two-cell Echo DWS scheme. We propose a calibration-free method to blend and merge Echo and two-cell DWS data and demonstrate the use of regularized inversion algorithms to enhance data quality at very short times. Building on this, we introduce stable corrections for bead and fluid inertia, significantly improving the quality of microrheology data at high frequencies.</description>

      <title>Quantum Emitters in Rhombohedral Boron Nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rhombohedral boron nitride (rBN) is an emerging wide-bandgap van der Waals (vdW) material that combines strong second-order nonlinear optical properties with the structural flexibility of layered 2D systems. Here we show that rBN hosts optically-addressable spin defects and single-photon emitters (SPEs). Both are fabricated deterministically, using site-specific techniques, and are compared to their analogues in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). Emission spectra in hBN and rBN are compared, and computational models of defects in hBN and rBN are used to elucidate the debated atomic structure of the B-center SPE in BN. Our results establish rBN as a monolithic vdW platform that uniquely combines second-order nonlinear optical properties, optically addressable spin defects, and high-quality SPEs, opening new possibilities for integrated quantum and nonlinear photonics.</description>

      <title>Superconducting phenomena in systems with unconventional magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we review the recent advances on superconducting phenomena in junctions formed by superconductors and unconventional magnets. Conventional magnets, such as ferromagnets and antiferromagnets, are characterized by broken time-reversal symmetry but only ferromagnets produce a finite net magnetization due to parallel spin alignment and spin-split bands in momentum. Very recently, a new type of magnets have been reported and here we refer to them as \emph{unconventional magnets} because they exhibit special properties of both ferromagnets and antiferromagnets: they exhibit zero net magnetization (like antiferromagnets) and a nonrelativistic spin splitting of energy bands (like ferromagnets), both leading to anisotropic spin-polarized Fermi surfaces. An interesting property of unconventional magnets is that their magnetic order can be even or odd with respect to momentum, where \emph{$d$-wave altermagnets} and \emph{$p$-wave magnets} are the most representative examples. In this regard, $d$-wave altermagnetism and $p$-wave magnets are seen as counterparts in magnetism of the unconventional $d$-wave and $p$-wave superconducting states, respectively. While the impact of conventional magnetism on superconductivity has been largely studied, the combination of unconventional magnets and superconductivity has only lately attracted considerably attention. This work provides a comprehensive review of the recent progress on the interplay between superconductivity and unconventional magnets. In particular, we focus on the fundamental emerging superconducting phenomena and also discuss the potential implications towards quantum applications.</description>

      <title>MoMa: A Modular Deep Learning Framework for Material Property Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning methods for material property prediction have been widely explored to advance materials discovery. However, the prevailing pre-train then fine-tune paradigm often fails to address the inherent diversity and disparity of material tasks. To overcome these challenges, we introduce MoMa, a Modular framework for Materials that first trains specialized modules across a wide range of tasks and then adaptively composes synergistic modules tailored to each downstream scenario. Evaluation across 17 datasets demonstrates the superiority of MoMa, with a substantial 14% average improvement over the strongest baseline. Few-shot and continual learning experiments further highlight MoMa's potential for real-world applications. Pioneering a new paradigm of modular material learning, MoMa will be open-sourced to foster broader community collaboration.</description>

      <title>Lattice dynamics and spin-phonon coupling in the kagome spin ice HoAgGe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We employ polarization-resolved Raman spectroscopy and first-principles phonon calculations to study the lattice dynamics and spin-phonon coupling in the kagome spin ice compound HoAgGe. Upon cooling, HoAgGe shows transitions from a nonmagnetic state at 300 K to a partially magnetic-ordered phase below T2 = 11.6 K, eventually reaching a fully-magnetic ordered phase below T1 = 7 K. We detect eight of ten Raman-active phonon modes at room temperature, with frequencies consistent with first-principles phonon calculations. We find that the low-energy phonon modes harden upon cooling, soften slightly below T2, and finally harden again below T1, suggesting finite spin-phonon coupling in HoAgGe. Furthermore, one high-energy mode at 185 cm-1 with E' symmetry exhibits a Fano lineshape due to electron-phonon coupling. Our Raman results establish finite spin-phonon coupling and electron-phonon coupling in the magnetic phase of HoAgGe, providing a foundation for future studies of the novel field-induced phases at low temperatures in HoAgGe.</description>

      <title>Accurate and efficient machine learning interatomic potentials for finite temperature modeling of molecular crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As with many parts of the natural sciences, machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) are revolutionizing the modeling of molecular crystals. However, challenges remain for the accurate and efficient calculation of sublimation enthalpies - a key thermodynamic quantity measuring the stability of a molecular crystal. Specifically, two key stumbling blocks are: (i) the need for thousands of ab initio quality reference structures to generate training data; and (ii) the sometimes unreliable nature of density functional theory, the main technique for generating such data. Exploiting recent developments in foundational models for chemistry and materials science alongside accurate quantum diffusion Monte Carlo benchmarks, offers a promising path forward. Herein, we demonstrate the generation of MLIPs capable of describing molecular crystals at finite temperature and pressure with sub-chemical accuracy, using as few as $\sim 200$ data structures; an order of magnitude improvement over the current state-of-the-art. We apply this framework to compute the sublimation enthalpies of the X23 dataset, accounting for anharmonicity and nuclear quantum effects, achieving sub-chemical accuracy with respect to experiment. Importantly, we show that our framework can be generalized to crystals of pharmaceutical relevance, including paracetamol and aspirin. Nuclear quantum effects are also accurately captured as shown for the case of squaric acid. By enabling accurate modeling at ambient conditions, this work paves the way for deeper insights into pharmaceutical and biological systems.</description>

Abstract: Sulfur was the first nonmetal element which was transformed to a superconductor by applying megabar pressure. Recent pioneering experimental developments in measuring the superconducting energy gap $\Delta(T)$ in compressed sulfur using tunneling spectroscopy (Du $\textit{et al}$., $\textit{Phys. Rev. Lett.}$ $\textbf{133}$, 036002 (2024)) initiated an interest in better understanding real atomic structure and superconducting properties of this element at high pressure. Here, we analyzed available experimental data on highly compressed sulfur, and, from the $\Delta(T)$ data reported by Du $\textit{et al}$. (2024), we extracted the specific heat jump at the transition temperature of ${\Delta}C_{el}/{\gamma}T_{c} = 1.8$. We also developed a model to extract the Debye temperatures ${\Theta}_D$ for sulfur and $H_{3}S$ in two-phases sample from the temperature-dependent resistance $R(T)$. for better understanding of material structure, here we proposed to use a size-strain map for highly compressed samples, and we revealed this size-strain map for laser-heated sulfur in a diamond anvil cell with a mixture of sulfur and $H{_3}S$. Finally, we found that superconducting sulfur exhibits a moderate level of nonadiabaticity $0.04 \leq {\Theta}_{D}/T_{F} \leq 0.15$ (where $T_{F}$ is the Fermi temperature), which is similar to $MgB_2$, pnictides, cuprates, $La_{4}H_{23}$, $ThH_{9}$, $H_{3}S$, $LaBeH_{8}$, and $LaH_{10}$.</description>

Abstract: Altermagnets constitute a class of collinear compensated N\'eel ordered magnets that break time-reversal symmetry and feature spin-split band structures. Based on versatile microscopic models able to capture the altermagnetic sublattice degrees of freedom, we study characteristic local signatures of altermagnetism near disorder sites. We give a complete list of two-dimensional models that exhibit altermagnetism classified by their corresponding layer groups. Specifically, we calculate the local density of states in the vicinity of pointlike nonmagnetic impurities and expose its spatial dependence for two minimal models showcasing $d$-wave and $g$-wave altermagnetism. The momentum structure of the nodes ($d$-wave, $g$-wave, etc.) is directly imprinted on the total local density of states, thus measurable by scanning tunneling conductance experiments. This signature is present both in the spin-resolved as well as the spin-summed local density of states. We find a weaker response in the nonmagnetic state from the anisotropic crystal environment and uncover the importance of the sublattice degree of freedom to model altermagnets. We also study coexistence phases of altermagnetism and superconductivity and provide predictions for the local impurity response of in-gap bound states. The response of impurity bound states strongly enhances the distinct altermagnetic signature.</description>

      <title>Compositional phase stability in medium-entropy and high-entropy Cantor-Wu alloys from an ab initio all-electron, Landau-type theory and atomistic modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.08468v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe implementation and analysis of a first-principles theory, derived in an earlier work, for the leading terms in an expansion of a Gibbs free energy of a multi-component alloy in terms of order parameters that characterize potential, compositional phases. The theory includes effects of rearranging charge and other electronics from changing atomic occupancies on lattice sites. As well as the rigorous description of atomic short-range order in the homogeneously disordered phase, pairwise interaction parameters suited for atomistic modelling in a multicomponent setting can be calculated. From our study of an indicative series of the Cantor-Wu alloys, NiCo, NiCoCr, NiCoFeCr, and NiCoFeMnCr, we find that the interactions are not approximated well either as pseudobinary or restricted to nearest neighbour range. Our computed order-disorder transition temperatures are low, consistent with experimental observations, and the nature of the ordering is dominated by correlations between Ni, Co, and Cr, while Fe and Mn interact weakly. Further atomistic modelling suggests that there is no true single-phase low-temperature ground state for these multicomponent systems. Instead the single-phase solid solution is kept stable to low temperatures by the large configurational entropy and the Fe, Mn dilution effects. The computationally cost-effectiveness of our method makes it a good candidate for further exploration of the space of multicomponent alloys.</description>

      <title>Low temperature phase of AuSn$_{4}$ induced by the van der Waals interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.10571v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: AuSn$_{4}$ is the example of an compound that exhibits topological properties. Recent XRD measurements reveal an ambiguous nature of the crystal structure, as it can be realized with either Aea2 or Ccca symmetry. Motivated by this, we analyze the dynamical stability of the compound. We discuss the role of van der Waals (vdW) corrections within the ab initio calculation. Interestingly, our main result indicates that AuSn$_{4}$ can be unstable with both Aea2 and Ccca symmetries, due to the soft modes in the phonon spectra. From the soft mode analyses we find dynamically stable Pc structure. This structure has always smaller energy than Aea2 or Ccca crystal and it stays independent of the vdW correction. We also show that the comparison of theoretical electronic properties with the experimental ARPES measurements. Our findings may be valuable in the future investigations of AuSn$_{4}$-like compounds.</description>

      <title>tda-segmentor: A tool to extract and analyze local structure and porosity features in porous materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16558v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Local geometrical features of a porous material such as the shape and size of a pore or the curvature of a solid ligament often affect the macroscopic properties of the material, and their characterization is necessary to fully understand the structure-property relationships.In this contribution, we present an approach to automatically segment large porous structures into such local features. Our work takes inspiration from techniques available in Topological Data Analysis(TDA).In particular, using Morse theory, we generate Morse-Smale Complexes(MSC) of our structures that segment the structure, and/or its porosity into individual features that can then be compared. We develop a tool that is built on the topology toolkit (TTK) library, an open source platform for the topological analysis of scalar data, with which we can perform segmentation of these structures. Our tool takes a volumetric grid representation as an input, which can be generated from atomistic or mesh structure models and any function defined on such grid, e.g. the distance to the surface or the interaction energy with a probe. We demonstrate the applicability of the tool by two examples related with analysis of porosity in zeolite materials as well as analysis of ligaments in a porous metal structure. Specifically, by segmenting the pores in the structure we demonstrate some applications to zeolites such as assessing pore-similarity between structures or evaluating the accessible volume to a target molecule such as methane that can be adsorbed to its surface. Moreover, once the MSC's are generated, we can construct graph representations of the void space, replacing the entire pore structure by a simply connected graph. Similarly, the same tool is used to segment and generate graphs representing the solid structure and we show how they can be used to correlate structure and mechanical properties of the material.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Multimodal Machine Learning Analysis of X-ray Absorption Near-Edge Spectra and Pair Distribution Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17467v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We used interpretable machine learning to combine information from multiple heterogeneous spectra: X-ray absorption near-edge spectra (XANES) and atomic pair distribution functions (PDFs) to extract local structural and chemical environments of transition metal cations in oxides. Random forest models were trained on simulated XANES, PDF, and both combined to extract oxidation state, coordination number, and mean nearest-neighbor bond length. XANES-only models generally outperformed PDF-only models, even for structural tasks, although using the metal's differential PDFs (dPDFs) instead of total PDFs narrowed this gap. When combined with PDFs, information from XANES often dominates the prediction. Our results demonstrate that XANES contain rich structural information and highlight the utility of species-specificity. This interpretable, multimodal approach is quick to implement with suitable databases and offers valuable insights into the relative strengths of different modalities, guiding researchers in experiment design and identifying when combining complementary techniques adds meaningful information to a scientific investigation.</description>

      <title>Magneto-optical evidence of tilting effect in coupled Weyl bands</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17081v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Theories have revealed the universality of the band tilting effect in topological Weyl semimetals (WSMs) and its implications for the material's physical properties. However, the experimental identification of tilted Weyl bands remains much less explored. Here, by combining magneto-infrared optical studies with a four-band coupled Weyl point model, we report spectroscopic evidence of the tilting effect in the well-established WSM niobium phosphide. Specifically, we observe Landau level transitions with rich features that are well reproduced within a model of coupled tilted Weyl points. Our analysis indicates that the tilting effect relaxes the selection rules and gives rise to transitions that would otherwise be forbidden in the non-tilt case. Additionally, we observe unconventional interband transitions with flat and negative magnetic field dispersions, highlighting the importance of coupling between Weyl points. Our results not only emphasize the significance of the tilting effect in the optical responses of WSMs but also demonstrate magneto-optics as an effective tool for probing the tilting effect in electronic band structures.</description>

      <title>Quantum effects in surface diffusion: application to diffusion of nitrogen adatoms over GaN(0001) surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19079v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is shown that quantum effects play determining role in nitrogen adatom diffusion due to several different factors. This could be related to the change of the energy of the quantum states and also due to the redistribution of electrons between the quantum states, both full and resonant, via quantum statistics partially governed by the Fermi energy level. These effects were studied in the case of nitrogen diffusion over clean and gallium covered Ga-terminated GaN(0001) surface. For the fractional coverage the density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that at the saddle point configuration the redistribution of electrons between different quantum states may affect the surface diffusion barrier significantly. The other quantum influence occurs via the change of the minimal energy configuration. Under fractional Ga coverage of GaN(0001) surface the nitrogen diffusion energy barrier proceeds from the resonant states governed energy minimal H3 site across the saddle point in the bridge configuration. At this path the barrier is affected the electron redistribution between surface quantum states both in the initial and the saddle point. In the case of the full GaN coverage the diffusion path is from on-top N adatom configuration via H3 site that corresponds to maximal energy. Therefore the diffusion barrier is Ebar= 1.18 eV for clean and Ebar= 0.92 eV for (1/6) ML to finally Ebar= 1.23 eV for full Ga coverage. Thus the overall barrier is reduced to Ebar= 0.92 eV due to quantum statistics effects. The identified stable N on-top configuration for the full coverage is essential for atomic mechanism of GaN growth in Ga-rich regime.</description>

      <title>Elasto-Hall conductivity and the anomalous Hall effect in altermagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03517v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Altermagnets break time-reversal symmetry, preserve the crystal translation invariance, and have a spin density with $d$-wave, $g$-wave, etc. momentum dependencies which do not contribute to the magnetization. When an $s$-wave spin-density contribution cannot be excluded by symmetry a small magnetization and an anomalous Hall effect (AHE) emerge. However, for so-called "pure" altermagnets, where the $s$-wave component is symmetry forbidden even in the presence of SOC, both the zero-field magnetization and the AHE vanish. We show that altermagnets generally exhibit a non-zero elasto-Hall-conductivity, by which application of strain leads to a non-zero AHE. For pure altermagnets it is the only contribution to the AHE. This elasto-Hall-conductivity is caused by strain coupling to the Berry curvature quadrupole that characterizes altermagnets and allows for the determination of the altermagnetic order using transport measurements that are linear in the electrical field. We further show that the emergence of a non-zero magnetization in the presence of strain arises from a different response function: piezomagnetism. While this magnetization gives rise to an additional contribution to the elasto-Hall conductivity, the corresponding Berry curvature is qualitatively different from the distorted Berry curvature quadrupole originating from the altermagnetic order parameter. This insight also helps to disentangle AHE and weak ferromagnetism for systems with symmetry-allowed $s$-wave contribution. Quantitatively, the elasto-Hall conductivity is particularly pronounced for systems with a Dirac spectrum in the altermagnetic state. The same mechanism gives rise to anomalous elasto-thermal Hall, Nernst, and Ettinghausen effects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11050v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interplay between magnetism and light can create abundant optical phenomena. Here, we demonstrated the emergence of an unconventional magnetization-induced second-harmonic generation (MSHG) stemming from vector spin chirality, denoted as chiral SHG. Taking bilayer antiferromagnetic (AFM) CrSBr as a prototype, we theoretically showed that, via spin canting, the chiral SHG can be continuously tuned from zero to a value one order of magnitude larger than its intrinsic MSHG. Remarkbly, chiral SHG was found to be proportional to the spin chirality and spin canting-induced electric polarization, while the intrinsic MSHG was proportional to the N\'eel vector, demonstrating their different physical mechanisms. Additionally, we revealed a unique interference effect between these two types of MSHG under the reversal of spin canting direction, generating giant modulation of SHG signals. Our work not only uncovers a novel SHG with superb tunability but also advances the applications of AFM optical devices and magnetoelectric detection.</description>

Abstract: The ground-state quantum geometry is at the root of several static and adiabatic properties, while genuinely dynamic properties are routinely addressed via Kubo formulae, whose essential entries are the excited states. It is shown here that the ground-state metric-curvature tensor evolves in time by means of a causal unitary operator, which by construction elucidates the geometrical effect of the excited states in compact form. In the condensed-matter case the generalized tensor encompasses the whole conductivity tensor at arbitrary frequencies in both insulators and metals, with the exception of the Drude term in the metallic case; the latter is shown to be eminently nongeometrical.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.10602v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Researchers in physical science aim to uncover universal features in strongly interacting many-body systems, often hidden in complicated observables like entanglement entropy (EE). The non-local nature of EE makes it challenging to compute numerically, necessitating the development of an unbiased and convenient algorithm. In this paper, we use quantum Monte Carlo to reveal that the coefficient of variation in direct EE calculations increases exponentially with system size, leading to inaccuracies. To address this issue, we develop a power incremental algorithm and a technique for straightforwardly calculating the universal term of EE, successfully evaluating the EE of a 2D Hubbard model. Our numerical results demonstrate the consistency of the universal coefficient of EE from sharp corners at the Gross-Neveu quantum critical point and for free Dirac fermions. Our method can also be applied to other unstable observables, such as partition functions, entanglement spectra, and negativity, thereby fostering computational and theoretical progress.</description>

Abstract: This paper explores the potential for spin-triplet superconductivity in molecular beam epitaxy grown PbTe/SnTe semiconductor heterostructures. We present convincing evidence for spin-triplet pairing by soft point-contact spectroscopy, using both spin-polarized and unpolarized electrons and additionally, by detailed analysis of the upper critical field, as inferred from the four probe resistance measurements. The experimental data are described in terms of the Anderson-Brinkman-Morel model of p-wave electron pairing. Our results confirm the predictions on strain-induced topological superconductivity by E.Tang and L. Fu.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the electronic shot noise produced by nanowires of $\beta$-Ta, an archetypal ``bad" metal with resistivity near the Ioffe-Regel localization limit. The Fano factor characterizing the shot noise exhibits a strong dependence on temperature and is suppressed compared to the expectations for quasiparticle diffusion, but hopping transport is ruled out by the analysis of scaling with the nanowire length. These anomalous behaviors closely resemble those of strange metal nanowires, suggesting that $\beta$-Ta may host a correlated electron liquid. This material provides an accessible platform for exploring exotic electronic states of matter.</description>
