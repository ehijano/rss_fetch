      <title>Frequency-offset separated oscillatory fields technique applied to neutrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The novel technique of frequency-offset separated oscillatory fields (FOSOF) has been originally proposed as a modification to Ramsey's method of separated oscillatory fields. It has recently been employed in precision measurements with atomic beams since it allows for an alternative approach to determine absolute resonance frequencies. We present results from a systematic investigation of the FOSOF technique adapted to a beam of cold neutrons.</description>

      <title>DEDALO: Device for Enhanced Dust Analyses with Light Obscuration sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Instruments based on light obscuration sensors are widely used for measuring the size distribution of insoluble sub-visible particles in liquid suspensions, being fast and suitable for in situ and real-time measurements. Such instruments are typically calibrated by means of reference polystyrene spherical particles with a specific refractive index, which unavoidably leads to systematic errors when determining the size of particles of different materials. In this paper, we propose a reliable and consistent method to overcome this limitation by setting the refractive index value according to the sample, thus achieving an improved particle size distribution (PSD) measurement. An ad hoc, ready-to-use, open source code with a graphical interface able to drive an in-line instrument and obtain a real-time correction to the PSD has been developed. The method has been extensively validated with several oil emulsions characterized by different refractive index values and the results have been compared with an independent optical method. As an example of application, we have adopted this approach for the analysis of dust suspended in meltwater of an ice core from a glacier in the Aosta Valley (Italy). We believe that our approach will strongly improve the accuracy in characterizing liquid suspensions and reduce discrepancies between data obtained with different methods. The code has been made publicly available at:https://instrumentaloptics.fisica.unimi.it/dedalo/ and on the GitHub page of the corresponding author (https://github.com/LucaTeruzzi/DEDALO).</description>

      <title>Frequency response limitation of heat flux meters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heat flux meters are used for measuring the heat flux densities going through walls, usually at quasi-steady state. The limitations of heat flux meters under dynamic conditions are well documented in the literature; nonetheless there is a theoretical limitation which is mostly not considered and should be also taken into account. Since heat transfer is a dissipative process, it would be expected to obtain transfer functions which act as low pass filters. Nonetheless, this paper shows that the transfer functions modeling heat flow rate may become high pass filters, which is against the physical evidence. In order to show this theoretical limitation of the heat flux meters, the heat equation is transformed in different classes of models, from partial differential equations to transfer functions related to surface temperatures and heat flux density going through a wall.</description>

      <title>Circular polarization measurement for individual gamma rays in capture reactions with intense pulsed neutrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measurements of circular polarization of $\gamma$-ray emitted from neutron capture reactions provide valuable information for nuclear physics studies. The spin and parity of excited states can be determined by measuring the circular polarization from polarized neutron capture reactions. Furthermore, the $\gamma$-ray circular polarization in a neutron capture resonance is crucial for studying the enhancement effect of parity nonconservation in compound nuclei. The $\gamma$-ray circular polarization can be measured using a polarimeter based on magnetic Compton scattering. A polarimeter was constructed, and its performance indicators were evaluated using a circularly polarized $\gamma$-ray beam. Furthermore, as a demonstration, the $\gamma$-ray circular polarization was measured in $^{32}$S($\vec{\textrm{n}}$,$\gamma$)$^{33}$S reactions with polarized neutrons.</description>

      <title>Preliminary Design of a General Electronics Platform for Accelerator Facilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many accelerators require considerable electronic systems for tests, verification, and operation. In Shenzhen Superconducting Soft X-ray Free Electron Laser (S3FEL), to meet the early tests and verification of various systems, save development expenses, and improve the reusability of hardware, firmware, and software systems, we have considered the needs of each system and preliminarily designed a general electronics platform based on MicroTCA.4. The Advanced Mezzanine Card (AMC) will place an FPGA Mezzanine Card (FMC) that supports 500 MSPS to 2 GSPS ADC/DAC. We will design two FMC cards on the Rear Transition Module (RTM), which can be used for analog signal conditioning and waveform digitization by 10 MSPS to 250 MSPS ADC/DAC or motor control. The commercial MCH, CPU, power module, and MTCA crate are deployed. This platform can also be applied to other accelerator facilities.</description>

      <title>MacroQueue: Automating Measurements in High-Dimensional Parameter Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laboratory measurements often use several instruments to fully explore the relevant parameter space; such as, an external lock-in amplifier, an electromagnet, an RF generator, etc.. Ordinarily, these instruments have to be individually controlled and their parameters have to be manually recorded. MacroQueue enables effortless measurements throughout these high-dimensional parameter space systems. MacroQueue is a modular software designed for controlling and automating various laboratory equipment in sync without requiring coding ability. Currently, it includes functions to control the 3 major commercial scanning tunneling microscopes, CreaTec, RHK, and Scienta Omicron in combination with any other instruments that are a part of the systems. It can be extended to control any instrument that can be controlled via Python.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive overview of diffuse correlation spectroscopy: theoretical framework, recent advances in hardware, analysis, and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS) is a powerful tool for assessing microvascular hemodynamic in deep tissues. Recent advances in sensors, lasers, and deep learning have further boosted the development of new DCS methods. However, newcomers might feel overwhelmed, not only by the already complex DCS theoretical framework but also by the broad range of component options and system architectures. To facilitate new entry into this exciting field, we present a comprehensive review of DCS hardware architectures (continuous-wave, frequency-domain, and time-domain) and summarize corresponding theoretical models. Further, we discuss new applications of highly integrated silicon single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) sensors in DCS, compare SPADs with existing sensors, and review other components (lasers, fibers, and correlators), as well as new data analysis tools, including deep learning. Potential applications in medical diagnosis are discussed, and an outlook for the future directions is provided, to offer effective guidance to embark on DCS research.</description>

      <title>Fluorescence Imaging of Individual Ions and Molecules in Pressurized Noble Gases for Barium Tagging in $^{136}$Xe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The imaging of individual Ba$^{2+}$ ions in high pressure xenon gas is one possible way to attain background-free sensitivity to neutrinoless double beta decay and hence establish the Majorana nature of the neutrino. In this paper we demonstrate selective single Ba$^{2+}$ ion imaging inside a high-pressure xenon gas environment. Ba$^{2+}$ ions chelated with molecular chemosensors are resolved at the gas-solid interface using a diffraction-limited imaging system with scan area of 1$\times$1~cm$^2$ located inside 10~bar of xenon gas. This new form of microscopy represents an important enabling step in the development of barium tagging for neutrinoless double beta decay searches in $^{136}$Xe, as well as a new tool for studying the photophysics of fluorescent molecules and chemosensors at the solid-gas interface.</description>

      <title>Fast and accurate extraction of ultra-high quality factor from cavity ring-down measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cavity ring-down is an essential test to measure ultra-high quality factor (UHQ) optical cavities, which is, however, frequently misinterpreted due to lacking of a specified analysis guideline. Here we clarify the basic property of cavity ring down and present a step-by-step method that enables extraction of the overall quality factor, as well as the intrinsic loss and coupling state of UHQ cavities with better fidelity and simplicity than prior schemes. Our work can facilitate acurrate design and characterization of UHQ cavities for ultra-low noise lasers, high finesse reference cavities, and ultra-narrow optical filters.</description>

      <title>Thermal/epithermal neutron detection via LiO$_{2}$-doped fiber bundles: A computational study through GEANT4 simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15462v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the neutron capture processes in lithium or lithium-doped materials leads to the production of secondary alpha-triton pairs. The counts of these secondary charged particle pairs in the presence of thermal/epithermal neutrons indirectly give access to detecting the primary incident neutrons with the aid of the plastic scintillators by reminding that both these secondary alphas and tritons deposit their entire kinetic energy within a short range. In this study, we modify the polystyrene fiber core of Kuraray Y11-200(M) by doping with 10 wt.$\%$ LiO$_{2}$. We investigate a fiber bundle system hinged on 10 wt.$\%$ LiO$_{2}$-doped Kuraray Y11-200(M) fibers via the GEANT4 simulations by targeting the detection of the incident thermal/epithermal neutrons through the generation of the secondary alpha-triton pairs. First, we estimate an optimal number of fiber arrays by using a monoenergetic beam of thermal neutrons with a kinetic energy of 0.025 eV and we count the number of secondary alpha-triton pairs. Subsequently, we insert a pixelated photo-sensor on both ends of the fiber bundle in order to collect the entrapped optical photons. In addition to the thermal neutrons, we also explore the detection of epithermal neutrons with a kinetic energy of 1 eV by utilizing a combination of the 10 wt.$\%$ LiO$_{2}$-doped Kuraray Y11-200(M) fiber bundles and the neutron absorption layers. We demonstrate that the LiO$_{2}$-doped plastic scintillating fiber bundles are instrumental for the detection of thermal/epithermal neutrons in diverse applications.</description>

      <title>On the 96-well plate coverglass tilt and curvature suppression in 96-camera imaging system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 96-eyes instrument is capable of computational extended depth of focus (eDOF) of up to +/- 30 micrometer in the phase channel, and conventional depth of field (DOF) of +/- 5 micrometer in the fluorescence channel. However, it requires minimal plate-to-plate cover glass depth variation to function. Plate depths are measured using a third-party plate scanner (Opera Phenix) grouped by plate types (Greiner UV-Star, Cell-Star, and Eppendorf meniscus-free). The two-dimensional (2D) depth dataset is aggregated through principal component analysis to obtain the top eight dominating 2D surface deformation modes. More than 90% of the variation can be explained by the plate's absolute depth and tilt (Pitch, Gradient-Y, and Gradient-X), followed by (~= 2%) the cover glass's curvature (Curve-Y and Curve-XY). Plate-to-plate average depth and tilt variations are suppressed by a customized kinematic mount anchoring the plate's cover glass at the instrument's imaging plane. The plate's average curvature is compensated by manually aligning all 96-eyes microscope objective lenses to track the plate's surface; an one-off calibration procedure aided by the backlash-free piezo-flexure z-stage. Design validation is conducted in silico, with the proof of concept experiment conducted on the 96-eyes with new mounting bracket retrofits.</description>

      <title>Proton discrimination in CLYC for fast neutron spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Cs$_2$LiYCl$_6$:Ce (CLYC) elpasolite scintillator is known for its response to fast and thermal neutrons along with good $\gamma$-ray energy resolution. While the $^{35}$Cl($n,p$) reaction has been identified as a potential means for CLYC-based fast neutron spectroscopy in the absence of time-of-flight (TOF), previous efforts to functionalize CLYC as a fast neutron spectrometer have been thwarted by the inability to isolate proton interactions from $^{6}$Li($n,\alpha$) and $^{35}$Cl($n,\alpha$) signals. This work introduces a new approach to particle discrimination in CLYC for fission spectrum neutrons using a multi-gate charge integration algorithm that provides excellent separation between protons and heavier charged particles. Neutron TOF data were collected using a $^{252}$Cf source, an array of EJ-309 organic liquid scintillators, and a $^6$Li-enriched CLYC scintillator outfitted with fast electronics. Modal waveforms were constructed corresponding to the different reaction channels, revealing significant differences in the pulse characteristics of protons and heavier charged particles at ultrafast, fast, and intermediate time scales. These findings informed the design of a pulse shape discrimination algorithm, which was validated using the TOF data. This study also proposes an iterative subtraction method to mitigate contributions from confounding reaction channels in proton and heavier charged particle pulse height spectra, opening the door for CLYC-based fast neutron and $\gamma$-ray spectroscopy while preserving sensitivity to thermal neutron capture signals.</description>

Abstract: For tracking and tagging the cosmic-ray muon (CR-muon), the Taishan Antineutrino Observatory (TAO) experiment is equipped with a top veto tracker (TVT) system composed of 160 modules, each consisting of plastic scintillator (PS) strip as target material, embedded wavelength shifting fiber (WLS-fiber) as photon collection and transmission medium, and silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) at both ends as read-out. This article introduces the unique design of the module and reports the excellent performance of all modules, providing guidance and important reference for the process design of scintillation detectors with WLS-fibers. In general, when the CR-muon hits the center of plastic scintillator and without optical grease, the most probable value of the signal amplitude at one end of the PS strip is greater than 40.8 p.e. and 51.5 p.e. for all the 2 m-length modules and 1.5 m-length modules respectively. The CR-muon tagging efficiency of PS module is measured to be more than 99.3%, which meets the requirement of TAO.</description>

      <title>Real-time antiproton annihilation vertexing with sub-micron resolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The primary goal of the AEgIS experiment is to precisely measure the free fall of antihydrogen within Earth's gravitational field. To this end, a cold ~50K antihydrogen beam has to pass through two grids forming a moir\'e deflectometer before annihilating onto a position-sensitive detector, which shall determine the vertical position of the annihilation vertex relative to the grids with micrometric accuracy. Here we introduce a vertexing detector based on a modified mobile camera sensor and experimentally demonstrate that it can measure the position of antiproton annihilations with an accuracy of $0.62^{+0.40}_{-0.22}\mu m$, which represents a 35-fold improvement over the previous state-of-the-art for real-time antiproton vertexing. Importantly, these antiproton detection methods are directly applicable to antihydrogen. Moreover, the sensitivity to light of the sensor enables the in-situ calibration of the moir\'e deflectometer, significantly reducing systematic errors. This sensor emerges as a breakthrough technology for achieving the \aegis scientific goals and has been selected as the basis for the development of a large-area detector for conducting antihydrogen gravity measurements.</description>

      <title>A ROOT based detector geometry and event visualization system for JUNO-TAO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Taishan Antineutrino Observatory (TAO or JUNO-TAO) is a satellite experiment of Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO) and located near the Taishan nuclear power plant (NPP). TAO will measure the energy spectrum of reactor antineutrinos with unprecedented precision, which will benefit both reactor neutrino physics and the nuclear database. A detector geometry and event visualization system has been developed for TAO. The software is based on ROOT packages and embedded in the TAO offline software framework. It provides an intuitive tool to visualize the detector geometry, tune the reconstruction algorithm, understand the neutrino physics, and monitor the operation of reactors at NPP. The further applications of the visualization system in the experimental operation of TAO and its future development are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Data Reduction for Low Energy Nuclear Physics Experiments Using Data Frames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low energy nuclear physics experiments are transitioning towards fully digital data acquisition systems. Realizing the gains in flexibility afforded by these systems relies on equally flexible data reduction techniques. In this paper, methods utilizing data frames and in-memory techniques to work with data, including data from self-triggering, digital data acquisition systems, are discussed within the context of a Python package, \texttt{sauce}. It is shown that data frame operations can encompass common analysis needs and allow interactive data analysis. Two event building techniques, dubbed referenced and referenceless event building, are shown to provide a means to transform raw list mode data into correlated multi-detector events. These techniques are demonstrated in the analysis of two example data sets.</description>

      <title>Quantum Diamond Microscope for Narrowband Magnetic Imaging with High Spatial and Spectral Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum diamond microscope (QDM) is a recently developed technology for near-field imaging of magnetic fields with micron-scale spatial resolution. In the present work, we integrate a QDM with a narrowband measurement protocol and a lock-in camera; and demonstrate imaging of radiofrequency (RF) magnetic field patterns produced by microcoils, with spectral resolution $\approx1$\,Hz. This RF-QDM provides multi-frequency imaging with a central detection frequency that is easily tunable over the MHz-scale, allowing spatial discrimination of both crowded spectral peaks and spectrally well-separated signals. The present instrument has spatial resolution $\approx2\,\mathrm{\mu m}$, field-of-view $\approx300\times300\,\mathrm{\mu m^2}$, and per-pixel sensitivity to narrowband fields $\sim{1}\,$nT$\cdot$Hz$^{-1/2}$. Spatial noise can be reduced to the picotesla scale by signal averaging and/or spatial binning. The RF-QDM enables simultaneous imaging of the amplitude, frequency, and phase of narrowband magnetic field patterns at the micron-scale, with potential applications in real-space NMR imaging, AC susceptibility mapping, impedance tomography, analysis of electronic circuits, and spatial eddy-current-based inspection.</description>

      <title>The FRB-searching pipeline of the Tianlai Cylinder Pathfinder Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the design, calibration, and survey strategy of the Fast Radio Burst (FRB) digital backend and its real-time data processing pipeline employed in the Tianlai Cylinder Pathfinder array. The array, consisting of three parallel cylindrical reflectors and equipped with 96 dual-polarization feeds, is a radio interferometer array designed for conducting drift scans of the northern celestial semi-sphere. The FRB digital backend enables the formation of 96 digital beams, effectively covering an area of approximately 40 square degrees with 3 dB beam. Our pipeline demonstrates the capability to make automatic search of FRBs, detecting at quasi-real-time and classify FRB candidates automatically. The current FRB searching pipeline has an overall recall rate of 88\%. During the commissioning phase, we successfully detected signals emitted by four well-known pulsars: PSR B0329+54, B2021+51, B0823+26, and B2020+28. We report the first discovery of an FRB by our array, designated as FRB 20220414A. We also investigate the optimal arrangement for the digitally formed beams to achieve maximum detection rate by numerical simulation.</description>

      <title>Free Space Optical Frequency Comparison Over Rapidly Moving Links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08899v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The comparison of optical reference frequency signals over free-space optical links is limited by the relative motion between local and remote sites. For ground to low earth orbit comparison, the expected Doppler shift and Doppler rate typically reach 4 GHz at 100 MHz/s, which prevents the narrow-band detection required to compare optical frequencies at the highest levels of stability. We demonstrate a system capable of optical frequency comparison in the presence of these significant Doppler shifts, using an electro-optic phase modulator with an actuation bandwidth of 10 GHz, which will enable ground-to-space frequency comparison. This system was demonstrated over a retro-reflected drone link, with a maximum line-of-sight velocity of 15 m/s and Doppler shift of 19 MHz at a Doppler rate of 1 MHz/s. The best fractional frequency stability obtained was 7E-18 at an integration time of 5s. These results are an important step toward ground to low earth orbit optical frequency comparison, providing a scalable terrestrial test bed.</description>

      <title>Improved Modelling of Detector Response Effects in Phonon-based Crystal Detectors used for Dark Matter Searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01259v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Various dark matter search experiments employ phonon-based crystal detectors operated at cryogenic temperatures. Some of these detectors, including certain silicon detectors used by the SuperCDMS Collaboration, are able to achieve single-charge sensitivity when a voltage bias is applied across the detector. The total amount of phonon energy measured by such a detector is proportional to the number of electron-hole pairs created by the interaction. However, crystal impurities and surface effects can cause propagating charges to either become trapped inside the crystal or create additional unpaired charges, producing non-quantized measured energy as a result. A new analytical model for describing these detector response effects in phonon-based crystal detectors is presented. This model improves upon previous versions by demonstrating how the detector response, and thus the measured energy spectrum, is expected to differ depending on the source of events. We use this model to extract detector response parameters for SuperCDMS HVeV detectors, and illustrate how this robust modelling can help statistically discriminate between sources of events in order to improve the sensitivity of dark matter search experiments.</description>
