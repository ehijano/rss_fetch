      <title>LatencyPrism: Online Non-intrusive Latency Sculpting for SLO-Guaranteed LLM Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: LLM inference latency critically determines user experience and operational costs, directly impacting throughput under SLO constraints. Even brief latency spikes degrade service quality despite acceptable average performance. However, distributed inference environments featuring diverse software frameworks and XPU architectures combined with dynamic workloads make latency analysis challenging. Constrained by intrusive designs that necessitate service restarts or even suspension, and by hardware-bound implementations that fail to adapt to heterogeneous inference environments, existing AI profiling methods are often inadequate for real-time production analysis.
  We present LatencyPrism, the first zero-intrusion multi-platform latency sculpting system. It aims to break down the inference latency across pipeline, proactively alert on inference latency anomalies, and guarantee adherence to SLOs, all without requiring code modifications or service restarts. LatencyPrism has been deployed across thousands of XPUs for over six months. It enables low-overhead real-time monitoring at batch level with alerts triggered in milliseconds. This approach distinguishes between workload-driven latency variations and anomalies indicating underlying issues with an F1-score of 0.98. We also conduct extensive experiments and investigations into root cause analysis to demonstrate LatencyPrism's capability.</description>

      <title>Secure and Efficient Access Control for Computer-Use Agents via Context Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22256v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based computer-use agents represent a convergence of AI and OS capabilities, enabling natural language to control system- and application-level functions. However, due to LLMs' inherent uncertainty issues, granting agents control over computers poses significant security risks. When agent actions deviate from user intentions, they can cause irreversible consequences. Existing mitigation approaches, such as user confirmation and LLM-based dynamic action validation, still suffer from limitations in usability, security, and performance. To address these challenges, we propose CSAgent, a system-level, static policy-based access control framework for computer-use agents. To bridge the gap between static policy and dynamic context and user intent, CSAgent introduces intent- and context-aware policies, and provides an automated toolchain to assist developers in constructing and refining them. CSAgent enforces these policies through an optimized OS service, ensuring that agent actions can only be executed under specific user intents and contexts. CSAgent supports protecting agents that control computers through diverse interfaces, including API, CLI, and GUI. We implement and evaluate CSAgent, which successfully defends against all attacks in the benchmarks while introducing only 1.99% performance overhead and 5.42% utility decrease.</description>
