      <title>Approaching Dialogue State Tracking via Aligning Speech Encoders and LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we approach spoken Dialogue State Tracking (DST) by bridging the representation spaces of speech encoders and LLMs via a small connector module, with a focus on fully open-sourced and open-data components (WavLM-large, OLMo). We focus on ablating different aspects of such systems including full/LoRA adapter fine-tuning, the effect of agent turns in the dialogue history, as well as fuzzy matching-based output post-processing, which greatly improves performance of our systems on named entities in the dialogue slot values. We conduct our experiments on the SpokenWOZ dataset, and additionally utilize the Speech-Aware MultiWOZ dataset to augment our training data. Ultimately, our best-performing WavLM + connector + OLMo-1B aligned models achieve state of the art on the SpokenWOZ test set (34.66% JGA), and our system with Gemma-2-9B-instruct further surpasses this result, reaching 42.17% JGA on SpokenWOZ test.</description>

      <title>MD-ViSCo: A Unified Model for Multi-Directional Vital Sign Waveform Conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the remarkable progress of deep-learning methods generating a target vital sign waveform from a source vital sign waveform, most existing models are designed exclusively for a specific source-to-target pair. This requires distinct model architectures, optimization procedures, and pre-processing pipelines, resulting in multiple models that hinder usability in clinical settings. To address this limitation, we propose the Multi-Directional Vital-Sign Converter (MD-ViSCo), a unified framework capable of generating any target waveform such as electrocardiogram (ECG), photoplethysmogram (PPG), or arterial blood pressure (ABP) from any single input waveform with a single model. MD-ViSCo employs a shallow 1-Dimensional U-Net integrated with a Swin Transformer that leverages Adaptive Instance Normalization (AdaIN) to capture distinct waveform styles. To evaluate the efficacy of MD-ViSCo, we conduct multi-directional waveform generation on two publicly available datasets. Our framework surpasses state-of-the-art baselines (NabNet &amp; PPG2ABP) on average across all waveform types, lowering Mean absolute error (MAE) by 8.8% and improving Pearson correlation (PC) by 4.9% over two datasets. In addition, the generated ABP waveforms satisfy the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) criterion and achieve Grade B on the British Hypertension Society (BHS) standard, outperforming all baselines. By eliminating the need for developing a distinct model for each task, we believe that this work offers a unified framework that can deal with any kind of vital sign waveforms with a single model in healthcare monitoring.</description>

      <title>A Review on Score-based Generative Models for Audio Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as powerful deep generative techniques, producing high-quality and diverse samples in applications in various domains including audio. These models have many different design choices suitable for different applications, however, existing reviews lack in-depth discussions of these design choices. The audio diffusion model literature also lacks principled guidance for the implementation of these design choices and their comparisons for different applications. This survey provides a comprehensive review of diffusion model design with an emphasis on design principles for quality improvement and conditioning for audio applications. We adopt the score modeling perspective as a unifying framework that accommodates various interpretations, including recent approaches like flow matching. We systematically examine the training and sampling procedures of diffusion models, and audio applications through different conditioning mechanisms. To address the lack of audio diffusion model codebases and to promote reproducible research and rapid prototyping, we introduce an open-source codebase at https://github.com/gzhu06/AudioDiffuser that implements our reviewed framework for various audio applications. We demonstrate its capabilities through three case studies: audio generation, speech enhancement, and text-to-speech synthesis, with benchmark evaluations on standard datasets.</description>

      <title>Passive acoustic non-line-of-sight localization without a relay surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The detection and localization of a source hidden outside the Line-of-Sight (LOS) traditionally rely on the acquisition of indirect signals, such as those reflected from visible relay surfaces such as floors or walls. These reflected signals are then utilized to reconstruct the obscured scene. In this study, we present an approach that utilize signals diffracted from an edge of an obstacle to achieve three-dimensional (3D) localization of an acoustic point source situated outside the LOS. We address two scenarios - a doorway and a convex corner - and propose a localization method for each of them. For the first scenario, we utilize the two edges of the door as virtual detector arrays. For the second scenario, we exploit the spectral signature of a knife-edge diffraction, inspired by the human perception of sound location by the head-related transfer function (HRTF). In both methods, knife-edge diffraction is utilized to extend the capabilities of non-line-of-sight (NLOS) acoustic sensing, enabling localization in environments where conventional relay-surface based approaches may be limited.</description>

      <title>Higher-Order Network Representation of J. S. Bach's Solo Violin Sonatas and Partitas: Topological and Geometrical Explorations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Music is inherently complex, with structures and interactions that unfold across multiple layers. Complex networks have emerged as powerful structures for the quantitative analysis of Western classical music, revealing significant features of its harmonic and structural organization. Although notable works have used these approaches to study music, dyadic representations of interactions fall short in conveying the underlying complexity and depth. In recent years, the limitations of traditional graph representations have been questioned and challenged in the context of interactions that could be higher-dimensional. Effective musical analysis requires models that capture higher-order interactions and a framework that simultaneously captures transitions between them. Subsequently, in this paper, we present a topological framework for analyzing J. S. Bach's Solo Violin Sonatas and Partitas that uses higher-order networks where single notes are vertices, two-note chords are edges, three-notes are triangles, etc. We subsequently account for the flow of music, by modeling transitions between successive notes. We identify genre-specific patterns in the works' geometric and topological properties. In particular, we find signatures in the trends of the evolution of the Euler characteristic and curvature, as well as examining adherence to the Gauss-Bonnet theorem across different movement types. The distinctions are revealed between slow movements, Fugues, and Baroque dance movements through their simplicial complex representation.</description>

      <title>Auto-Regressive vs Flow-Matching: a Comparative Study of Modeling Paradigms for Text-to-Music Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08570v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent progress in text-to-music generation has enabled models to synthesize high-quality musical segments, full compositions, and even respond to fine-grained control signals, e.g. chord progressions. State-of-the-art (SOTA) systems differ significantly across many dimensions, such as training datasets, modeling paradigms, and architectural choices. This diversity complicates efforts to evaluate models fairly and pinpoint which design choices most influence performance. While factors like data and architecture are important, in this study we focus exclusively on the modeling paradigm. We conduct a systematic empirical analysis to isolate its effects, offering insights into associated trade-offs and emergent behaviors that can guide future text-to-music generation systems. Specifically, we compare the two arguably most common modeling paradigms: Auto-Regressive decoding and Conditional Flow-Matching. We conduct a controlled comparison by training all models from scratch using identical datasets, training configurations, and similar backbone architectures. Performance is evaluated across multiple axes, including generation quality, robustness to inference configurations, scalability, adherence to both textual and temporally aligned conditioning, and editing capabilities in the form of audio inpainting. This comparative study sheds light on distinct strengths and limitations of each paradigm, providing actionable insights that can inform future architectural and training decisions in the evolving landscape of text-to-music generation.

      <title>Multi-Teacher Language-Aware Knowledge Distillation for Multilingual Speech Emotion Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is crucial for improving human-computer interaction. Despite strides in monolingual SER, extending them to build a multilingual system remains challenging. Our goal is to train a single model capable of multilingual SER by distilling knowledge from multiple teacher models. To address this, we introduce a novel language-aware multi-teacher knowledge distillation method to advance SER in English, Finnish, and French. It leverages Wav2Vec2.0 as the foundation of monolingual teacher models and then distills their knowledge into a single multilingual student model. The student model demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, with a weighted recall of 72.9 on the English dataset and an unweighted recall of 63.4 on the Finnish dataset, surpassing fine-tuning and knowledge distillation baselines. Our method excels in improving recall for sad and neutral emotions, although it still faces challenges in recognizing anger and happiness.</description>

      <title>Addressing Pitfalls in Auditing Practices of Automatic Speech Recognition Technologies: A Case Study of People with Aphasia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) has transformed daily tasks from video transcription to workplace hiring. ASR systems' growing use warrants robust and standardized auditing approaches to ensure automated transcriptions of high and equitable quality. This is especially critical for people with speech and language disorders (such as aphasia) who may disproportionately depend on ASR systems to navigate everyday life. In this work, we identify three pitfalls in existing standard ASR auditing procedures, and demonstrate how addressing them impacts audit results via a case study of six popular ASR systems' performance for aphasia speakers. First, audits often adhere to a single method of text standardization during data pre-processing, which (a) masks variability in ASR performance from applying different standardization methods, and (b) may not be consistent with how users - especially those from marginalized speech communities - would want their transcriptions to be standardized. Second, audits often display high-level demographic findings without further considering performance disparities among (a) more nuanced demographic subgroups, and (b) relevant covariates capturing acoustic information from the input audio. Third, audits often rely on a single gold-standard metric -- the Word Error Rate -- which does not fully capture the extent of errors arising from generative AI models, such as transcription hallucinations. We propose a more holistic auditing framework that accounts for these three pitfalls, and exemplify its results in our case study, finding consistently worse ASR performance for aphasia speakers relative to a control group. We call on practitioners to implement these robust ASR auditing practices that remain flexible to the rapidly changing ASR landscape.</description>

      <title>Step-Audio-AQAA: a Fully End-to-End Expressive Large Audio Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) have significantly advanced intelligent human-computer interaction, yet their reliance on text-based outputs limits their ability to generate natural speech responses directly, hindering seamless audio interactions. To address this, we introduce Step-Audio-AQAA, a fully end-to-end LALM designed for Audio Query-Audio Answer (AQAA) tasks. The model integrates a dual-codebook audio tokenizer for linguistic and semantic feature extraction, a 130-billion-parameter backbone LLM and a neural vocoder for high-fidelity speech synthesis. Our post-training approach employs interleaved token-output of text and audio to enhance semantic coherence and combines Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with model merge to improve performance. Evaluations on the StepEval-Audio-360 benchmark demonstrate that Step-Audio-AQAA excels especially in speech control, outperforming the state-of-art LALMs in key areas. This work contributes a promising solution for end-to-end LALMs and highlights the critical role of token-based vocoder in enhancing overall performance for AQAA tasks.</description>

      <title>Phonology-Guided Speech-to-Speech Translation for African Languages</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23323v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a prosody-guided framework for speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) that aligns and translates speech \emph{without} transcripts by leveraging cross-linguistic pause synchrony. Analyzing a 6{,}000-hour East African news corpus spanning five languages, we show that \emph{within-phylum} language pairs exhibit 30--40\% lower pause variance and over 3$\times$ higher onset/offset correlation compared to cross-phylum pairs. These findings motivate \textbf{SPaDA}, a dynamic-programming alignment algorithm that integrates silence consistency, rate synchrony, and semantic similarity. SPaDA improves alignment $F_1$ by +3--4 points and eliminates up to 38\% of spurious matches relative to greedy VAD baselines. Using SPaDA-aligned segments, we train \textbf{SegUniDiff}, a diffusion-based S2ST model guided by \emph{external gradients} from frozen semantic and speaker encoders. SegUniDiff matches an enhanced cascade in BLEU (30.3 on CVSS-C vs.\ 28.9 for UnitY), reduces speaker error rate (EER) from 12.5\% to 5.3\%, and runs at an RTF of 1.02. To support evaluation in low-resource settings, we also release a three-tier, transcript-free BLEU suite (M1--M3) that correlates strongly with human judgments. Together, our results show that prosodic cues in multilingual speech provide a reliable scaffold for scalable, non-autoregressive S2ST.</description>

      <title>LLaSE-G1: Incentivizing Generalization Capability for LLaMA-based Speech Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00493v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in language models (LMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in semantic understanding and contextual modeling, which have flourished in generative speech enhancement (SE). However, many LM-based SE approaches primarily focus on semantic information, often neglecting the critical role of acoustic information, which leads to acoustic inconsistency after enhancement and limited generalization across diverse SE tasks. In this paper, we introduce LLaSE-G1, a LLaMA-based language model that incentivizes generalization capabilities for speech enhancement. LLaSE-G1 offers the following key contributions: First, to mitigate acoustic inconsistency, LLaSE-G1 employs continuous representations from WavLM as input and predicts speech tokens from X-Codec2, maximizing acoustic preservation. Second, to promote generalization capability, LLaSE-G1 introduces dual-channel inputs and outputs, unifying multiple SE tasks without requiring task-specific IDs. Third, LLaSE-G1 outperforms prior task-specific discriminative and generative SE models, demonstrating scaling effects at test time and emerging capabilities for unseen SE tasks. Additionally, we release our code and models to support further research in this area.</description>

      <title>The trajectoRIR Database: Room Acoustic Recordings Along a Trajectory of Moving Microphones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23004v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data availability is essential to develop acoustic signal processing algorithms, especially when it comes to data-driven approaches that demand large and diverse training datasets. For this reason, an increasing number of databases have been published in recent years, including either room impulse responses (RIRs) or audio recordings during motion. In this paper we introduce the trajectoRIR database, an extensive, multi-array collection of both dynamic and stationary acoustic recordings along a controlled trajectory in a room. Specifically, the database features recordings using moving microphones and stationary RIRs spatially sampling the room acoustics along an L-shaped trajectory. This combination makes trajectoRIR unique and applicable in various tasks ranging from sound source localization and tracking to spatially dynamic sound field reconstruction, auralization and system identification. The recording room has a reverberation time of 0.5 seconds, and the three different microphone configurations employed include a dummy head, with additional reference microphones located next to the ears, 3 first-order Ambisonics microphones, two circular arrays of 16 and 4 channels, and a 12-channel linear array. The motion of the microphones was achieved using a robotic cart traversing a 4.62 meter-long rail at three speeds: [0.2, 0.4, 0.8] m/s. Audio signals were reproduced using two stationary loudspeakers. The collected database features 8648 stationary RIRs, as well as perfect sweeps, speech, music, and stationary noise recorded during motion. Python functions are included to access the recorded audio as well as to retrieve geometrical information.</description>

      <title>Speech Synthesis By Unrolling Diffusion Process using Neural Network Layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.09652v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work introduces UDPNet, a novel architecture designed to accelerate the reverse diffusion process in speech synthesis. Unlike traditional diffusion models that rely on timestep embeddings and shared network parameters, UDPNet unrolls the reverse diffusion process directly into the network architecture, with successive layers corresponding to equally spaced steps in the diffusion schedule. Each layer progressively refines the noisy input, culminating in a high-fidelity estimation of the original data, \(x_0\). Additionally, we redefine the learning target by predicting latent variables instead of the conventional \(x_0\) or noise \(\epsilon_0\). This shift addresses the common issue of large prediction errors in early denoising stages, effectively reducing speech distortion. Extensive evaluations on single- and multi-speaker datasets demonstrate that UDPNet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both quality and efficiency, while generalizing effectively to unseen speech. These results position UDPNet as a robust solution for real-time speech synthesis applications. Sample audio is available at https://onexpeters.github.io/UDPNet.</description>

      <title>Structuring Concept Space with the Musical Circle of Fifths by Utilizing Music Grammar Based Activations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00790v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the intriguing similarities between the structure of a discrete neural network, such as a spiking network, and the composition of a piano piece. While both involve nodes or notes that are activated sequentially or in parallel, the latter benefits from the rich body of music theory to guide meaningful combinations. We propose a novel approach that leverages musical grammar to regulate activations in a spiking neural network, allowing for the representation of symbols as attractors. By applying rules for chord progressions from music theory, we demonstrate how certain activations naturally follow others, akin to the concept of attraction. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of modulating keys to navigate different basins of attraction within the network. Ultimately, we show that the map of concepts in our model is structured by the musical circle of fifths, highlighting the potential for leveraging music theory principles in deep learning algorithms.</description>

      <title>Exploring SSL Discrete Speech Features for Zipformer-based Contextual ASR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08797v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) based discrete speech representations are highly compact and domain adaptable. In this paper, SSL discrete speech features extracted from WavLM models are used as additional cross-utterance acoustic context features in Zipformer-Transducer ASR systems. The efficacy of replacing Fbank features with discrete token features for modelling either cross-utterance contexts (from preceding and future segments), or current utterance's internal contexts alone, or both at the same time, are demonstrated thoroughly on the Gigaspeech 1000-hr corpus. The best Zipformer-Transducer system using discrete tokens based cross-utterance context features outperforms the baseline using utterance internal context only with statistically significant word error rate (WER) reductions of 0.32% to 0.41% absolute (2.78% to 3.54% relative) on the dev and test data. The lowest published WER of 11.15% and 11.14% were obtained on the dev and test sets. Our work is open-source and publicly available at https://github.com/open-creator/icefall/tree/master/egs/gigaspeech/Context\_ASR.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Retrieval-Augmented Audio Captioning with Generation-Assisted Multimodal Querying and Progressive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10913v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation can improve audio captioning by incorporating relevant audio-text pairs from a knowledge base. Existing methods typically rely solely on the input audio as a unimodal retrieval query. In contrast, we propose Generation-Assisted Multimodal Querying, which generates a text description of the input audio to enable multimodal querying. This approach aligns the query modality with the audio-text structure of the knowledge base, leading to more effective retrieval. Furthermore, we introduce a novel progressive learning strategy that gradually increases the number of interleaved audio-text pairs to enhance the training process. Our experiments on AudioCaps, Clotho, and Auto-ACD demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art results across these benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Summarizing Speech: A Comprehensive Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08024v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Speech summarization has become an essential tool for efficiently managing and accessing the growing volume of spoken and audiovisual content. However, despite its increasing importance, speech summarization remains loosely defined. The field intersects with several research areas, including speech recognition, text summarization, and specific applications like meeting summarization. This survey not only examines existing datasets and evaluation protocols, which are crucial for assessing the quality of summarization approaches, but also synthesizes recent developments in the field, highlighting the shift from traditional systems to advanced models like fine-tuned cascaded architectures and end-to-end solutions. In doing so, we surface the ongoing challenges, such as the need for realistic evaluation benchmarks, multilingual datasets, and long-context handling.</description>

      <title>CASPER: A Large Scale Spontaneous Speech Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00267v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The success of large language models has driven interest in developing similar speech processing capabilities. However, a key challenge is the scarcity of high-quality spontaneous speech data, as most existing datasets contain scripted dialogues. To address this, we present a novel pipeline for eliciting and recording natural dialogues and release our dataset with 100+ hours of spontaneous speech. Our approach fosters fluid, natural conversations while encouraging a diverse range of topics and interactive exchanges. Unlike traditional methods, it facilitates genuine interactions, providing a reproducible framework for future data collection. This paper introduces our dataset and methodology, laying the groundwork for addressing the shortage of spontaneous speech data. We plan to expand this dataset in future stages, offering a growing resource for the research community.</description>

      <title>Voice Impression Control in Zero-Shot TTS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05688v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Para-/non-linguistic information in speech is pivotal in shaping the listeners' impression. Although zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) has achieved high speaker fidelity, modulating subtle para-/non-linguistic information to control perceived voice characteristics, i.e., impressions, remains challenging. We have therefore developed a voice impression control method in zero-shot TTS that utilizes a low-dimensional vector to represent the intensities of various voice impression pairs (e.g., dark-bright). The results of both objective and subjective evaluations have demonstrated our method's effectiveness in impression control. Furthermore, generating this vector via a large language model enables target-impression generation from a natural language description of the desired impression, thus eliminating the need for manual optimization. Audio examples are available on our demo page (https://ntt-hilab-gensp.github.io/is2025voiceimpression/).</description>

      <title>Towards Generalized Source Tracing for Codec-Based Deepfake Speech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07294v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent attempts at source tracing for codec-based deepfake speech (CodecFake), generated by neural audio codec-based speech generation (CoSG) models, have exhibited suboptimal performance. However, how to train source tracing models using simulated CoSG data while maintaining strong performance on real CoSG-generated audio remains an open challenge. In this paper, we show that models trained solely on codec-resynthesized data tend to overfit to non-speech regions and struggle to generalize to unseen content. To mitigate these challenges, we introduce the Semantic-Acoustic Source Tracing Network (SASTNet), which jointly leverages Whisper for semantic feature encoding and Wav2vec2 with AudioMAE for acoustic feature encoding. Our proposed SASTNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on the CoSG test set of the CodecFake+ dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness for reliable source tracing.</description>

      <title>An introduction to pitch strength in contemporary popular music analysis and production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07473v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Music information retrieval distinguishes between low- and high-level descriptions of music. Current generative AI models rely on text descriptions that are higher level than the controls familiar to studio musicians. Pitch strength, a low-level perceptual parameter of contemporary popular music, may be one feature that could make such AI models more suited to music production. Signal and perceptual analyses suggest that pitch strength (1) varies significantly across and inside songs; (2) contributes to both small- and large-scale structure; (3) contributes to the handling of polyphonic dissonance; and (4) may be a feature of upper harmonics made audible in a perspective of perceptual richness.</description>
