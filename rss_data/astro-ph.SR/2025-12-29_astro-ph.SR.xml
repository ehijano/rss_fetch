      <title>Early Planet Formation in Embedded Disks (eDisk). XIX. Structures of molecular outflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As part of the ALMA Large Program "Early Planet Formation in Embedded Disks" (eDisk), 12CO (2 - 1) was observed towards 19 nearby low-mass protostars. Of these objects, 15 sources are found to show molecular outflow emission. Based on their morphological and kinematical structures, the CO outflows are classified into three types: a wind-driven shell, where ambient material is swept up by a wide-angle wind from the star, a bow shock, and a slow disk wind, which is a conical or parabolic flow with onion-like velocity structure. We categorize 11 outflows as a slow disk wind, 7 as a wind-driven shell, and 1 as a bow shock. Four of these outflows were found to show signs of both slow disk wind and wind-driven shell characteristics. Five objects show misalignment between the red- and blue-shifted outflows. Seven objects show significant misalignment between the outflow axis (either or both of the red- and blue-shifted outflows) and the minor axis of the dust continuum emission around the protostar. For the objects showing wind-driven shell emission, we compare simple parametrized models with the observations to derive physical properties of the observed shells, such as their dynamical ages. This shows evidence of a time variability in the outflows, such as changes in their direction. In some objects, large differences are seen between the properties of the red- and blue-shifted outflows, possibly indicating differences in the properties of the ambient medium with which the outflow interacts.</description>

      <title>The Effect of Magnetic Field Dissipation in the Inner Heliosheath: Reconciling Global Heliosphere Model and Voyager Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Global ideal magnetohydrodynamic models of the heliosphere typically predict a greatly exaggerated magnetic field pile-up in the inner heliosheath (IHS), the region between the termination shock and heliopause. However, Voyager 1 and 2 observations show only a gradual increase throughout this region. This mismatch is largely attributed to the simplified assumption of a unipolar solar magnetic field in many global models, which neglects the complex, folded structure of the heliospheric current sheet (HCS). The IHS, especially at low heliolatitudes, contains these compressed sector boundaries, widely considered prime locations for magnetic dissipation via reconnection. To align global model simulations with observations without incurring the prohibitive computational cost of resolving the kinetic-scale current sheet, this work introduces a phenomenological term into the magnetic field induction equation. This term captures the macroscopic effect of magnetic energy dissipation due to unresolved HCS dynamics. It is designed to mitigate the artificial magnetic pile-up, preserve the topological integrity of the magnetic field lines, and avoid explicit magnetic diffusion. This study demonstrates that incorporating a phenomenological dissipation term into global heliospheric models helps to resolve the longstanding discrepancy between simulated and observed magnetic field profiles in the IHS. The proposed mechanism reduces exaggerated magnetic energy (converts it into thermal energy), aligns model output with Voyager measurements of both magnetic field and proton density, and produces the outward shift in termination shock position and a reduction of the IHS thickness. We found that the characteristic time for magnetic field dissipation of about 6 years provides improved agreement with Voyager data in the IHS.</description>

      <title>A self-consistent 3D MHD model producing a solar blowout jet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Solar blowout jets are a distinct subclass of ubiquitous extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) and X-ray coronal jets. Aims. Most existing models of blowout jets prescribe an initial magnetic field configurations and apply ad-hoc changes in the photosphere to trigger the jets. In contrast, we aim for a self-consistent magneto-convective description of the jet initiation. Methods. We employ a 3D radiation magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model of a solar coronal hole region using the MURaM code. The computational domain extends from the upper convection zone to the lower corona. We synthesize the emission in the extreme UV and X-rays for a direct comparison to observations and examine the evolution of the magnetic field structure of the event. Results. In the simulation a twisted flux tube forms self-consistently, emerges through the surface and interacts with the pre-existing open field. Initially the resulting jet is of the standard type with a narrow spire. The release of the twist into the open field causes a broadening of the jet spire turning the jet into a blowout type. At the same time this creates a fast heating front propagating at the local Alfv\'en speed. The properties of the modeled jet closely match observations of blowout jets: a slow (180 km/s) mass upflow and a fast (500 km/s) propagating front form, the latter being a signature of the heating front. Also the timing of the jet with respect to the flux emergence and subsequent cancellation matches observations. Conclusions. The near-surface magneto-convection self-consistently generates a twisted flux tube that emerges through the photosphere. The tube then interacts with the pre-existing magnetic field by means of interchange reconnection. This transfers the twist to the open field region and produces a blowout jet that matches the main characteristics of this type of jet found in observations.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive study of solar type II radio bursts and the properties of the associated shock waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Type II radio bursts are solar radio emissions generated by electrons accelerated by coronal shocks. These bursts are typically found close to expanding coronal mass ejections (CMEs), making them valuable for studying the properties and dynamics of CME-driven shocks in the solar corona. Here, we aim to determine the regions in the solar corona where shock waves accelerate electrons and determine their characteristic properties. To do this, we combine radio observations of type II solar radio bursts with magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of the solar corona. We analyse ten type II radio bursts from Solar Cycle 25 exhibiting emissions. The novelty of this study lies in using radio imaging data for all type II bursts to examine the positions of the radio sources. The radio source positions, combined with a geometrical fitting of the CME shock and the MHD simulations, are used to determine essential shock parameters at the acceleration region, such as the Alfv\'en Mach number $(M_{\rm A}$ and $\theta_{\rm BN}$. The shock parameters are then combined with the properties of the radio emission and the associated eruption in a comprehensive study. We found that for all events, the type II bursts are located near or inside coronal streamers. The estimated shock speeds are high, resulting in the formation of super-critical shocks $(3.6~\leq~M_{\rm A}~\leq~6.4$) at the type II locations. In most events, type II bursts are located at oblique shocks rather than near-perpendicular geometries, suggesting that the shock structure is more complex at local scales than the simple spherical shock models usually applied to CME shocks. Our results suggest that CME-streamer interaction regions are necessary for the generation of type II bursts, as they provide ideal plasma conditions for the formation of super-critical shocks and the subsequent acceleration of electrons.</description>

      <title>Compact Ca II K Brightenings Precede Solar Flares: A Dunn Solar Telescope Pilot Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a uniform analysis of compact Ca II K (3934 \AA) brightenings that occur near flare kernels and assess their value as short-lead indicators of solar flare onset. Using high-cadence imaging from the Rapid Oscillations in the Solar Atmosphere (ROSA) instrument at the Dunn Solar Telescope (DST), we examine eight flare sequences (seven C-class and one B-class) obtained between 2021 and 2025. Fixed, detector-coordinate regions of interest are used to generate mean-intensity light curves, which are detrended and smoothed to isolate impulsive brightenings. In every event, a compact Ca II K brightening is detected within or adjacent to the flaring region that peaks 10--45 min before the primary kernel and the corresponding rise in GOES 1--8 \AA\ flux. The measured temporal offsets scale with the deprojected separation between the brightening and flare kernels, implying an apparent propagation speed of $\sim$30--35 km s$^{-1}$ that is consistent with chromospheric reconnection. Complementary Spectropolarimeter for Infrared and Optical Regions (SPINOR) spectropolarimetry for one event shows topological reconfiguration from closed to open or extended connectivity, supporting a reconnection-driven origin. These results demonstrate that compact Ca II K brightenings are reproducible, physically meaningful precursors to flare onset. Their simplicity and cadence make them attractive chromospheric indicators, and future work will evaluate their predictive skill alongside established UV/EUV and magnetic diagnostics.</description>

      <title>Cosmic-Ray-Constrained LSTM Model for Geomagnetic Storm Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geomagnetic storms (GSTs) driven by solar wind-magnetosphere coupling can severely disrupt technological systems, motivating the need for improved prediction accuracy and longer warning times. In this study, we develop a physics-informed Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model that incorporates cosmic-ray flux modulation as an additional precursor signal. As coronal mass ejection (CME)-driven disturbances propagate through the heliosphere, enhanced turbulence and magnetic-field compression reduce galactic cosmic-ray (GCR) flux measured by ground-based neutron monitors (Forbush decreases), providing early information that can precede near-Earth solar-wind signatures by 1--3 days. We integrate multi-source space-weather data, spanning 1995-2020, including cosmic-ray observations, solar wind plasma parameters, interplanetary magnetic-field data, and geomagnetic indices. Based on these data, we construct a 19-dimensional feature vector that includes flux background levels, decrease-related indicators, and inter-station correlation measures as model inputs. Employing a 50-unit LSTM architecture, the proposed model achieves root-mean-square errors (RMSE) of 5.106 nT, 8.315 nT, 10.854 nT, 12.883 nT, and 14.788 nT for 2-, 6-, 12-, 24-, and 48-hour predictions, respectively. Incorporating cosmic-ray information further improves 48-hour forecast skill by up to 25.84% (from 0.178 to 0.224). These results demonstrate the value of physics-informed deep learning and cosmic-ray precursors for advancing space-weather forecasting.</description>

      <title>Habitability of exoplanets orbiting flaring stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As of late 2025 there are about 70 exoplanets that meet the formal criterion of having equilibrium temperatures allowing the presence of liquid water and about 50 of them orbit M-stars, known for their strong chromospheric activity. Most of these stars are close to the Sun and the planet-to-star mass and luminosity ratios are advantageous, allowing for a more detailed follow-up than of planets orbiting hotter and more massive stars. Many more planets orbiting late-type stars are expected to be discovered by Gaia and PLATO in the following years. However, the lingering question remains whether the UV and X-ray emission, associated with the stellar activity, allows for complex life. A comprehensive study focused on properties of flaring exoplanet hosts and their activity, on a much larger scale than these few tens (soon to become hundreds) of stars with habitable planets is called for, to answer the question if such stars can harbor habitable planets. The proposed Wide Field Survey telescope is well suited for this study.</description>

      <title>Superradiant and dynamical spin-down of neutron stars with gravitational wave implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutron stars such as pulsars and magnetars lose angular momentum primarily through electromagnetic dipole radiation, gravitational waves, $r$-mode oscillation, and also affected by fallback accretion processes. However, anomalous spin variations, particularly sudden enhanced spin-down rates, indicate additional spin-down mechanisms. We propose superradiant spin-down as a potential explanation for these events. By modelling the interplay between conventional and superradiant spin-down channels, we evaluate their impact on neutron star rotational evolution. We also discuss gravitational-wave emission produced by quadrupole deformation, $r$-mode oscillations, and axion-induced bosonic clouds around an isolated neutron star, highlighting their potential as distinct multimessenger probes in upcoming detectors.</description>

      <title>Small-scale turbulent dynamo for low-Prandtl number fluid: comparison of the theory with results of numerical simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context: During the last decades, significant progress has been made in both numerical simulations of turbulent dynamo and theoretical understanding of turbulence. However, there is still lack of quantitative comparison between the simulations and the theory of the dynamo.
  Results: We study the critical magnetic Reynolds number ($Rm_c$) and the growth rate near the threshold both in the limit of very high and in the case of moderate Reynolds numbers. We argue that in Kazantsev equation for magnetic field generation, one should use the quasi-Lagrangian correlator of velocities instead of Eulerian, as usually implied when comparing theory and simulations. The theoretical results obtained with this correlator agree well with numerical results. We also propose the explanation of the decrease of $Rm_c$ as a function of Reynolds number ($Re$) at intermediate-high $Re$. It is probably due to Reynolds-dependent intermittency of the velocity structure function: we show that the scaling exponent of this function in the inertial range affects strongly the magnetic field generation, and it is known to be an increasing function of the Reynolds number.
  Conclusions: Use of quasi-Lagrangian correlator in the Kazantsev theory gives good accordance with numerical simulations. An ideal way to compare them should be to find the correlator substituted to the Kazantsev equation and the generation properties in the same simulation. At least one has to use universal parameters independent of the properties of pumping scale. Reynolds-dependent intermittency can explain recently observed decrease of the critical magnetic Reynolds number at small Prandtl numbers.</description>

      <title>Probing the large-scale magnetic field inside the Sun from three decades of observed surface magnetograms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23959v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Space-weather and disturbances in the heliosphere are manifestations of the solar magnetic field, which is solely driven by the interior dynamo, and constraining the solar interior magnetic field and its oscillatory behavior is one of the major challenges in solar physics. Observationally, none of the techniques, including helioseismology, are able to provide an estimation of the interior magnetic field. We reconstruct, for the first time, the dynamics of the interior large-scale magnetic fields by assimilating observed line-of-sight photospheric magnetogram data from MDI/SOHO &amp; HMI/SDO along with helioseismic differential rotation data over three decades (1996-2025) into a 3D Babcock-Leighton dynamo model. The assimilation of observational magnetogram data allows us in realistic modelling of Babcock-Leighton mechanism as observed on the Sun without any simplified parameterization. As a result, our data-driven model successfully reproduces key observational features such as the surface butterfly diagram, accurate polar field evolution, and axial dipole moment. The reconstructed interior field dominated by toroidal component exhibits an equatorward migration and reproduces the realistic amplitude and modulation of cycles 23-25. We observe that the non-axisymmetric behaviour of the interior toroidal field becomes less prominent as we move deep towards the tachocline according to our model. A strong correlation between the simulated toroidal field and sunspot number establishes our 3D magnetogram-driven model as a robust predictive model of the solar cycle.</description>

      <title>Towards sub-milliarcsecond astrometric precision using seeing-limited imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11615v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Earth's atmospheric turbulence degrades the precision of ground-based astrometry. Here, we discuss these limitations and propose that, with proper treatment of systematics and by leveraging the many epochs available from the Korean Microlensing Telescope Network (KMTNet), seeing-limited observations can reach sub-milliarcsecond precision. Such observations may be instrumental for the detection of Galactic black holes via microlensing. We present our methodology and pipeline for precise astrometric measurements using seeing-limited observations. The method is a variant of Gaia's Astrometric Global Iterative Solution (AGIS) that includes several detrending steps. Tests on 6,500 images of the same field, obtained by KMTNet with typical seeing condition of 1 arcsecond and pixel scale of 0.4 arcsecond, suggest that we can achieve, at the bright end (mag&lt;17), per-epoch relative astrometric precision of ~5 and relative proper motion precision of 0.1-0.2 mas/yr over a baseline of approximately five years, using data from the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory (CTIO) site. Time binning on 5--20 day cadences improves the bright-source precision to ~2 mas per coordinate on astrometric microlensing-relevant timescales. The precision is estimated using bootstrap simulations and further validated by comparing results from two independent KMTNet telescopes.</description>
