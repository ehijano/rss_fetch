      <title>Dedekind-MacNeille and related completions: subfitness, regularity, and Booleanness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Completions play an important r\^ole for studying structure by supplying elements that in some sense ``ought to be." Among these, the Dedekind-MacNeille completion is of particular importance. In 1968 Janowitz provided necessary and sufficient conditions for it to be subfit or Boolean. Another natural separation axiom situated between the two is regularity. We explore similar characterizations of when closely related completions are subfit, regular, or Boolean. We are mainly interested in the Bruns-Lakser, ideal, and canonical completions, which are useful in pointfree topology since (unlike the Dedekind-MacNeille completion) they satisfy stronger forms of distributivity.</description>

      <title>Topological fractals revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.15394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.15394v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that every Peano continuum with uncountably many local cut points is a topological fractal. This extends some recent results and it partially answers a conjecture by Hata. We also discuss the number of mappings which are necessary for witnessing the structure of a topological fractal.</description>

      <title>Semitopology: a survey of a topological approach to distributed collaborative action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.09287v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce semitopologies, a generalisation of point-set topology that removes the restriction that intersections of open sets need necessarily be open. The intuition is that points are participants in some distributed system, and an open set is a collection of participants that can collaborate to update their local state by taking a distributed collaborative action; we call this an actionable coalition. What constitutes an actionable coalition depends on what actions we want to model. Intuitive examples include 'a group of people that is collectively strong enough to lift a rock', where the state update is very simply 'holding rock low' to 'holding rock high' and this update is common to all participants in the actionable coalition. Or, consider 'two people wishing to barter a can of juice for a bar of chocolate', in which case the coalition is any such pair and the state updates differ between participants to flip them between 'has/has no juice' and 'has/has no chocolate'. A characteristic of these systems is that state updates are local to the coalition, voluntary, may vary between participants, and are not assumed subject to permission or synchronisation by a central authority. Peer-to-peer computer networks, including filesharing and blockchain systems, provide motivating examples from computing. This paper presents a mathematics that is inspired by these considerations. It is interesting in and of itself, much like point-set topology is; and it provides a conceptual framework within which to understand a useful class of distributed systems.</description>

      <title>Semiframes: algebras of heterogeneous consensus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00956v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Semitopologies model consensus in distributed system by equating the notion of a quorum -- a set of participants sufficient to make local progress -- with that of an open set. This yields a topology-like theory of consensus, but semitopologies generalise topologies, since the intersection of two quorums need not necessarily be a quorum. The semitopological model of consensus is naturally heterogeneous and local, just like topologies can be heterogenous and local, and for the same reasons: points may have different quorums and there is no restriction that open sets / quorums be uniformly generated (e.g. open sets can be something other than two-thirds majorities of the points in the space).
  Semiframes are an algebraic abstraction of semitopologies. They are to semitopologies as frames are to topologies. We give a notion of semifilter, which plays a role analogous to filters, and show how to build a semiframe out of the open sets of a semitopology, and a semitopology out of the semifilters of a semiframe.
  We define suitable notions of category and morphism and prove a categorical duality between (sober) semiframes and (spatial) semitopologies, and investigate well-behavedness properties on semitopologies and semiframes across the duality. Surprisingly, the structure of semiframes is not what one might initially expect just from looking at semitopologies, and the canonical structure required for the duality result -- a compatibility relation *, generalising sets intersection -- is also canonical for expressing well-behavedness properties.
  Overall, we deliver a new categorical, algebraic, abstract framework within which to study consensus on distributed systems, and which is also simply interesting to consider as a mathematical theory in its own right.</description>

      <title>Semitopology: distributed collaborative action via topology, algebra, and logic</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03253v2 Announce Type: replace-cross

  This monograph presents a comprehensive view of semitopologies which includes point-set semitopology, algebra, and logic inspired by these considerations. This is interesting in and of itself and it provides a conceptual framework within which to understand a useful class of distributed systems.</description>
