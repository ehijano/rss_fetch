      <title>Disordered topological crystalline phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The imposition of crystalline symmetries is known to lead to a rich variety of insulating and superconducting topological phases. These include higher-order topological phases and obstructed atomic limits with and without filling anomalies. We here comprehensively classify such topological crystalline phases (TCPs) with mirror, twofold rotation, and inversion symmetries in the presence of disorder that preserves the crystalline symmetry on average. We find that the inclusion of disorder leads to a simplification of the classification in comparison to the clean case. We also find that, while clean TCPs evade a general bulk-boundary principle, disordered TCPs admit a complete bulk-boundary correspondence, according to which (bulk) topological phases are topologically equivalent if and only if they have the same anomalous boundary states and filling anomaly. We corroborate the stability of disordered TCPs by way of field-theoretic, numerical and symmetry-based analyses in various case studies. While the boundary signatures of most disordered TCPs are similar to their clean counterparts, the addition of disorder to certain mirror-symmetric TCPs results in novel higher-order statistical topological phases, in which zero-energy hinge states have critical wavefunction statistics, while remaining protected from Anderson localization.</description>

      <title>Comparing Dynamics, Pinning and Ratchet Effects for Skyrmionium, Skyrmions, and Antiskyrmions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compare the driven dynamics of skyrmions, antiskyrmions, and skyrmionium interacting with random disorder, circular defects, and asymmetric potentials. When interacting with a line defect at a constant drive, skyrmions and antiskyrmions show an acceleration effect for motion along the wall and a drop in velocity when they can cross the barrier. In contrast, skyrmionium travels at a reduced velocity when moving along a wall, and exhibits an increase in velocity once it can cross the barrier. For point defects, skyrmionium can be pinned for a finite fixed period of time, while for skyrmions and antiskyrmions, the Magnus force creates a deflection from the defect and an acceleration effect. For a given drive, skyrmionium moves twice as fast as skyrmions; however, skyrmionium is more susceptible to pinning effects than skyrmions and antiskyrmions. Additionally, there is a critical threshold where the skyrmionium transforms to a skyrmion that is associated with a drop in the velocity of the texture. We show that all three textures exhibit diode and ratchet effects when interacting with an asymmetric substrate, but skyrmions and antiskyrmions show a stronger ratcheting effect than skyrmionium due to the Magnus force.</description>

      <title>Energy level structure of diamond silicon vacancy centers in an off-axis magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the development of an experimental approach that can characterize the energy level structure of an individual silicon vacancy (SiV) center in a magnetic field and extract the key parameters for the energy level structure. This approach builds upon a theoretical model that includes effects of the static strain, dynamic Jahn-Teller coupling, and magnetic field and introduces two coupling rates, one each for the ground and the excited states, to characterize the combined effects of strain and Jahn-Teller coupling. With the use of an analytical expression for the energy level structure of the SiV center under a transverse magnetic field, these two coupling rates can be directly derived from the measurement of the frequency separation between two spin-conserved transitions in a photoluminescence excitation spectrum and the measurement of the coherent population trapping resonance related to the SiV ground spin states. Additional experimental studies on the dependence of the energy level structure on the magnetic field amplitude and direction further verify the theoretical model and reveal contributions from unequal orbital magnetic coupling for the ground and excited states.</description>

      <title>Sensing Few Electrons Floating on Helium with High-Electron-Mobility Transistors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on low-frequency measurements of few electrons floating on superfluid helium using a bespoke cryogenic cascode amplifier circuit built with off-the-shelf GaAs High-Electron-Mobility Transistors (HEMTs). We integrate this circuit with a Charge-Coupled Device (CCD) to transport the electrons on helium and characterize its performance. We show that this circuit has a Signal-to-Noise ratio (SNR) of $\thicksim$ 2$\frac{e}{\sqrt{Hz}}$ at 102 kHz, an order of magnitude improvement from previous implementations and provides a compelling alternative to few electron sensing with high frequency resonators.</description>

      <title>Transverse magnetic focusing in two-dimensional hole gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional hole gases (2DHGs) have strong intrinsic spin-orbit coupling and could be used to build spin filters by utilising transverse magnetic focusing (TMF). However, with an increase in the spin degree of freedom, holes demonstrate significantly different behaviour to electrons in TMF experiments, making it difficult to interpret the results of these experiments. In this paper, we numerically model TMF in a 2DHG within a GaAs/Al$_{\mathrm{x}}$Ga$_{\mathrm{1-x}}$As heterostructure. Our band structure calculations show that the heavy $(\langle J_{z} \rangle = \pm\frac{3}{2})$ and light $(\langle J_{z} \rangle = \pm\frac{1}{2})$ hole states in the valence band mix at finite $k$, and the heavy hole subbands which are spin-split due to the Rashba effect are not spin-polarised. This lack of spin polarisation casts doubt on the viability of spin filtering using TMF in 2DHGs within conventional GaAs/Al$_{\mathrm{x}}$Ga$_{\mathrm{1-x}}$As heterostructures. We then calculate transport properties of the 2DHG with spin projection and offer a new perspective on interpreting and designing TMF experiments in 2DHGs.</description>

      <title>Parity breaking in Thouless quantum walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Abelian evolution is a landmark in modern theoretical physics. But if non-commutative dynamics has a significant impact in the control of entanglement and transport in quantum systems is an open question. Here we propose to utilize non-Abelian Thouless pumping in one-dimensional discrete-time quantum walks in lattices with degenerate Bloch-bands. We show how the interplay of non-commutativity and topology enables geometrically protected quantum coin and shift operators. By composing different non-Abelian pumping cycles, different classes of tunable protected quantum walks arise. Surprisingly, the walks break parity symmetry and generate a dynamic process described by a Weyl-like equation. The amount of entanglement can be varied by acting on the initial conditions. The asymptotic statistical distribution and its features are determined by closed form analytical expression and confirmed numerically.</description>

      <title>Land\'e g-factors and spin dynamics of charge carriers in CuCl nanocrystals in a glass matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spin properties of charge carriers confined in CuCl semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs) of different sizes (radius from 1.8 nm up to 28 nm) crystallized in a glass matrix are studied experimentally and theoretically. By means of photoluminescence, spin-flip Raman scattering, time-resolved Faraday ellipticity, and time-resolved differential transmission performed at temperatures in the range of $1.6 - 120$ K at magnetic fields up to 8 T, comprehensive information on the Land\'e $g$-factors as well as the population and spin dynamics is received. The spin signals are contributed by confined electrons with a $g$-factor close to 2, which shows a weak increase with decreasing NC size, i.e. increasing electron confinement energy. We revisit the theory of exciton confinement as a whole in spherical NCs within the six-band valence band model in order to describe the size dependence of the $Z_3$ and $Z_{1,2}$ exciton energies in CuCl NCs. We demonstrate theoretically that the stronger increase of the $Z_{1,2}$ energy transitions with decreasing radius can be explained by the strong absorption from the excited exciton state caused by strong heavy hole-light hole mixing in the exciton. The parameters of the six-band Hamiltonian describing both the exciton and hole kinetic energies are estimated from the comparison of the calculated and experimental size dependences of the exciton transitions. A theoretical model of the size-dependent Land\'e $g$-factors for electron and hole confined in spherical NCs of semiconductors with negative spin-orbit splitting of the valence band is developed.</description>

      <title>Room-temperature van der Waals magnetoresistive memories with data writing by orbital current in the Weyl semimetal TaIrTe4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current-induced out of plane magnetization has been utilized for field-free switching of ferromagnets with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. Identifying systems capable of energy-efficiently converting charge currents into out of plane orbit- or spin-polarized currents is crucial for advancing magnetic memory technologies. Here we introduce the Berry curvature dipole as a key evaluation factor, directly measurable through nonlinear Hall effects. In the Weyl semimetal TaIrTe4 used in our experiments, applying a current parallel to the Berry curvature dipole results in out of plane orbital magnetization, which governs the field-free perpendicular magnetization switching in TaIrTe4/Fe3GaTe2 heterostructures. Notably, all-electric control of van der Waals magnetoresistive memory at room temperature has been achieved with a low critical current density 2x10^6A/cm2 for data writing. Our findings reveal the connection between nonlinear Hall effects and field-free magnetization switching, highlighting the potential of the Berry curvature dipole in advancing orbitronics.</description>

      <title>Facilitating field-free perpendicular magnetization switching with a Berry curvature dipole in a Weyl semimetal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the synergy between orbital and spin-orbit torques in WTe2/Fe3GeTe2 heterostructures characterized by a Berry curvature dipole. By applying a current along the a axis in WTe2, we detect an out-of-plane magnetization in the system, which we attribute to nonequilibrium orbital magnetization linked to the Berry curvature dipole based on first-principles calculations, manifesting as the orbital Edelstein effect. This effect generates orbital torques that enable field-free perpendicular magnetization switching. Furthermore, by applying a relatively small current along the a axis and a pulsed current along the b axis in WTe2, we demonstrate controllable field-free magnetization switching of the adjacent Fe3GeTe2 layer, independently manipulating the orbital and spin-orbit torques. Our findings not only enhance the understanding of the collaborative dynamics between these torques but also suggest potential applications in magnetoresistive random-access memory.</description>

Abstract: We show that quantum geometry sets a bound on the $q^4$ term in the static structure factor $S(q)$. Bands that saturate this bound satisfy a form of Laplace's equation, leading us to refer to them as \textit{harmonic bands}. We provide some examples of harmonic bands in one- and two-dimensional systems.</description>

      <title>Matchgate circuits deeply thermalize</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the ensemble of states generated by performing projective measurements on the output of a random matchgate (or free-fermionic) quantum circuit. We rigorously show that this `projected ensemble' exhibits deep thermalization: For large system sizes, it converges towards a universal ensemble that is uniform over the manifold of Gaussian fermionic states. As well as proving moment-wise convergence of these ensembles, we demonstrate that the full distribution of any physical observable in the projected ensemble is close to its universal form in Wasserstein-1 distance, which we argue is an appropriate and efficiently computable measure of convergence when studying deep thermalization. Using this metric, we also numerically find that local matchgate circuits deeply thermalize after a timescale $t \sim L^2$ set by the diffusive spreading of quantum information. Our work opens up new avenues to experimentally accessible protocols to probe the emergence of quantum statistical mechanics and benchmark quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Designing Optically Addressable Nitrogen-Vacancy Centers in Ultra-Small Nanodiamonds: Insights from First-Principles Calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultrasmall nanodiamonds (USNDs) are promising platforms for fluorescent and quantum sensing applications. Here we present first-principles electronic structure calculations of color centers in USNDs, specifically the nitrogen-vacancy (NV-) and we investigate their optical addressability as a function of the surface termination. We consider both isolated nanoparticles and arrays of USNDs with different degrees of packing, and we include quantum vibronic effects in our analysis, using stochastic methods. We find that the NV in USNDs can be stabilized in a negative charge state if the nanoparticles are terminated by fluorine, hydroxyl, and ether. While fluorine terminations can be used for fluorescent bio-tags, we suggest that hydroxyl and ether terminations are beneficial for quantum sensing applications. We also find that the NV- can be stabilized in arrays of USNDs when inter-particle separations are larger than the diameter of the nanoparticle. Interestingly, the phonon renormalizations of single-particle energy levels found in arrays contribute to the charge stability of negatively charged NV centers.</description>

      <title>Anomalous wave-packet transport on boundaries of Floquet topological systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A two-dimensional periodically driven (Floquet) system with zero winding number in the absence of time-reversal symmetry is usually considered topologically trivial. Here, we study the dynamics of a Gaussian wave packet placed at the boundary of a two-dimensional driven system with zero winding numbers but multiple valley-protected edge states that can be realized in a square Raman lattice, and investigate the unidirectionally propagating topological edge currents. By carefully tuning the initial parameters of the wave packet including its spin polarization as well as the initial time of the periodic driving, we control the population of different edge states, where the speed of the resulting propagation establishes a direct correspondence with the target dispersions across different gaps and valleys. Interestingly, we find that the edge states at different valleys in the $\pi$ gap can hybridize and form bowtie-shaped edge bands fully detached from the bulk. This phase, not only presents a favorable regime with narrower bulk bands, but also exhibits distinct edge dynamics where the majority of particles bounce back-and-forth confined to a boundary while a small portion can follow a chiral transport around the sample.</description>

      <title>Thermal state structure in the Tavis--Cummings model and rapid simulations in mesoscopic quantum ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hybrid quantum systems consisting of a collection of N spin-1/2 particles uniformly interacting with an electromagnetic field, such as one confined in a cavity, are important for the development of quantum information processors and will be useful for metrology, as well as tests of collective behavior. Such systems are often modeled by the Tavis-Cummings model and having an accurate understanding of the thermal behaviors of this system is needed to understand the behavior of them in realistic environments. We quantitatively show in this work that the Dicke subspace approximation is at times invoked too readily, in specific we show that there is a temperature above which the degeneracies in the system become dominant and the Dicke subspace is minimally populated. This transition occurs at a lower temperature than priorly considered. When in such a temperature regime, the key constants of the motion are the total excitation count between the spin system and cavity and the collective angular momentum of the spin system. These enable perturbative expansions for thermal properties in terms of the energy shifts of dressed states, called Lamb shifts herein. These enable efficient numeric methods for obtaining certain parameters that scale as $O(\sqrt{N})$, and is thus highly efficient. These provide methods for approximating, and bounding, properties of these systems as well as characterizing the dominant population regions, including under perturbative noise. In the regime of stronger spin-spin coupling the perturbations outweigh the expansion series terms and inefficient methods likely are needed to be employed, removing the computational efficiency of simulating such systems. The results in this work can also be used for related systems such as coupled-cavity arrays, cavity mediated coupling of collective spin ensembles, and collective spin systems.</description>

      <title>Simulating Composite Fermion Excitons by Density Functional Theory and Monte Carlo on a Disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Kohn-Sham density functional method for the fractional quantum Hall (FQH) effect has recently been developed by mapping the strongly interacting electrons into an auxiliary system of weakly interacting composite fermions (CFs) that experience a density-dependent effective magnetic field. This approach has been successfully applied to explore the edge rescontruction, fractional charge and fractional braiding statistics of quasiparticle excitations. In this work, we investigate composite fermion excitons in the bulk of the disk geometry. By varying the separation of the quasiparticle-quasihole pairs and calculating their energy, we compare the dispersion of the magnetoroton mode with results from other numerical methods, such as exact diagonalization (ED) and Monte Carlo (MC) simulation. Furthermore, through an evaluation of the spectral function, we identify chiral ``graviton'' excitations: a spin $-2$ mode for the particle-like Laughlin state and a spin $2$ mode for the hole-like Laughlin state. This method can be extended to construct neutral collective excitations for other fractional quantum Hall states in disk geometry.</description>

      <title>Anderson localization: A disorder-induced quantum bound state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electrons at the Fermi energy lose their ability to propagate to long distances in disordered media when undergoing the Anderson localization transition. We use Green functions in an analytically solvable model to describe the vanishing of diffusion at this transition. We find that the low-energy asymptotics of the electron-hole correlation function undergoes a crossover with a disorder-dependent time scale separating the two regimes. This scale determines how long the propagating particle remains captured within a finite volume. It is critical and diverges at the localization transition. According to our analysis, the diffusionless phase consists of quantum bound states that cannot be described in the space of Bloch waves and with the diffusion equation. We identify the necessary amendments to the existing approaches to reach a consistent microscopic picture of the emergence of Anderson localization.</description>

      <title>Chiral Anomalous Magnetohydrodynamics in action: effective field theory and holography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chiral Anomalous Magnetohydrodynamics (CAMHD) provides a low-energy effective framework for describing chiral fluids in the presence of dynamical electromagnetic fields and axial anomaly. This theory finds applications across diverse physical systems, including heavy-ion collisions, the early universe, and Weyl/Dirac semimetals. Along with Schwinger-Keldysh (SK) effective theories, holographic models serve as a complementary tool to provide a systematic formulation of CAMHD that goes beyond the weak coupling regime. In this work, we explore holographic models with $U(1)_A \times U(1)$ symmetry, where the electromagnetic $U(1)$ field is rendered dynamical through mixed boundary conditions applied to the bulk gauge field and the axial anomaly is introduced via a Chern-Simons bulk term. Through a detailed holographic SK analysis, we demonstrate that the low-energy effective action derived from this model aligns precisely with the SK field theory proposed by Landry and Liu and, in fact, it generalizes it to scenarios with finite background axial field. This alignment not only validates the holographic model but also paves the way for its use in exploring unresolved aspects of CAMHD, such as the recently proposed chiral magnetic electric separation wave and nonlinear chiral instabilities.</description>

      <title>Resistive anisotropy in the charge density wave phase of Kagome superconductor CsV3Sb5 thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the resistive anisotropy in CsV3Sb5 thin films within the charge density wave phase. Using a device structure with twelve electrodes symmetrically distributed in a circular shape, we measure the resistivity anisotropy by varying the current direction. A twofold resistivity anisotropy modulated by temperature is found, which is fully consistent with the electronic nematicity in CsV3Sb5, that is, the spontaneous rotational symmetry breaking by electronic degree of freedom. Additionally, the resistivity anisotropy also shows modest changes by applying magnetic fields, implying the possible chiral charge orders with time-reversal symmetry breaking. These findings provide deep insights into the correlated electronic states in Kagome materials and highlight the unique properties of CsV3Sb5 in the two-dimensional regime.</description>

Abstract: We present the design of a helium liquefaction system tailored to efficiently recover helium vapor from either an individual or a small cluster of vibration-sensitive cryogenic instruments. This design prioritizes a compact footprint, mitigating potential contamination sources such as gas bags and oil-lubricated compressors while maximizing the recovery rate by capturing both the boil-offs during normal operation and refilling process of the bath cryostat. We demonstrated its performance by applying it to a commercial low-temperature scanning probe microscope. It features a &gt; 94% recovery rate and induces negligible vibrational noise to the microscope. Due to its adaptability, affordability, compact size, and suitability for homemade setups, we foresee that our design can be utilized across a wide range of experimental measurements where liquid helium is used as the cryogen.</description>

Abstract: Berry phases have long been known to significantly alter the properties of periodic systems, resulting in anomalous terms in the semiclassical equations of motion describing wave-packet dynamics. In non-Hermitian systems, generalizations of the Berry connection have been proposed and shown to have novel effects on dynamics and transport. In this work, we consider perturbing fields which are themselves non-Hermitian, in the form of complex external electric fields, which are realizable as gain/loss gradients. We derive the full set of semiclassical equations of motion and show that the anomalous velocity depends not only on the Berry curvature, but on the entirety of the quantum geometric tensor, including the quantum metric. This quantum metric dependent velocity appears regardless of whether the unperturbed Hamiltonian is Hermitian or not. These analytical results are compared with numerical lattice simulations which reveal these anomalous terms even in one-dimension. Our work expands the range of phenomena expected to be detectable in experimental setups, which should be realizable in currently available metamaterials and classical wave systems, including mechanical, acoustic, and optical.</description>

      <title>Nagaoka Ferromagnetism in $3 \times 3$ Arrays and Beyond</title>

Abstract: Nagaoka ferromagnetism (NF) is a long-predicted example of itinerant ferromagnetism (IF) in the Hubbard model that has been studied theoretically for many years. The condition for NF, an infinite on-site Coulomb repulsion and a single hole in a half-filled band, does not arise naturally in materials. NF was only realized recently for the first time in experiments on a $2\times 2$ array of gated quantum dots. Dopant arrays and gated quantum dots in Si allow for engineering controllable systems with complex geometries. This makes quantum dot arrays good candidates to study NF in different geometries through analog quantum simulation. Here we present theoretical simulations done for $3\times 3$ arrays and larger $N\times N$ arrays, and predict the emergence of different forms of ferromagnetism in different geometries. We find NF in perfect $3\times 3$ arrays, and in $N\times N$ arrays for one hole doping of a half-filled band. The ratio of the hopping $t$ to Hubbard on-site repulsion $U$ that defines the onset of NF scales as $1/N^{4}$ as $N$ increases, approaching the bulk limit of infinite $U$ for large $N$. Additional simulations are done for geometries made by removing sites from $N\times N$ arrays. Different forms of ferromagnetism are found for different geometries. Loops show ferromagnetism, but only for three electrons. For loops, the critical $t/U$ for the onset of ferromagnetism scales as $N$ as the loop length increases. We show that the different dependences on size for loops and $N\times N$ arrays can be understood by scaling arguments that highlight the different energy contributions to each form of ferromagnetism. Our results show how analog quantum simulation with small arrays can elucidate the role of effects including wavefunction connectivity; system geometry, size and symmetry; bulk and edge sites; and kinetic energy in determining quantum magnetism of small systems.</description>

Abstract: Intercalation of epitaxial graphene on SiC(0001) with Sn results in a well-ordered Sn $(1\times1)$ structure on the SiC surface with quasi-freestanding graphene on top. While the electronic properties of the individual layers have been studied in the past, emerging phenomena arising from possible inter-layer interactions between the 2D\,Sn layer and graphene remain unexplored. We use time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy to reveal a surprisingly short-lived non-equilibrium carrier distribution inside the Dirac cone of Sn-intercalated graphene. Further, we find that the graphene $\pi$-band exhibits a transient increase in binding energy that we attribute to charging of the graphene layer with holes. We interpret our results with support from density functional theory calculations of the graphene - 2D\,Sn heterostructure that reveal a substantial hybridization between the graphene $\pi$-bands and Sn states, providing a channel for efficient ultrafast charge transfer between the layers. Our results on the graphene - 2D\,Sn model system are expected to trigger similar investigations on related heterostructures obtained by intercalation of epitaxial graphene. Regarding the huge choice of materials that have been successfully intercalated in the past, we believe that the interlayer interactions revealed in the present work only represent the tip of the iceberg with many fascinating emerging phenomena to be discovered in the near future.</description>

Abstract: Topological flat bands formed in two-dimensional lattice systems offer unique opportunity to study the fractional phases of matter in the absence of an external magnetic field. Celebrated examples include fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) effects and fractional topological insulators. Recently, FQAH effects have been experimentally realized in both the twisted bilayer MoTe2 (tMoTe2) system and the rhombohedral stacked multilayer graphene/hBN moir\'e systems. To date, experimental studies mainly focus on the first moir\'e flat band, except a very recent work that studied novel transport properties in higher moir\'e bands of a 2.1{\deg} tMoTe2 device. Here, we present the systematical transport study of approximately 3{\deg} tMoTe2 devices, especially for the second moir\'e band. At {\nu} = -2 and -4, time-reversal-symmetric single and double quantum spin Hall states formed, consistent with the previous observation in 2.1{\deg} tMoTe2 device. On the other hand, we observed ferromagnetism in the second moir\'e band, and a Chern insulator state driven by out-of-plane magnetic fields at {\nu} = -3. At {\nu} = -2.2 to -2.7, finite temperature resistivity minimum with 1/T scaling at low temperatures, and large out-of-plane negative magnetoresistance have been observed. Applying out-of-plane electric field can induce quantum phase transitions at both integer and fractional filling factors. Our studies pave the way for realizing tunable topological states and other unexpected magnetic phases beyond the first moir\'e flat band based on twisted MoTe2 platform.</description>

      <title>Linear response in planar Hall and thermal Hall setups for Rarita-Schwinger-Weyl semimetals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01422v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the nature of the linear-response tensors in planar Hall and planar thermal Hall setups, where we subject a Rarita-Schwinger-Weyl (RSW) semimetal to the combined influence of an electric field $\mathbf E $ (and/or temperature gradient $\nabla_{\mathbf r } T$) and a weak (i.e., nonquantizing) magnetic field $\mathbf B $. For computing the in-plane transport components, we have added an elastic deformation which gives rise to a chirality-dependent effective magnetic field $ \mathbf B^{\text{tot}} = \mathbf B + \chi \, \mathbf B_5 $, where $\chi $ is the chirality of an RSW node. We have included the effects of orbital magnetic moment (OMM), in conjunction with the Berry curvature (BC), both of which appear as a consequence of nontrivial topology of the bandstructure. Due to the presence of four bands, RSW semimetals provide a richer structure for obtaining the linear-response coefficients, compared to the Weyl semimetals. In particular, we have found that the OMM-contributed terms may oppose or add up to the BC-only parts, depending on which band we are considering. Last, but not the least, we have determined the out-of-plane response comprising the intrinsic anomalous-Hall and the Lorentz-force-contributed currents, whose nature corroborates the findings of some recent experimental results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04459v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The existence of exceptional points (EPs) ${-}$ where both eigenvalues and eigenvectors converge ${-}$ is a key characteristic of non-Hermitian physics. A newly-discovered class of magnets ${-}$ termed as altermagnets (AMs) ${-}$ are characterized by a net zero magnetization as well as spin-split bands. In this study, we propose the emergence of non-Hermitian physics at AM-ferromagnet (FM) junctions. We discover that such a junction hosts tunable EPs. We demonstrate that the positions of these emergent EPs can be tuned using an external applied magnetic field and show that for a critical value of the applied magnetic field the EPs can annihilate. Notably, the number and position of the EPs crucially depends on the type of AM and its orientation with respect to the FM. Our work puts forth a promising platform of exploration of non-Hermitian physics in an emerging class of magnetic materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16759v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the Dirac-Frenkel variational principle, a time-dependent description of the dynamics of a two-level system coupled to a bosonic bath is formulated. The method is applied to the case of a gas of cold atoms adsorbing to an elastic membrane at finite temperature via phonon creation. The time-dependence of the system state is analytically calculated using Laplace transform methods, and a closed-form expression for the transition rate is obtained. Atoms in the gas transition to the adsorbed state through a resonance that has contributions from a distribution of vibrational modes of the membrane. The resonance can decay with the creation of a phonon to complete the adsorption process. The adsorption rate at low membrane temperatures agrees with the golden rule estimate to lowest order in the coupling constant for values greater than a critical coupling strength. Below this critical coupling strength, the adsorption rate is exponentially suppressed by a phonon reduction factor whose exponent diverges with increasing adsorbent size. The rate changes discontinuously with coupling strength for low temperature membranes, and the magnitude of the discontinuity decreases with increasing temperature. These variational results suggest the quantum adsorption model may contain a first-order quantum phase transition.</description>

Abstract: Bilayer quantum hall system with total filling factor 1 was studied in the regime of heavy layer imbalance in a recent transport experiment [Zeng2023, arXiv:2306.16995], with intriguing new findings. We demonstrate in this paper that 1) the exciton Wigner crystal in this regime can melt into a superfluid phase, giving rise to re-entrant superfluid behavior; 2) in the presence of disorder, electron and hole Wigner crystals in the two layers go through a locking/decoupling transition as layer separation increases, resulting in a sudden change in the counter flow conductance. Comparison will be made with the findings of experiments.</description>

      <title>Few-to-many-particle crossover of pair excitations in a superfluid</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.03762v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent advances in the creation of few-body atomic Fermi gases with attractive interactions, we study theoretically the few-to-many-particle crossover of pair excitations, which for large particle numbers evolve into a mode that describes amplitude fluctuations of the superfluid order parameter (the "Higgs" mode). Our analysis is based on the hypothesis that salient aspects of the excitation spectrum are captured by interactions between time-reversed pair states in a harmonic oscillator potential. Microscopically, this assumption leads to a Richardson-type pairing model, which is integrable and thus allows a systematic quantitative study of the few-to-many-particle crossover with only minor numerical effort. We first establish a parity effect in the ground-state energy, i.e., a spectral convexity in the energy of open-shell configurations compared to their closed-shell neighbors, which is quantified by a so-called Matveev-Larkin parameter discussed for mesoscopic superconductors, which generalizes the pairing gap to mesoscopic ensembles and which behaves quantitatively differently in a few-body and a many-body regime. The crossover point for this quantity is widely tunable as a function of interaction strength. We then compute the excitation spectrum and demonstrate that the pair excitation energy shows a minimum that deepens with increasing particle number and shifts to smaller interaction strengths, consistent with the finite-size precursor of a quantum phase transition to a superfluid state. We extract a critical finite-size scaling exponent that characterizes the decrease of the gap with increasing particle number.</description>

      <title>Quantum tensor network algorithms for evaluation of spectral functions on quantum computers</title>

Abstract: We investigate quantum algorithms derived from tensor networks to simulate the static and dynamic properties of quantum many-body systems. Using a sequentially prepared quantum circuit representation of a matrix product state (MPS) that we call a quantum tensor network (QTN), we demonstrate algorithms to prepare ground and excited states on a quantum computer and apply them to molecular nanomagnets (MNMs) as a paradigmatic example. In this setting, we develop two approaches for extracting the spectral correlation functions measured in neutron scattering experiments: (a) a generalization of the SWAP test for computing wavefunction overlaps and, (b) a generalization of the notion of matrix product operators (MPOs) to the QTN setting which generates a linear combination of unitaries. The latter method is discussed in detail for translationally invariant spin-half systems, where it is shown to reduce the qubit resource requirements compared with the SWAP method, and may be generalized to other systems. We demonstrate the versatility of our approaches by simulating spin-1/2 and spin-3/2 MNMs, with the latter being an experimentally relevant model of a Cr$^{3+}_8$ ring. Our approach has qubit requirements that are independent of the number of constituents of the many-body system and scale only logarithmically with the bond dimension of the MPS representation, making them appealing for implementation on near-term quantum hardware with mid-circuit measurement and reset.</description>

      <title>Non-resonant electric quantum control of individual on-surface spins</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19036v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum control techniques play an important role in manipulating and harnessing the properties of different quantum systems, including isolated atoms. Here, we propose to achieve quantum control over a single on-surface atomic spin using Landau-Zener-St\"uckelberg-Majorana (LZSM) interferometry implemented with Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM). Specifically, we model how the application of time-dependent, non-resonant AC electric fields across the STM tip-surface gap makes it possible to achieve precise quantum state manipulation in an isolated Fe atom on a MgO/Ag(100) surface. We propose a protocol to combine Landau Zener tunneling with LZSM interferometry that permits one to measure the quantum spin tunneling of an individual Fe atom. The proposed experiments can be implemented with ESR-STM instrumentation, opening a new venue in the research of on-surface single spin control.</description>

      <title>Strain-driven stabilization of a room-temperature chiral multiferroic with coupled ferroaxial and ferroelectric order</title>

Abstract: Noncollinear ferroic materials are sought after as testbeds to explore the intimate connections between topology and symmetry, which result in electronic, optical and magnetic functionalities not observed in collinear ferroic materials. For example, ferroaxial materials have ordered rotational structural distortions that break mirror symmetry and induce chirality. When ferroaxial order is coupled with ferroelectricity arising from a broken inversion symmetry, it offers the prospect of electric-field-control of the ferroaxial distortions and opens up new tunable functionalities. However, chiral multiferroics, especially ones stable at room temperature, are rare. We report the discovery of a strain-stabilized, room-temperature chiral multiferroic phase in single crystals of BaTiS$_3$, a quasi-one-dimensional (1D) hexagonal chalcogenide. Using first-principles calculations, we predict the stabilization of this multiferroic phase having $P6_3$ space group for biaxial tensile strains exceeding 1.5% applied on the basal ab-plane of the room temperature $P6_3cm$ phase of BaTiS$_3$. The chiral multiferroic phase is characterized by rotational distortions of select TiS$_6$ octahedra around the long $c$-axis and polar displacement of Ti atoms along the $c$-axis. We used an innovative approach using focused ion beam milling to make appropriately strained samples of BaTiS$_3$. The ferroaxial and ferroelectric distortions, and their domains in $P6_3$-BaTiS$_3$ were directly resolved using atomic resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy. Landau-based phenomenological modeling predicts a strong coupling between the ferroelectric and the ferroaxial order making $P6_3$-BaTiS$_3$ an attractive test bed for achieving electric-field control of chirality-related phenomena such as circular photo-galvanic current and the Rashba effect.</description>

      <title>Universal bound states and resonances with Coulomb plus short-range potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06011v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study charged particles in three dimensions interacting via a short-range potential in addition to the Coulomb potential. When the Bohr radius and the scattering length are much larger than the potential range, low-energy physics of the system becomes independent from details of the short-range potential. We develop the zero-range theory to describe such universal physics in terms of the Bohr radius and the scattering length by generalizing the Bethe-Peierls boundary condition, which is then applied to two charged particles to reveal their bound states and resonances. Infinite resonances are found for a repulsive Coulomb potential, one of which turns into a bound state with increasing inverse scattering length, whereas infinite bound states exist for an attractive Coulomb potential with no resonances at any scattering length. The zero-range theory is also applied to three equally charged particles at infinite scattering length under the variational Born-Oppenheimer approximation. We find that the effective potential between two heavy particles induced by a light particle is an inverse-square attraction at distances shorter than the Bohr radius, leading to infinite deep bound states, whereas shallow ones successively turn into resonances with increasing Coulomb repulsion.</description>

      <title>Semi-implicit Lax-Wendroff kinetic scheme for multi-scale phonon transport</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01945v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fast and accurate predictions of the spatiotemporal distributions of temperature are crucial to the multi-scale thermal management and safe operation of microelectronic devices. To realize it, an efficient semi-implicit Lax-Wendroff kinetic scheme is developed for numerically solving the transient phonon Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) from the ballistic to diffusive regime. The phonon BTE at the cell center is discretized under the framework of finite volume method, where the trapezoidal and midpoint rules are used to deal with the temporal integration of phonon scattering and convection terms, respectively. For the reconstruction of the interfacial distribution function, the phonon BTE at the cell interface is discretized in the form of finite difference method and solved numerically, where second-order upwind and central scheme are used to deal with the spatial interpolation and gradient of interfacial distribution function, respectively. The macroscopic governing equations are invoked for the evolution of macroscopic fields at both the cell center and interface, where the macroscopic flux is obtained by taking the moment of the interfacial distribution function. Numerical results show that the present scheme could accurately predict the steady/unsteady heat conduction in solid materials from the ballistic to diffusive regime, and its time and cell size are not limited by the relaxation time and phonon mean free path. The present work could provide a useful tool for the efficient predictions of the macroscopic spatiotemporal distributions in the multi-scale thermal engineering.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear optical response and spontaneous polarization in layer-stacked gallenene using second harmonic generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00461v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gallenene is a promising low-dimensional material with a structure down to the thickness of a single atom, similar to graphene. However, van der Waals stacking of two-dimensional (2D) gallenene under confinement remain poorly understood. In this study, we present evidence of the formation of parallel-stacked hexagonal gallenene (a100) structures in liquid gallium. The present study demonstrates the AB stacking of 2D gallenene a100 crystals in liquid gallium sandwiched between two graphene layers, as observed through transmission electron microscopy. A nonlinear optical response of the confined hexagonal gallenene was investigated through second harmonic generation (SHG) microscopy. The SHG signal exhibits periodic peak intensity shifts upon angular rotation up to 90 degrees and intensity dampening at elevated temperatures. These findings offer insights on device applications of 2D gallenene.</description>
