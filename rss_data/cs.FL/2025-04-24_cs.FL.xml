      <title>Learning Weighted Automata over Number Rings, Concretely and Categorically</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a generic reduction procedure for active learning problems. Our approach is inspired by a recent polynomial-time reduction of the exact learning problem for weighted automata over integers to that for weighted automata over rationals (Buna-Marginean et al. 2024). Our procedure improves the efficiency of a category-theoretic automata learning algorithm, and poses new questions about the complexity of its implementation when instantiated to concrete categories. As our second main contribution, we address these complexity aspects in the concrete setting of learning weighted automata over number rings, that is, rings of integers in an algebraic number field. Assuming a full representation of a number ring OK, we obtain an exact learning algorithm of OK-weighted automata that runs in polynomial time in the size of the target automaton, the logarithm of the length of the longest counterexample, the degree of the number field, and the logarithm of its discriminant. Our algorithm produces an automaton that has at most one more state than the minimal one, and we prove that doing better requires solving the principal ideal problem, for which the best currently known algorithm is in quantum polynomial time.</description>

      <title>Density of rational languages under shift invariant measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study density of rational languages under shift invariant probability measures on spaces of two-sided infinite words, which generalizes the classical notion of density studied in formal languages and automata theory. The density for a language is defined as the limit in average (if it exists) of the probability that a word of a given length belongs to the language. We establish the existence of densities for all rational languages under all shift invariant measures. We also give explicit formulas under certain conditions, in particular when the language is aperiodic. Our approach combines tools and ideas from semigroup theory and ergodic theory.</description>

      <title>Using games and universal trees to characterise the nondeterministic index of tree languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The parity index problem of tree automata asks, given a regular tree language $L$ and a set of priorities $J$, is $L$ $J$-feasible, that is, recognised by a nondeterministic parity automaton with priorities $J$? This is a long-standing open problem, of which only a few sub-cases and variations are known to be decidable. In a significant but technically difficult step, Colcombet and L\"oding reduced the problem to the uniform universality of distance-parity automata. In this article, we revisit the index problem using tools from the parity game literature.
  We add some counters to Lehtinen's register game, originally used to solve parity games in quasipolynomial time, and use this novel game to characterise $J$-feasibility. This provides a alternative proof to Colcombet and L\"oding's reduction.
  We then provide a second characterisation, based on the notion of attractor decompositions and the complexity of their structure, as measured by a parameterised version of their Strahler number, which we call $n$-Strahler number. Finally, we rephrase this result using the notion of universal tree extended to automata: a guidable automaton recognises a $[1,2j]$-feasible language if and only if it admits a universal tree with $n$-Strahler number $j$, for some $n$. In particular, a language recognised by a guidable automaton $A$ is B\"uchi-feasible if and only if there is a uniform bound $n\in \mathbb{N}$ such that all trees in the language admit an accepting run with an attractor decomposition of width bounded by $n$, or, equivalently, if and only $A$ admits a \textit{finite} universal tree.
  While we do not solve the decidability of the index problem, our work makes the state-of-the-art more accessible and brings to light the deep relationships between the $J$-feasibility of a language and attractor decompositions, universal trees and Lehtinen's register game.</description>

      <title>Linear Time Subsequence and Supersequence Regex Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well-known that checking whether a given string $w$ matches a given regular expression $r$ can be done in quadratic time $O(|w|\cdot |r|)$ and that this cannot be improved to a truly subquadratic running time of $O((|w|\cdot |r|)^{1-\epsilon})$ assuming the strong exponential time hypothesis (SETH). We study a different matching paradigm where we ask instead whether $w$ has a subsequence that matches $r$, and show that regex matching in this sense can be solved in linear time $O(|w| + |r|)$. Further, the same holds if we ask for a supersequence. We show that the quantitative variants where we want to compute a longest or shortest subsequence or supersequence of $w$ that matches $r$ can be solved in $O(|w| \cdot |r|)$, i. e., asymptotically no worse than classical regex matching; and we show that $O(|w| + |r|)$ is conditionally not possible for these problems. We also investigate these questions with respect to other natural string relations like the infix, prefix, left-extension or extension relation instead of the subsequence and supersequence relation. We further study the complexity of the universal problem where we ask if all subsequences (or supersequences, infixes, prefixes, left-extensions or extensions) of an input string satisfy a given regular expression.</description>

      <title>Compositional Active Learning of Synchronous Systems through Automated Alphabet Refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active automata learning infers automaton models of systems from behavioral observations, a technique successfully applied to a wide range of domains. Compositional approaches for concurrent systems have recently emerged. We take a significant step beyond available results, including those by the authors, and develop a general technique for compositional learning of a synchronizing parallel system with an unknown decomposition. Our approach automatically refines the global alphabet into component alphabets while learning the component models. We develop a theoretical treatment of distributions of alphabets, i.e., sets of possibly overlapping component alphabets. We characterize counter-examples that reveal inconsistencies with global observations, and show how to systematically update the distribution to restore consistency. We present a compositional learning algorithm implementing these ideas, where learning counterexamples precisely correspond to distribution counterexamples under well-defined conditions. We provide an implementation, called CoalA, using the state-of-the-art active learning library LearnLib. Our experiments show that in more than 630 subject systems, CoalA delivers orders of magnitude improvements (up to five orders) in membership queries and in systems with significant concurrency, it also achieves better scalability in the number of equivalence queries.</description>

      <title>Decidability Problems for Micro-Stipula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Micro-Stipula is a stateful calculus in which clauses can be activated either through interactions with the external environment or by the evaluation of time expressions. Despite the apparent simplicity of its syntax and operational model, the combination of state evolution, time reasoning, and nondeterminism gives rise to significant analytical challenges. In particular, we show that determining whether a clause is never executed is undecidable. We formally prove that this undecidability result holds even for syntactically restricted fragments: namely, the time-ahead fragment, where all time expressions are strictly positive, and the instantaneous fragment, where all time expressions evaluate to zero. On the other hand, we identify a decidable subfragment: within the instantaneous fragment, reachability becomes decidable when the initial states of functions and events are disjoint.</description>
