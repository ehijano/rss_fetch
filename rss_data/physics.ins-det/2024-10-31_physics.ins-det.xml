      <title>Efficient noble gas purification using hot getters and gas circulation by convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Noble gas radiation detectors with optical readout are gaining popularity in fields like astrophysics and particle physics due to their ability to produce both ionization and scintillation signals in response to ionizing radiation interaction. In addition, the amplification of primary ionization signals can be achieved by promoting secondary scintillation in the gas. Noble gas purity, especially concerning impurities like H$_{2}$O, N$_{2}$, O$_{2}$, CO$_{2}$, and hydrocarbons, greatly influences its performance. These impurities can cause the loss of primary electrons and quench the scintillation signal. A very high purity level of the gas is required. In the early 90's, a simple method was developed for noble gas purification in sealed, small volume (up to few litters) gas radiation detectors. Gas purification is achieved promoting gas circulation through Zr-based hot getters, simply maintaining the gas circulation by convection. The effectiveness of this method has been only confirmed by the energy resolutions achieved in those detectors, which were similar to that achieved in other high-performance noble gas detectors. In this work, we used waveform analysis of the primary and secondary scintillation signals and we were able to evaluate the impact of the attachment and quenching caused by impurities in one of our detectors filled with pure Xe, and estimate upper values for the impurity content in the gas. The maximum overall impurity concentration was estimated to be below 4 ppm, considering nearly all the impurities, and below 82 ppm if N$_{2}$ is considered. The electron lifetime was measured to be 2.1 $\pm$ 0.1 ms, in line with those achieved in other high-performance optical detectors.</description>

      <title>The Auger-Meitner Radioisotope Microscope: an instrument for characterization of Auger electron multiplicities and energy distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe a new instrument, the Argonne Auger-Meitner Radioisotope Microscope (ARM), capable of characterizing the Auger-Meitner electron emission of radionuclides, including candidates relevant in nuclear medicine. Our approach relies on event-by-event coincidence ion, electron time-of-flight and spatial readout measurement to determine correlated electron multiplicity and energy distributions of Auger-Meitner decays. We present a proof-of-principle measurement with the ARM using X-ray photoionization of stable krypton beyond the K-edge and identify a bifurcation in the electron multiplicity distribution depending on the emission of K-LX electrons. Extension of the ARM to the characterization of radioactive sources of Auger-Meitner electron emissions is enabled by the combination of two recent developments: (1) cryogenic buffer gas beam technology, which enables well-defined initial conditions, gas-phase, high activity introduction of Auger-Meitner emitters into the detection region, and (2) large-area micro-channel plate detectors with multi-hit detection capabilities, which enables the simultaneous detection of many electrons emitted in a single decay.
  The ARM will generate new experimental data on Auger-Meitner multiplicities that can be used to benchmark atomic relaxation and decay models. As the multiplicities are binned by energy, this data will provide insight into the low-energy regime of Auger-Meitner electrons where intensity calculations are most challenging and experimental data is limited. In particular, accurate multiplicity data of the low-energy regime can be used to inform oncological dosimetry models, where electron energies less than 500 eV are known to be effective in damaging DNA and cell membranes.</description>

      <title>A Low-Cost, Low-Power Media Converter Solution for Next-Generation Detector Readout Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High Energy Physics (HEP) data acquisition systems are often built from high-end FPGAs. As such systems scale in the HL-LHC era, severe under-utilization of FPGA transceivers can occur because front-end links prioritize radiation hardness and power consumption over raw data bandwidth. This work evaluates recently introduced low-power, low-cost FPGA devices as an alternative building block for future readout architectures. This study presents the implementation of a readout back-End on FPGA where the front-end protocol is based on the Low-Power GigaBit Transceiver (lpGBT) and the readout protocol is based on 10 Gigabit Ethernet, using the LHCb Run 4 RICH detector as a practical case study.</description>

      <title>Impact of extreme ultraviolet radiation on the scintillation of pure and xenon-doped liquid argon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Xenon-Argon Technology (X-ArT) collaboration presents a study on the dynamics of pure and xenon-doped liquid argon (LAr) scintillation. Using two types of silicon photomultipliers sensitive to different wavelength ranges, we identify a long-lived extreme ultraviolet (EUV) radiative component that enhances the light yield. This component is present in both pure and xenon-doped LAr, becoming more pronounced at higher xenon concentrations, where it complements the traditional collisional energy transfer process. To explain this mechanism, we develop a comprehensive model of the Xe-doped LAr scintillation process that integrates both collisional and radiative contributions. Additionally, we investigate how xenon doping affects LAr scintillation light yield and pulse shape discrimination. Finally, we hypothesize that the EUV component may explain the emission of spurious electrons, a known challenge in light dark matter searches using noble liquids. By characterizing the scintillation dynamics in Xe-doped LAr, identifying the long-lived EUV component, and exploring the potential origin of spurious electrons, this work lays the groundwork for optimizing detector performance and advancing the design and sensitivity of future noble liquids particle detectors.</description>

      <title>Conditioned quantum-assisted deep generative surrogate for particle-calorimeter interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Particle collisions at accelerators such as the Large Hadron Collider, recorded and analyzed by experiments such as ATLAS and CMS, enable exquisite measurements of the Standard Model and searches for new phenomena. Simulations of collision events at these detectors have played a pivotal role in shaping the design of future experiments and analyzing ongoing ones. However, the quest for accuracy in Large Hadron Collider (LHC) collisions comes at an imposing computational cost, with projections estimating the need for millions of CPU-years annually during the High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) run \cite{collaboration2022atlas}. Simulating a single LHC event with \textsc{Geant4} currently devours around 1000 CPU seconds, with simulations of the calorimeter subdetectors in particular imposing substantial computational demands \cite{rousseau2023experimental}. To address this challenge, we propose a conditioned quantum-assisted deep generative model. Our model integrates a conditioned variational autoencoder (VAE) on the exterior with a conditioned Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) in the latent space, providing enhanced expressiveness compared to conventional VAEs. The RBM nodes and connections are meticulously engineered to enable the use of qubits and couplers on D-Wave's Pegasus-structured \textit{Advantage} quantum annealer (QA) for sampling. We introduce a novel method for conditioning the quantum-assisted RBM using \textit{flux biases}. We further propose a novel adaptive mapping to estimate the effective inverse temperature in quantum annealers. The effectiveness of our framework is illustrated using Dataset 2 of the CaloChallenge \cite{calochallenge}.</description>

      <title>FIEVel: A Fast InExpensive Velocimeter based on an optical mouse sensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fluid velocimetry is fundamental to a breadth of applications spanning academia and industry, however velocimetry at high temporal resolution is often prohibitively costly. Here, we introduce a Fast and InExpensive Velocimeter (FIEVel) based on an optical mouse sensor. At its core, the optical mouse sensor consists of a small pixel array that acquires image data at high rates, with onboard hardware to compute and output motion in two orthogonal axes directly. By adapting this widely available integrated circuit to fluid velocimetry, we demonstrate that FIEVel is capable of resolving two components of velocity non-intrusively in the bulk of a flowing fluid at rates up to 6.4 kHz, at orders of magnitude lower cost than traditional velocimetry devices. We demonstrate and validate the velocimeter across a range of flows, operating conditions, and illumination strategies. As a sample application, we measure the temporal spectrum of a grid-generated turbulent flow and show excellent agreement with traditional Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) using a high-speed camera.</description>

      <title>HGPflow: Extending Hypergraph Particle Flow to Collider Event Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In high energy physics, the ability to reconstruct particles based on their detector signatures is essential for downstream data analyses. A particle reconstruction algorithm based on learning hypergraphs (HGPflow) has previously been explored in the context of single jets. In this paper, we expand the scope to full proton-proton and electron-positron collision events and study reconstruction quality using metrics at the particle, jet, and event levels. Rather than operating on the entire event in a single pass, we train HGPflow on smaller partitions to avoid potentially learning long-range correlations related to the physics process. We demonstrate that this approach is feasible and that on most metrics, HGPflow outperforms both traditional particle flow algorithms and a machine learning-based benchmark model.</description>

      <title>Analysis of reactor burnup simulation uncertainties for antineutrino spectrum prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12540v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nuclear reactors are a source of electron antineutrinos due to the presence of unstable fission products that undergo $\beta^-$ decay. They will be exploited by the JUNO experiment to determine the neutrino mass ordering and to get very precise measurements of the neutrino oscillation parameters. This requires the reactor antineutrino spectrum to be characterized as precisely as possible both through high resolution measurements, as foreseen by the TAO experiment, and detailed simulation models. In this paper we present a benchmark analysis utilizing Serpent Monte Carlo simulations in comparison with real pressurized water reactor spent fuel data. Our objective is to study the accuracy of fission fraction predictions as a function of different reactor simulation approximations. Then, utilizing the BetaShape software, we construct fissile antineutrino spectra using the summation method, thereby assessing the influence of simulation uncertainties on reactor antineutrino spectrum.</description>

      <title>Time performance of Analog Pixel Test Structures with in-chip operational amplifier implemented in 65 nm CMOS imaging process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18528v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the context of the CERN EP R&amp;D on monolithic sensors and the ALICE ITS3 upgrade, the Tower Partners Semiconductor Co (TPSCo) 65 nm process has been qualified for use in high energy physics, and adopted for the ALICE ITS3 upgrade. An Analog Pixel Test Structure (APTS) featuring fast per pixel operational-amplifier-based buffering for a small matrix of four by four pixels, with a sensor with a small collection electrode and a very non-uniform electric field, was designed to allow detailed characterization of the pixel performance in this technology. Several variants of this chip with different pixel designs have been characterized with a (120 GeV/$c$) positive hadron beam. This result indicates that the APTS-OA prototype variants with the best performance achieve a time resolution of 63 ps with a detection efficiency exceeding 99% and a spatial resolution of 2 $\mu$m, highlighting the potential of TPSCo 65nm CMOS imaging technology for high-energy physics and other fields requiring precise time measurement, high detection efficiency, and excellent spatial resolution.</description>

      <title>White Paper on Light Sterile Neutrino Searches and Related Phenomenology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.07323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.07323v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This white paper provides a comprehensive review of our present understanding of experimental neutrino anomalies that remain unresolved, charting the progress achieved over the last decade at the experimental and phenomenological level, and sets the stage for future programmatic prospects in addressing those anomalies. It is purposed to serve as a guiding and motivational "encyclopedic" reference, with emphasis on needs and options for future exploration that may lead to the ultimate resolution of the anomalies. We see the main experimental, analysis, and theory-driven thrusts that will be essential to achieving this goal being: 1) Cover all anomaly sectors -- given the unresolved nature of all four canonical anomalies, it is imperative to support all pillars of a diverse experimental portfolio, source, reactor, decay-at-rest, decay-in-flight, and other methods/sources, to provide complementary probes of and increased precision for new physics explanations; 2) Pursue diverse signatures -- it is imperative that experiments make design and analysis choices that maximize sensitivity to as broad an array of these potential new physics signatures as possible; 3) Deepen theoretical engagement -- priority in the theory community should be placed on development of standard and beyond standard models relevant to all four short-baseline anomalies and the development of tools for efficient tests of these models with existing and future experimental datasets; 4) Openly share data -- Fluid communication between the experimental and theory communities will be required, which implies that both experimental data releases and theoretical calculations should be publicly available; and 5) Apply robust analysis techniques -- Appropriate statistical treatment is crucial to assess the compatibility of data sets within the context of any given model.</description>

Abstract: For decades since the development of phase-contrast optical microscopy, an analogous approach has been sought for maximizing the image contrast of weakly-scattering objects in transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The recent development of the laser phase plate (LPP) has demonstrated that an amplified, focused laser standing wave provides stable, tunable phase shift to the high-energy electron beam, achieving phase-contrast TEM. Building on proof-of-concept experimental demonstrations, this paper explores design improvements tailored to biological imaging. In particular, we introduce the approach of crossed laser phase plates (XLPP): two laser standing waves intersecting in the diffraction plane of the TEM, rather than a single beam as in the current LPP. We provide a theoretical model for the XLPP inside the microscope and use simulations to quantify its effect on image formation. We find that the XLPP increases information transfer at low spatial frequencies while also suppressing the ghost images formed by Kapitza-Dirac diffraction of the electron beam by the laser beam. We also demonstrate a simple acquisition scheme, enabled by the XLPP, which dramatically suppresses unwanted diffraction effects. The results of this study chart the course for future developments of LPP hardware.</description>
