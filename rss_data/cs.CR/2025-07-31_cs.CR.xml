      <title>Fine-Grained Privacy Extraction from Retrieval-Augmented Generation Systems via Knowledge Asymmetry Exploitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems enhance large language models (LLMs) by integrating external knowledge bases, but this advancement introduces significant privacy risks. Existing privacy attacks on RAG systems can trigger data leakage but often fail to accurately isolate knowledge-base-derived sentences within mixed responses. They also lack robustness when applied across multiple domains. This paper addresses these challenges by presenting a novel black-box attack framework that exploits knowledge asymmetry between RAG and standard LLMs to achieve fine-grained privacy extraction across heterogeneous knowledge landscapes. We propose a chain-of-thought reasoning strategy that creates adaptive prompts to steer RAG systems away from sensitive content. Specifically, we first decompose adversarial queries to maximize information disparity and then apply a semantic relationship scoring to resolve lexical and syntactic ambiguities. We finally train a neural network on these feature scores to precisely identify sentences containing private information. Unlike prior work, our framework generalizes to unseen domains through iterative refinement without pre-defined knowledge. Experimental results show that we achieve over 91% privacy extraction rate in single-domain and 83% in multi-domain scenarios, reducing sensitive sentence exposure by over 65% in case studies. This work bridges the gap between attack and defense in RAG systems, enabling precise extraction of private information while providing a foundation for adaptive mitigation.</description>

      <title>Counterfactual Evaluation for Blind Attack Detection in LLM-based Evaluation Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates defenses for LLM-based evaluation systems against prompt injection. We formalize a class of threats called blind attacks, where a candidate answer is crafted independently of the true answer to deceive the evaluator. To counter such attacks, we propose a framework that augments Standard Evaluation (SE) with Counterfactual Evaluation (CFE), which re-evaluates the submission against a deliberately false ground-truth answer. An attack is detected if the system validates an answer under both standard and counterfactual conditions. Experiments show that while standard evaluation is highly vulnerable, our SE+CFE framework significantly improves security by boosting attack detection with minimal performance trade-offs.</description>

      <title>LLM-Based Identification of Infostealer Infection Vectors from Screenshots: The Case of Aurora</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Infostealers exfiltrate credentials, session cookies, and sensitive data from infected systems. With over 29 million stealer logs reported in 2024, manual analysis and mitigation at scale are virtually unfeasible/unpractical. While most research focuses on proactive malware detection, a significant gap remains in leveraging reactive analysis of stealer logs and their associated artifacts. Specifically, infection artifacts such as screenshots, image captured at the point of compromise, are largely overlooked by the current literature. This paper introduces a novel approach leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), more specifically gpt-4o-mini, to analyze infection screenshots to extract potential Indicators of Compromise (IoCs), map infection vectors, and track campaigns. Focusing on the Aurora infostealer, we demonstrate how LLMs can process screenshots to identify infection vectors, such as malicious URLs, installer files, and exploited software themes. Our method extracted 337 actionable URLs and 246 relevant files from 1000 screenshots, revealing key malware distribution methods and social engineering tactics. By correlating extracted filenames, URLs, and infection themes, we identified three distinct malware campaigns, demonstrating the potential of LLM-driven analysis for uncovering infection workflows and enhancing threat intelligence. By shifting malware analysis from traditional log-based detection methods to a reactive, artifact-driven approach that leverages infection screenshots, this research presents a scalable method for identifying infection vectors and enabling early intervention.</description>

      <title>Polynomial Lattices for the BIKE Cryptosystem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce a rank $2$ lattice over a polynomial ring arising from the public key of the BIKE cryptosystem \cite{aragon2022bike}. The secret key is a sparse vector in this lattice. We study properties of this lattice and generalize the recovery of weak keys from \cite{BardetDLO16}. In particular, we show that they implicitly solved a shortest vector problem in the lattice we constructed. Rather than finding only a shortest vector, we obtain a reduced basis of the lattice which makes it possible to check for more weak keys.</description>

      <title>Noise-Coded Illumination for Forensic and Photometric Video Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The proliferation of advanced tools for manipulating video has led to an arms race, pitting those who wish to sow disinformation against those who want to detect and expose it. Unfortunately, time favors the ill-intentioned in this race, with fake videos growing increasingly difficult to distinguish from real ones. At the root of this trend is a fundamental advantage held by those manipulating media: equal access to a distribution of what we consider authentic (i.e., "natural") video. In this paper, we show how coding very subtle, noise-like modulations into the illumination of a scene can help combat this advantage by creating an information asymmetry that favors verification. Our approach effectively adds a temporal watermark to any video recorded under coded illumination. However, rather than encoding a specific message, this watermark encodes an image of the unmanipulated scene as it would appear lit only by the coded illumination. We show that even when an adversary knows that our technique is being used, creating a plausible coded fake video amounts to solving a second, more difficult version of the original adversarial content creation problem at an information disadvantage. This is a promising avenue for protecting high-stakes settings like public events and interviews, where the content on display is a likely target for manipulation, and while the illumination can be controlled, the cameras capturing video cannot.</description>

      <title>Scalable contribution bounding to achieve privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In modern datasets, where single records can have multiple owners, enforcing user-level differential privacy requires capping each user's total contribution. This "contribution bounding" becomes a significant combinatorial challenge. Existing sequential algorithms for this task are computationally intensive and do not scale to the massive datasets prevalent today. To address this scalability bottleneck, we propose a novel and efficient distributed algorithm. Our approach models the complex ownership structure as a hypergraph, where users are vertices and records are hyperedges. The algorithm proceeds in rounds, allowing users to propose records in parallel. A record is added to the final dataset only if all its owners unanimously agree, thereby ensuring that no user's predefined contribution limit is violated. This method aims to maximize the size of the resulting dataset for high utility while providing a practical, scalable solution for implementing user-level privacy in large, real-world systems.</description>

      <title>Medical Image De-Identification Benchmark Challenge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The de-identification (deID) of protected health information (PHI) and personally identifiable information (PII) is a fundamental requirement for sharing medical images, particularly through public repositories, to ensure compliance with patient privacy laws. In addition, preservation of non-PHI metadata to inform and enable downstream development of imaging artificial intelligence (AI) is an important consideration in biomedical research. The goal of MIDI-B was to provide a standardized platform for benchmarking of DICOM image deID tools based on a set of rules conformant to the HIPAA Safe Harbor regulation, the DICOM Attribute Confidentiality Profiles, and best practices in preservation of research-critical metadata, as defined by The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA). The challenge employed a large, diverse, multi-center, and multi-modality set of real de-identified radiology images with synthetic PHI/PII inserted.
  The MIDI-B Challenge consisted of three phases: training, validation, and test. Eighty individuals registered for the challenge. In the training phase, we encouraged participants to tune their algorithms using their in-house or public data. The validation and test phases utilized the DICOM images containing synthetic identifiers (of 216 and 322 subjects, respectively). Ten teams successfully completed the test phase of the challenge. To measure success of a rule-based approach to image deID, scores were computed as the percentage of correct actions from the total number of required actions. The scores ranged from 97.91% to 99.93%. Participants employed a variety of open-source and proprietary tools with customized configurations, large language models, and optical character recognition (OCR). In this paper we provide a comprehensive report on the MIDI-B Challenge's design, implementation, results, and lessons learned.</description>

      <title>An Inversion-based Measure of Memorization for Diffusion Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05846v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The past few years have witnessed substantial advances in image generation powered by diffusion models. However, it was shown that diffusion models are susceptible to training data memorization, raising significant concerns regarding copyright infringement and privacy invasion. This study delves into a rigorous analysis of memorization in diffusion models. We introduce InvMM, an inversion-based measure of memorization, which is based on inverting a sensitive latent noise distribution accounting for the replication of an image. For accurate estimation of the measure, we propose an adaptive algorithm that balances the normality and sensitivity of the noise distribution. Comprehensive experiments across four datasets, conducted on both unconditional and text-guided diffusion models, demonstrate that InvMM provides a reliable and complete quantification of memorization. Notably, InvMM is commensurable between samples, reveals the true extent of memorization from an adversarial standpoint and implies how memorization differs from membership. In practice, it serves as an auditing tool for developers to reliably assess the risk of memorization, thereby contributing to the enhancement of trustworthiness and privacy-preserving capabilities of diffusion models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13156v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a decentralised autonomous organisation (DAO) model that uses non-fungible tokens (NFTs) for identity management and privacy-preserving interactions within a Punishment not Reward (PnR) blockchain mechanism. The proposed model introduces a dual NFT architecture deployed on Layer 2 networks: Membership NFTs (\(NFT_{auth}\)) for authentication and access control and interaction NFTs (\(NFT_{priv}\)) for private interactions among participants. Our Layer 2 implementation achieves 97\% gas cost reduction while maintaining security through cross-chain mechanisms. The identity management system incorporates decentralised KYC processes and Sybil attack resistance using soulbound token characteristics. Governance operates through smart contracts that manage reputation and administer punitive measures, including conditional identity disclosure for forensic purposes. Governance operates through smart contracts that manage reputation and administer punitive measures, including conditional identity disclosure when misconduct is detected.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05997v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel approach to gaining insight into the structure of cryptographic migration problems which are classic problems in applied cryptography. We use a formal model to capture the inherent dependencies and complexities of such transitions. Using classical mathematical results from combinatorics, probability theory, and combinatorial analysis, we evaluate the challenges of migrating large cryptographic IT infrastructures and prove that - in a suitable sense - cryptographic migration exhibits a certain expected complexity. We also provide numerical data for selected parameter sets. Furthermore, we analyze the proposed model in terms of real-world patterns and its practical applicability. Additionally, we discuss the challenges of modeling real-world migration projects. As concrete examples we examine the transition to post-quantum cryptography of the CI/CD system GitLab and the multi-level technological transition of distribution power grids. This work paves the way for future advancements in both the theoretical understanding and practical implementation of cryptographic migration strategies.</description>

Abstract: The syndrome decoding problem is one of the NP-complete problems lying at the foundation of code-based cryptography. The variant thereof where the distance between vectors is measured with respect to the Lee metric, rather than the more commonly used Hamming metric, has been analyzed recently in several works due to its potential relevance for building more efficient code-based cryptosystems. The purpose of this article is to present a zero-knowledge proof of knowledge for this variant of the problem.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Modeling of Jailbreak on Multimodal LLMs: From Quantification to Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06989v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated their superior ability in understanding multimodal content. However, they remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, which exploit weaknesses in their safety alignment to generate harmful responses. Previous studies categorize jailbreaks as successful or failed based on whether responses contain malicious content. However, given the stochastic nature of MLLM responses, this binary classification of an input's ability to jailbreak MLLMs is inappropriate. Derived from this viewpoint, we introduce jailbreak probability to quantify the jailbreak potential of an input, which represents the likelihood that MLLMs generated a malicious response when prompted with this input. We approximate this probability through multiple queries to MLLMs. After modeling the relationship between input hidden states and their corresponding jailbreak probability using Jailbreak Probability Prediction Network (JPPN), we use continuous jailbreak probability for optimization. Specifically, we propose Jailbreak-Probability-based Attack (JPA) that optimizes adversarial perturbations on input image to maximize jailbreak probability, and further enhance it as Multimodal JPA (MJPA) by including monotonic text rephrasing. To counteract attacks, we also propose Jailbreak-Probability-based Finetuning (JPF), which minimizes jailbreak probability through MLLM parameter updates. Extensive experiments show that (1) (M)JPA yields significant improvements when attacking a wide range of models under both white and black box settings. (2) JPF vastly reduces jailbreaks by at most over 60\%. Both of the above results demonstrate the significance of introducing jailbreak probability to make nuanced distinctions among input jailbreak abilities.</description>

      <title>CEE: An Inference-Time Jailbreak Defense for Embodied Intelligence via Subspace Concept Rotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13201v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly becoming the cognitive core of Embodied Intelligence (EI) systems, such as robots and autonomous vehicles. However, this integration also exposes them to serious jailbreak risks, where malicious instructions can be transformed into dangerous physical actions. Existing defense mechanisms suffer from notable drawbacks--including high training costs, significant inference delays, and complex hyperparameter tuning--which limit their practical applicability. To address these challenges, we propose a novel and efficient inference-time defense framework: Concept Enhancement Engineering (CEE). CEE enhances the model's inherent safety mechanisms by directly manipulating its internal representations, requiring neither additional training nor external modules, thereby improving defense efficiency. Furthermore, CEE introduces a rotation-based control mechanism that enables stable and linearly tunable behavioral control of the model. This design eliminates the need for tedious manual tuning and avoids the output degradation issues commonly observed in other representation engineering methods. Extensive experiments across multiple EI safety benchmarks and diverse attack scenarios demonstrate that CEE significantly improves the defense success rates of various multimodal LLMs. It effectively mitigates safety risks while preserving high-quality generation and inference efficiency, offering a promising solution for deploying safer embodied intelligence systems.</description>

      <title>Graph Representation-based Model Poisoning on Federated Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01694v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Federated large language models (FedLLMs) enable powerful generative capabilities within wireless networks while preserving data privacy. Nonetheless, FedLLMs remain vulnerable to model poisoning attacks. This article first reviews recent advancements in model poisoning techniques and existing defense mechanisms for FedLLMs, underscoring critical limitations, especially when dealing with non-IID textual data distributions. Current defense strategies predominantly employ distance or similarity-based outlier detection mechanisms, relying on the assumption that malicious updates markedly differ from benign statistical patterns. However, this assumption becomes inadequate against adaptive adversaries targeting billion-parameter LLMs. The article further investigates graph representation-based model poisoning (GRMP), an emerging attack paradigm that exploits higher-order correlations among benign client gradients to craft malicious updates indistinguishable from legitimate ones. GRMP can effectively circumvent advanced defense systems, causing substantial degradation in model accuracy and overall performance. Moreover, the article outlines a forward-looking research roadmap that emphasizes the necessity of graph-aware secure aggregation methods, specialized vulnerability metrics tailored for FedLLMs, and evaluation frameworks to enhance the robustness of federated language model deployments.</description>

      <title>White-Basilisk: A Hybrid Model for Code Vulnerability Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08540v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The proliferation of software vulnerabilities presents a significant challenge to cybersecurity, necessitating more effective detection methodologies. We introduce White-Basilisk, a novel approach to vulnerability detection that demonstrates superior performance while challenging prevailing assumptions in AI model scaling. Utilizing an innovative architecture that integrates Mamba layers, linear self-attention, and a Mixture of Experts framework, White-Basilisk achieves state-of-the-art results in vulnerability detection tasks with a parameter count of only 200M. The model's capacity to process sequences of unprecedented length enables comprehensive analysis of extensive codebases in a single pass, surpassing the context limitations of current Large Language Models (LLMs). White-Basilisk exhibits robust performance on imbalanced, real-world datasets, while maintaining computational efficiency that facilitates deployment across diverse organizational scales. This research not only establishes new benchmarks in code security but also provides empirical evidence that compact, efficiently designed models can outperform larger counterparts in specialized tasks, potentially redefining optimization strategies in AI development for domain-specific applications.</description>

      <title>PurpCode: Reasoning for Safer Code Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19060v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce PurpCode, the first post-training recipe for training safe code reasoning models towards generating secure code and defending against malicious cyberactivities. PurpCode trains a reasoning model in two stages: (i) Rule Learning, which explicitly teaches the model to reference cybersafety rules to generate vulnerability-free code and to avoid facilitating malicious cyberactivities; and (ii) Reinforcement Learning, which optimizes model safety and preserves model utility through diverse, multi-objective reward mechanisms. To empower the training pipelines with comprehensive cybersafety data, we conduct internal red-teaming to synthesize comprehensive and high-coverage prompts based on real-world tasks for inducing unsafe cyberactivities in the model. Based on PurpCode, we develop a reasoning-based coding model, namely PurpCode-32B, which demonstrates state-of-the-art cybersafety, outperforming various frontier models. Meanwhile, our alignment method decreases the model overrefusal rates in both general and cybersafety-specific scenarios, while preserving model utility in both code generation and common security knowledge.</description>

      <title>Toward Integrated Solutions: A Systematic Interdisciplinary Review of Cybergrooming Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05727v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cybergrooming exploits minors through online trust-building, yet research remains fragmented, limiting holistic prevention. Social sciences focus on behavioral insights, while computational methods emphasize detection, but their integration remains insufficient. This review systematically synthesizes both fields using the PRISMA framework to enhance clarity, reproducibility, and cross-disciplinary collaboration. Findings show that qualitative methods offer deep insights but are resource-intensive, machine learning models depend on data quality, and standard metrics struggle with imbalance and cultural nuances. By bridging these gaps, this review advances interdisciplinary cybergrooming research, guiding future efforts toward more effective prevention and detection strategies.</description>
