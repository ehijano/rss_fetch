      <title>Parameterized Algorithms for Coordinated Motion Planning: Minimizing Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the parameterized complexity of a generalization of the coordinated motion planning problem on graphs, where the goal is to route a specified subset of a given set of $k$ robots to their destinations with the aim of minimizing the total energy (i.e., the total length traveled). We develop novel techniques to push beyond previously-established results that were restricted to solid grids.
  We design a fixed-parameter additive approximation algorithm for this problem parameterized by $k$ alone. This result, which is of independent interest, allows us to prove the following two results pertaining to well-studied coordinated motion planning problems: (1) A fixed-parameter algorithm, parameterized by $k$, for routing a single robot to its destination while avoiding the other robots, which is related to the famous Rush-Hour Puzzle; and (2) a fixed-parameter algorithm, parameterized by $k$ plus the treewidth of the input graph, for the standard \textsc{Coordinated Motion Planning} (CMP) problem in which we need to route all the $k$ robots to their destinations. The latter of these results implies, among others, the fixed-parameter tractability of CMP parameterized by $k$ on graphs of bounded outerplanarity, which include bounded-height subgrids.
  We complement the above results with a lower bound which rules out the fixed-parameter tractability for CMP when parameterized by the total energy. This contrasts the recently-obtained tractability of the problem on solid grids under the same parameterization. As our final result, we strengthen the aforementioned fixed-parameter tractability to hold not only on solid grids but all graphs of bounded local treewidth -- a class including, among others, all graphs of bounded genus.</description>

      <title>Detecting Disjoint Shortest Paths in Linear Time and More</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the $k$-Disjoint Shortest Paths ($k$-DSP) problem, we are given a weighted graph $G$ on $n$ nodes and $m$ edges with specified source vertices $s_1, \dots, s_k$, and target vertices $t_1, \dots, t_k$, and are tasked with determining if $G$ contains vertex-disjoint $(s_i,t_i)$-shortest paths. For any constant $k$, it is known that $k$-DSP can be solved in polynomial time over undirected graphs and directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). However, the exact time complexity of $k$-DSP remains mysterious, with large gaps between the fastest known algorithms and best conditional lower bounds. In this paper, we obtain faster algorithms for important cases of $k$-DSP, and present better conditional lower bounds for $k$-DSP and its variants.
  Previous work solved 2-DSP over weighted undirected graphs in $O(n^7)$ time, and weighted DAGs in $O(mn)$ time. For the main result of this paper, we present linear time algorithms for solving 2-DSP on weighted undirected graphs and DAGs. Our algorithms are algebraic however, and so only solve the detection rather than search version of 2-DSP.
  For lower bounds, prior work implied that $k$-Clique can be reduced to $2k$-DSP in DAGs and undirected graphs with $O((kn)^2)$ nodes. We improve this reduction, by showing how to reduce from $k$-Clique to $k$-DSP in DAGs and undirected graphs with $O((kn)^2)$ nodes. A variant of $k$-DSP is the $k$-Disjoint Paths ($k$-DP) problem, where the solution paths no longer need to be shortest paths. Previous work reduced from $k$-Clique to $p$-DP in DAGs with $O(kn)$ nodes, for $p= k + k(k-1)/2$. We improve this by showing a reduction from $k$-Clique to $p$-DP, for $p=k + \lfloor k^2/4\rfloor$. Under the $k$-Clique Hypothesis from fine-grained complexity, our results establish better conditional lower bounds for $k$-DSP for all $k\ge 4$, and better conditional lower bounds for $p$-DP for all $p\le 4031$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2009.12753v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This is a simplification of a previous version of this ArXiv note. We present an example of a function $f$ from $\{-1,1\}^n$ to the unit sphere in $\mathbb{C}$ with influence bounded by $1$ and entropy of $|\hat f|^2$ larger than $\frac12\log n$.</description>

      <title>Limit Laws for Critical Dispersion on Complete Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05372v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a synchronous process of particles moving on the vertices of a graph $G$, introduced by Cooper, McDowell, Radzik, Rivera and Shiraga (2018). Initially, $M$ particles are placed on a vertex of $G$. In subsequent time steps, all particles that are located on a vertex inhabited by at least two particles jump independently to a neighbour chosen uniformly at random. The process ends at the first step when no vertex is inhabited by more than one particle; we call this (random) time step the dispersion time.
  In this work we study the case where $G$ is the complete graph on $n$ vertices and the number of particles is $M=n/2+\alpha n^{1/2} + o(n^{1/2})$, $\alpha\in \mathbb{R}$. This choice of $M$ corresponds to the critical window of the process, with respect to the dispersion time. We show that the dispersion time, if rescaled by $n^{-1/2}$, converges in $p$-th mean, as $n\rightarrow \infty$ and for any $p \in \mathbb{R}$, to a continuous and almost surely positive random variable $T_\alpha$. We find that $T_\alpha$ is the absorption time of a standard logistic branching process, thoroughly investigated by Lambert (2005), and we determine its expectation. In particular, in the middle of the critical window we show that $\mathbb{E}[T_0] = \pi^{3/2}/\sqrt{7}$, and furthermore we formulate explicit asymptotics when $|\alpha|$ gets large that quantify the transition into and out of the critical window. We also study the (random) total number of jumps that are performed by the particles until the dispersion time is reached. In particular, we prove that it centers around $\frac{2}{7}n\ln n$ and that it has variations linear in $n$, whose distribution we can describe explicitly.</description>
