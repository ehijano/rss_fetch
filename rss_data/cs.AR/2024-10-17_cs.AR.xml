      <title>MLPerf Power: Benchmarking the Energy Efficiency of Machine Learning Systems from {\mu}Watts to MWatts for Sustainable AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rapid adoption of machine learning (ML) technologies has led to a surge in power consumption across diverse systems, from tiny IoT devices to massive datacenter clusters. Benchmarking the energy efficiency of these systems is crucial for optimization, but presents novel challenges due to the variety of hardware platforms, workload characteristics, and system-level interactions. This paper introduces MLPerf Power, a comprehensive benchmarking methodology with capabilities to evaluate the energy efficiency of ML systems at power levels ranging from microwatts to megawatts. Developed by a consortium of industry professionals from more than 20 organizations, MLPerf Power establishes rules and best practices to ensure comparability across diverse architectures. We use representative workloads from the MLPerf benchmark suite to collect 1,841 reproducible measurements from 60 systems across the entire range of ML deployment scales. Our analysis reveals trade-offs between performance, complexity, and energy efficiency across this wide range of systems, providing actionable insights for designing optimized ML solutions from the smallest edge devices to the largest cloud infrastructures. This work emphasizes the importance of energy efficiency as a key metric in the evaluation and comparison of the ML system, laying the foundation for future research in this critical area. We discuss the implications for developing sustainable AI solutions and standardizing energy efficiency benchmarking for ML systems.</description>

      <title>COMET: Towards Partical W4A4KV4 LLMs Serving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantization is a widely-used compression technology to reduce the overhead of serving large language models (LLMs) on terminal devices and in cloud data centers. However, prevalent quantization methods, such as 8-bit weight-activation or 4-bit weight-only quantization, achieve limited performance improvements due to poor support for low-precision (e.g., 4-bit) activation. This work, for the first time, realizes practical W4A4KV4 serving for LLMs, fully utilizing the INT4 tensor cores on modern GPUs and reducing the memory bottleneck caused by the KV cache. Specifically, we propose a novel fine-grained mixed-precision quantization algorithm (FMPQ) that compresses most activations into 4-bit with negligible accuracy loss. To support mixed-precision matrix multiplication for W4A4 and W4A8, we develop a highly optimized W4Ax kernel. Our approach introduces a novel mixed-precision data layout to facilitate access and fast dequantization for activation and weight tensors, utilizing the GPU's software pipeline to hide the overhead of data loading and conversion. Additionally, we propose fine-grained streaming multiprocessor (SM) scheduling to achieve load balance across different SMs. We integrate the optimized W4Ax kernel into our inference framework, COMET, and provide efficient management to support popular LLMs such as LLaMA-3-70B. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that, when running LLaMA family models on a single A100-80G-SMX4, COMET achieves a kernel-level speedup of \textbf{$2.88\times$} over cuBLAS and a \textbf{$2.02 \times$} throughput improvement compared to TensorRT-LLM from an end-to-end framework perspective.</description>

      <title>An O(m+n)-Space Spatiotemporal Denoising Filter with Cache-Like Memories for Dynamic Vision Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic vision sensor (DVS) is novel neuromorphic imaging device that generates asynchronous events. Despite the high temporal resolution and high dynamic range features, DVS is faced with background noise problem. Spatiotemporal filter is an effective and hardware-friendly solution for DVS denoising but previous designs have large memory overhead or degraded performance issues. In this paper, we present a lightweight and real-time spatiotemporal denoising filter with set-associative cache-like memories, which has low space complexity of \text{O(m+n)} for DVS of $m\times n$ resolution. A two-stage pipeline for memory access with read cancellation feature is proposed to reduce power consumption. Further the bitwidth redundancy for event storage is exploited to minimize the memory footprint. We implemented our design on FPGA and experimental results show that it achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with previous spatiotemporal filters while maintaining low resource utilization and low power consumption of about 125mW to 210mW at 100MHz clock frequency.</description>

      <title>Toleo: Scaling Freshness to Tera-scale Memory using CXL and PIM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trusted hardware's freshness guarantee ensures that an adversary cannot replay an old value in response to a memory read request. They rely on maintaining a version number for each cache block and ensuring their integrity using a Merkle tree. However, these existing solutions protect only a small amount of main memory (few MBs), as the extraneous memory accesses to the Merkle tree increase prohibitively with the protected memory size. We present Toleo, which uses trusted smart memory connected through a secure CXL IDE network to safely store version numbers. Toleo eliminates the need for an unscalable Merkle tree to protect the integrity of version numbers by instead using smart memory as the root of trust. Additionally, Toleo ensures version confidentiality which enables stealth versions that reduce the version storage overhead in half.
  Furthermore, in the absence of Merkle tree imposed constraints, we effectively exploit version locality at page granularity to compress version number by a factor of 240. These space optimizations make it feasible for one 168 GB Toleo smart memory device to provide freshness to a 28 TB CXL-expanded main memory pool in a rack server for a negligible performance overhead. We analyze the benefits of Toleo using several privacy-sensitive genomics, graph, generative AI, and database workloads.</description>

      <title>Online Energy Optimization in GPUs: A Multi-Armed Bandit Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Energy consumption has become a critical design metric and a limiting factor in the development of future computing architectures, from small wearable devices to large-scale leadership computing facilities. The predominant methods in energy management optimization are focused on CPUs. However, GPUs are increasingly significant and account for the majority of energy consumption in heterogeneous high performance computing (HPC) systems. Moreover, they typically rely on either purely offline training or a hybrid of offline and online training, which are impractical and lead to energy loss during data collection. Therefore, this paper studies a novel and practical online energy optimization problem for GPUs in HPC scenarios. The problem is challenging due to the inherent performance-energy trade-offs of GPUs, the exploration &amp; exploitation dilemma across frequencies, and the lack of explicit performance counters in GPUs. To address these challenges, we formulate the online energy consumption optimization problem as a multi-armed bandit framework and develop a novel bandit based framework EnergyUCB. EnergyUCB is designed to dynamically adjust GPU core frequencies in real-time, reducing energy consumption with minimal impact on performance. Specifically, the proposed framework EnergyUCB (1) balances the performance-energy trade-off in the reward function, (2) effectively navigates the exploration &amp; exploitation dilemma when adjusting GPU core frequencies online, and (3) leverages the ratio of GPU core utilization to uncore utilization as a real-time GPU performance metric. Experiments on a wide range of real-world HPC benchmarks demonstrate that EnergyUCB can achieve substantial energy savings. The code of EnergyUCB is available at https://github.com/XiongxiaoXu/EnergyUCB-Bandit.</description>

      <title>Mixed-precision finite element kernels and assembly: Rounding error analysis and hardware acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we develop the first fine-grained rounding error analysis of finite element (FE) cell kernels and assembly. The theory includes mixed-precision implementations and accounts for hardware-acceleration via matrix multiplication units, thus providing theoretical guidance for designing reduced- and mixed-precision FE algorithms on CPUs and GPUs. Guided by this analysis, we introduce hardware-accelerated mixed-precision implementation strategies which are provably robust to low-precision computations. Indeed, these algorithms are accurate to the lower-precision unit roundoff with an error constant that is independent from: the conditioning of FE basis function evaluations, the ill-posedness of the cell, the polynomial degree, and the number of quadrature nodes. Consequently, we present the first AMX-accelerated FE kernel implementations on Intel Sapphire Rapids CPUs. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed mixed- (single/half-) precision algorithms are up to 60 times faster than their double precision equivalent while being orders of magnitude more accurate than their fully half-precision counterparts.</description>

      <title>A Mess of Memory System Benchmarking, Simulation and Application Profiling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10170v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Memory stress (Mess) framework provides a unified view of the memory system benchmarking, simulation and application profiling. The Mess benchmark provides a holistic and detailed memory system characterization. It is based on hundreds of measurements that are represented as a family of bandwidth--latency curves. The benchmark increases the coverage of all the previous tools and leads to new findings in the behavior of the actual and simulated memory systems. We deploy the Mess benchmark to characterize Intel, AMD, IBM, Fujitsu, Amazon and NVIDIA servers with DDR4, DDR5, HBM2 and HBM2E memory. The Mess memory simulator uses bandwidth--latency concept for the memory performance simulation. We integrate Mess with widely-used CPUs simulators enabling modeling of all high-end memory technologies. The Mess simulator is fast, easy to integrate and it closely matches the actual system performance. By design, it enables a quick adoption of new memory technologies in hardware simulators. Finally, the Mess application profiling positions the application in the bandwidth--latency space of the target memory system. This information can be correlated with other application runtime activities and the source code, leading to a better overall understanding of the application's behavior. The current Mess benchmark release covers all major CPU and GPU ISAs, x86, ARM, Power, RISC-V, and NVIDIA's PTX. We also release as open source the ZSim, gem5 and OpenPiton Metro-MPI integrated with the Mess simulator for DDR4, DDR5, Optane, HBM2, HBM2E and CXL memory expanders. The Mess application profiling is already integrated into a suite of production HPC performance analysis tools.</description>

      <title>Modeling Short-Range Microwave Networks to Scale Superconducting Quantum Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.08825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.08825v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A core challenge for superconducting quantum computers is to scale up the number of qubits in each processor without increasing noise or cross-talk. Distributed quantum computing across small qubit arrays, known as chiplets, can address these challenges in a scalable manner. We propose a chiplet architecture over microwave links with potential to exceed monolithic performance on near-term hardware. Our methods of modeling and evaluating the chiplet architecture bridges the physical and network layers in these processors. We find evidence that distributing computation across chiplets may reduce the overall error rates associated with moving data across the device, despite higher error figures for transfers across links. Preliminary analyses suggest that latency is not substantially impacted, and that at least some applications and architectures may avoid bottlenecks around chiplet boundaries. In the long-term, short-range networks may underlie quantum computers just as local area networks underlie classical datacenters and supercomputers today.</description>
