      <title>On minimizing cyclists' ascent times: Part II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate an optimization of a bicycle ascent time under the constraints of the average, maximum, and minimum powers. In contrast to the first part of this study, we do not restrict the departure to flying starts with an initial speed determined by the model and its optimization. We allow for various initial speeds, from a standstill to a launched start. We accomplish this by generalizing the discontinuous piecewise constant speed model to a continuous piecewise linear speed model. Regardless of the initial speed, steepness or profile of the ascent the optimal strategy tends to a constant ground speed, in agreement with the conclusion of the previous, more restricted, formulation. This new formulation allows us to compare various initial-speed strategies and, hence, has a direct application to competitive cycling. Notably, in timetrials composed of flat and steep sections, it helps one decide whether or not to change bicycle, which requires stopping and restarting, from one that is more appropriate for flats to one that is more appropriate for uphills.</description>

      <title>Time-reversal-symmetry bounds on electromagnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For linear electromagnetic systems possessing time-reversal symmetry, we present an approach to bound ratios of internal fields excited from different ports, using only the scattering matrix (S matrix), improving upon previous related bounds by Sounas and Al\`u (2017). By reciprocity, emitted-wave amplitudes from internal dipole sources are bounded in a similar way. When applied to coupled-resonant systems, our method constrains ratios of resonant coupling/decay coefficients. We also obtain a relation for the relative phase of fields excited from the two ports and the ratio of field intensities in a two-port system. In addition, although lossy systems do not have time-reversal symmetry, we can still approximately bound loss-induced non-unitarity of the S matrix using only the lossless S matrix. We show numerical validations of the near-tightness of our bounds in various scattering systems.</description>
