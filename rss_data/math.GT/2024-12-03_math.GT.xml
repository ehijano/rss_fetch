      <title>A Torres formula for twisted Reidemeister torsion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Torres formula, which relates the Alexander polynomial of a link to the Alexander polyomial of its sublinks, admits a generalization to the twisted setting due to Morifuji. This paper uses twisted Reidemeister torsion to obtain a second proof of Morifuji's result that is closer in appearance to Torres' original formula.</description>

      <title>Independence complexes of circle graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Independence complexes of circle graphs are purely combinatorial objects. However, when constructed from some diagram of a link $L$, they reveal topological properties of $L$, more specifically, of its Khovanov homology. We analyze the homotopy type of independence complexes of circle graphs, with a focus on those arising when the graph is bipartite. Moreover, we compute (real) extreme Khovanov homology of a $4$-strand pretzel knot using chord diagrams and independence complexes.</description>

      <title>Topological Representations of Free Numerical Semigroups via Iterated Torus Knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we will associate a family $\{K_1,\dots,K_l\}\subset \mathbb{S}^3$ of iterated torus knots to a given free numerical semigroup. We will describe the fundamental group of the knot complement of each knot of the family. Finally, we will show that all knots in the family have same Alexander polynomial and it coincides (up to a factor) with the Poincar\'e series of the free numerical semigroup. As a consequence, we will provide families of iterated torus knots with the same Alexander polynomial of an irreducible plane curve singularity but which are non-isotopic to its associated knot.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We determine the minimum dilatation $\delta_n$ among pseudo-Anosov braids with $n$ strands, for large enough values of $n$. This confirms a conjecture of Venzke that $\lim_{n \to \infty} \delta_n^n = (2+\sqrt{3})^2 \approx 13.928$. Together with previous work, this also solves the minimum dilatation problem on the $n$-punctured sphere, for all but $6$ values of $n$.</description>

      <title>The canonical lamination calibrated by a cohomology class</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a closed oriented Riemannian manifold of dimension $d$, and let $\rho \in H^{d - 1}(M, \mathbb R)$ have unit norm. We construct a lamination $\lambda_\rho$ whose leaves are exactly the minimal hypersurfaces which are calibrated by every calibration in $\rho$. The geometry of $\lambda_\rho$ is closely related to the the geometry of the unit ball of the stable norm on $H_{d - 1}(M, \mathbb R)$, and so we deduce several results constraining the geometry of the stable norm ball in terms of the topology of $M$. These results establish a close analogy between the stable norm on $H_{d - 1}(M, \mathbb R)$ and the earthquake norm on the tangent space to Teichm\"uller space.</description>

      <title>H\"older equivalence of a class of Bara\'nski carpets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of Lipschitz equivalence of fractals is a very active topic in recent years, but there are very few results on non-totally disconnected fractals. In this paper, we use a class of finite state automata, called feasible $\Sigma$-automata, to construct pseudo-metric spaces, and then apply them to the classification of self-affine sets. We first recall a notion of neighbor automaton, and we show that an neighbor automaton satisfying the finite type condition is a feasible $\Sigma$-automaton. Secondly, we construct a universal map to show that pseudo-metric spaces induced by different automata can be bi-Lipschitz equivalent. As an application, we obtain a rather general sufficient condition for Bara\'nski carpets to be Lipschitz equivalent.</description>

      <title>Relative simplicity of the universal coverings of transformation groups and Tsuboi's metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many transformation groups on manifolds are simple, but their universal coverings are not. In the present paper, we study the concept of relatively simple group, that is, a group with the maximum proper normal subgroup. We show that many examples of universal coverings of transformation groups are relatively simple, including the universal covering $\widetilde{\mathrm{Ham}}(M,\omega)$ of the group of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms of a closed symplectic manifold $(M,\omega)$.
  Tsuboi constructed a metric space $\mathcal{M}(G)$ for a simple group $G$. We generalize his construction to relatively simple groups, and study their large scale geometric structure. In particular, Tsuboi's metric space of $\widetilde{\mathrm{Ham}}(M, \omega)$ is not quasi-isometric to the half line for every closed symplectic manifold $(M,\omega)$.</description>

      <title>Minimal Submanifolds and Waists of Locally Symmetric Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the higher expansion properties of locally symmetric spaces, with a particular focus on octonionic hyperbolic manifolds. We show that codimension two minimal submanifolds of compact octonionic locally symmetric spaces must have large volume, at least linear in the volume of the ambient space. As a corollary we prove linear waist inequalities for octonionic hyperbolic manifolds in codimension two and construct the first locally symmetric examples of power-law systolic freedom. We also show that any codimension two submanifold of small volume can be homotoped to a lower dimensional set. We use this to prove that branched covers of octonionic hyperbolic manifolds are stable in the sense of Dinur-Meshulam and to establish a uniform lower bound on the non-abelian Cheeger constants of octonionic hyperbolic manifolds.
  In a more general setting, we prove that maps from locally symmetric spaces to low dimensional euclidean spaces admit fibers whose fundamental group has large exponent of growth. We show as a consequence that cocompact lattices in $SL_n(\mathbb{R})$ have property $ FA_{\lfloor n/8\rfloor-1}$: any action on a contractible $CAT(0)$ simplicial complex of dimension at most $ \lfloor n/8\rfloor -1$ has a global fixed point.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ends and end cohomology are powerful invariants for the study of noncompact spaces. We present a self-contained exposition of the topological theory of ends and prove novel extensions including the existence of an exhaustion of a proper map. We define reduced end cohomology as the relative end cohomology of a ray-based space. We use those results to prove a version of a theorem of King that computes the reduced end cohomology of an end sum of two manifolds. We include a complete proof of Freudenthal's fundamental theorem on the number of ends of a topological group, and we use our results on dimension-zero end cohomology to prove -- without using transfinite induction -- a theorem of N\"obeling on freeness of certain modules of continuous functions.</description>

      <title>Quasi-isometry classification of right-angled Artin groups II: several infinite out cases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.02372</link>
      <description>arXiv:1603.02372v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We are motivated by the question that for which class of right-angled Artin groups (RAAG's), the quasi-isometry classification coincides with commensurability classification. This is previously known for RAAG's with finite outer automorphism groups. In this paper, we identify two classes of RAAG's, where their outer automorphism groups are allowed to contain adjacent transvections and partial conjugations, hence infinite. If $G$ belongs to one of these classes, then any other RAAG $G'$ is quasi-isometric to $G$ if and only if $G'$ is commensurable to $G$. We also show that in this case, there exists an algorithm to determine whether two RAAG's are quasi-isometric by looking at their defining graphs. Compared to the finite out case, as well as the previous quasi-isometry rigidity results for symmetric spaces, thick Euclidean buildings and mapping class groups, the main issue we need to deal with here is the reconstruction map may not have nice properties as before, or may not even exist. We introduce a deformation argument, as well as techniques from cubulation to deal with this issue.</description>

      <title>Thick isotopy property and the mapping class groups of Heegaard splittings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2008.11548v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a necessary and sufficient condition for the fundamental group of the space of Heegaard splittings of an irreducible $3$-manifold to be finitely generated. The condition is exactly the conclusion of the thick isotopy lemma proved by Colding, Gabai and Ketover, which says that any isotopy of a Heegaard surface is achieved by a $1$-parameter family of surfaces with area bounded above by a universal constant and with some ``thickness property''. We also prove that a Heegaard splitting of a hyperbolic or spherical $3$-manifold satisfies the condition if it is topologically minimal (in the sense of Bachman) and its disk complex has finitely generated homotopy group. In conclusion, such a Heegaard splitting has finitely generated mapping class group.</description>

Abstract: A spatial surface is a compact surface embedded in the $3$-sphere. We assume that a spatial surface is oriented and that each connected component of a spatial surface is neither a disk nor without a boundary. A diagram of a spatial surface is a diagram of a spatial trivalent graph that is a spine of the spatial surface. In this paper, we introduce the notion of a groupoid rack, which is used for considering colorings for diagrams of spatial surfaces in order to obtain an invariant of spatial surfaces. Furthermore, we show that a groupoid rack has a universal property on colorings for diagrams of spatial surfaces.</description>

Abstract: We present a way to build hyperbolic spheres with conical singularities by gluing together simple building blocks. Our construction provides good control over the holonomy of the resulting hyperbolic cone sphere. In particular, it can be used to realize any Deroin-Tholozan (DT) representation as the holonomy of a hyperbolic cone sphere. Our construction is inspired by the correspondence between DT representations and chains of triangles in the hyperbolic plane. It gives a geometric interpretation of certain action-angle coordinates on the space of DT representations, which come from this correspondence.</description>

      <title>The pinning ideal of a multiloop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16216v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A loop is a generic immersion of the circle in a surface, considered up to isotopy. A loop is taut when it is minimally intersecting in its homotopy class. A pinning set of a loop is a set of points $P$ in the surface avoiding the loop, such that the loop is taut in the surface punctured at $P$. The collection of pinning sets forms a poset under inclusion, endowed with the cardinal function: its minimum defines the pinning number of the loop.
  We show that the decision problem associated to computing the pinning number of a plane loop is NP-complete. First, we implement a polynomial algorithm to check if a point-set is pinning, adapting a method of Birman--Series for computing intersection numbers of curves in surfaces. Then we reduce the problem to a boolean formula whose solutions correspond to pinning sets: for this we study immersed discs in detail to improve a theorem of Hass--Scott characterising taut loops, and apply an algorithm of Blanc and Frish. Finally, we reduce the vertex-cover problem for graphs to an instance of the pinning problem for plane loops.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10281v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hyperbolic buildings are central objects in both hyperbolic geometry and geometric group theory, exhibiting a wide range of intriguing characteristics, especially with respect to group actions. In this paper, we develop the theory of surface quotients of Fuchsian buildings. For a large family of Fuchsian buildings, we prove the existence of a discrete subgroup $\Gamma$ of the automorphism group of the Fuchsian building whose quotient is a compact surface without boundary. We also provide some necessary conditions for the existence of such lattices, in terms of the symmetries of the building. The proof is based on another result of ours that generators of the fundamental group of a tessellated surface can be chose by closed geodesics in the 1-skeleton of the tessellation, which is of independent interest.</description>

Abstract: By leveraging techniques from complex analysis and topology, we have uncovered a remarkable property of branched covers and formulated a criterion for the existence of specific types of branched covers between 2-spheres. This criterion extends the findings previously reported by Jiang (2004), Pervova-Petronio (2006), Zhu (2019), and Wei-Wu-Xu (2024). Furthermore, as an application of our criterion, we introduce several novel exceptional branching datum.</description>

The fibers of these maps $f_{(i_1,\dots ,i_d)}$ encode the nonnegative real relations amongst exponentiated Chevalley generators. Our main theorems show that the fibers admit cell stratifications, that these cell stratifications have the same face posets as interior dual block complexes of subword complexes, and that these posets are contractible.
  We conjecture that each such fiber is a regular CW complex homeomorphic to the interior dual block complex of a subword complex. This conjecture is shown to have as a corollary a new proof of the Fomin-Shapiro Conjecture by way of general topological results regarding approximating maps by homeomorphisms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03601v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate and compare applications of the Zilber-Pink conjecture and dynamical methods to rigidity problems for arithmetic real and complex hyperbolic lattices. Along the way we obtain new general results about reconstructing a variation of Hodge structure from its typical Hodge locus that may be of independent interest. Applications to Siu's immersion problem are also discussed, the most general of which only requires the hypothesis that infinitely many closed geodesics map to proper totally geodesic subvarieties under the immersion.</description>

      <title>Legendrian Lavrentiev links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13473v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lavrentiev curves form a special class of rectifiable curves which includes cusp-free piecewise smooth curves. We call a Lavrentiev curve Legendrian if the integral of the contact form equals zero on any its subarc. We define Legendrian isotopies of such curves and prove that the equivalence classes of Legendrian Lavrentiev links with respect to Legendrian isotopies coincide with smooth classes.</description>

      <title>Fillability obstructions for high-dimensional confoliations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06918v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study confoliations in dimensions higher than three mostly from the perspective of symplectic fillability. Our main result is that Massot-Niederkr\"uger-Wendl's bordered Legendrian open book, an object that obstructs the weak symplectic fillability of contact manifolds, admits a generalization for confoliations equipped with symplectic data. Applications include the non-fillability of the product of an overtwisted contact manifold and a class of symplectic manifolds, and the fact that Bourgeois contact structures associated with overtwisted contact manifolds admit no weak symplectic fillings for which the symplectic structure restricts at the boundary to a positive generator of the second cohomology of the torus factor. In addition, along the lines of the original 3-dimensional work of Eliashberg and Thurston, we give a new definition of approximation and deformation of confoliations by contact structures and describe some natural examples.</description>

      <title>Congruence Subgroup Property for nilpotent groups and subsurface subgroups of Mapping Class Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06867v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the Congruence Subgroup Property for two families of subgroups of Mapping Class Groups of finite-type surfaces. The first one is related to nilpotent quotients of the fundamental group and Johnson filtration, and along the way we give an elementary proof of a theorem of Ben-Ezra-Lubotzky. The second family consists of certain geometric subgroups obtained via subsurface inclusions.</description>
