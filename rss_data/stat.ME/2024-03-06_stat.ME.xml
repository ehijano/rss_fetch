      <title>Addressing the Influence of Unmeasured Confounding in Observational Studies with Time-to-Event Outcomes: A Semiparametric Sensitivity Analysis Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a semiparametric sensitivity analysis approach designed to address unmeasured confounding in observational studies with time-to-event outcomes. We target estimation of the marginal distributions of potential outcomes under competing exposures using influence function-based techniques. We derived the non-parametric influence function for uncensored data and mapped the uncensored data influence function to the observed data influence function. Our methodology is motivated by and applied to an observational study evaluating the effectiveness of radical prostatectomy (RP) versus external beam radiotherapy with androgen deprivation (EBRT+AD) for the treatment of prostate cancer. We also present a simulation study to evaluate the statistical properties of our methodology.</description>

      <title>Determining the Number of Common Functional Factors with Twice Cross-Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The semiparametric factor model serves as a vital tool to describe the dependence patterns in the data. It recognizes that the common features observed in the data are actually explained by functions of specific exogenous variables.Unlike traditional factor models, where the focus is on selecting the number of factors, our objective here is to identify the appropriate number of common functions, a crucial parameter in this model. In this paper, we develop a novel data-driven method to determine the number of functional factors using cross validation (CV). Our proposed method employs a two-step CV process that ensures the orthogonality of functional factors, which we refer to as Functional Twice Cross-Validation (FTCV). Extensive simulations demonstrate that FTCV accurately selects the number of common functions and outperforms existing methods in most cases.Furthermore, by specifying market volatility as the exogenous force, we provide real data examples that illustrate the interpretability of selected common functions in characterizing the influence on U.S. Treasury Yields and the cross correlations between Dow30 returns.</description>

      <title>Regularised Canonical Correlation Analysis: graphical lasso, biplots and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent developments in regularized Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) promise powerful methods for high-dimensional, multiview data analysis. However, justifying the structural assumptions behind many popular approaches remains a challenge, and features of realistic biological datasets pose practical difficulties that are seldom discussed. We propose a novel CCA estimator rooted in an assumption of conditional independencies and based on the Graphical Lasso. Our method has desirable theoretical guarantees and good empirical performance, demonstrated through extensive simulations and real-world biological datasets. Recognizing the difficulties of model selection in high dimensions and other practical challenges of applying CCA in real-world settings, we introduce a novel framework for evaluating and interpreting regularized CCA models in the context of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), which we hope will empower researchers and pave the way for wider adoption.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Assisted Adjustment Boosts Inferential Efficiency of Randomized Controlled Trials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we proposed a novel inferential procedure assisted by machine learning based adjustment for randomized control trials. The method was developed under the Rosenbaum's framework of exact tests in randomized experiments with covariate adjustments. Through extensive simulation experiments, we showed the proposed method can robustly control the type I error and can boost the inference efficiency for a randomized controlled trial (RCT). This advantage was further demonstrated in a real world example. The simplicity and robustness of the proposed method makes it a competitive candidate as a routine inference procedure for RCTs, especially when the number of baseline covariates is large, and when nonlinear association or interaction among covariates is expected. Its application may remarkably reduce the required sample size and cost of RCTs, such as phase III clinical trials.</description>

      <title>Data Nuggets: A Method for Reducing Big Data While Preserving Data Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Big data, with NxP dimension where N is extremely large, has created new challenges for data analysis, particularly in the realm of creating meaningful clusters of data. Clustering techniques, such as K-means or hierarchical clustering are popular methods for performing exploratory analysis on large datasets. Unfortunately, these methods are not always possible to apply to big data due to memory or time constraints generated by calculations of order PxN(N-1). To circumvent this problem, typically, the clustering technique is applied to a random sample drawn from the dataset: however, a weakness is that the structure of the dataset, particularly at the edges, is not necessarily maintained. We propose a new solution through the concept of "data nuggets", which reduce a large dataset into a small collection of nuggets of data, each containing a center, weight, and scale parameter. The data nuggets are then input into algorithms that compute methods such as principal components analysis and clustering in a more computationally efficient manner. We show the consistency of the data nuggets-based covariance estimator and apply the methodology of data nuggets to perform exploratory analysis of a flow cytometry dataset containing over one million observations using PCA and K-means clustering for weighted observations. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.</description>

      <title>A novel methodological framework for the analysis of health trajectories and survival outcomes in heart failure patients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heart failure (HF) contributes to circa 200,000 annual hospitalizations in France. With the increasing age of HF patients, elucidating the specific causes of inpatient mortality became a public health problematic. We introduce a novel methodological framework designed to identify prevalent health trajectories and investigate their impact on death. The initial step involves applying sequential pattern mining to characterize patients' trajectories, followed by an unsupervised clustering algorithm based on a new metric for measuring the distance between hospitalization diagnoses. Finally, a survival analysis is conducted to assess survival outcomes. The application of this framework to HF patients from a representative sample of the French population demonstrates its methodological significance in enhancing the analysis of healthcare trajectories.</description>

      <title>The Influence of Validation Data on Logical and Scientific Interpretations of Forensic Expert Opinions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Forensic experts use specialized training and knowledge to enable other members of the judicial system to make better informed and more just decisions. Factfinders, in particular, are tasked with judging how much weight to give to experts' reports and opinions. Many references describe assessing evidential weight from the perspective of a forensic expert. Some recognize that stakeholders are each responsible for evaluating their own weight of evidence. Morris (1971, 1974, 1977) provided a general framework for recipients to update their own uncertainties after learning an expert's opinion. Although this framework is normative under Bayesian axioms and several forensic scholars advocate the use of Bayesian reasoning, few resources describe its application in forensic science. This paper addresses this gap by examining how recipients can combine principles of science and Bayesian reasoning to evaluate their own likelihood ratios for expert opinions. This exercise helps clarify how an expert's role depends on whether one envisions recipients to be logical and scientific or deferential. Illustrative examples with an expert's opinion expressed as a categorical conclusion, likelihood ratio, or range of likelihood ratios, or with likelihood ratios from multiple experts, each reveal the importance and influence of validation data for logical recipients' interpretations.</description>

      <title>Low-rank matrix estimation via nonconvex spectral regularized methods in errors-in-variables matrix regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-dimensional matrix regression has been studied in various aspects, such as statistical properties, computational efficiency and application to specific instances including multivariate regression, system identification and matrix compressed sensing. Current studies mainly consider the idealized case that the covariate matrix is obtained without noise, while the more realistic scenario that the covariates may always be corrupted with noise or missing data has received little attention. We consider the general errors-in-variables matrix regression model and proposed a unified framework for low-rank estimation based on nonconvex spectral regularization. Then in the statistical aspect, recovery bounds for any stationary points are provided to achieve statistical consistency. In the computational aspect, the proximal gradient method is applied to solve the nonconvex optimization problem and is proved to converge in polynomial time. Consequences for specific matrix compressed sensing models with additive noise and missing data are obtained via verifying corresponding regularity conditions. Finally, the performance of the proposed nonconvex estimation method is illustrated by numerical experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A theory of martingales for censoring is developed. The Doob-Meyer martingale is shown to be inadequate in general, and a repaired martingale is proposed with a non-predictable centering term. Associated martingale transforms, variation processes, and covariation processes are developed based on a measure of half-predictability that generalizes predictability. The development is applied to study the Kaplan Meier estimator.</description>

      <title>Scalable Bayesian inference for the generalized linear mixed model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) is a popular statistical approach for handling correlated data, and is used extensively in applications areas where big data is common, including biomedical data settings. The focus of this paper is scalable statistical inference for the GLMM, where we define statistical inference as: (i) estimation of population parameters, and (ii) evaluation of scientific hypotheses in the presence of uncertainty. Artificial intelligence (AI) learning algorithms excel at scalable statistical estimation, but rarely include uncertainty quantification. In contrast, Bayesian inference provides full statistical inference, since uncertainty quantification results automatically from the posterior distribution. Unfortunately, Bayesian inference algorithms, including Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), become computationally intractable in big data settings. In this paper, we introduce a statistical inference algorithm at the intersection of AI and Bayesian inference, that leverages the scalability of modern AI algorithms with guaranteed uncertainty quantification that accompanies Bayesian inference. Our algorithm is an extension of stochastic gradient MCMC with novel contributions that address the treatment of correlated data (i.e., intractable marginal likelihood) and proper posterior variance estimation. Through theoretical and empirical results we establish our algorithm's statistical inference properties, and apply the method in a large electronic health records database.</description>

      <title>Active Statistical Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the concept of active learning, we propose active inference$\unicode{x2013}$a methodology for statistical inference with machine-learning-assisted data collection. Assuming a budget on the number of labels that can be collected, the methodology uses a machine learning model to identify which data points would be most beneficial to label, thus effectively utilizing the budget. It operates on a simple yet powerful intuition: prioritize the collection of labels for data points where the model exhibits uncertainty, and rely on the model's predictions where it is confident. Active inference constructs provably valid confidence intervals and hypothesis tests while leveraging any black-box machine learning model and handling any data distribution. The key point is that it achieves the same level of accuracy with far fewer samples than existing baselines relying on non-adaptively-collected data. This means that for the same number of collected samples, active inference enables smaller confidence intervals and more powerful p-values. We evaluate active inference on datasets from public opinion research, census analysis, and proteomics.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by the proliferation of extensive macroeconomic and health datasets necessitating accurate forecasts, a novel approach is introduced to address Vector Autoregressive (VAR) models. This approach employs the global-local shrinkage-Wishart prior. Unlike conventional VAR models, where degrees of freedom are predetermined to be equivalent to the size of the variable plus one or equal to zero, the proposed method integrates a hyperprior for the degrees of freedom to account for the uncertainty about the parameter values. Specifically, a loss-based prior is derived to leverage information regarding the data-inherent degrees of freedom. The efficacy of the proposed prior is demonstrated in a multivariate setting for forecasting macroeconomic data, as well as Dengue infection data.</description>

      <title>Counterfactual Effect Generalization: A Combinatorial Definition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.04376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.04376v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The widely used 'Counterfactual' definition of Causal Effects was derived for unbiasedness and accuracy - and not generalizability. We propose a Combinatorial definition for the External Validity (EV) of intervention effects. We first define the concept of an effect observation 'background'. We then formulate conditions for effect generalization based on their sets of (observable and unobservable) backgrounds. This reveals two limits for effect generalization: (1) when effects are observed under all their enumerable backgrounds, or, (2) when backgrounds have become sufficiently randomized. We use the resulting combinatorial framework to re-examine several issues in the original counterfactual formulation: out-of-sample validity, concurrent estimation of multiple effects, bias-variance tradeoffs, statistical power, and connections to current predictive and explaining techniques.
  Methodologically, the definitions also allow us to also replace the parametric estimation problems that followed the counterfactual definition by combinatorial enumeration and randomization problems in non-experimental samples. We use this non-parametric framework to demonstrate (External Validity, Unconfoundness and Precision) tradeoffs in the performance of popular supervised, explaining, and causal-effect estimators. We demonstrate the approach also allows for the use of these methods in non-i.i.d. samples. The COVID19 pandemic highlighted the need for learning solutions to provide predictions in severally incomplete samples. We demonstrate applications in this pressing problem.</description>

      <title>Near-Optimal Non-Parametric Sequential Tests and Confidence Sequences with Possibly Dependent Observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.14411v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sequential tests and their implied confidence sequences, which are valid at arbitrary stopping times, promise flexible statistical inference and on-the-fly decision making. However, strong guarantees are limited to parametric sequential tests that under-cover in practice or concentration-bound-based sequences that over-cover and have suboptimal rejection times. In this work, we consider \cite{robbins1970boundary}'s delayed-start normal-mixture sequential probability ratio tests, and we provide the first asymptotic type-I-error and expected-rejection-time guarantees under general non-parametric data generating processes, where the asymptotics are indexed by the test's burn-in time. The type-I-error results primarily leverage a martingale strong invariance principle and establish that these tests (and their implied confidence sequences) have type-I error rates approaching a desired $\alpha$-level. The expected-rejection-time results primarily leverage an identity inspired by It\^o's lemma and imply that, in certain asymptotic regimes, the expected rejection time approaches the minimum possible among $\alpha$-level tests. We show how to apply our results to sequential inference on parameters defined by estimating equations, such as average treatment effects. Together, our results establish these (ostensibly parametric) tests as general-purpose, non-parametric, and near-optimal. We illustrate this via numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric Linear Feature Learning in Regression Through Regularisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.12754v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Representation learning plays a crucial role in automated feature selection, particularly in the context of high-dimensional data, where non-parametric methods often struggle. In this study, we focus on supervised learning scenarios where the pertinent information resides within a lower-dimensional linear subspace of the data, namely the multi-index model. If this subspace were known, it would greatly enhance prediction, computation, and interpretation. To address this challenge, we propose a novel method for linear feature learning with non-parametric prediction, which simultaneously estimates the prediction function and the linear subspace. Our approach employs empirical risk minimisation, augmented with a penalty on function derivatives, ensuring versatility. Leveraging the orthogonality and rotation invariance properties of Hermite polynomials, we introduce our estimator, named RegFeaL. By utilising alternative minimisation, we iteratively rotate the data to improve alignment with leading directions and accurately estimate the relevant dimension in practical settings. We establish that our method yields a consistent estimator of the prediction function with explicit rates. Additionally, we provide empirical results demonstrating the performance of RegFeaL in various experiments.</description>

      <title>Covariate adjustment in randomized experiments with missing outcomes and covariates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10877v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Covariate adjustment can improve precision in analyzing randomized experiments. With fully observed data, regression adjustment and propensity score weighting are asymptotically equivalent in improving efficiency over unadjusted analysis. When some outcomes are missing, we consider combining these two adjustment methods with inverse probability of observation weighting for handling missing outcomes, and show that the equivalence between the two methods breaks down. Regression adjustment no longer ensures efficiency gain over unadjusted analysis unless the true outcome model is linear in covariates or the outcomes are missing completely at random. Propensity score weighting, in contrast, still guarantees efficiency over unadjusted analysis, and including more covariates in adjustment never harms asymptotic efficiency. Moreover, we establish the value of using partially observed covariates to secure additional efficiency by the missingness indicator method, which imputes all missing covariates by zero and uses the union of the completed covariates and corresponding missingness indicators as the new, fully observed covariates. Based on these findings, we recommend using regression adjustment in combination with the missingness indicator method if the linear outcome model or missing complete at random assumption is plausible and using propensity score weighting with the missingness indicator method otherwise.</description>

      <title>Regression Copulas for Multivariate Responses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11804v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel distributional regression model for a multivariate response vector based on a copula process over the covariate space. It uses the implicit copula of a Gaussian multivariate regression, which we call a ``regression copula''. To allow for large covariate vectors their coefficients are regularized using a novel multivariate extension of the horseshoe prior. Bayesian inference and distributional predictions are evaluated using efficient variational inference methods, allowing application to large datasets. An advantage of the approach is that the marginal distributions of the response vector can be estimated separately and accurately, resulting in predictive distributions that are marginally-calibrated. Two substantive applications of the methodology highlight its efficacy in multivariate modeling. The first is the econometric modeling and prediction of half-hourly regional Australian electricity prices. Here, our approach produces more accurate distributional forecasts than leading benchmark methods. The second is the evaluation of multivariate posteriors in likelihood-free inference (LFI) of a model for tree species abundance data, extending a previous univariate regression copula LFI method. In both applications, we demonstrate that our new approach exhibits a desirable marginal calibration property.</description>

      <title>Detection and inference of changes in high-dimensional linear regression with non-sparse structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06915v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For data segmentation in high-dimensional linear regression settings, the regression parameters are often assumed to be sparse segment-wise, which enables many existing methods to estimate the parameters locally via $\ell_1$-regularised maximum likelihood-type estimation and then contrast them for change point detection. Contrary to this common practice, we show that the sparsity of neither regression parameters nor their differences, a.k.a. differential parameters, is necessary for consistency in multiple change point detection. In fact, both statistically and computationally, better efficiency is attained by a simple strategy that scans for large discrepancies in local covariance between the regressors and the response. We go a step further and propose a suite of tools for directly inferring about the differential parameters post-segmentation, which are applicable even when the regression parameters themselves are non-sparse. Theoretical investigations are conducted under general conditions permitting non-Gaussianity, temporal dependence and ultra-high dimensionality. Numerical results from simulated and macroeconomic datasets demonstrate the competitiveness and efficacy of the proposed methods.</description>

      <title>Online Local False Discovery Rate Control: A Resource Allocation Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11425v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of online local false discovery rate (FDR) control where multiple tests are conducted sequentially, with the goal of maximizing the total expected number of discoveries. We formulate the problem as an online resource allocation problem with accept/reject decisions, which from a high level can be viewed as an online knapsack problem, with the additional uncertainty of exogenous random budget replenishment. We start with general arrival distributions and propose a simple policy that achieves a $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret. We complement the result by showing that such regret rate is in general not improvable. We then shift our focus to discrete arrival distributions. We find that many existing re-solving heuristics in the online resource allocation literature, albeit achieve bounded loss in canonical settings, may incur a $\Omega(\sqrt{T})$ or even a $\Omega(T)$ regret. With the observation that canonical policies tend to be too optimistic and over accept arrivals, we propose a novel policy that incorporates budget buffers. We show that small additional logarithmic buffers suffice to reduce the regret from $\Omega(\sqrt{T})$ or even $\Omega(T)$ to $O(\ln^2 T)$. Numerical experiments are conducted to validate our theoretical findings. Our formulation may have wider applications beyond the problem considered in this paper, and our results emphasize how effective policies should be designed to reach a balance between circumventing wrong accept and reducing wrong reject in online resource allocation problems with exogenous budget replenishment.</description>

      <title>Recoverability of Causal Effects in a Longitudinal Study under Presence of Missing Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14562v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Missing data in multiple variables is a common issue. We investigate the applicability of the framework of graphical models for handling missing data to a complex longitudinal pharmacological study of children with HIV treated with an efavirenz-based regimen as part of the CHAPAS-3 trial. Specifically, we examine whether the causal effects of interest, defined through static interventions on multiple continuous variables, can be recovered (estimated consistently) from the available data only. So far, no general algorithms are available to decide on recoverability, and decisions have to be made on a case-by-case basis. We emphasize sensitivity of recoverability to even the smallest changes in the graph structure, and present recoverability results for three plausible missingness directed acyclic graphs (m-DAGs) in the CHAPAS-3 study, informed by clinical knowledge. Furthermore, we propose the concept of "closed missingness mechanisms" and show that under these mechanisms an available case analysis is admissible for consistent estimation for any type of statistical and causal query, even if the underlying missingness mechanism is of missing not at random (MNAR) type. Both simulations and theoretical considerations demonstrate how, in the assumed MNAR setting of our study, a complete or available case analysis can be superior to multiple imputation, and estimation results vary depending on the assumed missingness DAG. Our analyses are possibly the first to show the applicability of missingness DAGs (m-DAGs) to complex longitudinal real-world data, while highlighting the sensitivity with respect to the assumed causal model.</description>

      <title>Design-Robust Two-Way-Fixed-Effects Regression For Panel Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.13737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.13737v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new estimator for average causal effects of a binary treatment with panel data in settings with general treatment patterns. Our approach augments the popular two-way-fixed-effects specification with unit-specific weights that arise from a model for the assignment mechanism. We show how to construct these weights in various settings, including the staggered adoption setting, where units opt into the treatment sequentially but permanently. The resulting estimator converges to an average (over units and time) treatment effect under the correct specification of the assignment model, even if the fixed effect model is misspecified. We show that our estimator is more robust than the conventional two-way estimator: it remains consistent if either the assignment mechanism or the two-way regression model is correctly specified. In addition, the proposed estimator performs better than the two-way-fixed-effect estimator if the outcome model and assignment mechanism are locally misspecified. This strong double robustness property underlines and quantifies the benefits of modeling the assignment process and motivates using our estimator in practice. We also discuss an extension of our estimator to handle dynamic treatment effects.</description>

      <title>Trust Your $\nabla$: Gradient-based Intervention Targeting for Causal Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.13715v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inferring causal structure from data is a challenging task of fundamental importance in science. Observational data are often insufficient to identify a system's causal structure uniquely. While conducting interventions (i.e., experiments) can improve the identifiability, such samples are usually challenging and expensive to obtain. Hence, experimental design approaches for causal discovery aim to minimize the number of interventions by estimating the most informative intervention target. In this work, we propose a novel Gradient-based Intervention Targeting method, abbreviated GIT, that 'trusts' the gradient estimator of a gradient-based causal discovery framework to provide signals for the intervention acquisition function. We provide extensive experiments in simulated and real-world datasets and demonstrate that GIT performs on par with competitive baselines, surpassing them in the low-data regime.</description>

      <title>Behavioral Carry-Over Effect and Power Consideration in Crossover Trials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.01246v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A crossover trial is an efficient trial design when there is no carry-over effect. To reduce the impact of the biological carry-over effect, a washout period is often designed. However, the carry-over effect remains an outstanding concern when a washout period is unethical or cannot sufficiently diminish the impact of the carry-over effect. The latter can occur in comparative effectiveness research where the carry-over effect is often non-biological but behavioral. In this paper, we investigate the crossover design under a potential outcomes framework with and without the carry-over effect. We find that when the carry-over effect exists and satisfies a sign condition, the basic estimator underestimates the treatment effect, which does not inflate the type I error of one-sided tests but negatively impacts the power. This leads to a power trade-off between the crossover design and the parallel-group design, and we derive the condition under which the crossover design does not lead to type I error inflation and is still more powerful than the parallel-group design. We also develop covariate adjustment methods for crossover trials. We evaluate the performance of cross-over design and covariate adjustment using data from the MTN-034/REACH study.</description>

      <title>Regularization of the ensemble Kalman filter using a non-parametric, non-stationary spatial model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.14318v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The sample covariance matrix of a random vector is a good estimate of the true covariance matrix if the sample size is much larger than the length of the vector. In high-dimensional problems, this condition is never met. As a result, in high dimensions the EnKF ensemble does not contain enough information to specify the prior covariance matrix accurately. This necessitates the need for regularization of the analysis (observation update) problem. We propose a regularization technique based on a new spatial model on the sphere. The model is a constrained version of the general Gaussian process convolution model. The constraints on the location-dependent convolution kernel include local isotropy, positive definiteness as a function of distance, and smoothness as a function of location. The model allows for a rigorous definition of the local spectrum, which, in addition, is required to be a smooth function of spatial wavenumber. We regularize the ensemble Kalman filter by postulating that its prior covariances obey this model. The model is estimated online in a two-stage procedure. First, ensemble perturbations are bandpass filtered in several wavenumber bands to extract aggregated local spatial spectra. Second, a neural network recovers the local spectra from sample variances of the filtered fields. We show that with the growing ensemble size, the estimator is capable of extracting increasingly detailed spatially non-stationary structures. In simulation experiments, the new technique led to substantially better EnKF performance than several existing techniques.</description>

      <title>Series ridge regression for spatial data on $\mathbb{R}^d$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02773v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a general asymptotic theory of series estimators for spatial data collected at irregularly spaced locations within a sampling region $R_n \subset \mathbb{R}^d$. We employ a stochastic sampling design that can flexibly generate irregularly spaced sampling sites, encompassing both pure increasing and mixed increasing domain frameworks. Specifically, we focus on a spatial trend regression model and a nonparametric regression model with spatially dependent covariates. For these models, we investigate $L^2$-penalized series estimation of the trend and regression functions. We establish uniform and $L^2$ convergence rates and multivariate central limit theorems for general series estimators as main results. Additionally, we show that spline and wavelet series estimators achieve optimal uniform and $L^2$ convergence rates and propose methods for constructing confidence intervals for these estimators. Finally, we demonstrate that our dependence structure conditions on the underlying spatial processes include a broad class of random fields, including L\'evy-driven continuous autoregressive and moving average random fields.</description>
