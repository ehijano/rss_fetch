      <title>A scientific review on advances in statistical methods for crossover design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A comprehensive review of the literature on crossover design is needed to highlight its evolution, applications, and methodological advancements across various fields. Given its widespread use in clinical trials and other research domains, understanding this design's challenges, assumptions, and innovations is essential for optimizing its implementation and ensuring accurate, unbiased results. This article extensively reviews the history and statistical inference methods for crossover designs. A primary focus is given to the AB-BA design as it is the most widely used design in literature. Extension from two periods to higher-order designs is discussed, and a general inference procedure for continuous response is studied. Analysis of multivariate and categorical responses is also reviewed in this context. A bunch of open problems in this area are shortlisted.</description>

      <title>A Modified Satterthwaite (1941,1946) Effective Degrees of Freedom Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14606v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study introduces a correction to the approximation of effective degrees of freedom as proposed by Satterthwaite (1941, 1946), specifically addressing scenarios where component degrees of freedom are small. The correction is grounded in analytical results concerning the moments of standard normal random variables. This modification is applicable to complex variance estimates that involve both small and large degrees of freedom, offering an enhanced approximation of the higher moments required by Satterthwaite's framework. Additionally, this correction extends and partially validates the empirically derived adjustment by Johnson &amp; Rust (1992), as it is based on theoretical foundations rather than simulations used to derive empirical transformation constants.</description>

      <title>Mixed-type Distance Shrinkage and Selection for Clustering via Kernel Metric Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.01890v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Distance-based clustering and classification are widely used in various fields to group mixed numeric and categorical data. In many algorithms, a predefined distance measurement is used to cluster data points based on their dissimilarity. While there exist numerous distance-based measures for data with pure numerical attributes and several ordered and unordered categorical metrics, an efficient and accurate distance for mixed-type data that utilizes the continuous and discrete properties simulatenously is an open problem. Many metrics convert numerical attributes to categorical ones or vice versa. They handle the data points as a single attribute type or calculate a distance between each attribute separately and add them up. We propose a metric called KDSUM that uses mixed kernels to measure dissimilarity, with cross-validated optimal bandwidth selection. We demonstrate that KDSUM is a shrinkage method from existing mixed-type metrics to a uniform dissimilarity metric, and improves clustering accuracy when utilized in existing distance-based clustering algorithms on simulated and real-world datasets containing continuous-only, categorical-only, and mixed-type data.</description>
