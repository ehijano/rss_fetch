      <title>A Partially Fixed Background Field Gauge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the incorporation of gauge symmetries in the modern effective field theory (EFT) matching paradigm with a particular focus on spontaneously broken symmetries. The presence of gauge symmetries entails the introduction of gauge-fixing terms in matching calculations, which may prevent (partial) cancellation between loops from the underlying theory and those of the EFT, thereby preventing the establishment of a hard-region matching formula. While this is not an issue when using the ordinary background field (BF) gauge for unbroken gauge theories, we find ourselves unable to demonstrate the cancellation with the ordinary BF gauge in spontaneously broken gauge theories. As a convenient alternative, we construct a partially fixed BF gauge that, in addition to being simpler than the ordinary BF gauge, allows us to prove a hard-region matching formula.</description>

      <title>The Field Theory Axiverse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Axion and axion-like particles (ALPs) are a prominent candidate for physics beyond the Standard Model, and can play an important role in cosmology, serving as dark matter or dark energy, or both, drawing motivation in part from the string theory axiverse. Axion-like particles (ALPs) can also arise as composite degrees of freedom following chiral symmetry breaking in a dark confining gauge theory, analogous to the Standard Model (SM) pion. A dark sector with arbitrary $N_f$ flavors of dark quarks leads to $N_f^2-1$ axion-like states, effectively a field theory axiverse (or '$\pi$-axiverse'). A portal to the visible sector can be achieved through the standard kinetic mixing between the dark photon and SM photon, generating millicharges for the dark quarks and consequently couplings, both parity-even and parity-odd, between the SM and the dark pions. This scenario has been studied for the $N_f=2$ case and more recently for a dark Standard Model with $N_f=6$. In this work, we study the spectrum of this field theory axiverse for an arbitrary number of flavors, and apply this to the example $N_f=10$. We calculate the couplings to the SM photon analogous to the conventional axion-photon coupling, including the $N_f$ and $N_c$ dependence, and compute the present and future constraints on the $N_f=10$, $N_c=3$, $\pi$-axiverse. We elucidate the accompanying 'bary-verse' of superheavy dark baryons, namely an ensemble of charged and neutral dark baryons with a mass set by the dark pion decay constant.</description>

      <title>Neutrino Masses in the Mirror Twin Higgs with Spontaneous $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a mirror twin Higgs model with spontaneous $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry breaking that ameliorates the constraints in twin Higgs cosmology and, at the same time, generates the Standard Model neutrino masses. The model features an $SU(2)$ triplet with hypercharge $1$ alongside its twin counterpart. Spontaneous breaking of both $\mathbb{Z}_2$ and electroweak symmetry occurs in the scalar sector. The Standard Model neutrinos acquire small masses through the type-II seesaw mechanism. In contrast, their twin counterparts acquire large masses, effectively addressing the dark radiation problem in mirror twin Higgs scenarios. We study the impact of the model on the $N_{\rm eff.}$ constraints, as well as on collider phenomenology.</description>

      <title>Tunneling away the relic neutrino asymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Earth acts as a matter potential for relic neutrinos which modifies their index of refraction from vacuum by $\delta\sim10^{-8}$. It has been argued that the refractive effects from this potential should lead to a large $\mathcal O(\sqrt\delta)$ neutrino-antineutrino asymmetry at the surface of the Earth. This result was computed by treating the Earth as flat. In this work, we revisit this calculation in the context of a perfectly spherical Earth. We demonstrate, both numerically and through analytic arguments, that the flat-Earth result is only recovered under the condition $\delta^{3/2}kR\gg1$, where $k$ is the typical momentum of the relic neutrinos and $R$ is the radius of the Earth. This condition is required to prevent antineutrinos from tunneling into classically inaccessible trajectories below the Earth's surface and washing away the large asymmetry. As the physical parameters of the Earth do not satisfy this condition, we find that the asymmetry at the surface should only be $\mathcal O(\delta)$. While the asphericity of the Earth may serve as a loophole to our conclusions, we argue that it is still difficult to generate a large asymmetry even in the presence of local terrain.</description>

      <title>Annihilation of NMSSM neutralinos and Branching Ratios, Particle Decay Channel of lightest CP odd, even Higgs in NMSSM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine neutralino dark matter within the NMSSM framework by conducting a comprehensive analysis of its parameter space. This involves evaluating neutralino capture and annihilation rates within the Sun. The exploration of potential detection strategies for neutralino dark matter in neutrino experiments hinges on the composition of neutralinos and their primary annihilation pathways. Our study also involves reassessing the maximum thresholds for branching ratios of lepton flavour violation decays by directly referencing the constrained limits on $ \Delta a_{\mu} $ from $ g_{\mu}-2 $ experiment. This work also presents constraints of muon flux, photon, positron and antiproton flux, specifically its independence from experimental intricacies and the universal applicability of recalculation coefficients across NMSSM model. We also calculate the Branching Ratios, Particle Decay Channel of lightest CP odd, even Higgs in NMSSM.</description>

      <title>Time Flow and Flavor Mixing in the Flavor Spin Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that in the flavor spin theories (theories with non-Euclidean signature of the kinematic quadratic term of the Lagrangian) for physical mass eigenstates the transition from the interaction to the mass eigenstate basis is constrained. In the corresponding modification of the SM the constraints result in the experimentally observed textures of both lepton and quark flavor mixing matrices. Furthermore, the number of real mixing parameters is reduced by one for each of the quark and lepton sectors. In addition some pairs of elements of V_CKM and separately U_PMNS must have the same absolute values. The equalities are observed experimentally within the error bounds. Apart from its imprint on the flavor mixing the modified SM is identical to the SM.</description>

      <title>Generation of Ultrarelativistic Vortex Leptons with Large Orbital Angular Momenta</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrarelativistic vortex leptons with intrinsic orbital angular momenta (OAM) have important applications in high energy particle physics, nuclear physics, astrophysics, etc. However, unfortunately, their generation still poses a great challenge. Here, we put forward a novel method for generating ultrarelativistic vortex positrons and electrons through nonlinear Breit-Wheeler (NBW) scattering of vortex $\gamma$ photons. For the first time, a complete angular momentum-resolved scattering theory has been formulated, introducing the angular momentum of laser photons and vortex particles into the conventional NBW scattering framework. We find that vortex positron (electron) can be produced when the outgoing electron (positron) is generated along the collision axis. By unveiling the angular momentum transfer mechanism, we clarify that OAM of the $\gamma$ photon and angular momenta of multiple laser photons are entirely transferred to the generated pairs, leading to the production of ultrarelativistic vortex positrons or electrons with large OAM. Furthermore, we find that the cone opening angle and superposition state of the vortex $\gamma$ photon, distinct characteristics aside from its intrinsic OAM, can be determined via the angular distribution of created pairs in NBW processes. Our method paves the way for investigating strong-field quantum electrodynamics processes concerning the generation and detection of vortex particle beams in intense lasers.</description>

      <title>How does the $X(3872)$ show up in $e^+e^-$ collisions: dip versus peak</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the dip observed near the total energy of 3872 MeV in the recent cross section data from the BESIII Collaboration for $e^+e^-\to J/\psi\pi^+\pi^- $ admits a natural explanation as a coupled-channel effect: it is a consequence of unitarity and a strong $S$-wave $D\bar D^*$ attraction that generates the state $X(3872)$. We anticipate the appearance of a similar dip in the $e^+e^-\to J/\psi\pi^+\pi^-\pi^0$ final state near the $D^*\bar{D}^*$ threshold driven by the same general mechanism, then to be interpreted as a signature of the predicted spin-two partner of the $X(3872)$.</description>

      <title>The relic density and temperature evolution of light dark sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have developed a set of four fully coupled Boltzmann equations to precisely determine the relic density and temperature of dark matter by including three distinct sectors: dark matter, light scalar, and standard model sectors. The intricacies of heat transfer between DM and the SM sector through a light scalar particle are explored, inspired by stringent experimental constraints on the scalar-Higgs mixing angle and the DM-scalar coupling. Three distinct sectors emerge prior to DM freeze-out, requiring fully coupled Boltzmann equations to accurately compute relic density. Investigation of forbidden, resonance, and secluded DM scenarios demonstrates significant deviations between established methods and the novel approach with fully coupled Boltzmann equations. Despite increased computational demands, this emphasizes the need for improved precision in relic density calculations, underlining the importance of incorporating these equations in comprehensive analyses.</description>

      <title>String Junctions Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent measurements at the LHC have revealed heavy-flavour baryon fractions much larger than those observed at LEP, with e.g., LambdaC+/D0 and LambdaB0/B0 reaching ~ 0.5 at low pT. One scenario that has been at least partly successful in predicting observed trends is QCD colour reconnections with string junctions. In previous work, however, the limit of a low-pT heavy quark was not well defined. We reconsider the string equations of motion for junction systems in this limit, and find that the junction effectively becomes bound to the heavy quark, a scenario we refer to as a "pearl on a string". We extend string-junction fragmentation in Pythia with a dedicated modelling of this limit for both light- and heavy-quark "pearls".</description>

      <title>Strange quark matter as dark matter: 40 years later, a reappraisal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Forty years ago, Witten suggested that dark matter could be composed of macroscopic clusters of strange quark matter. This idea was very popular for several years, but it dropped out of fashion once lattice QCD calculations indicated that the confinement/deconfinement transition, at small baryonic chemical potential, is not first order, which seemed to be a crucial requirement in order to produce large clusters of quarks. Here we revisit both the conditions under which strangelets can be produced in the Early Universe and the many phenomenological implications of their existence. Most of the paper discusses the limits on their mass distribution and a possible and simple scheme for their production. Finally, we discuss the most promising techniques to detect this type of objects.</description>

      <title>Revisiting holographic model for thermal and dense QCD with a critical point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To quantitatively provide reliable predictions for the hot and dense QCD matter, a holographic model should be adjusted to describe first-principles lattice results available at vanishing baryon chemical potential. The equation of state from two well-known lattice groups, the HotQCD collaboration and the Wuppertal-Budapest (WB) collaboration, shows visible differences at high temperatures. We revisit the Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton (EMD) holographic model for hot QCD with 2+1 flavors and physical quark masses by fitting lattice QCD data from the WB collaboration. Using the parameterization for the scalar potential and gauge coupling proposed in our work [Phys.Rev.D 106 (2022) 12, L121902], the equation of state, the higher order baryon number susceptibilities, and the chiral condensates are in quantitative agreement with state-of-the-art lattice results. We find that the critical endpoint (CEP) obtained from fitting the WB collaboration data is nearly identical to the one from the HotQCD collaboration, suggesting the robustness of the location of the CEP. Moreover, our holographic prediction for the CEP location is in accord with more recent Bayesian analysis on a large number of holographic EMD models and an effective potential approach of QCD from gap equations.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work, the strong decays of the newly observed $P_{cs}(4338)$ as well as its high isospin cousin $P_{cs}(4460)$ are studied via the QCD sum rules. According to conservation of isospin, spin and parity, the hadronic coupling constants in four decay channels are obtained, then the partial decay widths are obtained. The total width of the $P_{cs}(4338)$ coincides with the experimental data nicely, while the predictions for the $P_{cs}(4460)$ can be testified in the future experiment, and shed light on the nature of the $P_{cs}(4338)$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We summarize the main properties of the so called ''abnormal solutions'' of the Wick--Cutkosky model, i.e. two massive scalar particles interacting via massless scalar exchange ("photons"), within the Bethe--Salpeter equation. These solutions do not exist in the non-relativistic limit, in spite of having very small binding energies. They present a genuine many-body character dominated by photons, with a norm of the valence constituent wave function (two-body norm) that vanishes in the limit of zero binding energy.
  We present new results concerning the massive-exchange case, in particular determine under which conditions is it possible to obtain such peculiar solutions without spoiling the model by tachyonic states ($M^2&lt;0$).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose simple scenarios where the observed dark matter abundance arises from decays and scatterings of heavy quarks through freeze-in of an axion-like particle with mass in the $10 {\rm \, keV} - 1 {\rm \, MeV}$ range. These models can be tested by future X-ray telescopes, and in some cases will be almost entirely probed by searches for two-body decays $K \to \pi + {\rm invis.}$ at NA62. As a byproduct, we discuss the cancellation of IR divergencies in flavor-violating scattering processes relevant for thermal axion production, and derive the general contribution to axion-photon couplings from all three light quarks.</description>

      <title>Constraining Higgs sectors of BSM models -- the case of 95 GeV "Higgs"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In view of lack of the direct experimental evidence for a Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) physics, accommodating a SM-like Higgs boson is on the most important constraints that a BSM model must fulfill. Already for some time the FlexibleSUSY spectrum generator generator allowed for a reliable prediction of masses and decay patterns of the BSM Higgs boson in a large class of user defined supersymmetric and non-supersymmetric models. However, no easy way to compare those predictions with experimental data existed. To that end we present here an interface between FlexibleSUSY and HiggsTools, a computer program assessing in a statistically meaningful way consistency of a BSM Higgs sector with experiments.
  Motivated by the recent ATLAS and CMS observation of the di-photon excess at a mass of $\sim$95 GeV we demonstrate the capabilities of our framework by investigating whether the observed low mass excesses around 95 GeV seen in the data can be explained as the lightest scalar of the Minimal R-symmetric Supersymmetric Standard Model, without spoiling the SM-like properties of the second-to-lightest state. We also briefly comment on the light dark matter candidate which is a necessarily ingredient of such a setup.</description>

      <title>Neutrinoless double beta decay in the minimal type-I seesaw model: mass-dependent nuclear matrix element, current limits and future sensitivities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we discuss the neutrino mass dependent nuclear matrix element (NME) of the neutrinoless double beta decay process and derive the limit on the parameter space of the minimal Type-I seesaw model from the current available experimental data as well as the future sensitivities from the next-generation experiments. Both the explicit many-body calculations and naive extrapolations of the mass dependent NME are employed in the current work. The uncertainties of the theoretical nuclear structure models are taken into account. By combining the latest experimental data from $^{76}$Ge-based experiments, GERDA and MAJORANA, the $^{130}$Te-based experiment, CUORE and the $^{136}$Xe-based experiments, KamLAND-Zen and EXO-200, the bounds on the parameter space of the minimal Type-I seesaw model are obtained and compared with the limits from other experimental probes. Sensitivities for future experiments utilizing $^{76}$Ge-based (LEGEND-1000), $^{82}$Se-based (SuperNEMO), $^{130}$Te based (SNO+II) and $^{136}$Xe-based (nEXO), with a ten-year exposure, are also derived.</description>

      <title>Two-loop integrals for $t \bar{t} +$jet production at hadron colliders in the leading colour approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the differential equations for the two remaining integral topologies contributing to the leading colour two-loop amplitudes for $pp \rightarrow t\bar{t}j$. We derive differential equations for the master integrals by solving the integration-by-parts identities over finite fields. Of the two systems of differential equations, one is presented in canonical '${\rm d} \log$' form, while the other is found to have an elliptic sector. For the elliptic topology we identify the relevant elliptic curve, and present the differential equations in a more general form which depends quadratically on $\epsilon$ and contains non-logarithmic one-forms in addition to the canonical ${\rm d} \log$'s. We solve the systems of differential equations numerically using generalised series expansions with the boundary terms obtained using the auxiliary mass flow method. A summary of all one-loop and two-loop planar topologies is presented including the list of alphabet letters for the '${\rm d} \log$' form systems and high-precision boundary values.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Symmetry Preserving Gapped Phases from Coupling Constant Anomalies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note, we will characterize constraints on the possible IR phases of a given QFT by anomalies in the space of coupling constants. We will give conditions under which a coupling constant anomaly cannot be matched by a continuous family of symmetry preserving gapped phases, in which case the theory is either gapless, or exhibits spontaneous symmetry breaking or a phase transition. We additionally demonstrate examples of theories with coupling constant anomalies which can be matched by a family of symmetry preserving gapped phases without a phase transition and comment on the interpretation of our results for the spontaneous breaking of "$(-1)$-form global symmetries."</description>

      <title>Soft Photon Heating: A Semi-Analytic Framework and Applications to $21$cm Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The presence of an abundant population of low frequency photons at high redshifts (such as a radio background) can source leading order effects on the evolution of the matter and spin temperatures through rapid free-free absorptions. This effect, known as soft photon heating, can have a dramatic impact on the differential brightness temperature, $\Delta T_{\rm b}$, a central observable in $21$cm cosmology. Here, we introduce a semi-analytic framework to describe the dynamics of soft photon heating, providing a simplified set of evolution equations and a useful numerical scheme which can be used to study this generic effect. We also perform quasi-instantaneous and continuous soft photon injections to elucidate the different regimes in which soft photon heating is expected to impart a significant contribution to the global $21$cm signal and its fluctuations. We find that soft photon backgrounds produced after recombination with spectral index $\gamma &gt; 3.0$ undergo significant free-free absorption, and therefore this heating effect cannot be neglected. The effect becomes stronger with steeper spectral index, and in some cases the injection of a synchrotron-like spectrum ($\gamma = 3.6$) can suppress the amplitude of $\Delta T_{\rm b}$ relative to the standard model prediction, making the global $21$cm signal even more difficult to detect in these scenarios.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the finite volume two-nucleon spectrum at $m_\pi \approx 806$ MeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The low-energy finite-volume spectrum of the two-nucleon system at a pion mass of $m_\pi \approx 806$ MeV is studied with lattice quantum chromodynamics (LQCD) using variational methods. The interpolating-operator sets used in [Phys.Rev.D 107 (2023) 9, 094508] are extended by including a complete basis of local hexaquark operators, as well as plane-wave dibaryon operators built from products of both positive- and negative-parity nucleon operators. Results are presented for the isosinglet and isotriplet two-nucleon channels. In both channels, these results provide compelling evidence for the presence of an additional state in the low-energy spectrum not present in a non-interacting two-nucleon system. Within the space of operators that are considered in this work, the strongest overlap of this state is onto hexaquark operators, and variational analyses based on operator sets containing only dibaryon operators are insensitive to this state over the temporal extent studied here. The consequences of these studies for the LQCD understanding of the two-nucleon spectrum are investigated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A solitonic ground state called a chiral soliton lattice (CSL) is realized in a supersymmetric theory with background magnetic field and finite chemical potential. To this end, we construct, in the superfield formalism, a supersymmetric chiral sine-Gordon model as a neutral pion sector of a supersymmetric two-flavor chiral Lagrangian with a Wess-Zumino-Witten term. The CSL ground state appears in the presence of either a strong magnetic field and/or large chemical potential, or a background fermionic condensate in the form of a fermion bilinear consisting of the gaugino and a superpartner of a baryon gauge field.</description>

      <title>Data reconstruction of the dynamical connection function in $f(Q)$ cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We employ Hubble data and Gaussian Processes in order to reconstruct the dynamical connection function in $f(Q)$ cosmology beyond the coincident gauge. In particular, there exist three branches of connections that satisfy the torsionless and curvatureless conditions, parameterized by a new dynamical function $\gamma$. We express the redshift dependence of $\gamma$ in terms of the $H(z)$ function and the $f(Q)$ form and parameters, and then we reconstruct it using 55 $H(z)$ observation data. Firstly, we investigate the case where ordinary conservation law holds, and we reconstruct the $f(Q)$ function, which is very well described by a quadratic correction on top of Symmetric Teleparallel Equivalent of General Relativity. Proceeding to the general case, we consider two of the most studied $f(Q)$ models of the literature, namely the square-root and the exponential one. In both cases we reconstruct $\gamma(z)$, and we show that according to AIC and BIC information criteria its inclusion is favoured compared to both $\Lambda$CDM paradigm, as well as to the same $f(Q)$ models under the coincident gauge. This feature acts as an indication that $f(Q)$ cosmology should be studied beyond the coincident gauge.</description>

      <title>Exploring Heavy Higgs Bosons at a 100 TeV Hadron Collider within the Semi-Constrained NMSSM</title>

      <description>arXiv:2112.15570v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we explore the detectability of heavy Higgs bosons in the $pp \to b\bar{b}H/A \to b\bar{b}t\bar{t}$ channel at a 100 TeV hadron collider within the semi-constrained Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (NMSSM). We calculate their production cross sections and decay branching ratios, comparing these with simulation results from existing reference. We focus on the heavy, doublet-dominated CP-even Higgs $H$ and CP-odd Higgs $A$, with mass limits set below 10 TeV to ensure detectability. We find that at a collider with 3 ab$^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity, the potential for detecting heavy Higgs bosons varies significantly with their mass and $\tan\beta$. Heavy Higgs bosons below 2 TeV are within the testable range, while those heavier than 7 TeV fall below the exclusion and discovery thresholds, rendering them undetectable. For masses between 2 and 7 TeV, heavy Higgs bosons with $\tan\beta$ less than 20 can be detected, whereas those with $\tan\beta$ greater than 20 are beyond the current discovery or exclusion capabilities.</description>

      <title>On the possibility of mixed axion/neutralino dark matter in specific SUSY DFSZ axion models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.11645v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce four supersymmetric (SUSY) axion models in which the strong CP problem and the $\mu$ problem are solved with the help of the Peccei-Quinn mechanism and the Kim-Nilles mechanism, respectively. The axion physics enriches the SUSY model by introducing axion as a dark matter candidate and, therefore, the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) could just be a part of the total dark matter. For this reason, axion relieves the tensions between SUSY models and numerous experimental measurements, such as the dark matter direct detection experiments and the precise measurements of anomalous magnetic moment of the muon $a_\mu$. In the present paper, we investigate the constraints imposed by the latest $a_\mu$ measurements and LUX-ZEPLIN (LZ) experiment on the relic density of the Higgsino-like LSP. Additionally, we consider the constraints arising from the cosmology of saxions and axinos, and their impacts on the parameter space of our models are carefully examined. For the axion constituting the remaining portion of dark matter, we find that the conventional misalignment mechanism can successfully account for the correct dark matter relic density observed by the Planck satellite.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.00171v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The bound state of a $\tau^+\tau^-$ pair by the electromagnetic force is the heaviest and smallest QED atom. Since the discovery of the two lightest QED atoms more than 60 years ago, no evidence for the third one has been found. We demonstrate that the $J_\tau$ ($\tau^+\tau^-$ atom with $J^{PC}=1^{--}$) resonance signal can be observed with a significance larger than $5\sigma$ including both statistical and systematic uncertainties, via the process $e^+e^-\to X^+ Y^- \slashed{E}$ ($X,\,Y=e$, $\mu$, $\pi$, $K$, or $\rho$, and $\slashed{E}$ is the missing energy) with $1.5~{\rm ab^{-1}}$ data taken around the $\tau$ pair production threshold. The $\tau$ lepton mass can be measured in a precision of 2 keV with the same data sample. This is within one year's running time of the proposed super tau-charm factory or super charm-tau factory.</description>

      <title>On the oscillating electric dipole moment induced by axion-fermion couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.16135v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has been recently claimed that the axion coupling to fermions is responsible for an oscillating electric dipole moment (EDM) in the background of axion dark matter. In this work, we re-examine the derivation of this effect. Contrary to previous studies, we point out the physical relevance of an axion boundary term, which is crucial in restoring the axion shift symmetry and drastically affects the EDM phenomenology. To describe the latter, we introduce the notion of a time-averaged effective axion EDM, which encodes the boundary term and whose magnitude depends on the oscillation regime. For slow oscillations, the boundary term washes out the standard oscillating EDM, resulting in an exact cancellation in the static limit. Conversely, during fast oscillations, the boundary term amplifies the effective EDM relatively to the standard EDM contribution. This observable is especially interesting in the case of the electron EDM. For an $\mathcal{O}(1)$ axion-electron coupling, the overall size of the effective EDM in the regime of intermediate or fast oscillations is comparable to the present static EDM limit.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Techniques for Intermediate Mass Gap Lepton Partner Searches at the Large Hadron Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.10197v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider machine learning techniques associated with the application of a Boosted Decision Tree (BDT) to searches at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) for pair-produced lepton partners which decay to leptons and invisible particles. This scenario can arise in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM), but can be realized in many other extensions of the Standard Model (SM). We focus on the case of intermediate mass splitting ($\sim 30~{\rm GeV}$) between the dark matter (DM) and the scalar. For these mass splittings, the LHC has made little improvement over LEP due to large electroweak backgrounds. We find that the use of machine learning techniques can push the LHC well past discovery sensitivity for a benchmark model with a lepton partner mass of $\sim 110~{\rm GeV}$, for an integrated luminosity of $300~{\rm fb}^{-1}$, with a signal-to-background ratio of $\sim 0.3$. The LHC could exclude models with a lepton partner mass as large as $\sim 160~{\rm GeV}$ with the same luminosity. The use of machine learning techniques in searches for scalar lepton partners at the LHC could thus definitively probe the parameter space of the MSSM in which scalar muon mediated interactions between SM muons and Majorana singlet DM can both deplete the relic density through dark matter annihilation and satisfy the recently measured anomalous magnetic moment of the muon. We identify several machine learning techniques which can be useful in other LHC searches involving large and complex backgrounds.</description>

Abstract: We study the possibility of generating light Dirac neutrino mass via scotogenic mechanism where singlet-doublet fermion dark matter (DM) plays non-trivial role in generating one-loop neutrino mass, anomalous magnetic moment of muon $(g-2)_\mu$ as well as additional relativistic degrees of freedom $\Delta{N_{\rm eff}}$ within reach of cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments. We show that the Dirac nature of neutrinos can bring interesting correlations within the parameter space satisfying the $\left(g-2\right)_\mu$ anomaly and DM relic density and the effective relativistic degrees of freedom $\Delta{N_{\rm eff}}$. While we stick to thermal singlet doublet DM with promising detection prospects, both thermal and non-thermal origin of $\Delta{N_{\rm eff}}$ have been explored. In addition to detection prospects at DM, $(g-2)$ and other particle physics experiments, the model remains verifiable at future CMB experiments like CMB-S4, SPT-3G.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.17183v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate Type-I Seesaw models where the right-handed neutrino masses are dynamically generated by strong interactions. Using horizontal gauge symmetry as the source of strong dynamics, a nontrivial flavor structure can also be introduced dynamically. We find that the right-handed neutrino mass matrix with a strongly anti-diagonal structure emerges when the three right-handed neutrinos are in the triplet representation of $SU(2)_H$ horizontal gauge symmetry. With an assumption of a Dirac neutrino mass matrix with hierarchical eigenvalues and small mixing angles, analogous to the up-type quark sector, and certain substructures, the resulting light neutrino mass matrix from the type-I seesaw mechanism can accommodate the large mixing and weak hierarchy observed in low-energy neutrino data. The neutrino puzzles can, therefore, be understood as the consequence of strong horizontal gauge interactions. We also discuss the potential UV completion and the phenomenology that could be tested in the future.</description>

Abstract: The search for sub-GeV dark matter via scattering on electrons has ramped up in the last few years. Like in the case of dark matter scattering on nuclei, electron-recoil-based searches also face an ultimate background in the form of neutrinos. The so-called ``neutrino fog'' refers to the range of open dark-matter parameter space where the background of neutrinos can potentially prevent a conclusive discovery claim of a dark matter signal from being made. In this study, we map the neutrino fog for a range of electron recoil experiments based on silicon, germanium, xenon and argon targets. In analogy to the nuclear recoil case, we also calculate the ''edge'' to the neutrino fog, which can be used as a visual guide to where neutrinos become an important background -- this boundary excludes some parts of the key theory milestones used to motivate these experiments.</description>

Abstract: Charged lepton flavor violation (cLFV) processes, potentially important for various Beyond the Standard Model Physics scenarios are analyzed in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) framework. We consider the most relevant 2 quark-2 lepton $(2q2\ell)$ operators for the leptonic and semi-leptonic LFV B-decay (LFVBD) processes $B_s\to \mu^+e^- , B^+\to K^+\mu^+e^-, B^0\to K^{*0}\mu^+ e^-, {\rm and}~ B_s\to \phi\mu^-e^+$. We analyse the interplay among the Wilson coefficients responsible for these LFVBDs and other cLFV processes like $\rm CR (\mu\to e)$, $\ell_i \to \ell_j \gamma$, $\ell_i \to\ell_j\ell_k\ell_m$ and $Z \to \ell_i \ell_j$, to find the maximal possible LFV effects in $B$-meson decays. We probe the scale of new physics in relation to the constraints imposed by both classes of the LFV decays while considering both the present bounds and future expectations. In view of proposed experiments at LHCb-II and Belle II to study charged LFV processes, we have also provided the upper limits on the indirect constraints on such LFVBDs. For the processes where $B$ meson is decaying to $\mu^{\pm}$ and $e^{\mp}$, we show that new physics can be constrained by an enhancement of 2-4 orders of magnitude on the current sensitivities of the BRs of $B^+\to K^+\mu^+e^-, B^0\to K^{*0}\mu^+ e^- {\rm and}~ B_s\to\phi\mu^{\pm}e^{\mp}$.</description>

      <title>Quantum tachyonic preheating, revisited</title>

Abstract: In certain models of inflation, the postinflationary reheating of the Universe is not primarily due to perturbative decay of the inflaton field into particles, but proceeds through a tachyonic instability. In the process, long-wavelength modes of an unstable field, which is often distinct from the inflaton itself, acquire very large occupation numbers, which are subsequently redistributed into a thermal equilibrium state. We investigate this process numerically through quantum real-time lattice simulations of the Kadanoff-Baym equation, using a 1/N-NLO truncation of the 2PI-effective action. We identify the early-time maximum occupation number, the "classical" momentum range, the validity of the classical approximation and the effective IR temperature, and study the kinetic equilibration of the system and the equation of state.</description>

      <title>About the magnitude of the $\gamma^\ast N \to N(1520)$ transverse amplitudes near $Q^2=0$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10654v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $\gamma^\ast N \to N(1520)$ transition has a property that differs from the other low-lying nucleon resonance amplitudes: the magnitude of the transverse helicity amplitudes.The transition helicity amplitudes are defined in terms of square-transfer momentum $q^2$, or $Q^2=-q^2$. Near the photon point ($Q^2=0$) there is a significant difference in the magnitude of the transverse amplitudes: $A_{3/2}$ is very large and $A_{1/2}$ is very small. This atypical behavior contrasts with the relation between the amplitudes at the pseudothreshold [the limit where the nucleon and the $N(1520)$ are both at rest and $Q^2 &lt;0$], where $A_{3/2} = A_{1/2}/\sqrt{3}$, and also in the large-$Q^2$ region, where theory and data suggest that $A_{3/2}$ is suppressed relative to $A_{1/2}$. In the present work, we look for the source of the suppression of the $A_{1/2}$ amplitude at $Q^2=0$. The result is easy to understand in first approximation, when we look into the relation between the transverse amplitudes and the elementary form factors, defined by a gauge-invariant parametrization of the $\gamma^\ast N \to N(1520)$ transition current, near $Q^2=0$. There is a partial cancellation between contributions of two elementary form factors near $Q^2=0$. We conclude, however, that the correlation between the two elementary form factors at $Q^2=0$ is not sufficient to explain the transverse amplitude data below $Q^2 = 1$ GeV$^2$. The description of the dependence of the transverse amplitudes on $Q^2$ requires the determination of the scale of variation of the elementary form factors in the range $Q^2=0$...0.5 GeV$^2$,a region with almost non existent data. We conclude at the end that the low-$Q^2$ data for the transverse amplitudes can be well described when we relate the scale of variation of the elementary form factors with the nucleon dipole form factor.</description>

Abstract: We present numerical results for the two-loop virtual amplitude entering the NNLO corrections to Higgs boson production in association with a top quark pair at the LHC, focusing, as a proof of concept of our method, on the part of the quark-initiated channel containing loops of massless or massive quarks. Results for the UV renormalised and IR subtracted two-loop amplitude for each colour structure are given at selected phase-space points and visualised in terms of surfaces as a function of two-dimensional slices of the full phase space.</description>

      <title>QCD parameters and SM-high precision from $e^+e^-$ to Hadrons: Updated</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13983v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 1. I update my previous comparison of the theoretical value of the muon anomaly with the new measurement and found $\Delta a_\mu\equiv a_\mu^{exp}-a_\mu^{th} = (143\pm 42_{th}\pm 22_{exp})\times 10^{-11}$ indicating about 3$\sigma$ discrepancy between the SM predictions and experiment. 2. I improve the estimate of QCD power corrections up to dimension D=12 and provide a new estimate of the ones up to D=20 within the SVZ expansion by combining the ratio of the Borel/Laplace sum rules (LSR) with the BNP $\tau$-like decay moments for the I=1 vector current. The results summarized in Table 1 confirm a violation of the factorization of the four-quark condensates and the value of the gluon one $ &lt;\alpha_s G^2&gt;$ from some other sources. Up to D=20, I do not observe any factorial nor exponential growth of the size of these power corrections. 3. I use these new values of power corrections to extract $\alpha_s$ from the BNP lowest moment. To order $\alpha_s^4$, I find within the SVZ expansion: $\alpha_s(M_\tau)= 0.3081(50)_{fit}(71)_{\alpha_s^5}$ [resp. $0.3260 (47)_{fit}(62)_{\alpha_s^5}]$ implying $\alpha_s(M_Z)= 0.1170(6)(3)_{evol}$ [resp. $0.1192(6)(3)_{evol}$] for Fixed Order (FO) [resp. Contour Improved (CI)] PT series. They lead to the mean: $ \alpha_s(M_\tau)\vert_{SVZ}=0.3179(58)_{fit}(81)_{syst}$ and $ \alpha_s(M_Z)\vert_{SVZ}= 0.1182(12)(3)_{evol}$ where the systematic error(syst) takes into account the discrepancy between FO and CI. Using the lowest BNP moment, we also obtain from the $V+A$ component of $\tau$-decay: $ \alpha_s(M_\tau)\vert_{\tau,V+A}=0.3040(76)_{fit}(68)_{syst}$ giving: $\alpha_s(M_Z)\vert_{\tau,V+A}=0.1166(8)(3)_{evol}$. The average of the two determinations leads to: $ \alpha_s(M_\tau)=0.3099(60)$ and $\alpha_s(M_Z)= 0.1174(10)(3)_{evol}$. 4. Some contributions beyond the SVZ expansion ($1/Q^2$, instantons and duality violation) are discussed in Sections 10,11.</description>

      <title>An optimized basis for hadronic light-by-light scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14060v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new basis for the hadronic light-by-light (HLbL) tensor that is optimized for the evaluation of narrow-resonance contributions to HLbL scattering in the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon. As main advantage, kinematic singularities are manifestly absent for pseudoscalar, scalar, and axial-vector states, while the remaining singularities for tensor resonances are minimized, even avoided for special cases, and simple crossing relations among the scalar functions maintained. We scrutinize the properties of this new basis for the scalar-QED pion box, demonstrating that the partial-wave convergence even slightly improves compared to our previous work, and discuss the physical sum rules that ensure basis independence of the HLbL contribution. Finally, we provide explicit expressions for narrow (pseudo-)scalar, axial-vector, and tensor intermediate states in terms of their respective transition form factors.</description>

      <title>Production of $P^\Lambda_{\psi s}(4338)$ from $\Xi_b$ decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14467v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present work, we investigate the production of the newly observed $P^\Lambda_{\psi s}(4338)$ state in $\Xi_b^-$ decay, where the $P^\Lambda_{\psi s}(4338)$ is assigned as a $\Xi_c \bar{D}$ molecular state. By using an effective Lagrangian approach, we evaluate the branching fractions of $\Xi_b^-\rightarrow P^\Lambda_{\psi s}(4338)K^-$ via the triangle loop mechanism. The branching fractions of $\Xi_b^-\rightarrow P^\Lambda_{\psi s}(4338)K^-$ are in the order of $10^{-4}$; the result is compared with our previous work of $\Xi_b^-\rightarrow P^\Lambda_{\psi s}(4459)K^-$. We also predict the ratio of $P^\Lambda_{\psi s}(4459)$ and $P^\Lambda_{\psi s}(4338)$ productions in the decay $\Xi_b^- \to P^\Lambda_{\psi s} K^- \to J/\psi \Lambda K^-$. The predicted branching fractions and their ratios could be tested experimentally, which may be helpful for understanding the molecular picture of $P^\Lambda_{\psi s}(4338)$ as well as other hidden-charm pentaquark states with strangeness. Moreover, the experimental potential of observing $P^\Lambda_{\psi s}(4338)$ in the $\Xi^-_b\to K^- J/\psi \Lambda$ is discussed.</description>

      <title>Lattice QCD Calculation of Electroweak Box Contributions to Superallowed Nuclear and Neutron Beta Decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.16755v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first lattice QCD calculation of the universal axial $\gamma W$-box contribution $\square_{\gamma W}^{VA}$ to both superallowed nuclear and neutron beta decays. This contribution emerges as a significant component within the theoretical uncertainties surrounding the extraction of $|V_{ud}|$ from superallowed decays. Our calculation is conducted using two domain wall fermion ensembles at the physical pion mass. To construct the nucleon 4-point correlation functions, we employ the random sparsening field technique. Furthermore, we incorporate long-distance contributions to the hadronic function using the infinite-volume reconstruction method. Upon performing the continuum extrapolation, we arrive at $\square_{\gamma W}^{VA}=3.65(8)_{\mathrm{lat}}(1)_{\mathrm{PT}}\times10^{-3}$. Consequently, this yields a slightly higher value of $|V_{ud}|=0.97386(11)_{\mathrm{exp.}}(9)_{\mathrm{RC}}(27)_{\mathrm{NS}}$, reducing the previous $2.1\sigma$ tension with the CKM unitarity to $1.8\sigma$. Additionally, we calculate the vector $\gamma W$-box contribution to the axial charge $g_A$, denoted as $\square_{\gamma W}^{VV}$, and explore its potential implications.</description>

      <title>On gravity unification in SL(2N,C) gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.11847v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The local $SL(2N,C)$ symmetry is shown to provide, when appropriately constrained, a viable framework for a consistent unification of the known elementary forces, including gravity. Such a covariant constraint implies that an actual gauge field multiplet in the $SL(2N,C)$ theory is ultimately determined by the associated tetrad fields which not only specify the geometric features of spacetime but also govern which local internal symmetries are permissible within it. As a consequence, upon the covariant removal of all "redundant" gauge field components, the entire theory only exhibits the effective $SL(2,C)\times SU(N)$ symmetry, comprising $SL(2,C)$ gauge gravity on one hand and $SU(N)$ grand unified theory on the other. Given that all states involved in the $SL(2N,C)$ theories are additionally classified according to their spin values, many potential $SU(N)$ GUTs, including the conventional $SU(5)$ theory, appear to be irrelevant for standard spin $1/2$ quarks and leptons. Meanwhile, applying the $SL(2N,C)$ symmetry to the model of composite quarks and leptons with constituent chiral preons in its fundamental representations reveals, under certain natural conditions, that among all accompanying $SU(N)_{L}\times SU(N)_{R}$ chiral symmetries of preons and their composites only the $SU(8)_{L}\times SU(8)_{R}$ meets the anomaly matching condition ensuring masslessness of these composites at large distances. This, in turn, identifies $SL(16,C)$ with the effective $SL(2,C)\times SU(8)$ symmetry, accommodating all three families of composite quarks and leptons, as the most likely candidate for hyperunification of the existing elementary forces.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Probe of Primordial Black Hole Origin via Superradiance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02876v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article we have used stochastic gravitational wave background as a unique probe to gain insight regarding the creation mechanism of primordial black holes. We have considered the cumulative gravitational wave background which consists of the primary part coming from the creation mechanism of the primordial black holes and the secondary part coming from the different mechanisms the primordial black holes go through. We have shown that in the presence of light or ultra light scalar bosons, superradiant instability generates the secondary part of the gravitational wave background which is the most detectable. In order to show the unique features of the cumulative background, we have considered the delayed vacuum decay during a first order phase transition as the origin of primordial black holes. We have shown the dependence of the features of the cumulative background, such as the mass of the relevant light scalars, peak frequencies, etc. on the transition parameters. We have also generated the cumulative background for a few benchmark cases to further illustrate our claim.</description>

      <title>Observables from classical black hole scattering in Scalar-Tensor theory of gravity from worldline quantum field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05492v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we compute the two observables, impulse and waveform, in a black hole scattering event for the Scalar-Tensor theory of gravity with a generic scalar potential using the techniques of Worldline Quantum Field Theory. We mainly investigate the corrections to the above mentioned observables due to the extra scalar degree of freedom. For the computation of impulse, we consider the most general scenario by making the scalar field massive and then show that each computed diagram has a smooth massless limit. We compute the waveform for scalar and graviton up to 2PM, taking the scalar as massless. Furthermore, we discuss if the scalar has mass and how the radiation integrals get more involved than the massless case. We also arrive at some analytical results using stationary phase approximation.</description>
