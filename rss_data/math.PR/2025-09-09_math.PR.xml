      <title>Large and moderate deviation principles for stochastic partial differential equation on graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study large and moderate deviation principles for stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) on metric graphs and their associated multiscale models via the weak convergence approach, providing a refined characterization of the probabilities of rare events. Several challenges unique to the graph setting are encountered, including operator degeneracy near vertices and the lack of compactness on non-compact graphs. To address these difficulties, we introduce novel weighted Sobolev spaces on graphs, and prove compact embedding results specifically adapted to the degeneracy structure. Our analysis is particularly applicable to SPDEs on graphs arising as limits of stochastic reaction-diffusion systems on narrow domains and from fast-flow asymptotics of stochastic incompressible fluids, yielding new deviation results for these models.</description>

      <title>The Boundary Principle of a Single Big Jump: Refined Asymptotics for Branching Processes with Immigration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the stationary tail of a fixed-point equation arising in branching processes with state-independent immigration, when both immigration and offspring distributions have heavy tails with boundary index one. We prove that \[ P(X &gt; x) \sim \frac{1}{(1-b)(1+x)}, \quad x \to \infty, \] and provide a refined asymptotic identifying negligible logarithmic corrections. Our approach develops a closure principle for subexponential summations and a cluster expansion representation, which disentangles immigration- and branching-driven extremes.</description>

      <title>Infinite horizon quadratic backward stochastic differential equations driven by $G$-Brownian motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim is to prove the well-posedness of infinite horizon backward stochastic differential equations driven by $G$-Brownian motion ($G$-BSDEs) with quadratic generators. To this end, we provide a full construction of explicit solutions to linear $G$-BSDEs with unbounded coefficients and the linearization method under the quadratic assumption. In addition, the comparison theorems for both finite and infinite horizon $G$-BSDEs are established.</description>

      <title>Concentration Inequalities for Branching Random Walk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical concentration inequalities for random walks are typically derived under independence assumptions or martingale difference conditions. In this paper, we extend concentration inequalities to more general conditions, relaxing the classical assumptions of independence and martingale differences. Specifically, in the notation of calculus, while the condition of independence is $\displaystyle \frac { \partial y } {\partial t}=$ constant and martingale difference condition is $\displaystyle \frac { \partial y } {\partial t} = 0 $, we relax these conditions to $\displaystyle \frac { \partial^2 y } {\partial u_i \partial t} \le L$, thereby allowing $\displaystyle\frac { \partial y } {\partial t}$ to vary. Furthermore, concentration inequalities are established for branching random walk.</description>

      <title>Ground state energies of multipartite $p$-spin models -- partially lifted RDT view</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider ground state energies (GSE) of multipartite $p$-spin models. Relying on partially lifted random duality theory (pl RDT) concepts we introduce an analytical mechanism that produces easy to compute lower and upper GSE bounds for \emph{any} spin sets. We uncover that these bounds actually match in case of fully spherical sets thereby providing optimal GSE values for spherical multipartite pure $p$-spin models. Numerical evidence further suggests that our upper and lower bounds may match even in the Ising scenarios. As such developments are rather intriguing, we formulate several questions regarding the connection between our bounds matching generality on the one side and the spin sets structures on the other.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assuming uniqueness of the martingale problem for Markov processes of generators $q_t$ in a quadratic family like \[q_t(i,j) = a_t(i) q_0(i,j)^2 + b_t(i) q_0(i,j) - \frac{a_t(i)}{N} \sum_k q_0(i,k)^2,\] where $a_t(i),b_t(i)$ are predictable processes, $N$ is the number of states, and $q_0$ represents the generator of a stationary reference Markov process which satisfies $q_0(i,j)&gt;0$ for all $i,j$, we obtain the sufficient and necessary conditions for the Girsanov transformation.</description>

      <title>Moments of finitary factor maps between Bernoulli processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of what moments can exist for the coding radius of a finitary map between two i.i.d. processes, has been extensively studied in the case of $\mathbb{Z}$-processes. Here we treat this problem for factor maps between $\mathbb{Z}^{d}$-processes ($d&gt;1$). By modeling the homomorphism with a map between spaces of finite sequences, we extend Harvey and Peres' result, showing that for a finitary homomorphism between two i.i.d. processes of equal entropy, if the coding radius of the map has a finite $\frac{d}{2}$-moment, then the two processes share the same informational variance. We use our modeling technique to prove a "Schmidt-type theorem" - that in case the above homomorphism has a coding radius of exponential tails, then the two processes are essentially the same. This result appears to be new even for the one-dimensional case, addressing a question of Angel and Spinka.</description>

      <title>On Recurrence of the Infinite Server Queue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper concerns the recurrence structure of the infinite server queue, as viewed through the prism of the maximum dater sequence, namely the time to drain the current work in the system as seen at arrival epochs. Despite the importance of this model in queueing theory, we are aware of no complete analysis of the stability behavior of this model, especially in settings in which either or both the inter arrival and service time distributions have infinite mean. In this paper, we fully develop the analog of the Loynes construction of the stationary version in the context of stationary ergodic inputs, extending earlier work of E.Altman (2005), and then classify the Markov chain when the inputs are independent and identically distributed. This allows us to classify the chain, according to transience, recurrence in the sense of Harris, and positive recurrence in the sense of Harris. We further go on to develop tail asymptotics for the stationary distribution of the maximum dater sequence, when the service times have tails that are asymptotically exponential or Pareto, and we contrast the stability theory for the infinite server queue relative to that for the single server queue.</description>

      <title>Limiting distribution of the chemical distance in high dimensional critical percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We identify the asymptotic distribution of the chemical distance in high-dimensional critical Bernoulli percolation. Namely, we show that the distance between the origin and a distant vertex conditioned to lie in the cluster of the origin converges in distribution when rescaled by a multiple the square of the Euclidean distance. The limiting distribution has an explicit density and coincides with the distribution of the time for a Brownian motion in $\mathbb{R}^d$ conditioned to hit a given unit vector to reach its target. Our result follows from a general moment computation for quantities that have an additive structure across the pivotal edges on a long-range connection in percolation. In addition to the number of pivotal edges in a long connection, this also includes the effective resistance. The existence of the incipient infinite cluster limit, in a form recently established, plays a key role in the derivation of our results.</description>

      <title>McKean-Vlasov limits of scaling-critical reaction-diffusion equations with random initial data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a large class of scaling-critical reaction-diffusion equations in two spatial dimensions, where the initial data is white noise mollified at scale $\varepsilon^2$ and the reaction term is attenuated by a factor of $(\log\varepsilon^{-1})^{-1}$. We show that as $\varepsilon\to 0$, the solution converges to the solution of a McKean-Vlasov equation, which is Gaussian with standard deviation given by the solution to an ODE. Our result covers the case of the reaction term $f(u)=u^3$, and thus gives a new proof of the limiting behavior for the Allen-Cahn equation discovered in the recent work of Gabriel, Rosati, and Zygouras (Probab. Theory Related Fields 192: 1373-1446, 2025).</description>

      <title>Normalized matching property for competing urn models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the competing urn model in which $m$ balls are placed independently into $n$ urns according to (possibly distinct) ball distributions. Kahn and Neiman (2010) showed that, under identical ball distributions, the induced urn measure has \emph{conditional negative association} property and asked whether this remains true without assuming identical distributions. We answer this in the affirmative by showing that the competing urn model satisfies the \emph{normalized matching property}. This, in turn, implies conditional negative association for the induced urn measure with non-identical ball distributions, resolving the question of Kahn and Neiman.</description>

      <title>The limit shape of the Leaky Abelian Sandpile Model on isoradial graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the limit shape of the boundary of the leaky sandpile model on isoradial graphs. These graphs are equipped with conductances and masses introduced by Boutillier, de Tili\`ere and Raschel, which are defined with the help of the geometry of the graph and Jacobi elliptic functions. Building on the link between the shape of the boundary of the sandpile and the Green function of the graph, together with the asymptotics of the Green function obtained by the previously mentioned authors, we prove an explicit formula for the limit shape, both in $\mathbb{R}^d$ where the graph can be seen as a monotone surface under our main geometric assumption, and on the plane where it naturally lies. We then study the limit regime where the elliptic modulus, the parameter of elliptic functions, tends to $0$, which comes down to approaching the massless case, and obtain a circle as a universal limit shape.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic branching Brownian motion: the empirical limit measure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06730v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study branching Brownian motion in hyperbolic space. As hyperbolic Brownian motion is transient, the normalised empirical measure of branching Brownian motion converges to a random measure $\mu_\infty$ on the boundary. We show that the Hausdorff dimension of $\mathrm{supp}\ \mu_\infty$ is $(2\beta)\wedge 1$ where $\beta$ is the branching rate, and that $\mu_\infty$ admits a Lebesgue density for $\beta&gt;1/2$. This is very different to the behaviour of the set of accumulation points on the boundary where $\beta_c=1/8$ which has been shown by Lalley and Selke. This answers several questions posed by Woess in a recent survey article and similar questions posed by Candellero and Hutchcroft. We believe that our methods also apply to branching random walks on non-elementary hyperbolic groups.</description>

      <title>Infinite Interacting Brownian Motions and EVI Gradient Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a sufficient condition under which the time marginal of the law of $\mu$-symmetric diffusion process $\mathsf{X}$ in the infinite dimensional configuration space $\mathbf \Upsilon$ is the unique Wasserstein $\mathsf{W}_{2, \mathsf{d}_\mathbf\Upsilon}$ $\mathsf{EVI}$-gradient flow of the relative entropy (a.k.a. Kullback-Leibler divergence) $\mathrm{Ent}_{\mu}$ on the space $P(\mathbf \Upsilon)$ of probability measures on $\mathbf \Upsilon$. Here, $\mathbf \Upsilon$ is equipped with the $\ell^2$-matching extended distance $\mathsf d_\mathbf \Upsilon$ and a Borel probability $\mu$ while $P(\mathbf \Upsilon)$ is endowed with the transportation extended distance $\mathsf W_{2, \mathsf d_\mathbf \Upsilon}$ with cost $\mathsf d_\mathbf \Upsilon^2$. Our results include the cases $\mu=\mathsf{sine}_2$ and $\mu= \mathsf{Airy}_2$ point processes, where the associated diffusion processes are unlabelled solutions to the infinite-dimensional Dyson-type stochastic differential equations in the bulk and soft-edge limit respectively. As an application, we show that the extended metric measure space $(\mathbf \Upsilon , \mathsf{d}_\mathbf \Upsilon, \mu)$ satisfies the Riemannian curvature-dimension (RCD) condition as well as the distorted Brunn-Minkowski inequality, the HWI inequality and several other functional inequalities. Finally we prove that the time marginal of the law of $\mathsf{X}$ propagates number rigidity and tail triviality.</description>

      <title>Hyperpfaffian Correlations for Beta-Ensembles: Beta an Even Square Integer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a hyperpfaffian formulation for correlation functions in $\beta$-ensembles of $M \times M$ random matrices when $\beta = L^2$ is an even square integer. More specifically, to the $m$th correlation function $R_m : \R^m \rightarrow [0, \infty)$ we associate the $L$-vector valued function $\omega_m : \R^m \rightarrow \Lambda^L \R^{L(M-m)}$ such that $R_m(\mathbf y)$ is given by the Vandermonde determinant in $y_1, \ldots, y_M$ times the hyperpfaffian of $\omega_m.$ The partition function of the ensemble was previously shown to be the hyperpfaffian of a {\it Gram} $L$-form $\omega$ in $\Lambda^L \R^{LM},$ and we demonstrate the relationship between $\omega_m(\mathbf y)$ and $\omega$, both having coefficients built from integrals of Wronskians of monic polynomials. Assuming the existence of families of polynomials sympathetic with the weight of the ensemble, we may construct $\omega(\mathbf y)$ so it is very sparse (relative to the expected ${L(M-m) \choose L}$ coefficients of a general $L$-vector). These generalize skew-orthogonal polynomials arising in the well-understood $\beta = 4$ situation. Finally we explore the situation in the circular $\beta = L^2$ ensembles. Here the monomials give a prototype, and we give explicit formulas for (the circular versions of) $\omega$ and $\omega_m.$ We use our hyperpfaffian framework to produce exact formulas for the two point function when $\beta = 16$ for small values $M.$ Along the way we will record hyperpfaffian evaluations using known values of partition functions of $\beta$-ensembles.</description>

Abstract: Stable distributions are of fundamental importance in probability theory, yet their absolute continuity makes them unsuitable for modeling count data. A discrete analog of strict stability has been previously proposed by replacing scaling with binomial thinning, but it only holds for a subset of the tail index parameters. Here, we generalize the discrete stable class to the full range of tail indices and show that it is equivalent to the mixed Poisson-stable family. This broadly discrete stable family is discretely infinitely divisible, with a compound Poisson representation involving a novel generalization of the Sibuya distribution. Under additional parameter constraints, they are also discretely self-decomposable and unimodal. The discrete stable distributions provide a new frontier in probabilistic modeling of both light and heavy tailed count data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove generalized Cheeger inequalities for eigenvalues of Laplacians for reversible Markov chains. Then we apply Hassannezhad and Miclo's convergence result to obtain Jammes Cheeger inequalities for Steklov eigenvalues. In particular, we get a sharp estimate for the first non-trivial Steklov eigenvalue via Escobar Cheeger constant. At the end, we extend Hassannezhad and Miclo's convergence result to non-reversible Markov chains via a different method based on resolvent convergence, answering one of their questions.</description>

      <title>Relaxation of stochastic dominance constraints via optimal mass transport</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optimization problems with stochastic dominance constraints provide a possibility to shape risk by selecting a benchmark random outcome with a desired distribution. The comparison of the relevant random outcomes to the respective benchmarks requires functional inequalities between the distribution functions or their transforms. A difficulty arises when no feasible decision results in a distribution that dominates the benchmark. Our paper addresses the problem of choosing a tight relaxation of the stochastic dominance constraint by selecting a feasible distribution, which is closest to those dominating the benchmark in terms of mass transportation distance. For the second-order stochastic dominance in a standard atomless space, we obtain new explicit formulae for the Monge-Kantorovich transportation distance of a given distribution to the set of dominating distributions. We use our results to construct a numerical method for solving the relaxation problem. Under an additional assumption, we also construct the associated projection of the distribution of interest onto the set of distributions dominating the benchmark. For the stochastic dominance relations of order $r\in[1,\infty)$, we show a lower bound for the relevant mass transportation distance. Our numerical experience illustrates the efficiency of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>The slice decomposition of planar hypermaps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The slice decomposition is a bijective method for enumerating planar maps (graphs embedded in the sphere) with control over face degrees. In this paper, we extend the slice decomposition to the richer setting of hypermaps, naturally interpreted as properly face-bicolored maps, where the degrees of faces of each color can be controlled separately. This setting is closely related with the two-matrix model and the Ising model on random maps, which have been intensively studied in theoretical physics, leading to several enumerative formulas for hypermaps that were still awaiting bijective proofs.
  Generally speaking, the slice decomposition consists in cutting along geodesics. A key feature of hypermaps is that the geodesics along which we cut are directed, following the canonical orientation of edges imposed by the coloring. This orientation requires us to introduce an adapted notion of slices, which admit a recursive decomposition that we describe.
  Using these slices as fundamental building blocks, we obtain new bijective decompositions of several families of hypermaps: disks (pointed or not) with a monochromatic boundary, cylinders with monochromatic boundaries (starting with trumpets or cornets having one geodesic boundary), and disks with a "Dobrushin" boundary condition. In each case, the decomposition ultimately expresses these objects as sequences of slices whose increments correspond to downward-skip free (Lukasiewicz-type) walks subject to natural constraints.
  Our approach yields bijective proofs of several explicit expressions for hypermap generating functions. In particular, we provide a combinatorial explanation of the algebraicity and of the existence of rational parametrizations for these generating functions when face degrees are bounded.</description>

      <title>Homogenisation of a Passive Scalar Transported by Locally Supported White Noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic perturbations of transport type are a common and widely accepted way of representing turbulent effects in fluid dynamics models. In many known examples, it even leads to improved solution theory, a phenomenon known as \emph{regularization by noise}. A common thread in the recent literature on the topic is the so-called \emph{It\^o-Stratonovich diffusion limit}. By selecting Stratonovich transport noise with carefully arranged vector fields, one can show that the solution of certain SPDEs are close, in an appropriate topology, to an effective, deterministic, equation with a new effective second order elliptic operator, linked to the Ito-Stratonovich corrector. In this work, we deal with a passive scalar model with molecular diffusivity $\kappa$. Starting from the results in [Flandoli \emph{et al.}, 2022, \emph{Philos. Trans. Roy. Soc. A}, 380(2219)], we consider a transport noise made by a sum of independent and compactly supported vector fields. This setting is relevant for models of stratified turbulence which naturally occur in boundary layers and Boussinesq models. Due to the anisotropic nature of the noise, the identification of the limit equation is not straightforward as in all other examples known in literature, as the Ito-Stratonovich corrector is a generic second order elliptic operator with non-constant coefficients. Using tools from Homogenisation theory, we obtain a representation for the limiting effective diffusivity matrix. Exploiting this representation, we study asymptotics, in the $\kappa \rightarrow 0$ regime, of the effective diffusivity across a number of vector field regimes parametrised by the radius of their support. Finally, we provide a careful numerical analysis of the effective diffusivity, discovering a nonlinear behavior for $\kappa \rightarrow 0$, in some regimes.</description>

      <title>Learning from one graph: transductive learning guarantees via the geometry of small random worlds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since their introduction by Kipf and Welling in $2017$, a primary use of graph convolutional networks is transductive node classification, where missing labels are inferred within a single observed graph and its feature matrix. Despite the widespread use of the network model, the statistical foundations of transductive learning remain limited, as standard inference frameworks typically rely on multiple independent samples rather than a single graph. In this work, we address these gaps by developing new concentration-of-measure tools that leverage the geometric regularities of large graphs via low-dimensional metric embeddings. The emergent regularities are captured using a random graph model; however, the methods remain applicable to deterministic graphs once observed. We establish two principal learning results. The first concerns arbitrary deterministic $k$-vertex graphs, and the second addresses random graphs that share key geometric properties with an Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi graph $\mathbf{G}=\mathbf{G}(k,p)$ in the regime $p \in \mathcal{O}((\log (k)/k)^{1/2})$. The first result serves as the basis for and illuminates the second. We then extend these results to the graph convolutional network setting, where additional challenges arise. Lastly, our learning guarantees remain informative even with a few labelled nodes $N$ and achieve the optimal nonparametric rate $\mathcal{O}(N^{-1/2})$ as $N$ grows.</description>

      <title>An upper bound on geodesic length in 2D critical first-passage percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.04454v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider i.i.d. first-passage percolation (FPP) on the two-dimensional square lattice, in the critical case where edge-weights take the value zero with probability $\tfrac{1}{2}$. Critical FPP is unique in that the Euclidean lengths of geodesics are superlinear -- rather than linear -- in the distance between their endpoints. This fact was speculated by Kesten in 1986 but not confirmed until 2019 by Damron and Tang, who showed a lower bound on geodesic length that is polynomial with degree strictly greater than $1$. In this paper, we establish the first nontrivial upper bound. Namely, we prove that for a large class of critical edge-weight distributions, the shortest geodesic from the origin to a box of radius $R$ uses at most $R^{2+\epsilon}\pi_3(R)$ edges with high probability, for any $\epsilon&gt; 0$. Here $\pi_3(R)$ is the polychromatic 3-arm probability from classical Bernoulli percolation; upon inserting its conjectural asymptotic, our bound converts to $R^{4/3 + \epsilon}$. In any case, it is known that $\pi_3(R) \lesssim R^{-\delta}$ for some $\delta &gt; 0$, so our bound gives an exponent strictly less than $2$. In the special case of Bernoulli($\tfrac{1}{2}$) edge-weights, we replace the additional factor of $R^\epsilon$ with a constant and give an expectation bound.</description>

Abstract: We consider global 2-SLE$_{\kappa}$ $(\eta_1, \eta_2)$ in a topological rectangle with $\kappa\in (4,8)$. We derive the law of a random hitting point of the curves and show that, conditional on this random hitting point, the pair of two curves has the same law as Gaussian free field flow lines with proper boundary data. Using a similar idea, we derive the asymptotic of the probability for $\eta_1\cap\eta_2=\emptyset$. As an application, we derive the asymptotic of the probability for the existence of two disjoint open paths in critical FK-Ising model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10732v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a quantitative estimate for the homogenization length scale in terms of the ellipticity ratio $\Lambda/\lambda$ of the coefficient field. This upper bound applies to high-contrast elliptic equations exhibiting near-critical behavior. Specifically, we show, assuming a suitable decay of correlations, the length scale at which homogenization occurs is at most $\exp(C \log^2(1+\Lambda/\lambda))$. The proof introduces the new concept of coarse-grained ellipticity, which measures the effective ellipticity ratio of the equation--and thus the strength of the disorder--after integrating out smaller scales. By a direct analytic argument, we derive an approximate differential inequality for this coarse-grained ellipticity as a function of the length scale. This approach may be viewed as a rigorous renormalization group argument and provides a quantitative framework for homogenization that can be iteratively applied across an arbitrary number of length scales.</description>

      <title>Cumulants and Limit Theorems for $q$-step walks on random graphs of long-range percolation radius model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11667v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study cumulants of numbers of $q$-step walks on Erd\"os-R\'enyi-type random graphs of long-range percolation radius model in the limit when the number of vertices $N$, concentration $c$, and the interaction radius $R$ tend to infinity. These cumulants can be associated with a formal cumulant expansion of the free energy of matrix models of exponential random graphs widely known in mathematical and theoretical physics.
  We show that in three different asymptotic regimes, the limiting values of $k$-th cumulants ${\cal F}_k^{(q)}$ exist and can be associated with one or another family of tree-type diagrams, in dependence of the asymptotic behavior of parameters $cR/N$ for $q$-step non-closed walks and $c^2R/N^2$ for 3-step closed walks, respectively. In certain cases, we obtain ${\cal F}_k^{(q)}$ in explicit form.
  These results allow us to prove Limit Theorems for the number of non-closed walks and for the number of triangles in corresponding ensembles of large random graphs. As a consequence, we indicate an asymptotic regime when in random graphs that we consider, the average vertex degree remains bounded while the total number of triangles infinitely increases, thus rigorously solving a graph collapse problem known in applications.</description>

Abstract: We present vector-valued concentration inequalities for the biased measure on the discrete hypercube with an optimal dependence on the bias parameter and the Rademacher type of the target Banach space. These results allow us to obtain novel vector-valued concentration inequalities for the measure given by a product of Poisson distributions. Furthermore, we obtain lower bounds on the average distortion with respect to the biased measure of embeddings of the hypercube into Banach spaces of nontrivial type which imply average non-embeddability.</description>

      <title>Any random variable with right-unbounded distributional support is the minimum of independent and very heavy-tailed random variables</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08954v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A random variable $\xi$ has a {\it light-tailed} distribution (for short: is light-tailed) if it possesses a finite exponential moment, $\E \exp (\lambda \xi) &lt;\infty$ for some $\lambda &gt;0$, and has a {\it heavy-tailed} distribution (is heavy-tailed) if $\E \exp (\lambda\xi) = \infty$, for all $\lambda&gt;0$. In (Leipus et al., AIMS Mathematics, 2023), the authors presented a particular example of a light-tailed random variable that is the minimum of two independent heavy-tailed random variables. We will show that this phenomenon is universal: {\it any} light-tailed random variable with right-unbounded support may be represented as the minimum of two independent heavy-tailed random variables. Moreover, a more general fact holds: these two independent random variables may have as heavy-tailed distributions as one wishes. Further, we will extend the latter result onto the minimum of any finite number of independent random variables. We will also comment on possible generalizations of our result to the case of dependent random variables.</description>

      <title>Multipoint distributions of the KPZ fixed point with compactly supported initial conditions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03246v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The KPZ fixed point is a universal limiting space-time random field for the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class. While the joint law of the KPZ fixed point at a fixed time has been studied extensively, the multipoint distributions of the KPZ fixed point in the general space-time plane are much less well understood. More explicitly, formulas were only available for the narrow wedge initial condition arXiv:1906.01053, arXiv:1907.09876 and the flat initial condition arXiv:1907.09876 for the multipoint distributions, and the half-Brownian and Brownian initial conditions arXiv:2010.07357v1, arXiv:2504.19975 for the two-point distributions.
  In this paper, we obtain the first formula for the space-time joint distributions of the KPZ fixed point with general initial conditions of compact support. The formula is obtained through taking $1:2:3$ KPZ scaling limit of the multipoint distribution formulas for the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP). A key ingredient is a probabilistic representation, inspired by arXiv:1701.00018, of the kernel encoding the initial condition for TASEP, which was first defined through an implicit characterization in arXiv:1907.09876. Moreover, we also verify that the equal time version of our formula matches the path integral formula in arXiv:1701.00018 for the KPZ fixed point.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05231v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A density-dependent branching process is a particle system in which individuals reproduce independently, but in a way that depends on the current population size. This feature can model a wide range of ecological interactions at the cost of breaking the branching property. We propose a general approach for studying the genealogy of these models based on moments. Building on a recent work of Bansaye, we show how to compute recursively these moments in a similar spirit to the many-to-few formula in the theory of branching processes. These formulas enable one to deduce the convergence of the genealogy by studying the population density, for which stochastic calculus techniques are available. As a first application of these ideas, we consider a density-dependent branching process started close to a stable equilibrium of the ecological dynamics. We show that, under a finite second moment assumption, its genealogy converges to Kingman's coalescent when the carrying capacity of the population goes to infinity.</description>

      <title>Haar-type stochastic Galerkin formulations for hyperbolic systems with Lipschitz continuous flux function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.11718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.11718v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work is devoted to the Galerkin projection of highly nonlinear random quantities. The dependency on a random input is described by Haar-type wavelet systems. The classical Haar sequence has been used by Pettersson, Iaccarino, Nordstroem (2014) for a hyperbolic stochastic Galerkin formulation of the one-dimensional Euler equations. This work generalizes their approach to several multi-dimensional systems with Lipschitz continuous and non-polynomial flux functions. Theoretical results are illustrated numerically by a genuinely multidimensional CWENO reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Distance Estimation for High-Dimensional Discrete Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.04264v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given two distributions $\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{Q}$ over a high-dimensional domain $\{0,1\}^n$, and a parameter $\varepsilon$, the goal of distance estimation is to determine the statistical distance between $\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{Q}$, up to an additive tolerance $\pm \varepsilon$. Since exponential lower bounds (in $n$) are known for the problem in the standard sampling model, research has focused on richer query models where one can draw conditional samples. This paper presents the first polynomial query distance estimator in the conditional sampling model ($\mathsf{COND}$).
  We base our algorithm on the relatively weaker \textit{subcube conditional} sampling ($\mathsf{SUBCOND}$) oracle, which draws samples from the distribution conditioned on some of the dimensions. $\mathsf{SUBCOND}$ is a promising model for widespread practical use because it captures the natural behavior of discrete samplers. Our algorithm makes $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(n^3/\varepsilon^5)$ queries to $\mathsf{SUBCOND}$.</description>

      <title>On the irreducibility and convergence of a class of nonsmooth nonlinear state-space models on manifolds and their applications to zeroth-order optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06447v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyze a large class of general nonlinear state-space models on a state-space X, defined by the recursion $\phi_{k+1} = F(\phi_k,\alpha(\phi_k,U_{k+1}))$, $k \in\mathbb N$, where $F,\alpha$ are some functions and $\{U_{k+1}\}_{k\in\mathbb N}$ is a sequence of i.i.d. random variables. More precisely, we extend conditions under which this class of Markov chains is irreducible, aperiodic and satisfies important continuity properties, relaxing two key assumptions from prior works. First, the state-space X is supposed to be a smooth manifold instead of an open subset of a Euclidean space. Second, we only suppose that $F$ is locally Lipschitz continuous.
  We demonstrate the significance of our results through their application to Markov chains underlying optimization algorithms. These schemes belong to the class of evolution strategies with covariance matrix adaptation and step-size adaptation.</description>

      <title>Distributionally robust monopoly pricing: Switching from low to high prices in volatile markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19486v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Problem definition: Traditional monopoly pricing assumes sellers have full information about consumer valuations. We consider monopoly pricing under limited information, where a seller only knows the mean, variance and support of the valuation distribution. The objective is to maximize expected revenue by selecting the optimal fixed price. Methodology/results: We adopt a distributionally robust framework, where the seller considers all valuation distributions that comply with the limited information. We formulate a maximin problem which seeks to maximize expected revenue for the worst-case valuation distribution. The minimization problem that identifies the worst-case valuation distribution is solved using primal-dual methods, and in turn leads to an explicitly solvable maximization problem. This yields a closed-form optimal pricing policy and a new fundamental principle prescribing when to use low and high robust prices. Managerial implications: We show that the optimal policy switches from low to high prices when variance becomes sufficiently large, yielding significant performance gains compared with existing robust prices that generally decay with market uncertainty. This presents guidelines for when the seller should switch from targeting mass markets to niche markets. Similar guidelines are obtained for delay-prone services with rational utility-maximizing customers, underlining the universality and wide applicability of the novel pricing policy.</description>

      <title>Optimality of Approximate Message Passing Algorithms for Spiked Matrix Models with Rotationally Invariant Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18081v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of estimating a rank one signal matrix from an observed matrix generated by corrupting the signal with additive rotationally invariant noise. We develop a new class of approximate message-passing algorithms for this problem and provide a simple and concise characterization of their dynamics in the high-dimensional limit. At each iteration, these algorithms exploit prior knowledge about the noise structure by applying a non-linear matrix denoiser to the eigenvalues of the observed matrix and prior information regarding the signal structure by applying a non-linear iterate denoiser to the previous iterates generated by the algorithm. We exploit our result on the dynamics of these algorithms to derive the optimal choices for the matrix and iterate denoisers. We show that the resulting algorithm achieves the smallest possible asymptotic estimation error among a broad class of iterative algorithms under a fixed iteration budget.</description>

      <title>Limit Theorems for Stochastic Gradient Descent with Infinite Variance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16340v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stochastic gradient descent is a classic algorithm that has gained great popularity especially in the last decades as the most common approach for training models in machine learning. While the algorithm has been well-studied when stochastic gradients are assumed to have a finite variance, there is significantly less research addressing its theoretical properties in the case of infinite variance gradients. In this paper, we establish the asymptotic behavior of stochastic gradient descent in the context of infinite variance stochastic gradients, assuming that the stochastic gradient is regular varying with index $\alpha\in(1,2)$. The closest result in this context was established in 1969 , in the one-dimensional case and assuming that stochastic gradients belong to a more restrictive class of distributions. We extend it to the multidimensional case, covering a broader class of infinite variance distributions. As we show, the asymptotic distribution of the stochastic gradient descent algorithm can be characterized as the stationary distribution of a suitably defined Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process driven by an appropriate stable L\'evy process. Additionally, we explore the applications of these results in linear regression and logistic regression models.</description>

      <title>Resident fitness computation in linear time and other algorithmic aspects of interacting trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11561v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The notion of a system of interacting trajectories was recently introduced by Hermann, Gonz\'alez Casanova, Soares dos Santos, T\'obi\'as and Wakolbinger. Such a system of $[0,1]$-valued piecewise linear trajectories arises as a scaling limit of the system of logarithmic subpopulation sizes in a population-genetic model (more precisely, a Moran model) with mutation and selection. By definition, the resident fitness is initially 0 and afterwards it increases by the ultimate slope of each trajectory that reaches height 1.
  We show that although the interaction of $n$ trajectories may yield $\Omega(n^2)$ slope changes in total, the resident fitness function can be computed algorithmically in $O(n)$ time. Our algorithm uses the so-called continued lines representation of the system of interacting trajectories. In the special case of Poissonian interacting trajectories where the birth times of the trajectories form a Poisson process and the initial slopes are random and i.i.d., we provide a linear bound on the expected total number of slope changes.</description>

      <title>The feasibility of multi-graph alignment: a Bayesian approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17142v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish thresholds for the feasibility of random multi-graph alignment in two models. In the Gaussian model, we demonstrate an "all-or-nothing" phenomenon: above a critical threshold, exact alignment is achievable with high probability, while below it, even partial alignment is statistically impossible. In the sparse Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi model, we rigorously identify a threshold below which no meaningful partial alignment is possible and conjecture that above this threshold, partial alignment can be achieved. To prove these results, we develop a general Bayesian estimation framework over metric spaces, which provides insight into a broader class of high-dimensional statistical problems.</description>

      <title>On the rate of convergence of estimating the Hurst parameter of rough stochastic volatility models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09276v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In [Han \&amp; Schied, 2023, \textit{arXiv 2307.02582}], an easily computable scale-invariant estimator $\widehat{\mathscr{R}}^s_n$ was constructed to estimate the Hurst parameter of the drifted fractional Brownian motion $X$ from its antiderivative. This paper extends this convergence result by proving that $\widehat{\mathscr{R}}^s_n$ also consistently estimates the Hurst parameter when applied to the antiderivative of $g \circ X$ for a general nonlinear function $g$. We also establish an almost sure rate of convergence in this general setting. Our result applies, in particular, to the estimation of the Hurst parameter of a wide class of rough stochastic volatility models from discrete observations of the integrated variance, including the rough fractional stochastic volatility model.</description>

      <title>Stability of Polling Systems for a Large Class of Markovian Switching Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13315v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a polling system with two queues, where a single server is attending the queues in a cyclic order and requires non-zero switching times to switch between the queues. Our aim is to identify a fairly general and comprehensive class of Markovian switching policies that renders the system stable. Potentially a class of policies that can cover the Pareto frontier related to individual-queue-centric performance measures like the stationary expected number of waiting customers in each queue; for instance, such a class of policies is identified recently for a polling system near the fluid regime (with large arrival and departure rates), and we aim to include that class. We also aim to include a second class that facilitates switching between the queues at the instance the occupancy in the opposite queue crosses a threshold and when that in the visiting queue is below a threshold (this inclusion facilitates design of `robust' polling systems). Towards this, we consider a class of two-phase switching policies, which includes the above mentioned classes. In the maximum generality, our policies can be represented by eight parameters, while two parameters are sufficient to represent the aforementioned classes. We provide simple conditions to identify the sub-class of switching policies that ensure system stability. By numerically tuning the parameters of the proposed class, we illustrate that the proposed class can cover the Pareto frontier for the stationary expected number of customers in the two queues.</description>

      <title>Ultra-discretization of Yang-Baxter maps, probability distributions and independence preserving property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21359v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the relationship between Yang-Baxter maps and the independence preserving (IP) property, motivated by their role in integrable systems, from the perspective of ultra-discretization. YangBaxter maps satisfy the set-theoretic Yang-Baxter equation, while the IP property ensures independence of transformed random variables. The relationship between these two seemingly unrelated properties has recently started to be studied in [Sasada and Uozumi, 2024]. Ultradiscretization is a concept primarily used in the context of integrable systems and is an area of active research, serving as a method for exploring the connections between different integrable systems. However, there are few studies on how the stationary distribution for integrable systems changes through ultra-discretization. In this paper, we introduce the concept of ultra-discretization for probability distributions, and prove that the properties of being a Yang-Baxter map and having the IP property are both preserved under ultra-discretization. Applying this to quadrirational Yang-Baxter maps, we confirm that their ultra-discrete versions retain these properties, yielding new examples of piecewise linear maps having the IP property. We also explore implications of our results for stationary distributions of integrable systems and pose several open questions.</description>

      <title>Improved sampling algorithms and Poincar\'e inequalities for non-log-concave distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11236v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of sampling from a distribution $\mu$ with density $\propto e^{-V}$ for some potential function $V:\mathbb R^d\to \mathbb R$ with query access to $V$ and $\nabla V$. We start with the following standard assumptions:
  (1) The potential function $V$ is $L$-smooth.
  (2) The second moment $\mathbf{E}_{X\sim \mu}[\|X\|^2]\leq M$.
  Recently, He and Zhang (COLT'25) showed that the query complexity of sampling from such distributions is at least $\left(\frac{LM}{d\epsilon}\right)^{\Omega(d)}$ where $\epsilon$ is the desired accuracy in total variation distance, and the Poincar\'e constant can be arbitrarily large.
  Meanwhile, another common assumption in the study of diffusion based samplers (see e.g., the work of Chen, Chewi, Li, Li, Salim and Zhang (ICLR'23)) strengthens the smoothness condition (1) to the following:
  (1*) The potential function of *every* distribution along the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process starting from $\mu$ is $L$-smooth.
  We show that under the assumptions (1*) and (2), the query complexity of sampling from $\mu$ can be $\mathrm{poly}(L,d)\cdot \left(\frac{Ld+M}{\epsilon^2}\right)^{\mathcal{O}(L+1)}$, which is polynomial in $d$ and $\frac{1}{\epsilon}$ when $L=\mathcal{O}(1)$ and $M=\mathrm{poly}(d)$. This improves the algorithm with quasi-polynomial query complexity developed by Huang et al. (COLT'24). Our results imply that the seemly moderate strengthening of the smoothness condition (1) to (1*) can lead to an exponential gap in the query complexity of sampling algorithms.
  Moreover, we show that together with the assumption (1*) and the stronger moment assumption that $\|X\|$ is $\lambda$-sub-Gaussian for $X\sim\mu$, the Poincar\'e constant of $\mu$ is at most $\mathcal{O}(\lambda)^{2(L+1)}$. As an application of our technique, we obtain improved estimate of the Poincar\'e constant for mixture of Gaussians with the same covariance.</description>

      <title>Constructive l2-Discrepancy Minimization with Additive Deviations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21423v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The \emph{signed series} problem in the $\ell_2$ norm asks, given set of vectors $v_1,\ldots,v_n\in \mathbf{R}^d$ having at most unit $\ell_2$ norm, does there always exist a series $(\varepsilon_i)_{i\in [n]}$ of $\pm 1$ signs such that for all $i\in [n]$, $\max_{i\in [n]} \|\sum_{j=1}^i \varepsilon_i v_i\|_2 = O(\sqrt{d})$. A result of Banaszczyk [2012, \emph{Rand. Struct. Alg.}] states that there exist signs $\varepsilon_i\in \{-1,1\},\; i\in [n]$ such that $\max_{i\in [n]} \|\sum_{j=1}^i \varepsilon_i v_i\|_2 = O(\sqrt{d+\log n})$. The best constructive bound known so far is of $O(\sqrt{d\log n})$, by Bansal and Garg [2017, \emph{STOC.}, 2019, \emph{SIAM J. Comput.}]. We give a polynomial-time randomized algorithm to find signs $x(i) \in \{-1,1\},\; i\in [n]$ such that \[ \max_{i\in [n]} \|\sum_{j=1}^i x(i)v_i\|_2 = O(\sqrt{d + \log^2 n}) = O(\sqrt{d}+\log n).\] By the constructive reduction of Harvey and Samadi [\emph{COLT}, 2014], this also yields a constructive bound of $O(\sqrt{d}+\log n)$ for the Steinitz problem in the $\ell_2$-norm. Thus, we algorithmically achieve Banaszczyk's bounds for both problems when $d \geq \log^2n$, which also matches the conjectured bounds. Our algorithm is based on the framework on Bansal and Garg, together with a new analysis involving $(i)$ additional linear and spectral orthogonality constraints during the construction of the covariance matrix of the random walk steps, which allow us to control the quadratic variation in the linear as well as the quadratic components of the discrepancy increment vector, alongwith $(ii)$ a ``Freedman-like" version of the Hanson-Wright concentration inequality, for filtration-dependent sums of subgaussian chaoses.</description>
