      <title>A Capacitor Model of the Helical Deflector: Revisiting Shamaev's Proposal and the Model in the Book</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A RF helical deflector is a type of electron and ion optics device that applies a time-dependent rotating transverse electric or magnetic field by means of time-dependent RF voltage applied on two opposite conducting helical structures (wires, ribbons or other) to deflect charged particles (a single, bunch or beam) in a circular or spiral path. It is a perspective direct timing system being concurrent for reaching picosecond time resolution, and have promise being excellent candidate for high precision time-of-flight detection. As a timing system, it converts the temporal structure of an electron beam into a spatial pattern -- particularly, an ellipse in the case of a single-frequency RF voltage and continuous electron beam.
  I propose a capacitor model of a RF helical deflector and compare it with the existing model in the Book, interpret it and provide understanding of it. Furthermore, I analyze the latter finding analytical formulas for the applied electric field, for ellipse sizes (semi-axes) and rotation angle, lengths of the ellipse line corresponding to the duration of electron bunches or beams. The present article touches the topic of getting circle on resonance limit and the deflection sensitivity.</description>

      <title>GPU acceleration of optical photon propagation in low photon yield applications: Opticks for the Electron Ion Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The bulk of time spent in the simulation of Cherenkov and other scintillation detectors is spent on optical-photon transport, i.e. ray tracing, a task that GPUs are uniquely qualified to perform. We present EIC-Opticks, a fork of Opticks, which uses event aggregation to drastically accelerate photon transport simulation for low-to-moderate photon yield experiments. During the full Geant4 Monte Carlo simulation of a given detector, optical photon simulation is performed on GPU(s) using the NVIDIA OptiX framework. We validate this approach using the ePIC pfRICH detector. We find GPU and CPU simulations in excellent agreement. For $5\times 10^4$ electrons with a momentum of $p=5~\mathrm{MeV}/c$ in the test case of the pfRICH detector, EIC-Opticks shows an order-of-magnitude speedup over multi-threaded Geant4, and a factor of up to 161$\pm$3 over single-threaded execution. In the case of low-to-moderate applications event aggregation reduces the per-photon simulation time from $\sim60\,\mu\mathrm{s}$ for single events to $\sim20\,\mathrm{ns}$ with batching, a factor of $\sim3000$. In order to make EIC-Opticks easily installable, we authored a Spack package that makes it possible to install it with a single command. Additionally, a Docker container is provided for users with EIC-Opticks installed. EIC-Opticks provides guardrails for common pitfalls (e.g. nested volume conversion, ray tracing setting optimization).</description>

      <title>First Electron Acceleration in a Tunable-Velocity Laser Wakefield</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21098v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first experimental confirmation that a laser-wakefield accelerator produced by a flying focus pulse is able to maintain the coherent structures necessary to accelerate electrons to relativistic energies. Through a combination of spatio-temporal near-field shaping of the beam and focusing with an axiparabola - a long-focal-depth mirror that produces a quasi-Bessel beam - the propagation velocity of the wakefield is tuned to control the maximum electron energy achievable. The experimental data are supported by advanced optical and particle-in-cell simulations and are aligned with a simplified analytical model. Together, the results significantly strengthen the case for the flying-focus wakefield as a strategy for mitigating dephasing in laser-wakefield acceleration.</description>
